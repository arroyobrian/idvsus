ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
EAJA provides that in an appropriate case a

12

court shall award to a prevailing party fees and other

13

expenses incurred by that party.

14

to have addressed the question, including the court

15

below, recognized that the plain meaning of EAJA's text

16

directs payment of EAJA fees and other expenses to the

17

prevailing party, and not her attorneys.

18

Every court of appeals

Moreover, EAJA's relationship to the fees

19

approved under section 406(b) of the Social Security Act

20

and this Court's decisions in Jeff D. and Venegas in the

21

section 1988 fee context make clear that Congress

22

designed EAJA, like other fee-shifting statutes,

23

to work within traditional attorney-client fee

24

relationships, under which the attorney looks to the

25

client for payment.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress has also provided that, subject to

2

exceptions not relevant here, all funds payable to the

3

-- by the United States to an individual who owes a

4

valid delinquent debt, Federal debt, shall be reduced by

5

administrative offset.

6

There is no dispute in this case

7

that the prevailing party in this case, Ms. Kills Ree,

8

owed a valid delinquent debt to the United States,

9

received notice of that debt, had the opportunity to

10

repay that debt or enter into a repayment agreement that

11

would have avoided offset, failed to do so.

12

directed in the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996

13

that agencies and the Department of Treasury here shall

14

offset such payments for delinquent debts.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Congress

Isn't it true that the

16

Commissioner of Social Security in the past paid EAJA

17

awards directly to attorneys and that this is still

18

done in cases in which the client has assigned the

19

payment to an attorney?

20

MR. YANG:

That is true in part.

Prior to

21

2005, the Treasury Department did not yet implement,

22

fully implement, the Debt Collection Improvement Act

23

with respect to certain payments.

24

miscellaneous payments.

25

large undertaking of computerizing the system to provide

Here, these are

Treasury undertook the very

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for offsets by tackling things like tax refunds, Federal

2

benefits, most contractor payments, large payment

3

systems that the government deals with on a day-to-day

4

basis, and only in 2005 was able to implement

5

miscellaneous offsets.

6

Since 2005, the government has been

7

offsetting EAJA payments.

Now, in some circumstances

8

where a debt is owed -- where an EAJA payment is made

9

and a court, for instance, orders the government to pay

10

the attorney, the government's policy is to check

11

whether or not there is a delinquent debt a prevailing

12

party owes, and if not, then the government may accept

13

the assignment or comply with the -JUSTICE ALITO:

14

What gives the Federal

15

Government the right to override State law on that

16

issue?

17

would have priority over the attorney if the money had

18

been paid directly to the claimant.

19

Suppose the situation was that another creditor

What gives the government the right, in

20

effect, to override that by paying the money directly to

21

the attorney, unless the government believes that this

22

is payable to the attorney under -- under EAJA?

23

MR. YANG:

I don't believe so.

There's two

24

circumstances where -- that we might be talking about.

25

The first circumstance might be where a court has

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ordered the government to pay the attorney.

2

happens in a number of cases.

That

When the government does not have a debt

3
4

which is receivable from the prevailing party, it

5

complies with the district court's order.

6

does not have a dog in that fight.

7

assignment that the government recognizes, that's true

8

in any kind of context where you might have an

9

assignment.

It simply

When we have an

The government recognizes the assignment.

10

If there are third-party creditors who are able to come

11

in, they may come in and contest that.

12

wouldn't have notice of it.

13

any other assignment that the government might accept,

14

from a party, of the debt, and that is not an infrequent

15

event.

17

But it's no different than

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

They likely

What authority does a court

have to direct that the money be paid to the attorney?
MR. YANG:

18

Well, it certainly doesn't lie in

19

EAJA.

Courts have recognized that they retain equitable

20

authority to recognize a constructive trust or an

21

equitable lien to enforce an agreement between the

22

attorney and client that the client will pay over to an

23

attorney funds received pursuant to an award such as

24

EAJA.

25

particularly clear in their reasoning -- they have cited

And in that context, although courts haven't been

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to equity -- the courts have provided that when, for

2

instance, an attorney represents a client pro bono or

3

represents a prisoner pro bono, that the court will see

4

to it that the payment actually received doesn't

5

ultimately land in the hands of the client and enforces

6

the understanding, either expressed or implicit, between

7

the attorney and client that the funds that the client

8

receives will go to the attorney.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would happen in the

10

case -- in case it is a prisoner who is this

11

prevailing party?

12

be paid to the prisoner?

13

be paid?

Would the -- would the attorney fee

MR. YANG:

14

And if not, to whom would it

The attorney fee under EAJA is

15

payable to the prevailing party, which would be the

16

prisoner.

17

attorneys for the prisoner, and ask the court to

18

exercise its equitable authority to recognize a

19

constructive trust over the fees that are actually paid

20

to the party and prevent the party from keeping that

21

money.

22

any other prevailing party under EAJA.

23

prevailing party to whom Congress has directed the court

24

shall award fees and other expenses.

25

Now, attorneys would likely come in, the

But a prisoner is ultimately no different than

Alderson Reporting Company

It is the

So how can the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court's broad equitable authority trump what you say is

2

what the statute says?
MR. YANG:

3

They are not trumping it, Your

4

Honor.

The -- there's two things going on when a court

5

recognizes an equitable trust.

6

necessarily recognize the right of the prevailing party

7

to the payment.

8

and only once the prevailing party actually has title to

9

the thing does equitable trust or a constructive trust

First, it has to

The prevailing party obtains the payment,

10

attach.

11

the prevailing party is the one who is entitled to the

12

fee, but then --

13
14

So it's recognizing in the EAJA context that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
to transfer it or --

15

MR. YANG:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

Well --

MR. YANG:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
the court can say:

Correct.

MR. YANG:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. YANG:

25

And you're saying

No, pay the lawyer.

21

24

I mean, the statute

says pay the prevailing party.

18

20

Do you actually have

Well -In certain --

In order to recognize the

agreement between the party and the attorney.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where is the agreement

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between the party and the attorney?

The Equal Access to

2

Justice Act provides that fees will be paid to the

3

prevailing party.

4

a contract with the attorney to turn the fees over?

Where does the prevailing party have

5

MR. YANG:

I'm sorry.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I didn't --

You said that pursuant --

7

maybe I misunderstood you, but I thought you said that

8

there is a contract between the prevailing party and the

9

attorney.

And where is -- how does that contract come

10

about if it's simply a case that the lawyer is

11

representing pro bono a plaintiff?

12

MR. YANG:

Well, as this Court recognized in

13

Venegas in the section 1988 context, it's commonplace

14

either for there to be an expressed or an implied

15

agreement to pay over any statutory award that the

16

prevailing party may receive to the attorney.

17

think, in the absence of any indication otherwise, courts

18

are well positioned to simply say, you know, if they

19

haven't agreed otherwise, the normal practice would be

20

for a prevailing party, if they were to receive

21

something under a statutory fee-shifting provision like

22

section 1988 or like EAJA, to agree to pay it to the

23

attorney.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I

Doesn't -- doesn't the

government setoff depend upon who owns the money under

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State law?

2

Federal law to look to State law on issues of ownership.

3

And, in fact, if there is this doctrine of equitable

4

ownership on the part of the attorney, what right does

5

the government have to do the setoff?

6

I mean, it's -- it's commonplace for the

MR. YANG:

Well, that might be true if we

7

were relying on a common law offset.

But in this

8

context, Congress has directed that all Federal

9

payments, unless there is an exception -- and there is

10

no exception in this case -- are to be offset before

11

payment, any payment, to the debtor.

12

Congress has effectively established a priority scheme

13

whereby when a debtor owes a delinquent valid debt to

14

the United States and the United States owes an

15

offsetting obligation to that individual, Congress has

16

provided that no Federal funds shall be paid to the

17

individual and instead that the debt -- the government's

18

debt shall be offset against the debt that the --

19
20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
is bankrupt?

So in this case,

What if the client

What happens then?
MR. YANG:

The same rule would apply.

No

22

Federal payment would -- well -- I believe that the same

23

rule would apply.

24

bankruptcy provisions, and I hate to venture into a very

25

complicated area to give you something definitive.

I've not carefully studied the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

my belief is that, based on the very clear text of

2

section 3716 of Title 31, which was amended by the Debt

3

Collection Improvement Act, that no payment shall be --

4

even in bankruptcy, the payment goes to the -- has

5

to go to the debtor first, and then it goes to the estate

6

-- that no payment shall be made from the Treasury and

7

instead an administrative offset shall be undertaken to

8

collect the government's debt.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there a way for the

10

lawyer -- a lawyer sees that his client has a good case

11

against the government, and thinks he can get an EAGA

12

fee, so he says to the client:

13

you and I can get paid for this.

14

There are a lot of debts I owe the government.

I'd like to represent
But the client says:

Now, is there any way they can work it out

15
16

so he can get the representation?

17

MR. YANG:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. YANG:

Well, sure.

There's --

What?

As we indicated in our brief,

20

there's several things that can be done.

First, the

21

attorney can determine whether there is in fact a debt

22

which is eligible for offset, and that can be done by

23

asking the Treasury with a valid Privacy Act waiver from

24

the client.

25

right, which Congress expressly codified in section

If that is the case, the client retains the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

3716, the right to enter into a repayment agreement.

If

2

that is done, there will be no offset, and the repayment

3

agreement is largely governed by the Federal claims

4

collections standards, which are codified at 31 C.F.R. 900

5

to 904, and those -- those provisions provide in section

6

901.8, for instance, that installments shall -- should

7

bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and

8

the debtor's ability to pay.

9

government agency is able to compromise that debt if the

And in some instances, the

10

debtor is unable to repay it within a reasonable amount of

11

time.

12

present and potential income, as well as assets of the

13

debtor, in order to determine the --

The agency should consider the age, health,

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

In other words, the lawyer

15

and the agency and the client sit down, and the lawyer

16

says:

17

that will help everybody, but I want to be paid.

18

want you, Agency, to agree that on the repayment

19

schedule if I get an EAGA fee, then I get to keep it and

20

I don't have to give it to my client, who will have to

21

give it to the government.

22

piece of paper and then that's done and the lawyer gets

23

to keep the money.

Here, I can get some money for this client and
So I

And then they can sign a

24

MR. YANG:

That -- that's correct.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And has that ever happened?

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. YANG:
in this offset context.

JUSTICE BREYER:

3
4

MR. YANG:

It could well happen, and in

Well, what's -- what's the

authority for the government to enter into the agreement?

MR. YANG:

But it could now.

people would know about, and they could do it.

5
6

I don't know that that's happened

The authority --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, if the statute

says there has to be an offset, that's it.
MR. YANG:

12

Well, the statute also provides,

13

under section 3711, for the Department of Justice and the

14

Department of Treasury to establish guidelines for

15

agencies.

16

to 904 of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

17
18
19

They have done so in Parts 901 to -- or 900

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But do the guidelines

reflect Justice Breyer's hypothetical?
MR. YANG:

Well, the statute actually

20

reflects Justice Breyer's hypothetical, because at

21

section 3716 -- this is at page 9a of the government's

22

brief's appendix -- the head of the agency, prior to

23

implementing an administrative offset must advise --

24

this is on a4 -- the debtor of the opportunity to make a

25

written agreement with the head of the agency to repay

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the amount of the claim.

2

the Federal claims collections standards of agreeing to

3

repayment of such claims.

4

That reflects the practice in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what

5

would motivate the government to agree to give to a

6

lawyer a piece of a recovery that it, the government,

7

thinks it's entitled to?

8

a repayment plan.

9

the individual can only each week or month or whatever

10

I mean, it's one thing to work

That starts on the proposition that

give a certain amount of money over.
MR. YANG:

11

But what --

Well, I think the hypothetical was

12

premised at the beginning of the lawsuit rather than at

13

the end.

14

government were ordered to pay EAJA fees, the offset

15

would be automatic.

16

split the -- the offset with -- with the attorney.

17

in the beginning of the lawsuit, when the attorney is

18

undertaking representation of the client, the attorney

19

is able to do precisely what Congress intended, which

20

was to have debtors come to the United States and

21

take -- to avail themselves of the opportunity to repay

22

their debts to avoid an offset.

If -- if the case were at the end and the

We would not agree at that point to

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

fanciful answer, because EAJA requires that the

25

government's position, to get fees, is substantially

14
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Well, but that's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unjustified.

2

sit down and say, well, you know, if I take a position

3

that is substantially unjustified, I will at that point

4

pay the fees to you, not to the client.

5

And so the government lawyer is going to

MR. YANG:

Well, not at all.

The

6

government's interest in an installment plan is not

7

motivated by EAJA.

8
9

The government's interest is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but the

attorney's interest -- I thought in the hypothetical we

10

were talking about, the attorney's interest is.

11

thinks the government is going to take a substantially

12

unjustified position, and he wants to make sure in that

13

case that he gets paid.

14

MR. YANG:

He

This is a separate question,

15

which is whether there is really any deterrent or how

16

large the deterrent effect would be having the specter

17

of a fee offset.

18

Court in Underwood explained that, because EAJA awards

19

are not given to every prevailing party and are only

20

given to parties where the government's position is not

21

substantially justified, it is -- one cannot reliably

22

determine in advance whether the government's position

23

is going to be so unreasonable that you're going to get

24

an award of fees.

25

And as we explained in our brief, this

And that -- that suggests that any deterrent

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect of having the possibility of an offsetting -- an

2

offset for the client's debt is small.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

And that --

Well, that's going

4

to look awful bad to a court that comes in and he's --

5

and the court is asked to award EAJA fees, and there is

6

an agreement already in effect.

7

well, if we're -- you know, if we're liable for EAJA

8

fees, this is how we are going to handle it.

9

MR. YANG:

10

The government says,

I may have misspoken --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That would be the

11

first piece of -- that would be the first piece of

12

evidence that I would want to put in saying I should get

13

EAJA fees.

14

a position that qualified.

The government thought they might even take

MR. YANG:

15

Let me back up.

I may have

16

misspoken.

What I intended to convey is that at the

17

beginning of the case when an attorney is deciding

18

whether to represent a client, the case has not been

19

litigated, we don't know whether the government's

20

position is going to be found to be substantially

21

unjustified or not, the attorney -- if the attorney

22

checks and wants to determine whether the client has

23

a -- a debt owed to the government that would be subject

24

to offset, the attorney can go to the government and say:

25

Let's enter into a repayment plan so that my debtor gets

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on the government's good graces and no longer is subject to

2

have a tax -- a tax return, for instance, offset or any

3

other payment that the government may owe to that

4

debtor in the future, including EAJA.

5

because of the EAJA payment that you would enter into

6

the agreement.

7

But it's not

The government --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but say he goes

8

in to the government and says, look, I'm about to sue

9

you, and I'd like to sit down and negotiate a nice

10
11

agreement about the repayment.
MR. YANG:

Well, I guess the attorney may

12

say, I'm about to sue you, but the government certainly

13

is not motivated because of the lawsuit.

14

government -- whether an attorney is going to sue the

15

government or not, the question is --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Government lawyers

17

are always sympathetic to people who come in and say:

18

I'm going to sue you.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. YANG:

Well, I guess that certainly gets

21

our attention.

22

enter into a repayment agreement is because that is an

23

opportunity for the government to collect a debt that is

24

delinquent, valid, and outstanding.

25

But the reason that the government would

And what Congress intended to do in the Debt

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Collection Improvement Act was not to have additional

2

Federal funds be paid to debtors who have been given

3

multiple warnings of the debt and are essentially, you

4

know --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem with your

6

argument is this pot of money is actually not going

7

to -- it's going to the debtor, according to your

8

argument, because in theory the debtor is the prevailing

9

party and is entitled to get the award.

But the money

10

is not being paid to the debtor.

11

of the lawyer who has done the work that Congress wanted

12

done.

13

MR. YANG:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's for the benefit

Well, actually, either -I don't know what the --

15

I don't know what the motivation would be for a lawyer

16

to undertake to represent the meritorious claim when

17

they have to not only do the work in the case, but now

18

have to do the work for the government in getting their

19

client to negotiate an agreement with the government on

20

something that's completely unrelated to the claim.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. LEACH

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. LEACH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

6

I'd like to discuss with you this

7

morning four reasons why Catherine Ratliff, and not the

8

government, is entitled to receive the fee for the legal

9

services she performed, that Congress invited her to

10

perform, to show that the government's position was

11

legally erroneous and was not even substantially

12

justified.

13

And my first point arises from your

14

question, Justice Scalia.

15

determines who has the priorities here in terms of

16

offset, if I understood.

17

actually Federal law determines that, specifically the

18

Debt Collection Improvement Act and regulations.

19

Act requires mutuality of a debt between the debtor and

20

the government before the government can offset.

21

regulations, which I'll quote in just an instant,

22

require that before offset can occur, the government must

23

look to who has the beneficial interest in the payment.

24

In other words, who is entitled to benefit from it.

You asked whether State law

Well, Your Honor, I think that's

15

a benefit -- true, that's a benefit, I agree; but that's

16

not a benefit, I don't think, in the sense of who --

17

because the question is who has the beneficial interest

18

in the fee payment?

because that's what's at issue here, is the fee payment.

7

And the government's -- my second point is

8

the government's reply brief at page 10 to 12 concedes

9

that, but for the government's alleged right to offset,

10

the attorney does indeed have the beneficial interest in

11

the attorney's fee.

12

reasons, and only three reasons, why its alleged right

13

to offset trumps the attorney's beneficial interest.

And the government gives three

The first reason the government gives is the

14
15

government says that the -- the constructive trust, which

16

the government acknowledges exists in the -- in -- in

17

favor of the attorney with respect to the fee payment,

18

does not arise until the instant the fee reaches the

19

client.

20

And that's true, but that's not the point.
The point is the attorney had the

21

beneficial interest in the fee, which had to precede the

22

moment the fee reached the client, if it's payable to

23

the client in the sense of "sent to."

24

interest had to precede that in order for a constructive

trust to arise.

MR. LEACH:

I'm not sure.
Okay.

I don't think so, because

13

if we are talking about payments to persons, you know,

14

if a person -- if a person owes a debt of $10,000,

15

receives $500 on the debt, the person receives the

benefit of that $500.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

$50,000.

17

2

MR. LEACH:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that's true.
And -- and so I -- it

4

seems to me that what you're -- what you're asking for

5

is just contrary to the standard law of offsets.

6

MR. LEACH:

Well, Your Honor, with what I --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's even worse

8

because the Federal statute says that there shall be

9

this offset first as a matter of priority.

10

MR. LEACH:

Actually, Your Honor, the

11

Federal statute provides for offset in accordance with

12

regulations to be issued by the Treasury Department.

13

And those Treasury Department regulations were what I

14

quoted right at the beginning of my argument.

15

to look at who is entitled to the benefit of the

16

payment, not the benefit in a generalized sense of the

17

lawsuit.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We have

Well, in the generalized

19

sense of -- of common law of offsets, as I've described

21

he's not going to be able to collect it vis-à-vis the

22

MR. LEACH:

Yes.

And the difference, Your

MR. LEACH:

10

Yes.
It has to do with when the

MR. LEACH:

Yes.

12

13

some money when the money is money that it would otherwise

give to a payee.

All right?

15

MR. LEACH:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

"payee" as a person who has some beneficial interest in

18

that money.

19

MR. LEACH:

Yes.

MR. LEACH:

Not so, Your Honor, in Social

15

which together account for more than 90 percent of all

17

And the reason that the Debt Collection

not offset a statutory fee award against the creditor's

15

debt because the fee is for the attorney.

16

Congress couldn't have conceivably thought to address it

17

in 1996.

18

That's why

And some of the questions take me toward the

19

point that you asked about before, Justice Roberts --

20

Chief Justice Roberts.

21

that EAJA says:

22

you correctly.

23

statute is, quote, "award to the prevailing party...

24

fees and other expenses...incurred by that party."

25

And you suggested, or you said,

Pay to the prevailing party.

If I heard

In fact, Your Honor, the language of the

And the two parts that we haven't really

36

addressed yet are that what is awarded is attorney's

2

fees.

3

that attorney's fee language, "attorney's fees" has a

4

traditional meaning.

5

recognized in all those cases bullet-pointed at pages 19

to 21 of our briefs.

7

an attorney.

interest in attorney's fees litigation as the attorneys,

And this "incurred by" language -- with respect to

It's a meaning this Court has

It's a fee earned by and paid to

And in Gisbrecht v. Barnhart in 2002, this

10

recognizing the reality that attorney fees go to

11

attorneys.

12

In addition, the language "incurred by that

13

party" -- what does it mean here?

14

it could mean -- it does mean, I think -- money the

15

client takes out and pays to the attorney.

16

Social Security cases and Veterans cases it can't mean

17

that, because that's illegal.

18

the attorney does it.

19

Well, outside of EAJA,

We know in

That's a Federal crime if

So what does it mean?

Well, the government

20

concedes at page 8 of its reply brief that that language

21

"incurred by" a prevailing party is supported by the

22

client's implied or express obligation to pay the

23

attorney the fee received.

24

government's argument is circular, I think,

25

Justice Alito, in the sense that that "incurred by"

So this is where the

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

language only is satisfied and an EAJA award only may be

2

made where the client has the express or implied

3

obligation to pay the attorney.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you say that in

5

Social Security the attorney is forbidden to accept

6

pay-as-you-go?

Is --

7

MR. LEACH:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10

But that doesn't mean that

there is not either an express or an implied contract
between the attorney and the Social Security recipient.
MR. LEACH:

11
12

Yes, Your Honor.

I agree.

That's what I was

trying to say.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but if there is that

14

implied contract, then it is an obligation of the

15

recipient.
MR. LEACH:

16
17

Yes, that's what I was trying to

say, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Well, I don't see how that

19

leads you where you want to go.

Then the payment given

20

to the recipient does indeed benefit the recipient by --

21

by paying off an obligation that the Social Security

22

recipient has.

23

MR. LEACH:

Yes, but that obligation exists

24

only to the extent of the EAJA fee.

25

obligation.

It's not a separate

The attorney can't turn around and go

38
Alderson Reporting Company

against the client.

I mean, 406(b)(2) prohibits the

2

attorney going against the client for any fee other than

3

the 406(b) fee, which is separate, if there is a 406(b)

4

fee, or the EAJA fee.

And when --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. LEACH:

7

We have been talking

-- I'm sorry.

8
9

Is it --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Just so I'm clarifying,

is it your position -- and this is something I want to

10

ask the government as well -- that once the EAJA fee is

11

awarded, the attorney couldn't sue the client later even

12

in an offset situation for repayment, because by statute

13

you view them as blocked from --

14

MR. LEACH:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

-- from seeking anything

other than the EAJA fee or the 406 fee?

17
18

Yes.

MR. LEACH:

Yes, that's what 406(b)(2) says,

Your Honor.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that once the offset

20

happens, the attorney, under -- even if the client had

21

other money, the attorney would be blocked from going

22

after it?

23

MR. LEACH:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Yes, Your Honor.
Because by the terms of

the statute they can only seek the EAJA fee?

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. LEACH:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

They can only seek what?
Either the EAJA fee or

the 406 fee.

4

MR. LEACH:

Yes, and we have been talking as

5

if EAJA fees and 406(b) fees are sort of contemporaneous

6

in every case.

7

red brief is that 46 percent of Federal court Social

8

Security cases result in a remand.

9

in an award of benefits.

10

In fact, the data cited at page 14 of the

Only 5 percent result

So there are going to be far more

EAJA fees in Federal court than there ever are 406(b) fees.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

Do you calculate the fee

12

under either the Social Security Act or EAJA, depending

13

on the case?

14

you get some under each?

Do you ever calculate it under both so that

15

MR. LEACH:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

it under both so you get some under each?

MR. LEACH:

Yes, Your Honor.

works, of the -- of EAJA 1985.

-- and sends the smaller

to the client and vice versa.

24

And that's the situation, for example,

25

where you could have an offset of an EAJA fee in a

that's what integrates all this discussion we've been

20

government was making in suggesting that an attorney at

21

the beginning of a case could never know whether or

22

not there -- there is going to be an EAJA fee, because,

23

you know, you can't know at the beginning, they argue,

24

what position the government will take, whether or not

25

the government's position is substantially justified or

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not.

2

Well -- and the government cites

3

Pierce/Underwood from 1988 from this Court, in which

4

this Court said exactly that -- Pierce v. Underwood.

5

Pierce v. Underwood is outside the Social

6

Security context, outside the Veterans context, so

7

Pierce v. Underwood is in this less than 10 percent

8

category of cases under EAJA which are not Social

9

Security or Veterans.

10

In a Social Security case or a Veterans

11

case, the attorney has the record before proceeding into

12

court, before deciding whether to proceed into court.

13

And the attorney can look at that record, read it, and

14

have a pretty good idea of whether or not the government

15

position might be substantially justified or not.
I don't ask you to take my word for any of

16
17
18

this.

Let me tell you what the data shows.
The data, Justice Ginsburg -- this is where

19

the 42 percent of Federal Social Security cases result

20

in an EAJA award.

21

high number of cases in which the government's position

22

is found substantially -- not substantially justified as

23

If it's 42 percent, that's quite a

Okay.

And I wanted to get back to the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, skip my points.

They're too complicated.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. LEACH:

Well -- but during -- during

17

Mr. Yang's argument, you asked about this -- this

18

repayment agreement.

19

agreement being any use to a lawyer who is thinking

20

about taking one of these cases is fanciful for two

21

reasons:

22

limited to, quote, "aged, blind, and disabled people who

23

have little or no money."

24
25

The concept of a repayment

Number one, SSI benefits by statute are

So, I don't know where the disabled or blind
or aged person is going to get the money to enter into

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

any repayment agreement.

2

But the second reason it's fanciful is that

3

the attorney only has 60 days from final agency action

4

to file the case in Federal court.

5

60 days to, you know, meet with the client and try to

6

get an answer out of the government.

7

to do this -- I don't know anyone who has -- but I don't

8

think you're going to get much of an answer at 60 days

9

asking the government to do this so the attorney can

10

And, so, there is

I've never tried

then recover a fee.
Finally, there's -- there's a critical

11
12

point here that I need to get to, which is that I think

13

Congress has told us exactly what this language means.

14

Here's why.
In 1985, Congress enacts EAJA and uses this

15
16

section 3 language which talks about who gets the fee,

17

large or smaller fee.

18

EAJA to Veterans claims.

19

U.S.C. 5904, Congress uses the same language, down to

20

the exact commas in the same place, that it has done in

21

1985.

Okay.

In 1992, Congress extends

And when it does that, in 38

22

During this entire period -- and here's why

23

that's important -- during that entire period from 1985

24

to 1992, and indeed continuing many years after that,

25

but for purposes here, 1992, the administration is every

time paying the attorney's fee to the attorney under

EAJA.

3

language for Veterans EAJA claims that it used for

4

Social Security EAJA claims 7 years earlier,

5

Congress, as a matter of law, is incorporating the

6

settled administrative construction --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so when Congress in 1992 uses the same

I thought the -- I

thought the government said they only did that when --

when the court directed that it be paid to the attorney.

MR. LEACH:

Because there was no

offset in the picture because the government wasn't

15

offsetting.

16

MR. LEACH:

Two responses, Your Honor:

The

17

offset came into the picture in 1996, but the government

18

says it wasn't practical to 2005.

19

that point, the agency had to make -- totally apart from

20

offset, the agency had to decide who these fees should

21

be paid to under section 3 -- I mean under EAJA.

22

Even if you grant them

The government had to say, who does this

23

statute say fees should be paid to?

24

government said, well, fees go to the client, says, you

25

know, award to the prevailing party, fees and other

Now, had the

They look at the statute.

fact that the attorney earned the fees, and they say we

8

1985 language --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that's

But Congress has provided

10

in some statutes, the Social Security Act itself, 406,

11

that you quoted, for the fee to be paid directly to the

12

attorney.

13

the prevailing party.

14

Here it used different language; it said pay

MR. LEACH:

Just two points,

15

Justice Ginsburg:

16

question about does payment mean who receives the check

17

or who is entitled to benefit from it?

18

doesn't say pay to the party.

19

phrase "payment"; 406 says payment to the attorney.

20

doesn't say that, "payment," at all.

21

find "pay" in EAJA is where it says the government

22

cannot be required to pay a filing fee.

23

Number one, we get back to this

Number two, EAJA

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. YANG:

11

I believe I heard counsel concede

13

are payable to the prevailing party and therefore

14

subject to offset.

15

distinction between Social Security fees and other types

16

expenses.

19

That's true.

EAJA does not draw a

Section 2412 uses the same language, court

I believe that disposes of this case.
Second, counsel relies on a definition of

20

"representative payee" in the offset regulations.

21

addressed at reply -- our reply, page 2, footnote 1.

22

representative payee -- as the Federal Register provisions

23

that relate to this make clear, it refers to things like

24

attorneys, it refers to things like parents, where the

25

beneficial interest is not that of the attorney or the

50
Alderson Reporting Company

That's
A

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

parent but the client and the child.
It would be entirely unworkable if any time

3

that a payee owes some debt that a third party might

4

claim an interest to, that the government would have to

5

find out the payee's finances and obligations in order

6

to execute an offset.

7

offset program was designed, and it's not reflected in

8

the regulation.

9
10

It's simply not the way the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, is your

adversary correct that under 406(b) --

11

MR. YANG:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

of those granted --

16

MR. YANG:

No.

Section 206(b) of the EAJA,

17

which is reproduced on 4a of our appendix, states that

18

section 206(b)(2), the provision you were talking about,

19

shall not apply with respect to any such award, meaning

20

any award under EAJA, so long as where the attorney

21

receives fees, the smaller fee is returned.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

Counsel, do you -- do

23

you dispute your friend's statement that 42 percent of

25
