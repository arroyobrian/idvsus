General Bennett.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. MARK J. BENNETT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BENNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A 1993 congressional apology resolution did

12

not alter Hawaii's right to transfer its public lands or

13

repeal, by implication, prior congressional enactments

14

that it extinguish all competing claims to those lands.

15

It was, as its sponsor said at the time, a simple

16

apology, and no more.

17

The lands in question were the former Crown

18

and government lands of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

The

19

Republic of Hawaii was the successor in interest and

20

ownership to those lands and was recognized as such by

21

the United States.

22

Annexation recited that the Republic of Hawaii was

23

ceding the absolute fee ownership of those lands to the

24

United States, and that that cession was accepted,

25

ratified and confirmed.

The 1898 Newlands Resolution of

Once the United States Congress
3


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

so acted, all competing claims to title were

2

extinguished, and under precedent going back almost

3

200 years, the determinations by Congress to accept the

4

cession were final and conclusive on any court.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Excuse me.

Does that

6

proposition settle the question whether your opponents

7

have equitable interest in the lands?

8

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, what the

9

Respondents have contended from day one in this case is

10

that they have a property right in this -- in the land,

11

and the Newlands Resolution conclusively settled that

12

question.

13

competed with the United States as perfect title.

14

perfect title was passed to the State of Hawaii in 1959

15

through the 1959 Hawaii Admission Act.

16

There is no property interest that could have

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That

But would the state of

17

Hawaii, under Hawaii law, be entitled to take the

18

position, if it so chose, that as the new owner of the

19

lands, it has a special duty as a trustee that some

20

other owner might not?

21

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, the Admission Act

22

gives the State the right to manage and dispose of the

23

lands according to State law.

24

certainly have the right to decide which lands they are

25

going to use for which of the five purposes -

So the political branches

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then -- then it's just

2

a question of whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court -

3

assuming that it made the decision that I hypothetically

4

stated -- whether the Hawaiian Supreme Court, as opposed

5

to Hawaiian legislature, could make the determination of

6

whether or not there is some special trust obligation

7

imposed on the State of Hawaii by reason of its own

8

duties.

9

MR. BENNETT:

But, Your Honor, in this case

10

what Respondents urged was that the Apology Resolution

11

changed the legal landscape and commanded the State to

12

hold these lands possibly in perpetuity without

13

alienation.

14

that the Apology Resolution dictated the results here,

15

that plaintiffs claims did not even arise until the

16

Apology Resolution was signed into law by President

17

Clinton.

18

urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court a property right, a

19

property and ownership interest in these lands.

20

--

21

The Hawaii Supreme Court specifically found

In addition, the plaintiffs -- the Respondents

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even if

But, General Bennett, if

22

I understand correctly, looking to your question

23

presented, the only thing before us is the effect of the

24

Apology Resolution.

25

anything about the Admissions Act or the Newlands

The question presented doesn't say

Resolution.

as you presented it?

3

Apology Resolution have any substantive effect?

4

So shouldn't we just stick to the question
Whatever the picture is, does the

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, that certainly is

5

one question before the Court, but we believe fairly

6

included in that question is the issue of the nature of

7

the State sovereign authority.

8

talks about whether the Apology Resolution changed in

9

any way the State's sovereign authority, and that

The question presented

10

question -- certainly interior and predicate to an

11

intelligent resolution of that question is the nature of

12

the State sovereign.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it necessary?

Why

14

isn't it sufficient just to say that this resolution has

15

no substantive effect, period, and then remand to the

16

Hawaii Supreme Court?

17

MR. BENNETT:

Because, Your Honor, the

18

Hawaii Supreme Court's decision also rests on a premise

19

foreclosed by Federal law, that is that there are

20

competing claims to title.

21

red brief, Respondents even say now that Native

22

Hawaiians are entitled to these lands as a matter of

23

property law, but they do not say anywhere in the red

24

brief how that property law claim arises or how that

25

property law claim could survive the Newlands

As late as page 18 of the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Resolution, the Hawaii Organic Act, or the Admission

2

Act.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

General, the difficulty I

4

have is that not only do they not say, so the Supreme

5

Court of Hawaii didn't say so either.

6

me that we would be well advised to make sure that we

7

understand the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Hawaii

8

before we start talking about the relationship between

9

the various Federal statutes and whatever this claim may

10

be.

And it seems to

I simply don't understand the claim myself.

11

I do understand your point, because I think

12

this much is clear from the Hawaiian opinion:

13

think the Apology Resolution seriously affects the

14

claim.

15

that, the -- the whole case seems murky to me.

16

missing something?

17

That they

That we can deal with, but once we get out of

MR. BENNETT:

Am I

Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii

18

Supreme Court, at page 69a of the appendix for the

19

petition, says that this was a claim seeking an

20

injunction -- injunctive relief with regard to property

21

rights.

22

Hawaii Supreme Court said there are questions regarding

23

the title to the State's ceded lands.

24
25

At page 87a of the petition appendix, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There -- there may well

be, but then the Hawaii Supreme Court chose its grounds,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and it said at one point the resolution dictates the

2

preservation of the ceded lands.

3

said that Federal law provides the basis for its

4

decision and that State trust law is interwoven with

5

that Federal law.

6

the decision and provides the governing legal standards.

7

At another place it

It also said that Federal law grounds

Now, they could not have been clearer.

They

8

repeated at least five times that their decision rested

9

on the resolution, that everything turned on that

10

resolution having substantive effect.

11

said that their decision was driven by Federal law.

12

I don't know why we shouldn't take the Hawaii Supreme

13

Court at its word repeated so many times.

14

MR. BENNETT:

That's why they
And

Well, Your Honor, we believe

15

that Respondents' attempt to trivialize this Court's

16

jurisdiction -- they say, for example, in the brief in

17

opposition that even if this Court were to reverse, the

18

Hawaii Supreme Court will simply reinstate the exact

19

same decision, and presumably they would press upon the

20

court the exact parameters they've pressed for 14 years

21

--

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. BENNETT:

24

JUSTICE BENNETT:

25

sure.

We don't -

-- that is We don't know that for

It may well be, but there is a large -- large
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difference, and if they're relying on Federal ground

2

that insulates them from any checks by the Hawaii

3

polity, but if they are forced to rely on State law,

4

then it's up to the people of Hawaii whether they like

5

it or not.

6

equitable notion, constitutional law.

7

the Hawaii Supreme Court did, they have taken the case

8

out of the realm of State law, subject to the political

9

check, put it on Federal grounds.

10

They could change the State statutory law,
But by doing what

So I think that that's what -- the issue

11

properly before this Court, and not anything about the

12

interpretation of the Admissions Act, which -- if it's

13

implicit in your question, it's a little hard to see.

14

Ordinarily, if a party wants us to address the effects

15

of a piece of legislation, they will mention that in the

16

question presented.

17

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, I agree that this

18

decision clearly rests on Federal grounds, but we would

19

also suggest that the question presented talks about

20

whether the State's sovereign authority is stripped, and

21

the State's sovereign authority, we would submit, is

22

clear.

23

The United States had perfect title.

The

24

State of Hawaii succeeded to the United States perfect

25

title.

Respondents do not suggest that anywhere in
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

their pleadings why that is not so, or why they continue

2

to press even with this Court this property right claim

3

to these lands.

4

be prudent for the Court to address what we believe is

5

the fairly included question of the nature of the

6

State's sovereign authority, especially as it would

7

appear to be entirely not subject to contravention by

8

the Respondents.

9

And so we would suggest that it would

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not sure it

10

would be prudent when the great bulk of the opinion is

11

based on the Apology Resolution.

12

do think you have a powerful argument if the Apology

13

Resolution presents us with a Federal question.

14

more far-reaching question -- I just inferred -

15

suggests -- might not even be very specifically within

16

the question presented, and even if it's fairly

17

embraced, you used the word "prudent."

18

for us to confine our decision to the effect of the

19

Apology Resolution and whether or not the Hawaiian

20

Supreme Court got that part of that right.

21

MR. BENNETT:

And I -- I certainly

But the

It seems prudent

Well, with -- with respect,

22

Your Honor, the Court could limit its ruling, but in a

23

case that has been gone on for 14 years and which, in

24

virtually every pleading, the Respondents have filed

25

they have asserted essentially that the State lacks
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

title to these lands because the United States lacked

2

title, the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii was

3

illegal, and that's the precise reason for 14 years the

4

State has either been through an injunction or, as a

5

practical matter, not been able to alienate its lands,

6

that this Court certainly has the ability for a question

7

that we believe -

8
9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the Apology Resolution is

put aside, I'm not quite sure what is left, other than
State-law issues.

11

MR. BENNETT:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what's left You could -- would there be

13

anything to prevent the Hawaiian legislature from

14

passing a law that says, we have absolute -- we have

15

title to these lands, but we are going to impose a

16

five-year moratorium on any transfer of these lands

17

because we want to promote a reconciliation process?

18

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, certainly under

19

the terms of the Admission Act, the authority given the

20

political branches for the management and disposition of

21

the lands is broad and would run up against only the

22

Federal common law of trust that the Ninth Circuit says

23

governs -

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:
Hawaiian Supreme Court said.

But that's not what the
I am reading from page 98a

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the petition appendix, the concluding portion of the

2

opinion. "We hold, number one, that the Apology

3

Resolution and related state legislation give rise to

4

the state's fiduciary duty."

5

The only Federal statute mentioned is the

6

Apology Resolution, and the rest of their reasoning

7

seems to rest upon some kind of State equity law or

8

trust law.

9

inconsistent with prior Federal acts, but the only -

Now, that trust law may ultimately be

10

the only thing they are disclosing right now is -- aside

11

from the Apology Resolution, seems to be State trust

12

law.

13

MR. BENNETT:

Well, Your Honor, the Hawaii

14

Supreme Court did say that this is an injunction based

15

on property rights.

The Hawaii Supreme Court did say -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

somebody's property rights.

18

are talking about legal rights or equitable rights, and

19

that's consistent with the statement I just read to you.

20

MR. BENNETT:

But trust law is based on
We don't know whether they

Well, Your Honor, at page 85-A

21

of the appendix to the petition the Court said that the

22

Congress recognized that native Hawaiians had

23

unrelinquished claims to the ceded lands.

24

result of that recognition the Apology Resolution

25

dictated the entry of this injunction.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

And as a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

We believe that clearly that is not so, but

2

that this idea of unrelinquished claims is an

3

unrelinquished property-right claim.

4

urged upon the Hawaii Supreme Court at every stage.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This is what was

But, General, I think -

6

with respect, I still don't know what the position of

7

the Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to be if this Court

8

rules that the Apology Resolution does not support the

9

proposition that you just read.

10

I don't know whether at that point the

11

Hawaiian Supreme Court is going to say, okay, all we

12

have got left to deal with now is State trust law, or

13

whether they've got to pull another rabbit out of the

14

hat and say, but there is -- there is some kind of -- of

15

prior -- there is some kind of a -- a claim against

16

which prior Federal law could not prevail.

17

I don't know.

And I -- that's -- that's why

18

it seems to me, to -- to say the least, imprudent to

19

wade into it at this point.

20

seems to have been significant to their decision is the

21

Apology Resolution.

22

stick to that.

23

The one thing we know that

And I think we would be wise to

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, what our response

24

would be is a simple one:

That the issue of the State's

25

title would in our view be undisputed.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

The United

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

States's title is perfect and indisputable, and the

2

State's title is perfect and indisputable.

3

Court has said that one of the functions in -- in cases

4

where respondents claim an adequate and independent

5

State-law ground is to remand the case by disabusing the

6

State court of incorrect notions of what Federal law

7

either permits or requires.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And this

A point on which both you

and your adversaries seem to agree is that the Apology

10

Resolution really is not critical to the decision of the

11

Hawaii Supreme Court.

12

simply taking the Apology Resolution off the books would

13

provide an acceptable outcome from your point of view,

14

you would be happy with our deciding just that narrow

15

question.

16

apology resolution wasn't critical to the decision of

17

the Hawaii Supreme Court; isn't that true?

18
19
20

Because if you thought that

And your opponent explicitly says that the

MR. BENNETT:

Yes, Your Honor, and they have

not asked this court to affirm.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And isn't it true that you

21

don't think that just saying the Apology Resolution did

22

not change anything would be insufficient?

23

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, because it seems

24

to us clear that both the respondents and Hawaii Supreme

25

Court believe that there are property-right claims that
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Native Hawaiians have.

2

property-right claims are clearly inconsistent with

3

Federal law, the Newlands Resolution, and the Admission

4

Act, and that there is no reason for this Court not to

5

reach such a clear claim.

6

And we believe those

JUSTICE BREYER:

But they don't say that -

7

there is nothing in the Resolution and nothing in the -

8

does anything in the Court's opinion or the Resolution

9

say that the claims are valid?

We all know they have

10

claims.

They have been making claims.

11

anything in any document I have that says the claims are

12

valid claims?

13

not.

14
15

Maybe they are valid, and maybe they are

MR. BENNETT:

The -- the only thing is the

position of the Respondents who assert -

16
17

Is there

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, they think they

are valid.

18

MR. BENNETT:

But I mean -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so since you have

20

normally one group thinks they are valid; another group

21

thinks they are invalid.

22

fight it out.

23

Well, here we are.

Let them

And all we can say is that this Resolution

24

of the Apology doesn't really say who's right.

25

Hawaii wants to give some more money, or whatever they
15
Alderson Reporting Company

And if

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

want to do, to the Native Hawaiians, that's their

2

affair.

What's the -- what's the problem?

3

MR. BENNETT:

Well, Your Honor, it is

4

certainly true that the Apology Resolution does not as

5

Respondents state recognize the validity of any claims,

6

but federal law forecloses the validity of any claims.

7

And we believe that that is a question that is fairly

8

included interior to the question of whether the

9

Resolution stripped Hawaii of its sovereign authority.

10

It's only natural for the Court to declare what we

11

believe is the indisputable proposition that Hawaii's

12

sovereign authority is based on -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could the Hawaiian

14

Legislature pass a law saying that the Native Hawaiians

15

have claims?

16

-- whatever it is -- are not valid any more.

17

was pretty unfair to them.

18

think we should do is the following.

19

a whole lot of things that they think would be

20

appropriate to do in light of what I just said.

21

stops that?

22

Those claims, because of the Federal 1950

MR. BENNETT:

But that

And, therefore, what we

it lists five purposes to any one purpose.

MR. BENNETT:

That would not.
Would it violate the

Admission Act if the legislature had not said -- said we

14

are giving it to them because we want to, because we

think it's a good idea.

16

because we think they have a right to it.

No, we are giving it to them

Let's assume that the legislature does

it to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.

MR. BENNETT:

I think that would be contrary

12

to Federal law, Your Honor.

laws on which the Hawaii Supreme Court relied to say

7

there was a cloud on the title before the court.

MR. JAY:

Are all of the Federal

We think that they have been in

the case from the beginning, and they -- they were

10

clearly pressed in the State supreme court.

11

think they are fairly encompassed in the question

12

presented partly because, as General Bennett said, the

13

-- the questions referenced to the State's sovereign

14

authority, which necessarily includes consideration of

15

The -- the argument

that is made on the other side is that the Native

2

Hawaiians have a moral claim to these lands, not that

3

they have a property-right claim to the lands.

4

And if the State of Hawaii, acting through

5

any branch of its government -- and that is not a matter

6

of concern to us -- says they have a moral claim to the

7

land and, therefore, there should not be any land

8

with Federal law in their doing that?

are now saying that the claims on which -- the claims on

injunction is a legal obligation and enforceable by

contempt.

17

The first step is that the State's

So the State supreme court, by effectively

18

locking up the lands for an indeterminant period of

19

time, has treated them as -- as legally valid and has

entered relief that is legal in nature.

But do you -- do you think there -- there might

MR. JAY:

Well, Justice Scalia I guess the

second half to my answer to Justice Alito as well, which

8

is that the State supreme court is not free as a matter

9

of State trust law or otherwise to formulate obligations

10

that don't relate to the State's obligation as trustee

11

of the Federal trust -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't it perfectly

clear that's a question of State law?

14

MR. JAY:

I don't think so, Justice Stevens,

because that State law has to comply with the

limitations set out in section 5(f)of the Admissions

any consideration of the unrelinquished claims of the

The State court can't rely, nor, I

it?
MR. JAY:

The legislature could determine

11

that the wisest use of the lands today, the way that

12

would best further -- promote the welfare of Native

13

Hawaiians today would be not to sell it.

14

legislature certainly could do that and then could enact

15

a moratorium that was consistent with that view.

The

But what it can't do is treat it -- and this

17

is the question Justice Scalia asked at the end of

18

General Bennett's presentation -- what the State is not

19

free to do is, based on claims by Native Hawaiians, not

20

as beneficiaries of the section 5(f) trust, but based on

21

considerations that arose before the Admissions Act was

22

ever enacted, based on -- based on their status as

23

competing claimants to the title of the land, give them

an equitable, moral, or otherwise claim to lock up the

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the position that

20

it's -- it is imposing a moratorium on land transfers

21

because it thinks this is the best way to promote the

22

interests of the Native Hawaiians, and part of their

23

thinking is that there was an inequity done when

24

absolute title was transferred to the United States and

25

then to the State of Hawaii?

Would that be a violation

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

of federal law?
MR. JAY:

I think, Justice Alito, that if

3

the state made that determination with respect to the

4

classic Native Hawaiians who are defined in the

5

Admissions Act as -- as one of the present day

6

beneficiaries of the trust, and determined that it

7

was -- that that was the best way to act for the

8

betterment of Native Hawaiians, which is a permissible

9

trust purpose, that that would be permissible.

10

But for the State to act on considerations

11

that are wholly extrinsic to the trust, to treat the

12

native -- the claims of Native Hawaiians as valid, even

13

though they are -- and to assume a duty to the Native

14

Hawaiians that has nothing to do with the State's

15

obligations as trustee of the section 5(f) trust, we

16

think that would be impermissible.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that doesn't seem to be

18

what the Supreme Court of Hawaii has done.

until these people who are currently negotiating, the

22

United Church of Christ, all come to a -- in effect, a

23

Whatever that means, it does not sound to me
as though it is the recognition of a legal title claim

with validity of any claim the Native Hawaiians are

differences.

7

Isn't that all the court is saying at this
point?

9

MR. JAY:

Well, the court said,

Justice Souter, that there is a fiduciary obligation not

10

to make these land transfers at any time until this

11

indeterminate point in the future which reconciliation

12

is achieved.

13

But to say -- to say that that -- that they

14

are not thereby pronouncing on the validity of the

15

title, I think that is inconsistent with the Newlands

Resolution.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the fact that you and

18

I are having this exchange a pretty good indication that

we don't know what they meant exactly by that?

1

wading into an argument that you and I can't settle

2

here.

3

MR. JAY:

Well, I wholly agree,

4

Justice Souter, that the State supreme court thought

5

that the Apology Resolution had significance and that

6

the Apology Resolution -

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

More than significance.

8

I am reading the sentence that immediately follows the

9

one that General Bennett brought to our attention on

10

page 85A. It says, "Accordingly, the Apology Resolution

11

dictates that the ceded lands should be preserved

12

pending a reconciliation between the United States and

13

the Native Hawaiian people."

14

It is very fear language, dictates.

And

15

that's why I am really puzzled as how this Court has any

16

business wading into any question other than telling the

17

Hawaii Supreme Court either their right about what the

18

resolution dictates or they are wrong, and they are

19

wrong because it's a nice apology but it's without

20

substantive effect.

21

MR. JAY:

Well, I certainly agree,

22

Justice Ginsburg, that the State supreme court thought

23

the Apology Resolution dictated the entry of the

24

injunction, and the -- also on page 85A the State

supreme court says that the Apology Resolution gives

even though that fiduciary duty arises outside the

and remand.

the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion is that it believed

MR. SHANMUGAM:

They did say at various

2

points in the opinion that the Apology Resolution,

together with State law, gave rise to the fiduciary

duty.

5

But I think that if one looks at the

6

critical portion of the Hawaii Supreme Court's opinion

7

on pages 31A to 32A, where the Hawaii Supreme Court

8

actually discusses the relevance of the Apology

Resolution, the Court makes clear that it is relying on

it only for the acknowledgment that Native Hawaiians

have unresolved claims.

The apology

And I do mean to

If you take a look at the original complaint in

the counts at issue here was article 12, section 4 -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's what you relied on

but it's not what the Hawaii Supreme Court relied on,

13

and I would repeat the point I made in the prior

14

argument:

15

fastening on a piece of Federal legislation and said, we

16

are compelled to do this because of Federal law.

17

that does is it removes it from the Hawaii political

18

process.

19

what's worrisome about this is they are

What

If they left Federal law out of it, and they

20

said truly this decision rests on State law, we think

21

that the title belongs with the Native Hawaiians, then

22

they have to answer to the policy; and here the Hawaii

23

Supreme Court insulates themselves by using the Federal

24

law as a crutch.

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Let me -- let me be clear
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about this, Justice Ginsburg, if the Hawaii Supreme

2

Court's opinion is read to construe the Apology

3

Resolution as creating some affirmative duty or

4

obligation as a matter of Federal law, we agree that

5

that would be erroneous.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you agree that there

7

would be a Federal question if the Hawaiian Supreme

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

No, because we believe that

read in context, Justice Kennedy, that that statement is

11

consistent with our theory of the Hawaii Supreme Court's

12

reliance on the Apology Resolution.

Why doesn't the Hawaii

that there is some property right on the part of these

native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with

Federal law?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The Hawaii Supreme Court

19

relied on Hawaii law only for the existence of the

20

fiduciary duty and that fiduciary duty has repeatedly

21

been recognized by the Hawaii Supreme Court.

22

gives Native Hawaiians an equitable or beneficial

23

interest in the plan.

it; it's a property interest.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As I read the Federal law,

it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the

lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and

5

the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee

without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii.

you are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now

finding as a matter of State law that there is a

property interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians --

Now if

10

I don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever -

problematic.

because it would depend on how they relied on them, but

18

I think that the critical point -

the same way you say they relied on the Apology

under State law.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Federal act could be read as creating a fiduciary duty

not to sell the ceded lands.

So I think I would concede

that that would be problematic as well.

2

that the question before the Court according to

might itself contravene the Newlands Resolution by

would have no objection to an opinion that said no

proceedings on remand should be based solely on State

law?

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that that is

right in the sense that we certainly think that the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You don't?
On remand, I think that they

11

would consider the issue of whether the injunction could

12

be granted on State law, which after ball was the basis

13

of our complaint from day one in this case.

14

is certainly language -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And there

Not if we said "to the

16

extent that."

I mean, if we said it is -- it's grounded

17

on the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates

18

property rights, and that's wrong; then they have to do

19

something.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, presumably -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To the extent that it may

22

be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's

-- why would that require

any action on their part?

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

If the Court were to write

4

that opinion, I assume the last line of the opinion

5

would be to vacate and remand, and that would eliminate

6

the injunction and so the Hawaii Supreme Court would

7

have the case once again; and at that point the Hawaii

8

Supreme Court could clarify that the source of fiduciary

9

duty at issue was State law.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

question of the source of the fiduciary duty.

12

presumably, in the course of saying what the Apology

13

Resolution, the Newlands Act, the Organic Act, and the

14

Admission Act had to say, we may well say something to

15

the effect that, because it conveyed perfect title, it's

16

inconsistent with the cloud of that title, under a

17

fiduciary obligation created by State law or anything

18

else.

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It's not simply a
It,

And if the Hawaii Supreme

20

Court on remand, Mr. Chief Justice, addressed the merits

21

of any underlying legal claims, then the Court could

22

review the decision, and at that point it might have a

23

sense of, for instance, what those legal claims actually

24

are.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
39
Alderson Reporting Company

But if we told them

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that these various Federal resolutions, including the

2

Apology Resolution, conveyed title to the State in a

3

particular way that precluded the burdening of the

4

State's title on the basis of Federal law, then they

5

would have to find a basis under State law that was not

6

inconsistent with the Federal law's conveying of perfect

7

title.

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that is presumably

9

always true, but, you know, I think for purposes of the

10

current posture of the current case, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

the only Federal issue that is before the Court is the

12

question of whether the Apology Resolution was the

13

source of the underlying obligation.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

resolution is distinguishable in any way from the

18

apology that the United States made to the people of

19

Japanese ancestry who were interned after World War II?

20

The United States did say -- it was -- I think it was an

21

executive order by President Ford that, in no uncertain

22

terms, stated that the United States made a dreadful

23

error and there was never reason for rounding these

11

support on which the Hawaii Supreme Court critically

12

relied here in informing its application of State law.

13

And it is that expression of

If I said that -- just in

the opinion -- and said just what you said, and nothing

else about the resolution, say we don't see any other

would that -- is that okay with you?

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that would be okay,

19

Justice Breyer, and I do think that it would be

20

important for this Court to make clear that to the

21

extent that the Hawaii Supreme Court, in any subsequent

22

remand, relies on the Apology Resolution only for what

23

are essentially factual findings, its acknowledgment

24

that Native Hawaiians have unrelinquished claims, which

25

is undoubtedly true as a factual matter -- I don't hear
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

petitioners to suggest otherwise -- and its recognition

2

that there is an ongoing reconciliation process, that is

3

entirely proper.

4

And the -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But then it would

5

also have to just -- the opinion we're drafting would go

6

further, I suppose, and since we are interpreting all

7

these Federal provisions, it may not be sufficient to

8

say that it did not create this obligation and the

9

Hawaiian Supreme Court was wrong to do that, but that it

10

precluded the creation under State law of this type of

11

obligation.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if the Hawaiian

14

Supreme Court wants to create, under State law, a

15

particular type of fiduciary obligation grounded on the

16

status of the land prior to admission, then it has to

17

run -- under the Supremacy Clause, it has to be

18

consistent with the Federal provisions.

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But the Hawaii Supreme

20

Court, in the opinion under review, did not ground that

21

duty on any judgment about the validity of the original

22

conveyance of title -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I'm not saying

24

they did.

That's the first question.

25

they grounded it on Federal law; I'm saying we would
42
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not saying

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have to determine whether Federal law precluded the

2

grounding of the fiduciary duty under the status of the

3

land prior to admission.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I do think,

5

Mr. Chief Justice, that that is an entirely discrete

6

question from the question presented, and it's entirely

7

discrete precisely because this argument concerning the

8

Newlands Resolution could have arisen, even if the

9

injunction were, as we believe it was, unambiguously

10

based solely on State law with nary a reference to the

11

Apology Resolution.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

The Native Hawaiians -

And it is precisely The Native Hawaiians -

they do get 20 percent of the proceeds, correct?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

out of Hawaii legislation?

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's correct.
And what -- that comes

Yes, that's right.

It comes

20

out of -- I think it's Hawaii statute 10-13.5, and as a

21

matter of State law they get 20 percent of the revenue

22

from the ceded-lands trust, though the amount of that

23

revenue has itself been the subject of protracted and

24

unresolved litigation.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the $5.5 million

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

figure, is that the subject of litigation?

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The valuation of the

3

Leiali'i parcel was challenged in this litigation, and

4

it remains pending before the trial court.

5

But, I think, more broadly the important

6

point is that to the extent that the injunction in this

7

case was based on the lack of resolution of underlying

8

claims in the State political process, the Hawaii

9

legislature could readily resolve those claims without

10

in any way casting any doubt on the validity of the

11

original conveyance of lands to the Federal Government.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

It also, I guess, has a -

13

there -- in the Admission Resolution, it set up a trust.

14

They hold it in trust, and there are five purposes in

15

the trust, and only one of those relates to the Native

16

Hawaiians.

17

know the merits of it -- but the trust that has been set

18

up is the subject of controversy continuously.

19

Now, I know from the newspapers -- I don't

So what I don't see -- and I hope we don't

20

have to get into this -- is what the relation between

21

the trust principles as enacted in the legislature is

22

and the trust principles set forth in the Admissions

23

Resolution.

24

that?

25

Is there any law going to anything like

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, now -- but let me say
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

something about that, because you think that it is

2

relevant to our interpretation of the Hawaii Supreme

3

Court's opinion.

4

12, section 4 of the Hawaii Constitution, was

5

essentially to say that, while the State does have some

6

discretion to use the assets in the section 5(f)

7

ceded-lands trust for any of the stated purposes, the

8

State owes a particularly high duty to Native Hawaiians.

9

What State of Hawaii did, with article

The Hawaii Supreme Court has so construed

10

article 12, section 4, in other cases involving the

11

ceded-lands trust.

12

this case, the Hawaii Supreme Court plainly relied on

13

that provision as a source of its fiduciary duty, the

14

fiduciary duty that we believe was at issue in this

15

case.

16

many words, but it refers to the Hawaii Constitution in

17

a case construing that provision.

So I assume it would be up to the State officers to

22

decide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians,

23

among the five obligations, should be given precedence.

24

Is the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State

25

officers to give it precedence?
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, article 12, section 4,

2

we would respectfully submit, Justice Scalia -- it does

3

place Native Hawaiians in something of a privileged

4

position vis-a-vis the other beneficiaries.

5

construing article 12, section 4, the Hawaii Supreme

6

Court was doing, albeit in a somewhat unusual context,

7

what courts do every day, which is essentially to

8

evaluate whether the trustee is acting consistent with

9

the trustee's obligations under the terms of the trust.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And in

And saying that the trustee

11

must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five

12

ends.

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

All that the Hawaii Supreme

14

Court said was, in light of the very realistic prospect

15

that lands may be returned to Native Hawaiians as part

16

of the reconciliation process that Congress recognized

17

in the Apology Resolution, it would constitute a breach

18

of fiduciary duty to sell those lands for another trust

19

purpose, for the simple reason that once those lands are

20

gone, they are gone forever.

21

consistent with the general principle of trust law, that

22

a trustee in exercising its discretion -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that is entirely

And all this comes from the

fact that Congress made reference to and approved a

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So in -- in perpetuam, this

land can't be transferred because Congress approved the

this reconciliation process?

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Only until the claims of the

Native Hawaiians are resolved.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And what is clear -

I see.
-- regardless of the degree

10

of the reliance on the Apology Resolution, Justice

11

Scalia, is that the Hawaii legislature has substantial

12

discretion to act and to act in a way that essentially

13

vacates the terms of the injunction.

14

legislature either says, we're going to reach a

15

definitive solution of the underlying claims of the

16

Native Hawaiians by giving them land or additional

monetary compensation, or the Hawaii Supreme Court

18

determines that -

Or denying it to them.

Then

22

would no longer have any force.

23

24

get out from under the terms of the injunction to the

25

extent they are restrictive.

So the Hawaii

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I would note, however, parenthetically, that

2

immediately after this litigation was commenced the

3

Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources imposed

4

a unilateral moratorium on the sale of ceded lands.

5

That moratorium, as an executive matter, has remained in

6

effect during the 14-year pendency of this litigation

7

even during the considerable period between the trial

8

court's ruling in favor of the Petitioners and Hawaii

9

So there doesn't seem to be any great

impetus on the part of the State to sell the ceded

statements to the effect that the State has no intention

there would not necessarily be any real dispute between

I don't quite understand.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your whole case rests on a

4

cloud on the title in favor of your clients.

5

you ignore the cloud on the title that has been entered

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But you -

Well, first of all, our

8

whole theory has never been that there is a cloud on the

9

title.

To be sure, we have maintained at various points

10

in this litigation that Native Hawaiians do have

11

potentially valid legal claims, as well as moral and

12

political claims, to the underlying land.

13

But we have never argued that the injunction

14

in this case should be based on some assessment of the

15

existence or validity of legal claims.

16

we have consistently taken the position -- and this is

17

clear from our briefs in support of the Hawaii Supreme

18

Court -- that any such underlying claims would be

19

nonjusticiable.

To the contrary,

20

And for that reason all we were seeking was

21

an injunction to protect these lands until those claims

22

could be resolved through the political process.

23

was all we were conceding below, and the Hawaii

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

A lot of money was sunk into

this parcel, at least according to the record below.

13

And the State would remain free at a minimum to proceed

14

with the development by simply entering into long-term

15

leases instead of the sale of these parcels of land.

16

Indeed, that appears to be some suggestion that that is

17

what the State would do in the event that this Court

18

does not vacate the injunction.

19

And so -- and, indeed, in the State of

20

Hawaii it is not uncommon for land to be transferred by

21

means of such long-term leases.

State would be barred from engaging in any development

So it isn't as if the

The terms of the injunction simply prohibit

And, again, the State's executive has been
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

operating under an effective moratorium on the sale of

2

ceded lands of its own volition during the pendency of

3

this litigation, which suggests at a minimum, regardless

4

of the jurisdictional implications, that there is no

5

great burden on the State from this injunction, which,

6

again, by its terms lasts only as long as the State

7

legislature acts.

8
9

And I would add one additional point on that
score, which is that to the extent that we believe that

10

the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision rested on a

11

fiduciary duty under State law, the State would, of

12

course, be free to amend its constitution in order to

13

make clear that the State's fiduciary duty to Native

14

Hawaiians does not run to the extent of requiring this

15

injunction.

16

that, and I would submit, as a political matter, it

17

would be highly unlikely.
