ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN M. SULLIVAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

IN NO. 07-1607

11
12

MS. SULLIVAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

The court of appeals in this case untethered

14

CERCLA liability for response costs from the plain

15

statutory language of CERCLA section 107(a)(3), and in

16

so doing also imposed potentially crippling liability on

17

entities with only the most attenuated connection to any

18

harm.

19

appendix in 1607 on page 266a, provides that among the

20

potentially responsible parties under CERCLA are

21

so-called arrangers; that is, those persons who by

22

contract, agreement, or otherwise arranged for disposal

23

of hazardous substances.

24
25

107(a)(3), which is reprinted in the petition

The paradigmatic case, of course, would be a
generator of hazardous waste calls up "Waste Co." and

asks Waste Co. to take those substances to a landfill or

2

to otherwise dispose of them.

3

define a statutory term -- and there's no definition of

4

"arrange" -- this Court has long said, for example in

5

United States against Bestfoods, that we look to the

6

ordinary meaning of the language, and the plain meaning,

7

the ordinary meaning, of "arrange for" is to make plans

8

or preparations to do something.

9

of the word "for" is to refer to a purpose or goal.

Where CERCLA does not

The ordinary meaning
And

10

the ordinary meaning of "to dispose" is to discard or to

11

throw away.

12

So CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if your shipper

13

here knew that every time he delivered one of these

14

truckloads of the chemical, one-third of it would end up

15

on the ground and seeping through the ground, and no

16

doubt about it, he knew that, and yet they kept sending

17

it?

18

least a third of the shipment?

19

Wouldn't that be arranging for the disposal of at

MS. SULLIVAN:

No, Your Honor.

That's not

20

our facts, of course, but even if there -- there had

21

been knowledge here, knowledge is not sufficient to give

22

rise to the specific intent required by the statute.

23

Just as in the criminal law, we wouldn't infer in a

24

specific intent case that one is presumed to know the

25

natural consequences of one's acts.

Justice Kennedy, Shell might

well be liable there, but not under 107(a)(3), rather
under 107(a)(2).

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

13

MS. SULLIVAN:

I mean, hasn't it arranged

You wouldn't reach arranger

14

liability there, Your Honor, because as in the Amcast

case, when Judge Posner said the truck is a facility,

16

the truck would be a facility that Shell owns or

17

operates in that instance.

18

Shell was hiring independent contractor truckers to ship

the waste.

But in this case, of course,

21

that I agree with your answer.

arranger -- give me some hypothetical in which Shell

24

would be an arranger?

25

MS. SULLIVAN:

Can you give me an

under arranger liability shell would never be an

arranger here.

The only thing -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if Shell went out of

4

business and it had some stuff left in the tanks?

5

that point, they might very well hire somebody to do

6

exactly what you're saying.

That's correct, Your Honor.
That would be an eccentric

situation, but it could happen.
MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Souter, if Shell had

11

residual waste product that it was seeking to dispose,

12

then the natural reading of 107(a)(3) would apply

13

because that would be waste product.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why isn't that the case in

15

my hypothetical -- it's just a hypothetical -- where the

16

driver catches the five gallons that spills out of the

17

hose every week and dumps it in the creek?

18

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's really the same as

20

the question you answered Justice Souter, and that's an

21

arranger under (3).

22

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, the key

23

difference in the two hypotheticals that you've posed is

24

that Shell is the owner and operator of the disposal of

25

waste there, and therefore it would be a 107(a)(2) case,

Ms. Sullivan, would it be

7

there is no transfer of ownership until the delivery is

9

MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that

10

would be a different case.

11

the so-called formulator cases, of which United States

12

against Aceto from the 8th Circuit is paradigmatic.

13

in that case the key is that the company arranging -

14

the company was held liable for arranging to dispose of

15

waste where it owned the product throughout a

16

manufacturing process, sent it out to a formulator, but

17

got it back as its own product, knowing that inherent in

the formulation process was the creation of waste

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The problem I have with

that line you're pursuing is the FOB destination term is

an eminently fixable connection, and CERCLA is -- can be

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Kennedy, it only

an accident except in the -

knowledge of spills at the site of the bulk unloading.

3

These were minute spills, only 80 gallons, 80 gallons a

year out of 123,000, or .07 percent.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

just a hypothetical definition of waste.

7

MS. SULLIVAN:

All I'm talking about is

Your Honor, even if the

8

spills are waste, the key for arranger liability, the

9

key for arranger liability is that you arrange for

10

spills.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we were talking about

12

waste, and I just wanted to get your agreement -- maybe

13

you won't agree -- that when the product is delivered

14

and 5 percent of it spills, that is waste, and we can

15

talk about the other parts of it later.

16

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, the statute

17

CERCLA, by cross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal

18

Act, does include spills and leaks as possible waste,

19

and the natural application of that definition would be

20

to spills or leaks in a waste disposal.

operator spills or leaks waste, then obviously that's

22

waste.

-- and there's no dispute here that the D-D shipped to

Even

Official - Subject to Final Review

if you view it as a spill of that product if a little

bit falls out of the hose upon delivery at the bulk

arranger for the disposal of hazardous waste.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

that I would have thought your answer to Justice Alito's

getting rid or the deliverer is not necessarily getting

We believe the -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would have thought you

would have similarly answered Justice Kennedy's question

differently and would have said that just because

7

something's wasted doesn't mean that it is waste.

mean, you may waste part of what is delivered, but what

9

is spilled is -- it doesn't seem to me to be waste.

MS. SULLIVAN:

I

Justice Kennedy and Justice

11

Souter an easy way to hold this case and to reverse the

12

court of appeals would be simply to hold that when a

13

useful product is spilled it is not waste.

14

cross-reference to the Solid Waste Disposal Act would

15

support that interpretation because in 42 U.S.C. Section

16

6903(3) Congress defined "hazardous waste" as that

17

material which is discarded.

18

This is not a case about sludge or waste material.

And the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your argument

20

assumes a sharp distinction between useful product and

21

waste.

22

so much of this, there's going to be a certain

24

percentage of waste.

But the

-- so even if you don't draw the line simply at the

useful product-waste distinction, we still do not

3

qualify as an arranger under 1007(a)(3) because we did

4

not arrange for the spill, we did not arrange for the

5

waste.

6

The government relies on facts in the record

7

to suggest that we had some special knowledge or special

8

responsibility, and of course the government's argument

9

that mere knowledge of a third-party's spills would

10

create arranger liability would disrupt commerce across

a range of industries.

12

company is liable when the pool supply store spills a

14

It would mean that the maker of perchloroethylene is

liable when the dry cleaning establishment spills dry

cleaning fluid near the dry cleaning machine, even if

17

they had nothing to do with it.

18

It would mean that the chlorine

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's making it too

easy for you.

It would mean all of those people would

20

be liable when in the course of delivering stuff they

21

know there's going to be a certain amount that's going

22

to spill, and even, perhaps the Justice Alito

23

hypothetical, they could have easily chose the truck

24

that causes more spill rather than the one that causes

25

less.

It's not simply here's the product, we're gone,

MS. SULLIVAN:

Your Honor, there's no

Alito's example.

5

--

The district court found that spills

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, i know.

But

7

I'm trying to reach the extent of your argument.

8

that type of a case would there be arranger liability?

9

MS. SULLIVAN:

So in

There -- we believe there

10

would not be because spilling a useful product while

11

it's being delivered should not count as waste.

12

even if you treated that as waste within the meaning of

13

the statute or even if you treated that as a discard of

14

a hazardous substance, there still should not be

15

arranger liability based on mere knowledge.

16

to be knowledge of a third party's spills.

17

But

There has

The difference from Justice Alito's example

18

is that Shell there would be invested in the spillage as

19

part of its own economic transaction, as in formulator

20

cases, where you send a material out to a manufacturer

21

intending for it, expecting for it to spill in the

22

process, you know you're going to get 98 percent back.

That's not this case.

MS. SULLIVAN:

Is this a case of

Your Honor, this is the first

15

and only case in the nation that has held that arranger

liability applies to a mere sale of a useful product

17

because a third-party purchaser after acquiring

possession and control spilled the product.

19

no other case I am aware of in which it's been

So there's

But the key distinction here is that even if

25

I thought there was as

part of this picture that Shell had a manual which told

7

its purchasers how to handle this material, and that

Shell was well aware that B&B was not following the

9

precautions laid out in the manual.

10

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Ginsburg, two points:

11

The manual comes out only in 1978, and a Shell

12

representative visits the site only in 1979.

13

leaves 19 years of liability unaccounted for on that

14

period.

16

impractical and terribly perverse in relation to the

17

purposes of the environmental laws that Congress passed

to penalize a manufacturer for telling a third-party

purchaser how to handle a product more safely.

20

use the manual issued in 1978 or the inspection in 1979

as evidence that Shell knew there were spills and,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

IN NO. 07-1601

6
7

MS. MAHONEY:
please the Court:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I would like to start with section 912 of
the Restatement because I think it really helps to

10

demonstrate that the trial court fully understood and

11

properly applied the common law standards that govern

12

the determination of apportionment in a pollution case.

13

That section provides that when a party bears the burden

14

of proof, they have to establish the extent of harm and

15

the amount of money with, quote, "as much certainty as

16

the nature of the tort and circumstances permit," end

17

quote.

18

At the time that CERCLA was adopted in 1980,

19

common law courts for more than a century had been using

20

that standard to apportion damages and harm in pollution

21

cases based on essentially rough estimates because the

22

nature of the tort, pollution, and the circumstances

23

don't allow for the kind of precision that we might

24

require in some other settings such as proof of -- of

25

fault, for instance.

14

Apportionment was never requested.

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, Your Honor, the finding

4

of apportionment was sought.

The trial court -- and,

5

again, note 16 of the -- of the Ninth Circuit's opinion

6

makes clear -- and the government doesn't say otherwise

7

-- that the railroads had requested apportionment.

8

issue was whether or not they had argued the precise

9

theory, and the factfinder certainly has the authority

The

10

to choose the theory that it thinks best approximates

11

what is a reasonable estimate.

12

And in fact, Your Honor, the theory that the

13

trial court seized upon was actually suggested by the

14

government's own expert on cross-examination in the

15

transcript at -- at 4077 to '78.

16

And in addition, Your Honor, when it was

17

time for closing argument, which was September 28th,

18

1999, at the very beginning of the transcript, page 4,

the trial court said to the government -- it said to the

Honor, the government could have filed a motion to amend

under Rule 52.

Shell did it for other reasons, but the government

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I suppose the district

said, I want additional evidence on this point.

MS. MAHONEY:

It absolutely could have.

And

11

so that argument of waiver was rejected by two courts

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if -- what if

16

you have a situation where it's clear under

17

apportionment one party is liable for one-tenth and the

18

other is liable for nine-tenths, but one-tenth is enough

19

to pollute the -- the water.

20

in that situation?

21

MS. MAHONEY:

Do you have apportionment

It depends, but generally yes.

22

And the reason, if it, as here -- the cost of the remedy

23

is driven by the mass of the contamination -- and it was

24

undisputed that that was the case here -- then the costs

25

have gone up based upon the aggregate harm.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I assume it's

2

not a linear, if that's the right word, progression,

3

because once you've got to start a clean-up, you've got

4

to start a clean-up, whether it's, you know, caused by

5

one-tenth or -- or nine-tenths.

6

MS. MAHONEY:

But it's that the whole cost

7

damages attributable to the harm that was caused by the

defendant?

And if they're not, then apportionment is

appropriate.

Here what we're talking about, under the

Ninth Circuit's holding, that they -- they didn't

question the district court's factfinding at 248a that

it is indisputable that the overwhelming majority of

9

hazardous substances were released by B&B on its own

10

parcel, on its own land, not on the railroad's land.

11

Its own operations on its own -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought -- I thought -

13

and tell me if my recollection of the facts is

14

incorrect, that the -- the newer parcel that enabled B&B

15

to expand its operation, the waste went into a pond,

16

what was called South, that was on the other side, that

17

was on the original B&B parcel.

The trial court found that it

20

was plausible that some leakage, some spills on the

21

railroad parcel, during the 13 years of the lease made

22

it into the groundwater by traveling nearly two football

23

fields in an area that hardly has any rain, but said

24

that 9 percent was the maximum of damages that could

25

possibly be attributable to this.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

What the Ninth Circuit really says is that,

2

even though B&B began dumping thousands of gallons of

3

chemical rinsate in 1960, which was 36 years before this

4

case was filed, 15 years before the lease was ever

5

entered into, that all of that harm that was caused by

6

B&B has to be paid by the railroads, because they can't

7

-- that's almost $40 million now -- because they can't

8

prove with precision whether their share of the damages

9

might be zero or one million or nine million.

10

And so what, in essence, the Ninth Circuit

11

did was said that because there weren't adequate records

12

to prove what amount of dumping was going on in 1960

13

when there wouldn't have been any reason to keep those

14

records, that as a default matter 100 percent of the

15

harm has to be allocated by the railroads, even though

16

it's not -- they didn't question the district court's

finding that it's indisputable that the overwhelming

18

majority was by B&B on its own land.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

If I could begin with the issue of arranger

liability.

referred to as the useful product cases and made it

21

clear that it would not impose arranger liability on

useful product that was later disposed of in a way that

24

contaminated the environment.

25

The Ninth Circuit distinguished what it

Rather, the Court of Appeals and the

over the delivery process and that Shell knew that, as

inherent in the chosen method.

There are two differences.

The first is that while HP might know that some

delivery.

17

that there is a particularly bad customer like Breyer

that I dispose of them all improperly.

The second difference here is

24

that Shell arranged for the delivery and controlled the

25

circumstances under which the delivery would be made.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

That is, Shell hired the common carrier and Shell

required that B&B have bulk storage facilities so that

the D-D would have to be pumped from the delivery truck

into the bulk storage.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then, suddenly if HP, in

fact, uses -- I guess they lease -- you know, they have

a common carrier, imagine -- or suppose it's car

8

batteries, same problem.

briefs is that what Shell here did -- I'm not saying it

17

easy -- but what they did was they arranged the

18

transport, that seems to me to be common, and they put

19

some instructions in which said the right way to dispose

20

of it.

21

And what I have found you so far to say from the

Well, doesn't everybody do that?
MR. STEWART:

No, because the fact

22

circumstance here was not that Shell or the common

23

carrier transferred control of the D-D to B&B with

24

instructions as to how it was to be used at a later

25

date, and the customer then violated those instructions.

The fact pattern here is that the spills occurred during

2

the process of delivery.

3

And to return to Justice Alito's

4

hypothetical, you asked what if Shell deliberately chose

a particular delivery company that it knew would result

6

in spills, but did so for economic advantage, that's

exactly the case here.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think -- I think it's

4

something of a misdescription to say that this spillage

5

is occurring in the course of delivery.

6

MR. STEWART:

But the district court -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think as far as Shell was

8

concerned, delivery had been made when the truck pulled

9

up.

10

MR. STEWART:

Well, the district court

11

specifically declined to find -- to make a finding as to

12

who owned the D-D at the time it was spilled.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. STEWART:

You're making it.

We don't think that our

15

argument is dependent upon the question of ownership,

16

because Shell undeniably had ownership and possession of

17

the D-D at the time the arrangement was made, and -

18
19
20
21
22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Independent of the time of

control.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Independent but not at the

time of the spill.
MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

But that

23

would be true in the paradigmatic arranger case, where

24

one company has generated waste and hires a hauler to

25

pick it up and take it away.

Those parties could easily

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

provide by contract that title would pass to the hauler

2

at the time the garbage -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then in your view what it

4

is is a company arranges with a transporter for disposal

5

when the company knows that the transporter on arrival

6

may spill some of the product?

7

MR. STEWART:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

It's more than I guess then every oil

company -- well, I mean, every liquid product company in

10

the United States is going to be -- fall within that

11

because a lot of people do spill things.

12

MR. STEWART:

Knowledge might well be

13

sufficient, but here we have more than knowledge, we

14

have control.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But why do we -- I mean, do

16

we have control?

Shell says to its buyer, see that the

17

delivery is made in the following way, so it doesn't

18

spill all over the place.

19

wouldn't have to say that to the buyer.

20

could either order the buyer, as a condition of receipt

21

of the product, or it could require that as part of the

22

-- its terms with the - with the deliverer.

23

me that the way Shell has set it up indicates that

24

control has passed to somebody else at the time that the

1

MR. STEWART:

Well, as Ms. Sullivan said,

2

the instructions were given in 1978, fairly far into the

period of contamination.

4

Shell had control in the sense that it required bulk

5

storage on the B&B facility.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He says, we won't sell you

to unless you -- you -- you have these tanks, correct?

9

But Even before that date

particular equipment for pumping the D-D out of the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, so what is your -- no

question, those are -- those are terms of their

willingness to deal.

15

that when the truck pulls up and they -- the hose is

turned on to deliver, that at that point Shell is

controlling the process?

MR. STEWART:

They have -- they have control

of the process in the sense of defining the way it is to

be done.

21

unloading is being done by employees of the common

carrier and employees of B&B rather than employees of

is to not allow the people who set in motion the process

4

the -- the deliverer's incidental spillage.

5

your position?

6

MR. STEWART:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is that

That is That is, that the spillage

8

is a breach of the contract between the transporter and

9

Shell?

10

MR. STEWART:

11

had pursued such a cause of action, then the delivery

12

company might well have argued that these -- this was

foreseeable and that there was -

for saying that if it had pursued that course of action,

Shell would have succeeded?

19
20

No.

And Then why is Shell in

control?
MR. STEWART:

I mean, that's my point.

21

Shell would not have succeeded in such a suit, because

22

the delivery company would have argued successfully this

23

was known to be an inherent consequence of the delivery

24

process that Shell has chosen.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, yes, but you're

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

saying that the delivery company would have had a

2

defense, but you are -- are saying that Shell would have

3

had at least a theoretical right under its actual

4

contract with the deliverer to assert the -- the control

5

over the manner of delivery that would have prevented

6

the spill; is that what you're saying?

7

MR. STEWART:

Well, it certainly insisted by

8

contract on the use of the pumping equipment of -- to

9

pump the D-D from the truck into the bulk storage

10

facility.

And that was JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's the only way they

some product of this -- this quantity and quality and so

forth, but they could substitute other -- other goods

from another source?

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I guess I would have

5

to know more about the hypothetical in -- as to the

6

circumstances in which the disposal occurred.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, Shell gave all the

8

same instructions they gave here, but they just didn't

9

insist that it be their product rather than somebody

10
11

else's, another oil company's product.
MR. STEWART:

I guess I just -- I don't

12

really understand the hypothetical, because I don't

understand the situation in which Shell would be

indifferent as to whether its product was being bought

or the product of a competitor was being bought.

go back to the -- to the broader question?

best response to the argument that Ms. Sullivan makes

20

that "arrange for disposal" implies something

21

significantly different from "arrange for transfer,"

22

"arrange for release," "arrange for delivery" -- that

23

the -- that the combination of arrangement as an

wasting something.

4

to that?

5

What is -- what is your best answer

MR. STEWART:

We agree that the term

6

"arrange for" connotes intentionality, and we think it's

7

satisfied here because Shell intentionally set in motion

the process of delivery.

9

being done in a particular fashion, and it knew that

It insisted upon the delivery

10

spills and leaks were inherent in that process.

an analogy -

To use

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if we're not arguing

14

about that, what you are arguing about, then, is the -

15

is the implication of disposal, as opposed to a more

16

neutral term like transfer or delivery or what-not.

17

What's your answer to that?

18

MR. STEWART:

The further point I would make

19

is that the term "disposal" is specifically defined to

20

include spilling and leaking.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, but those are certainly

22

ways in which disposal can occur, as I -- I think came

23

out in the argument.

24

spills things along the highway on the way to the dump,

25

it may be leakage, but a disposal is going on because in

If the -- if Waste Management

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact it is a way of getting rid of something that no

2

longer has any use.

3

So I -- I can -- I don't think the -- the

4

inclusion of leakage within the definition answers the

5

question whether disposal is something different from

6

transfer.

7

MR. STEWART:

To use a couple of analogies,

8

I think if I know that my car leaks oil whenever it's

9

operated and I choose to drive it on the public highway,

10

I think I could naturally be said to have intentionally

11

discharged oil onto the highway.

12

Well you have discharged,

but you -- the question is whether it's disposal.

It may be -

Well "Discharge" is a more

neutral term.

Well again, the term

18

"disposal" is specifically defined to include spilling

19

and leaking.

20

You're right that one -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but I mean, that -

that -- that begs the question.

22

of disposing, in the sense that she argues for, there

can be leakage.

MR. STEWART:

If you had a situation, for

3

instance, where the trash company was hauling waste and

4

intended to dispose of it in a more classic sense by

5

dumping it at a landfill, but along the way the truck

6

leaked, and some of the items spilled out -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. STEWART:

9

When?

-- I think everybody

acknowledges that there is disposal there, and I think

10

we would also say that a company that contracted with

11

that trash hauler, knowing that the vehicle tended to

12

leak trash on -- on every delivery, could be said to

13

have arranged for not only the ultimate disposal, but -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No that's at that point,

15

because I think you're focusing on the word.

16

use the word "for" disposal, and I think that is the key

17

word, and the question is intention versus purpose.

18

You don't

So that in your trash hauler case, it seems

19

to work pretty well for me that when we say that that

20

trash truck of course intended in the sense that it was

21

its purpose to dispose of the trash when it got to the

22

dump, but the leakage along the way, it was not its

23

purpose.

24
25

So how do we deal with that?

The statute

tells us that they are an owner of a facility or a
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

vessel that leaks, and therefore they are liable that

2

way.

3

Now, that seems to work.
So we get your example.

What doesn't seem

4

to work is when you import the notion of intention in

5

the sense of knowing that to the arranger provision,

6

because at that point I don't see how -- and I have to

7

buy that to get your argument.

8

see how you get every thing of Clorox on the shelf on

9

the shelf in the supermarket and don't put Clorox right

At that point I do not

10

in the arranger provision and lots of other companies

11

that shouldn't be held as arrangers.

12

Are you following that?

13

MR. STEWART:

That's my problem.

I am following that, but I

14

think that the court of appeals dealt with this and

15

said:

16

manufacturer of a useful product is liable down the road

17

if the customer ultimately disposes of it -

18

Our holding does not suggest that every

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does say that, but my

19

problem is I can't find in the distinctions that they

20

made useful distinctions that will do that.

21

"many," but it won't say, for example, the car battery

22

manufacturer who sends his car batteries out in his own

23

trucks to places where people will get them, and he

24

knows that they're not going to do it properly no matter

25

how hard he tries.

It will say

Well, he's not an arranger.

2

arrange the transport for disposal; he arranged the

3

transport for sale.

4

MR. STEWART:

He didn't

I mean, I think in a sense the

5

argument for liability there would depend in part on an

6

assumption that people will systematically violate the

7

law, like it would be an easy thing for the Court to say

8

we will not assume and we will not impose liability on

9

the basis of the assumption that battery customers will

10

systematically violate the law.

11

But the second thing that would be missing

12

in that hypothetical, even if the battery manufacturer

13

were assumed to know that every one of his customers

14

would dispose of them ultimately in an improper way, is

15

that the battery manufacturer would not be in control of

16

that process.

17

The manufacturer's control over the use of

18

the batteries and their ultimate disposal would be

19

severed once he turned them over, and that was not the

20

case here.

21

of the arranger liability provision, the operator

22

liability provision deals very well with the people who

23

undertake the actual disposal, but Congress evidently

24

thought that that was not enough.

25

And again I think to return to the purposes

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is Shell liable

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

because it -- it knew of the transportation

2

arrangements?

3

MR. STEWART:

I think it is a combination of

4

knowledge and control.

5

but knowledge and control together form a basis for

6

arranger liability.

7

particular common carrier uses a truck, to use a variant

8

of my earlier hypothetical, if I know that a particular

9

common carrier uses a truck that leaks oil whenever it's

10

operated on the highway and I contract with that carrier

11

and ask it to haul goods, I think I can naturally be

12

said to have arranged for the discharge of oil on -

13

Knowledge might be sufficient,

Again, if I know that the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but you -- in that

14

case, you have knowledge but you don't have control

15

because you're using a common carrier.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Whether you have -- you

2

might have knowledge that one chemical broker is more

careless than another in the way the product was

make the seller liable as an arranger if it knows or

6

ought to know that at some point in the distribution

7

process there is likely to be spillage which will enter

8

the waters of the United States.

9

your argument implies.

10
11

I think that's what

I just don't see that in the

statute.
MR. STEWART:

Again, because here Shell had

12

control over the very aspect of the process that

13

resulted in spills and leaks.

14

You mean it could have -

15

could have adopted some other means?

having control over it.
MR. STEWART:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

So all you're

requiring is knowledge that using this means will -

will result in a spill.

it is worth noting that in the typical arranger setting,

arranger's ultimate liability may be determined very

substantially by steps that the hauler takes afterwards;

the issue of apportionment at trial, and the Ninth

that you raised in one of your questions; that is, the

the incurrence of response costs, and in general that's

22

the way that damages are measured in a CERCLA case.

don't ask, what threat -- what was the degree of public

-- of threat to the public safety that was posed by the

25

contamination?

You

You ask, how much did it cost to clean

Alderson Reporting Company

it up?

And it JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you dispute what Ms.

3

Mahoney said, that it costs a great deal more to clean

4

up some of the other chemicals than the ones that the

5

railroad was responsible for?

6

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think -- I don't think

7

that the record kind of establishes the relative costs

8

of different contaminants.

9

Mahoney to say -

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MR. STEWART:

What I understood Ms.

The volume, the volume.
What I understood her to say

12

was that the cost of the remedial action is proportional

13

to the mass of chemicals to be removed, and we do

14

dispute that proposition.

15

Kalinowski testified about the remedial action that the

16

government at that time was contemplating, and it was

17

what was referred to as "a pump-and-treat system," where

18

water would be pumped out of the aquifer and it would be

19

treated with granular-activated carbon, or GAC, and that

20

was a method of removing the contaminants so that the

21

water could be pumped back in.

22

the amount of GAC that would be needed to implement that

23

remedy would be proportional to the mass of the

24

chemicals involved, but that the crucial point for these

25

purposes is the treatment with GAC is only a small

The railroad's expert, Dr.

And Dr. Kalinowski said

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

portion of the pump-and-treat remedy; that is, it's

2

essential to drill wells, pump the water out, then treat

3

it, and then under the prior remedial approach, pump it

4

back in.

5

And then CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that still

6

doesn't address the question, if you have varying

7

degrees of whatever you want to call it -- fault or

8

causal relationship -- that that's a sensible way to

9

apportion the liability.

10

MR. STEWART:

I think the first preliminary

11

point is there's no reason to think that the cost of the

12

remedy as a whole would be proportional to the mass of

13

the contaminants because you have very substantial fixed

14

costs, but the other point I would make is this is where

15

the insolvency of B&B really seems to us to become

16

crucial because, if you had all solvent defendants and

17

the evidence showed that the remedy the government

18

implemented would have been more or less the same if it

19

had only been 10 percent of the contamination, 30

20

percent of the contamination, or 100 percent of the

21

contamination, that so much of the costs were fixed

22

costs that reducing the volume was really not going to

23

affect the cost in any meaningful way -- if you had all

24

solvent defendants, it might still be the case that

25

dividing the costs up in proportion to the contamination
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they caused would do rough justice.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what -- what

3

about Ms. Mahoney's three answers, when I asked that

4

question of her?

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, I believe her first

6

answer was the cost of the remedy would be proportional

7

to the amount of contamination, which we disagree with,

8

and we don't think Dr. Kalinowski's testimony bears that

9

out, because all he said was the amount of

10

granular-activated carbon that would be necessary is

11

proportional to the mass of contaminants.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that -

She also said that

13

the Restatement comment h that you rely on cites no

14

cases, and the Third Restatement backs away from that

15

comment.

16

MR. STEWART:

Well, as to the first point,

17

the comment h, you're right, doesn't cite cases, and it

18

does say that this -- the insolvency of the defendant

19

need not prevent apportionment, only that it would

20

provide a basis for doing so in exceptional cases.

21

in our view, the exceptional case would be one in which

22

the ultimate determination was that the cost of the

23

remedy, the amount of the relevant harm, would be more

24

or less the same even if only one defendants's

25

contamination were at issue, that it 49
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you don't think

2

that the insolvency should prevent apportionment if you

3

have a situation where a party is 1 percent responsible

4

and the 99 percent responsible party is insolvent?

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, we would say even as to

6

10 or 20 percent, if it were established that the remedy

7

the government would have been required to implement,

8

had the only source of contamination been leakage on the

9

railroad parcel -- if it were established that the

10

government could have cleaned that up at 10 percent or

11

20 percent of the cost of the remedy that was actually

12

chosen, then there might be a sound basis for

13

apportionment despite the insolvency of B&B.

14

But our big point is, at the very least, the

15

government should not be left holding the bag for costs

16

that it would have been required to incur if the

17

railroad parcel had been the only source of

18

contamination, because -

19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And what do we have

in the way of findings on that question?

21

MR. STEWART:

We don't have findings either

way.

That is, the district court framed the relevant

23

inquiry as what percentage of the contamination was

24

attributable to the railroad parcel, to the

25

Shell-controlled deliveries, and to the B&B parcel.
50
Alderson Reporting Company

it made no finding one way or the other as to what the

2

cost of the remedy would have been if only the -- the

3

only source of contamination had been the railroad

parcel.

5

And certainly the -- the primary equitable

6

thrust of the argument on the other side is it's unfair

7

to make us pay for somebody else's contamination.

8

to the extent that the government would have been

required to implement a remedy this costly or even 60

MR. STEWART:

I don't know that -- I think

2

you should take it as a given because it was the

3

defendant's burden to prove different divisibility.

4

I think if you don't regard the defendants as having the

5

burden, I don't think there is an evidentiary basis for

6

feeling confident one way or the other as to whether the

7

harm was indivisible.

8
9

But

But with respect to -

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the basis for

thinking that every little detail in the latest

10

restatement, including comments, is binding in a CERCLA

11

case?

12

MR. STEWART:

I don't think so, and this

13

Court in Norfolk and Western -- it was dealing with a

14

different statute, but it said when you're looking at

15

the restatement, it's more important what the state of

16

the law was when Congress enacted the statute rather

17

than what the common-law principles are now.

18

we've said in our brief, we think for that reason the

19

second restatement is the more crucial document.

20

But if you were to look at the third

And as

21

restatement, one of the things you would find is that

22

the drafters, as to indivisible harms, identified a

23

variety of approaches that a local jurisdiction could

24

take -- expressly decline to choose a preferred one

25

among them, but said the most important determinant in

choosing between them is how will the risk that a

should be ignored in citing questions of an

MS. SULLIVAN:

They should bear.

But then

basis for apportionment.

6

railroads did argue, Justice Ginsburg -- put into

evidence and argued at the district court that there

should be apportionment -

But both Shell and the

So does that mean

10

that, let's say, the -- how does that work when it costs

11

$2 million to sort of start a clean-up, no matter who,

12

and then, you know, the more stuff there is, the extra

13

million it is?

14

divisible harm?

Is that -- is -- is the initial cost a

MS. SULLIVAN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the

16

district court here was conservative.

17

of the costs, fixed and specific, to the parties.

18

the conservative estimate of six percent for Shell, nine

19

percent for the railroads, was based on the heroic

20

assumption that a few drops spilled two football fields

21

away of a volatile substance that evaporates twice as

22

fast as water would be picked up by a rainfall that

23

could happen at the relevant quantities only once every

24

ten years according to our expert, once every seven

years according to the government's expert -- on the

It allocated all

heroic assumption that all of those drips reached the

2

pond which created a single plume of contamination.

3

Assuming that, then we award six percent or nine percent

of liability.

5

But the point is there was record evidence,

Justice Ginsburg -- and there is no need for a remand on

this.

8

percent and the nine percent could be -- we -- and we

9

didn't object and say we -

10

There was ample evidence for which the six

That's not normally how

-- when -- when someone has a burden of proof, it's a

burden of coming forward.

13

know from this district judge is he's saying, I was left

largely to make it up.

15

allocation did not come from -- yes, there is some

evidence in the record.

17

about a party who has a burden of proof, we don't mean

they put in a piece here and a piece there and left it

to the district judge to figure out.

MS. SULLIVAN:

And the one thing that we do

But ordinarily when you talk

Justice Ginsburg, there is no

question that both the railroads and Shell argued for

zero percent liability.

if you want to look at Docket Nos. 1317 and 1318,

Shell's proposed findings of fact did suggest a basis

But the same evidence that we

for apportionment.

So we met our burden of production

as well as proof.

But the -- to return to the question

3

--

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm really concerned about

5

the time and the white light, but I'm -- I'm not sure

6

you answered the Chief Justice's hypothetical about $2

7

million, which is an initial clean-up that has to be

8

expended no matter how large the -- the spill was.

9

did you discharge your burden of proof to show that that

10

How

is not the case here or that that is divisible?

11

MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Kennedy, here -- and

12

I refer you to the Petitioner's appendix at page -- I'm

13

sorry, to the joint appendix at page 288, to the expert

14

Kalinouski who described it as a single mass removal

15

scheme.

16

This is not a case like a toxic soup case in

17

a landfill with 238 different chemicals that require

18

different extraction procedures.

19

which two chemicals reached the ground water and were to

20

be removed by a single mass extraction scheme, a single

21

-- what the expert called at joint appendix 288 a mass

22

removal scheme.

23

that there was a single remediation process.

24

a simple case in which we are relying -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is a case in

It was not disputed or argued on appeal
So this is

Well, we don't suppose that

that cost -- that single thing cost $2 million, and you

2

will have to hire that $2 million machine even if there

3

is one drop.

4

couldn't matter if your client put in one drop and

5

nobody else put in any, or the others put in 40 billion

6

drops.

7

allocate it, but I guess maybe in the restatement there

8

is some law somewhere saying you can't, because it's

9

just one single cost that takes place regardless.

So for the cost of that machine it

Can you allocate it?

It would seem fair to

10

What's the state of the law on that?

11

MS. SULLIVAN:

How do you -

May I answer?

A reasonable

12

basis is all that's required.

13

is appropriate here.

14

between fixed capital costs and operating costs that

15

might matter in a different case.

16

here is that you should affirm as a matter of Federal

17

common law that restatement 433(a) provides only a

18

demand for a reasonable basis and not exactitude.

you very much.
