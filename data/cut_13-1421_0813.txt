 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (10:11 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 131421, Bank of 

5

America v. Caulkett, and the consolidated case. 

6

 Ms. Spinelli. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI 

8
9
10

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

11

 Respondents' position is that Section 506(d) 

12

of the Bankruptcy Code allows Chapter 7 debtors to keep 

13

their houses, strip their underwater mortgages, and 

14

prevent their lenders from accessing any later 

15

appreciation in a house's value.  In Dewsnup, this Court 

16

rejected that position with respect to partially 

17

underwater mortgages and that reasoning applies with 

18

equal force to completely underwater mortgages. 

19

 Dewsnup held that Section 506(d) voids only 

20

liens securing disallowed claims.  It does not void 

21

liens based on the current value of the collateral. 

22

That logic applies whether the current value of the 

23

collateral is a million dollars, $1 or zero, as 

24

virtually every court to address the question has held, 

25

and even the Eleventh Circuit below all but admitted.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Outside bankruptcy, the bank would be 

2

entitled to have its lien stay with the property until 

3

foreclosure or payment in full. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What is the value of 

5

of an  an under  completely underwater second 

6

mortgage?  How likely is it that it will ever  that 

7

the property will ever appreciate to the extent that it 

8

will have real value? 

9

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Ginsburg, it's quite 

10

likely.  In these two particular cases, to be sure, the 

11

second liens are deeply underwater.  That's not true in 

12

every case and there's no reason to think it's true in 

13

the typical case. 

14

 We have  Bank of America has many cases 

15

pending right now in the Eleventh Circuit.  We have 

16

cases in which the value of the house would need to rise 

17

only by $4,000, where it would need to rise only by 

18

$5,000, and given that we're in the middle of a market 

19

upswing, it's very plausible and very likely that many 

20

of these mortgages will regain equity. 

21

 We quote statistics in our opening brief 

22

that show that between 2012 and 2014, the number of 

23

underwater junior mortgages was cut in half from 

24

4.2 million to 2.1 million.  So houses are coming above 

25

water every day.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And what Dewsnup held is that the 

2

lienholder, according to the basic nonbankruptcy 

3

bargain, is entitled to keep its lien until payment in 

4

full or until a lender decides to foreclose. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do the holders of the 

6

second, assuming the second is partially or fully 

7

underwater, ever participate in negotiations with the 

8

property owner and with the holder of the first lien and 

9

say, well, if you keep the property, we'll reduce our 

10

junior lead  lien by 50 percent?  Is  is there a 

11

negotiation dynamic that the rule that you propose would 

12

further? 

13

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Let me be clear about this, 

14

Justice Kennedy, because I think this is important.  In 

15

Chapter 7 bankruptcies, there are no such negotiations. 

16

Chapter 7 is very simple; the debtor turns over his 

17

assets.  To the extent there are any nonexempt, 

18

nonencumbered assets, which there typically are not, 

19

the trustee will sell those assets, distribute the 

20

proceeds to creditors.  The debtor then receives a 

21

discharge of all prepetition debt. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let's just talk 

23

about Chapter 7 because that's what I had in mind. 

24

Suppose it's a close case and they're thinking of maybe 

25

insisting on  on sale.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Can the junior lienholder say what if  I'm 

2

not going to prevail in the sale, but I'll  if you 

3

don't sell, then I'll cut my  my lien in half on the 

4

chance that it may go up?  I mean, you  so you 

5

couldn't ever have this negotiated in  in a Chapter 7? 

6

 MS. SPINELLI: 

In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 

7

those negotiations simply don't occur.  If there's 

8

nonexempt equity in the house, the trustee has to sell 

9

the house 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

11

 MS. SPINELLI: 

12
13

Right. 
 and distribute the 

proceeds. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And the trustee doesn't 

14

care, I mean, right?  I mean, his job is done once 

15

once the bankruptcy is over.  If  if it goes up, it's 

16

the homeowner who  who would care. 

17

 MS. SPINELLI: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

That's correct. 
And he's not part of the 

negotiation.  He's out of it. 

20

 MS. SPINELLI: 

21

 Now, if 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's  that's correct. 

I'm sorry.  How does 

23

this work?  I'm sorry.  Back up.  You say the trustee 

24

sells it.  How does the mortgage holder in that 

25

situation foreclose?  Meaning if  if the debtor no

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

longer owns the property, this doesn't go free and clean 

2

to the purchaser? 

3

 MS. SPINELLI: 

The way it works, Justice 

4

Sotomayor, is that if there is nonexempt equity in the 

5

house which, of course, was not true in these two cases, 

6

the trustee will sell the house; out of those proceeds, 

7

the trustee will first satisfy the claim of the senior 

8

secured lender.  If there's anything left over, it will 

9

go to the junior secured lender.  If there's not, the 

10

junior lender receives nothing, and the junior lien is 

11

extinguished. 

12
13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So when does  do the 

facts of this case matter? 

14

 MS. SPINELLI: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The facts of this 
Because this is before 

16

the  the finished  the wrappingup of the plan; 

17

right? 

18
19
20
21
22

 MS. SPINELLI: 

In Chapter 7 there is no 

plan. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  This is 

before the bankruptcy is terminated. 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

I think it's important to 

23

understand that Chapter 7 bankruptcies happen very 

24

quickly.  A noasset bankruptcy like this one will 

25

usually be wrapped up in 30 to 45 days.  Whereas here,

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's no equity in the property to be distributed to 

2

creditors, and there are no other nonexempt assets, 

3

there's really not very much for the trustee to do.  The 

4

trustee will file a notice that the case is 

5

administered, and at that point, a house that's in a 

6

situation of these two houses, in which there is no 

7

nonexempt, nonencumbered value, will be abandoned to 

8

the debtor. 

9

 At that point, the debtor's rights in the 

10

property are precisely what they were before bankruptcy. 

11

If the debtor is in default on his mortgage, then the 

12

lenders can foreclose.  If the 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let me follow up to 

14

something Justice Kennedy  many of  your adversary 

15

plus many others, amici, have argued that if we rule in 

16

the way that you seek, that wholly underwater junior 

17

liens are going to be a holdup, and you are going to use 

18

it as hostage value, and they point to various 

19

situations in which that has occurred. 

20
21
22

 That, to me, is a concerning policy issue, 
so explain why that's not true. 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Sotomayor, my answer 

23

to that would be that's not a bankruptcy problem.  There 

24

are not negotiations that take place in Chapter 7 as to 

25

which the junior lienholder could exercise any holdup

8

Alderson Reporting Company

value. 
 It's ­ it's 

certainly may be the case that 

3

later on the debtor may want to negotiate a modification 

4

with its senior lender.  That happens all the time to 

5

people who have been through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and 

6

people who have not.  And to the extent there's a 

7

housing policy issue, I don't think that's properly 

8

addressed through interpretation of the bankruptcy code. 

9

One of the amici 

10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, the bankruptcy 

code  code wants to give debtors a fresh start. 

12

 MS. SPINELLI: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That is true. 
And to the extent that 

14

Chapter 7 is an attempt to do that, if you're able to 

15

hold up that fresh start, that is the concern 

16

they're  they're pointing to. 

17

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Sotomayor, the fresh 

18

start that's given to debtors in Chapter 7 has a 

19

particular nature.  The nature of the fresh start in 

20

Chapter 7 is that the debtor surrenders all of his or 

21

her assets and in return gets a discharge of all 

22

prepetition debt.  It's never been the case that the 

23

Chapter 7 fresh start has encompassed an ability to 

24

retain property and also strip off liens on that 

25

property.

9

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 If the debtor wanted  and this  this 

2

doesn't force the debtor to stay in a house that he or 

3

she can't afford.  If the debtor  if the debtor wanted 

4

to, say, cure a default on his mortgage and keep the 

5

house, Chapter 13 is open to the debtor which permits 

6

curing a default on a mortgage and maintaining payments 

7

during the course of the plan. 

8

 Under Chapter 7, a debtor can, if the debtor 

9

is in the situation of these debtors and the house has 

10

been abandoned back to the debtor  if the debtor is 

11

in  is current on its loans can keep the house, pay 

12

its mortgage going forward, and be in the same situation 

13

that he was prior to bankruptcy.  The one thing that 

14

Chapter 7 gives a debtor in that situation is that it 

15

discharges the debtor of any personal liability for the 

16

mortgage debt, so the lender cannot come after the 

17

debtor personally.  If the debtor decides that the house 

18

is too expensive for him to stay in, he can stop paying 

19

the mortgage and the only recourse that the lender then 

20

has is to foreclose. 

21

 So there  there certainly is an ability 

22

for debtors to walk away from houses that they simply 

23

can't afford, and there is also an ability through 

24

Chapter 13 to cure existing defaults and reach an 

25

arrangement for which the debtor can keep the house.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Ms. Spinelli, I  I 

2

dissented in Dewsnup, and I continue to believe that 

3

dissent was correct.  Why should I not limit Dewsnup to 

4

the facts that it involved, which is a partially 

5

underwater mortgage? 

6

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Scalia, I don't think 

7

that can be done coherently given the reasoning of 

8

the Court in Dewsnup.  But what the Court held in 

9

Dewsnup is that Section 506(d) 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, I understand that, but 

11

I think the reasoning was wrong, and  and very often, 

12

we  we adhere to a prior decision that  that, on the 

13

facts of that case  and Dewsnup did  did say, you know, 

14

we're just limiting it to the facts of this case, and 

15

we're not saying what these terms mean elsewhere in the 

16

Bankruptcy Act.  So let's take Dewsnup at its word and 

17

just limit it to what it involved, which was a partially 

18

under  underwater mortgage.  Now, why shouldn't I do 

19

that? 

20

 MS. SPINELLI: 

I don't believe that's 

21

logically possible even if Dewsnup was wrongly decided 

22

because Dewsnup interpreted a specific phrase in a 

23

specific place in the code. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I understand that.  But we 

often limit prior decisions to their facts and don't 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

follow their logic.

2

 MS. SPINELLI: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, Justice Scalia 
If we followed their logic, 

4

we would  we would never be able to do what I'm 

5

suggesting.  But we often say, yes, the logic would lead 

6

us here, but it was a terrible decision, and we're not 

7

going  we're not going to extend it any further.  Why 

8

would that be a bad idea here? 

9

 MS. SPINELLI: 

In this situation, we're 

10

talking about an interpretation of language in a 

11

specific place in a statute, and to do that would be to 

12

read the exact same language in the exact same place in 

13

the statute to mean different things 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All right, I'm just not 

15

getting through to you.  I'm willing to do that.  I'm 

16

willing to do that when  when the language was read 

17

incorrectly the first time. 

18

 MS. SPINELLI: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay. 
But as a practical 

20

matter  I'm talking as a practical matter and stare 

21

decisis is a very practical doctrine.  Why  why 

22

should, as a practical matter, should I ad  adhere 

23

to an opinion that I think was wrong? 

24
25

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Well, I do think 

Clark v. Martinez would apply in this situation and 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

1

present  prevent a barrier to doing that.  But in

2

addition 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What is  what is 

Hart  what is the case that you just cited? 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

I apologize, Justice 

6

Ginsburg.  That is one of the cases in which the Court 

7

has said that the same language in the same place in the 

8

same statute cannot mean different things in different 

9

factual circumstances. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

There is a dissenting 

11

opinion in a different area of the law on taxpayer 

12

standard under the Establishment Clause, a brilliant 

13

dissenting opinion that you might want to rely on in 

14

this context. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I've never been able to 

17

figure out the answer to question he raises which is I 

18

take a dissenting opinion in one case, and then when do 

19

I say, okay, forget it? 

20

 MS. SPINELLI: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
And  and the answer is 

22

sort of personal, in a way.  How strongly do you feel, 

23

given the need of the law, to advise the lawyers, advise 

24

judges, advise Congress and others?  If we all keep 

25

dissenting all the time, it will be chaos.  If we never 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

change, you can't stick to a principle.  If you have

2

found any way of drawing that line, I  I don't think 

3

there is a way 

4

 MS. SPINELLI: 

I think  I think there is, 

5

Justice Breyer and Justice Scalia, which is that, I 

6

mean, this Court has very rarely taken the step of 

7

overruling a statutory interpretation decision. 

8

Certainly never in the kind of 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm not talking about 

10

overruling.  I'm saying subsist as far as partially 

11

underwater mortgages are concerned.  The issue before us 

12

is whether we should extend it to totally underwater. 

13

 Now, I thought you were going to tell me, 

14

you know, I feel strongly that  that Dewsnup was 

15

wrong, but I'm not going to upset expectations.  I mean, 

16

if banks have been, you know, lending money for second 

17

mortgages on the assumption that they would not be 

18

stripped, I mean, that's what I thought you were going 

19

to tell me.  Oh, you know, many expectations that have 

20

been rested upon this  this misbegotten opinion of 

21

Dewsnup. 

22

 MS. SPINELLI: 

It's  it's certainly been 

23

the case that since Dewsnup was decided until this 

24

decision by the Eleventh Circuit in 2012, it was  it 

25

was wellestablished that Dewsnup applied equally to 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

completely underwater. 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Well, Ms. Spinelli

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And ­ and are you saying, 

4

then, that there have been substantial reliance on the 

5

Dewsnup interpretation that you are supporting here by 

6

banks that have given second mortgages all over the 

7

country, huge reliance that would be upset. 

8

 MS. SPINELLI: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I have been relying 
I  I thought that that's 

10

what you were going to say to Justice Scalia, and I 

11

don't  I don't hear that being argued. 

12

 MS. SPINELLI: 

I believe that there has been 

13

reliance.  I actually don't think that's the most 

14

compelling argument as to why the Court shouldn't depart 

15

from Dewsnup. 

16
17
18

 The language in Dewsnup simply can't be read 
to distinguish between completely and partially 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but if we could go 

19

back  I mean, I kind of agree with you that it's not a 

20

very compelling argument, this reliance argument, 

21

because I find myself in the same position as Justice 

22

Scalia.  I read the two Dewsnup opinions, and it seems 

23

to me that Justice Scalia clearly has the better of the 

24

argument.  And then 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And then the question is, 

3

what do we do about that and where do we go from there.

4

And it does strike me that if  you know, these are the 

5

most sophisticated parties that can possibly be 

6

imagined, Bank of America and other banks, and it seems 

7

to me that they would be making essentially a bet on 

8

and they would, you know, think about all the things 

9

what is the probability that Dewsnup will be extended to 

10
11

completely underwater mortgages. 
 And presumably, they discounted all their 

12

various calculations in order to take into account the 

13

probability that another court would say, you know, 

14

Dewsnup is not very persuasive, and we're just not 

15

willing to extend it any further.  And I think that's 

16

probably what Bank of America and other banks did, is 

17

they said, you know, we think there is X percent chance 

18

that Dewsnup will be extended and Y percent chance that 

19

it won't, and they made their cost and pricing 

20

calculations based on that calculation. 

21
22
23

 So if that's the case, why should we worry 
about reliance? 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Kagan, I do believe 

24

that banks have relied on the Dewsnup decision.  As to 

25

whether they specifically made calculations about when 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it would apply  whether it would apply in these 

2

circumstances, I don't know.  But I think I would go 

3

back to the premise of your question, which is that this

4

would be extending Dewsnup.  It ­ it wouldn't be 

5

extending Dewsnup.  It would simply be applying Dewsnup 

6

to a set of facts in which the interpretation the Court 

7

gave in Dewsnup is equally applicable. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Even though Dewsnup 

itself said no, we're deciding this case only, and not 

10

any other.  I think in  in your brief, you did make 

11

the point that Dewsnup is now how many years old? 

12
13
14

 MS. SPINELLI: 

It's almost 25 years old, 

Justice Ginsburg. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And Congress could have 

15

changed it if it didn't like it, and Congress has 

16

amended the code. 

17

 MS. SPINELLI: 

That's  that's correct.  I 

18

mean, Congress has amended the code substantially both 

19

in 1994 and in 2005.  In 1994, Congress overruled or 

20

modified a couple of these courts' bankruptcy decisions. 

21

It overruled Rake v. Wade.  It modified the statute in 

22

response to this Court's decision in Nobelman. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that proves, at most, 

24

that Congress liked Dewsnup as applied to partially 

25

underwater mortgages; isn't that right?  I mean, that's 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all it proves.  They let it  they let it stand.  They 

2

did not overrule Dewsnup as far as partially underwater 

3

mortgages.  It doesn't say anything about how they feel

4

about totally underwater mortgages. 

5

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice Scalia, there is 

6

simply no distinction that can be drawn between 

7

partially and completely underwater liens in this 

8

situation.  Dewsnup held that a secured claim is a claim 

9

secured by a lien with recourse to the underlying 

10
11

collateral.  That is equally applicable here. 
 Likewise, I mean, the text of Section 506 

12

certainly draws no such distinction, so it would be an 

13

odd thing to do to vindicate textualism to adopt the 

14

proposition that Respondents are advancing here. 

15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You really know how to hurt 

a fellow, don't you? 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean, I understand 

19

the notion and agree with it completely that if you have 

20

a decision that's wrong, you don't extend it in any way. 

21

But there are factual distinctions and there are factual 

22

distinctions.  I mean, Dewsnup may have been decided on 

23

a Tuesday, and this case could be decided on a Thursday, 

24

but you would not say, you know, we're not extending it 

25

 you know, we're simply not going to extend it to 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other cases. 

2

 MS. SPINELLI: 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice. 
And in this

4

particular instance, I assume the difference between 

5

underwater and  and totally  partially underwater 

6

and totally underwater is a completely  a completely 

7

fluid one in the sense that at the start of  the start 

8

of the bankruptcy  I didn't think of that one. 

9
10
11

 (Laughter.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That was totally 

unintended. 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But  but the idea 

14

is that, you know, throughout a bankruptcy, you could 

15

have a mortgage that is  a lien that's underwater, 

16

then totally underwater, then partially underwater.  And 

17

the idea that you'd latch onto that as a distinction 

18

seems to me to be a difficult proposition . 

19

 MS. SPINELLI: 

That's exactly right.  I 

20

mean, the nonbankruptcy right of a lienholder is to 

21

retain its lien until payment in full or until 

22

foreclosure, which means that the lienholder is entitled 

23

to access any equity that may develop in the future due 

24

to appreciation of the property to secure its lien. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is this  is this right? 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I want to be sure I understand.  Under Dewsnup, the last 

2

25 years, lenders and others in the bankruptcy community 

3

have understand  understood the way it works is the

4

following:  If you have a lien and the house is worth 

5

500,000 and your  your lien is secured and it's worth 

6

a million, and they're in Chapter 7, you have a secured 

7

interest and they're counted as a secured creditor only 

8

to 500,000.  As to the remaining 500,000, you're counted 

9

as an unsecured creditor, but you keep the lien. 

10

 MS. SPINELLI: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right.  Well, but 
And so therefore, if when 

12

they're out of bankruptcy someday or the house goes up, 

13

or whatever it is, you still have your lien.  Is that 

14

right? 

15
16

 MS. SPINELLI: 

explain that, Justice Breyer. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MS. SPINELLI: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20
21

That's right.  And let me 

No.  I mean, I don't 
Section 506 
I just wanted to be sure it 

was right, but if you'd like to explain it further, do. 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

It  it is right, and I 

22

and I would, if I might.  Section 506(a) bifurcates 

23

under secured claims into a secured portion and an 

24

unsecured portion, and that determines the distribution 

25

that a creditor can get from the estate. 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, I want to be clear that nothing in the 

2

way this Court reads 506(d) will affect that.  That is 

3

going to be true no matter what.  What Dewsnup said is

4

that Section 506(d) does not refer back to that 

5

bifurcation in 506(a).  Rather, it uses the word 

6

"secured" in the ordinary English and ordinary legal 

7

meaning of secured by a lien with recourse to the 

8

underlying collateral.  And in that situation, given 

9

that reading, 506(d) only strips liens securing 

10

disallowed claims.  If the claim is valid, then the 

11

creditor is entitled to 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That means that after 

13

bankruptcy's over and you're back out of Section 7 

14

Chapter 7, your lien  unless it falls within one of 

15

the other two exceptions there  remains. 

16

 MS. SPINELLI: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

Correct. 
And therefore  and that's 

the understanding.  Okay.  I understand.  Thank you. 

19

 MS. SPINELLI: 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Correct. 
When  when do trustees 

21

decide that they're not sure of the value of the home 

22

and that they're going to sell it to find out what it's 

23

worth? 

24
25

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Typically, the value's not 

disputed.  If it's  it's usually quite clear whether 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there is or is not nonexempt, nonencumbered value in a 

2

house, and the trustee will sell the house only if there 

3

is nonexempt, nonencumbered value.

4

 The  you know, it's possible that in a 

5

situation in which it's not clear, the trustee might go 

6

ahead and sell the house and see how much is realized 

7

for it, because that sell  sale price would then by 

8

definition establish the amount of the secured claim. 

9

 Typically, in  you know, typically, in no 

10

asset cases like this, there's simply no issue and 

11

there's no question that the trustee is not going to be 

12

selling the asset. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Just  just getting back 

14

to the reliance point or really, from your argument, the 

15

nonreliance point, the  your  your brief talked 

16

about the millions of loans and so forth that have been 

17

made, but you  you seem to walk away from any reliance 

18

argument.

 MS. SPINELLI: 

Justice  Justice Kennedy, 

let me be clear. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm really quite surprised 

at that. 
 MS. SPINELLI: 

Let me be clear.  I am not 

24

walking away from the argument that the banks have 

25

relied on Dewsnup.  I think that's unquestionably true. 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Millions of loans have been made in reliance on 

2

Dewsnup's holding.  Banks, when they make loans, price 

3

them in and extend them based on an understanding of

4

what their recovery is going to be given default.  That 

5

is true. 

6

 What I was responding to is the notion that 

7

banks may have relied on, you know, whether this Court 

8

would apply Dewsnup to completely underwater mortgages. 

9

I think that's a little bit less strong, although it's 

10

true that in the 25 years since Dewsnup, it's  until 

11

this decision by the Eleventh Circuit, it's been well 

12

established that Dewsnup does apply to completely 

13

underwater liens. 

14

 May I reserve the balance of my time?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANOS BIBAS 

19
20
21
22

You may. 

Thank you. 
Mr. Bibas. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. BIBAS: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 A claim unsupported by any value is a 

23

completely unsecured claim under Section 506(a).  An 

24

unsecured claim cannot be an allowed secured claim, and 

25

its associated lien is void under Section 506(d). 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Claims with some value remain secured.  Claims with no 

2

value don't.  They would be wiped out in foreclosure, 

3

and bankruptcy treats them no better than foreclosure

4

would. 

5

 But before I get to text or holdup value or 

6

Dewsnup, let me seize on the striking concession of my 

7

adversary.  Justices Scalia and Kagan pressed my 

8

adversary who conceded that she couldn't demonstrate 

9

reliance here.  There were bankruptcy courts and 

10

district courts that foreshadowed the ruling below, and 

11

they pointed to no evidence of reliance.  There is  we 

12

challenged in our brief to show that in the Eleventh 

13

Circuit lending markets were being affected.  No 

14

evidence.  There are eight circuits in which lien 

15

voiding is allowed in Chapter 13.  No evidence.  We 

16

should clear the table of a reliance argument that my 

17

adversary all but concedes. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How  how  she didn't 

19

concede it, and  and it just seems  you know, it's 

20

not just homeowners.  You can cure me of this 

21

misapprehension, but probably in the last 25 years or 

22

30 years, there have been trillions of dollars that have 

23

been loaned to businesses.  I mean, think of Lehman 

24

Brothers, and  and they go bankrupt, and suddenly at 

25

stake are  are hundreds of billions of dollars.  And a 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person who has made a mortgage, at least a lawyer would 

2

say, okay, you can lend the money; if things go badly, 

3

we can keep the lien.  We won't collect because he is

4

bankrupt, but markets go up and down.  Keep  keep 

5

keep the secured interest, they might go back up, you 

6

might get it some day. 

7
8
9

 Now, that's perfectly obvious advice, it 
seems to me, from what I know so far. 
 So  so when you do that, the mortgage 

10

lender has to decide what the interest rate is, how 

11

what the terms are, and it's pretty hard to believe 

12

there isn't some effect on the brain of the  of the 

13

person who is making the mortgage from the simple fact 

14

that he gets to keep that lien, it passes through 

15

bankruptcy, and eventually the market may go back up. 

16

 MR. BIBAS: 

In addition to Justice Kagan's 

17

answer, which is the banks are well advised and can 

18

forecast, they can read the text of the statute and 

19

Dewsnup's express 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We have  we have had 

21

25 years or 30 years  23 years to be exact, and I 

22

and  and the  the fact is that, sure, they go to 

23

their lawyer  they don't  the lawyers, and the 

24

lawyers would read and the lawyers would say. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. BIBAS: 

Well, I direct the Court to the 

2

Levitin amicus brief.  There are two empirical studies 

3

that found natural experiments.  One of them involved

4

differences in circuits before Nobelman in Chapter 13 

5

lien voiding which found a very slight effect, 0.12 to 

6

0.18 percent, on first mortgages.  The other, an 

7

empirical study by Philadelphia Federal Reserve 

8

economists, likewise found no substantial effect on 

9

markets even when different circuits adopted 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It  it  it's hard 

11

it's hard for me to think that a decision in your favor 

12

wouldn't, in a sense, hurt borrowers because the market 

13

for a second is going to dry up or become much more 

14

expensive.  I  I'll read the briefs and you can tell 

15

me about why that theory, economic theory, might be 

16

wrong, but it seems to me just common sense. 

17

 MR. BIBAS: 

Justice Kennedy, the Levitin 

18

amicus brief explains in greater detail, but there is a 

19

problem in the mortgage market in that first mortgagees 

20

and debtors often want to work out mutually beneficial 

21

resolutions.  As my adversary concedes, no negotiation 

22

goes on in bankruptcy.  The second can prevent this from 

23

happening, and we've cited multiple studies that show 

24

that the second lenders may wind up forcing homes into 

25

foreclosure. 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The other point that the Levitin brief makes 

2

is that this is primarily a problem with the housing 

3

bubble.  This is a problem of very high loantovalue,

4

piggyback second mortgages.  They found no evidence of 

5

an effect on low loantovalue home improvement, home 

6

equity lines of credit of the sort that survive now that 

7

the regulatory 

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I would agree that 

their bargaining club might be too big in some 

10

instances, the  the bargaining club of  of the 

11

second.  On the other hand, it does seem to me that 

12

there is room in close cases for a threeway compromise. 

13

I'm  I'm advised that that just doesn't happen in 

14

Chapter 7.  I find that hard to believe, but especially 

15

in major bankruptcies, not homeowner bankruptcy. 

16

 MR. BIBAS: 

Two responses, Justice Kennedy. 

17

The first part of your question was, well, what is the 

18

effect on mortgage lending?  Even if there were an 

19

effect on second mortgage lending, one has to balance 

20

that against maximizing the value of first mortgages, 

21

which are purchase money mortgages which are helped by 

22

unclogging the housing market.  The chief economist at 

23

Moody's Analytics said that resolving subordinate liens 

24

was the biggest obstacle to the housing recovery. 

25

 Then your second question is, well, what 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about loan modifications and bargaining.  My answer 

2

there is this administration had a number or programs in 

3

place after the housing bubble; HAMP and HARP were these

4

mortgage  mortgage modification programs.  The takeup 

5

rate on those were very disappointing, much lower than 

6

the administration expected because of this holdup power 

7

that 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why is this all about 

housing?  Why isn't it about  maybe it is.  I'm  I'm 

10

expecting an answer.  Why  why is it just about 

11

housing?  Why isn't it about Lehman Brothers?  Why isn't 

12

about it about businesses?  Why isn't it about 

13

commercial property? 

14

 MR. BIBAS: 

Because currently, in Chapter 11 

15

in  in cramdown reorganizations and the like, similar 

16

lien voiding already happens when there is no value to 

17

be  to secure it. 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 MR. BIBAS: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's statutorily. 

Right, statutorily is 
Now, where in any 

21

statute in 11 or 13 did Congress ever use the word 

22

voiding a lien as opposed to stripping down a lien? 

23

 MR. BIBAS: 

It  it doesn't use the phrase 

24

stripping down.  It doesn't use the phrase void, 

25

Justice Sotomayor.  And this is very important.  The 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

NACBA brief goes into this.  There are references to 

2

retaining liens, to satisfying liens, to modifying 

3

liens.  But as NACBA explains, those provisions all

4

piggyback on 506, which values a claim.  It goes over 

5

for adjudication in Chapter 11, the different classes of 

6

creditors, and then back to 506(d) which is the 

7

provision that says that it voids liens.  And NACBA's 

8

fear is that if this Court does not allow Section 506(d) 

9

to do what it's supposed to do, it could impair not only 

10

housing mortgage modifications, but business 

11

bankruptcy 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, yes, but no.  I'm 

13

I'm not  I just want to understand it.  I'm 

14

housing  I'm a mall.  I'm Lehman Brothers. 

15

 MR. BIBAS: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
I go bankrupt.  There are 

17

all kinds of liens all over the place.  Doesn't the same 

18

law apply to them

2

business in Chapter 7. 

3

 MR. BIBAS: 

No, no.  But assume a big 

Yes.  Businesses under Chapter 7

4

do not receive a discharge, and so typically the 

5

business is filing under Chapter 11.  If there is a 

6

liquidation, you are right, though, that the same logic 

7

could apply there.  And whether it a business bankruptcy 

8

or it's a mortgage, a home bankruptcy, there is still 

9

the need for the bankruptcy code's policies of finality 

10
11

and a fresh start. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You know, I  I'm not 

12

familiar with the widespread practice of giving  of 

13

taking a second mortgage on a business loan unless it's 

14

your fatherinlaw.  It's  it's a very common practice 

15

for  for purchases of homes.  I  I  I'm not aware 

16

that it's a common practice in businesses, getting 

17

getting second mortgages.  I  it seems to me quite 

18

rare. 

19

 MR. BIBAS: 

But there are different tranches 

20

of debt sometimes, senior and junior debt obligations, 

21

that would be analogous.  But you're right. 

22

Numerically, this is going to be a huge issue in  in 

23

the housing market. 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Bibas, I'm ­ I'm really 

not a poor loser and  and, you know 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 I've  I've lost in 

3

Dewsnup.  What I am concerned about is the  what

4

should I say  the ridiculousness of saying if under 

5

Dewsnup  and you haven't asked us to overrule Dewsnup 

6

 under Dewsnup, if  if there's $1 worth of value, 

7

okay, you don't lose your lien.  But if there is zero 

8

value, $1 less and it's stripped entirely, it seems to 

9

me a  a very strange  strange outcome.  Why would 

10

any intelligent system want to produce an outcome like 

11

that? 

12

 MR. BIBAS: 

I'll talk about that doctrinally 

13

and then as a policy matter.  Doctrinally, the code has 

14

dozens of provisions that turn on a dollar difference in 

15

eligibility for Chapter 7 or presumptions of abuse of a 

16

like.  Congress draws these lines.  Section 1111(b) for 

17

business bankruptcies and reorganizations talks about 

18

inconsequential value.  You keep your lien if it has 

19

some value.  If it doesn't 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

that Congress drew, right? 

22
23
24
25

 MR. BIBAS: 

You think this is a line 

Well, Congress drew the 

other provisions. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Congress intentionally 

wanted Dewsnup for partially underwater and really 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doesn't want Dewsnup for totally underwater.  Come on. 

2

 MR. BIBAS: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MR. BIBAS: 

I didn't say that, Your Honor. 
All right.
I  I'd remind Your Honor of 

5

of your opinion in Green v. Bock Laundry.  If it's 

6

necessary to deviate from the text, which Dewsnup 

7

admitted it was deviating from the text, pick the 

8

deviation that does the least violence to the text, that 

9

minimizes the amount of the deviation.  We preserve a 

10

link and Dewsnup did not completely sever the 

11

link between 506(a)'s requirement 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It may take the least 

13

violence from the text, but it leaves, as Justice Scalia 

14

suggested, absolutely draconian arbitrary results. 

15
16
17
18
19

 MR. BIBAS: 

Okay.  As a policy matter, 

Justice Kennedy 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And his opinion didn't say 

that you do that. 
 MR. BIBAS: 

No.  Your Honor, I don't believe 

20

it's draconian.  If a property is $1 above water, okay, 

21

it is preserved under this reading of Dewsnup.  But we've 

22

explained in our brief that foreclosure sale at deep 

23

discounts, there are high transaction costs.  So a house 

24

might have to rise by half or more in value before 

25

there's any additional money on the table.  So if 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

anything, allowing preservation of a lien that has $1 in 

2

nominal value is being somewhat overprotective, erring 

3

on the side of being generous and protective when there

4

would be no money left in foreclosure.  What it does is 

5

it clears out the liens that are nowhere close to having 

6

value in foreclosure. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Isn't the question 

8

complicated by the fact that whether it's $1 above or $1 

9

below is a matter of a fairly subjective valuation by 

10
11

the court? 
 MR. BIBAS: 

On the contrary, Your Honor, 

12

Section 506(a) expressly provides for judicial 

13

valuation.  Nobelman recognized it would be judicial 

14

valuation.  The house reports recognized it would be 

15

judicial. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Oh, no, I know it's 

17

judicial valuation, but that's  that's the problem. 

18

If you're cutting a fine line and saying it's up to the 

19

judge who can look ahead and say, well, this is going to 

20

happen in the bankruptcy, and I'm worried about that. 

21

No one's going to say a valuation at $50,001 is 

22

accurate, but 49,999 is not.  But that is in control of 

23

the judge who's doing the valuation. 

24
25

 MR. BIBAS: 

Yes.  But it's far more accurate 

than the realistic alternative of foreclosure.  There 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are many more safeguards.  One can  the creditor can 

2

submit a proposed valuation.  A creditor submits 

3

appraisals, expert testimony, there is a hearing.  And

4

that is far more protected than foreclosures which have 

5

to have  be rushed sales, poor notice, poorly 

6

advertised, they require cash sales, that leave the 

7

creditor much less protection. 

8

 The realistic alternative here is throwing 

9

the house into foreclosure, and  and outside a 

10

bankruptcy and then, in fact, the creditor winds up 

11

worse off.  Not just the second, who has nothing to gain 

12

and nothing to lose, holds it up, the first mortgagee 

13

winds up losing value. 

14

 If I might now take the Court back to the 

15

text of the statute. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Bibas, before you do, 

17

could I go back to something that the Chief asked 

18

about  that the Chief Justice asked about earlier, 

19

which is this question of whether a distinction between 

20

fully underwater and partially underwater is coherent at 

21

all. 

22

 Here's what Dewsnup said. 

Dewsnup on the 

23

one hand said, we're deciding this case and this case 

24

only.  But it also said this, this is how it framed its 

25

holding.  "We hold that 506(d) does not allow petitioner 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to strip down respondent's lien because respondent's 

2

lien"  excuse me  "because respondent's claim is 

3

secured by a lien and has been fully allowed pursuant to

4

502." 

5

 So this claim, too, is secured by a lien and 

6

has been fully allowed pursuant to 502.  It seems to 

7

come within this statement of the holding.  And I guess 

8

the question is, you know, how  how is it that we can 

9

say that this is a sensical distinction at all given 

10
11

that holding? 
 MR. BIBAS: 

Two ways.  Let me focus on that 

12

sentence and then things elsewhere in the opinion and 

13

then Nobelman. 

14

 That sentence was careful, unusually 

15

careful, to phrase the holding in terms of the 

16

particular parties.  That respondent had value in the 

17

mortgage.  That's why the Court said respondent's claim, 

18

not claims in general.  Then it used the verb "stripped 

19

down."  That's bankruptcy jargon for a partially secured 

20

mortgage and reducing the amount, scaling down the 

21

indebtedness, the court said two days later. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I hear you, but it 

23

seems as though it's the second half of the sentence 

24

that is key here.  Why are we doing this?  Why are we 

25

holding this?  Because the claim is secured by a lien 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and because the claim has been fully allowed.  And both 

2

of those things also apply here. 

3

 MR. BIBAS: 

Respondent's claim also had some

4

value that made it unquestionable that it was still 

5

secured.  But you're  you're correct.  I think, 

6

though, that the use of the verb "stripped down" and the 

7

use of the respondent particular limits to that 

8

situation. 

9

 It's very important, though, to go back 

10

three sentences before that to see what the court 

11

hedged.  The court specifically reserved hypothetical 

12

applications advanced at oral argument.  Petitioner 

13

advanced two hypotheticals at oral argument.  One of 

14

those was of the completely underwater junior mortgage. 

15

The court said that those hypotheticals illustrate the 

16

difficulty of the broad creditors in government's rule, 

17

the same rule that Ms. Spinelli says that the court 

18

embraces.  The same rule she quoted during her argument 

19

as if it were the court's holding, about, well, there's 

20

some collateral, therefore, it's secured. 

21

 The court declined to rule on all possible 

22

fact situations, in light of that hypothetical, and it 

23

said we, therefore, focus on the case before us and 

24

allow other facts to await their legal resolution. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why haven't you argued 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that we should overrule Dewsnup?  Is it because of 

2

reliance, because you think that there has been a great 

3

deal of reliance on Dewsnup as applied to a partially

4

underwater mortgage, but not reliance as applied to 

5

totally underwater? 

6

 MR. BIBAS: 

Your Honor, it's quite right 

7

that those are two different categories.  It's not our 

8

burden to take on steri decisis because we win under 

9

Dewsnup.  Either way, the Court can do what it wants, 

10

but we have not advocated it.  We've been faithful to 

11

Dewsnup's holding and its reasoning, including the 

12

express limitations it put on its reasoning.  Its 

13

reasoning was limited to a case with some value. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the law would be much 

15

more coherent if either Dewsnup applies to the totally 

16

underwater as well as partially underwater, or Dewsnup 

17

is overruled. 

18

 MR. BIBAS: 

I don't believe that's the 

19

case  in terms of  while the Court could consider 

20

overruling Dewsnup, we haven't advocated for that. 

21

Because even  our reading of the statute is still more 

22

faithful to the text than Petitioner's. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

I guess 
I mean, you're giving 

the same  exactly the same phrase in the statute two 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different meanings, depending on whether one's 

2

underwater or not, completely or partially. 

3

 MR. BIBAS: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5
6
7
8
9

No, Your Honor.
Where do you find that 

distinction in 506? 
 MR. BIBAS: 

Okay.  Section 506(a) defines 

what an allowed secured claim is. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.  But that's the 

argument that Justice Scalia made that was rejected. 

10

You're giving the same phrase two different meanings. 

11

 How do you apply the meaning in Dewsnup to 

12
13

this case? 
 MR. BIBAS: 

On  on 506(d).  Dewsnup was 

14

interpreting a claim that was a  it was a hybrid.  It 

15

was  it had a secured claim component and an unsecured 

16

claim component.  The secured claim component had some 

17

value.  That value was sufficient under 506(a) that 

18

there was a partial partial secured claim. 

19

 Dewsnup must be read in light of Nobelman a 

20

year later.  Nobelman said there's a secured  it's a 

21

Chapter 13 case, but it interprets 506 which applies 

22

across the code.  Nobelman said there's a secured claim 

23

component, there's an unsecured claim component.  The 

24

creditors in Nobelman advanced the same argument, the 

25

same argument that my adversary advances, which is 506 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is just about priority and distribution.  That it has 

2

nothing to do with lien voiding, Dewsnup resolved this 

3

issue, every claim that is secured by a lien is secured

4

by a 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But Nobelman was not 

6

about 506.  It was about 1322.  And 1322 talks about the 

7

bankruptcy court's power to modify the rights of any 

8

creditor, whether it's secured or unsecured.  That's how 

9

it's been read by the courts. 

10

 MR. BIBAS: 

Yes.  But 1322's operative 

11

phrase is "modifying the rights of holders of secured 

12

claims."  In order to be a holder of secured claim, one 

13

must have a secured claim.  And so in Nobelman, this 

14

Court stressed petitioners were correct in looking to 

15

Section 506(a) for a judicial valuation of the 

16

collateral to determine the status of the bank's secured 

17

claim, whether there was a secured claim or not.  There 

18

was a secured claim component, and so the Court said the 

19

bank is still the holder of a secured claim because 

20

Petitioner's home retains $23,500 of collateral. 

21

 So the issue in Nobelman, as in Dewsnup, 

22

was, okay, we have a secured claim component under Rumph 

23

here  we have an unsecured claim component.  Do we 

24

split the baby?  Do we chop them in half?  And Nobelman 

25

said, no, in part, because it's a difficult thing to 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to change the amortization, the loan term, the payments, 

2

et cetera.  There is some value here that supports this. 

3

So we're going to leave it as indivisible hold.  This

4

Court could easily understand allowed secured claim in 

5

506(d) if it wished to preserve Dewsnup's holding just 

6

as a binary term.  If there's some 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you can do that, 

8

linguistically, I can see a difference.  The part that 

9

I'm having a hard time with is if this earlier case 

10

survives.  Let's imagine a commercial loan.  And I put 

11

it in a commercial context, because the numbers  a 

12

mortgage  a lender lends $5 million  the senior 

13

lender  to a commercial building, which then goes into 

14

the Chapter 7.  The junior lender lends 2 million, so 

15

now he has 7 million.  The property ends up being worth 

16

a million.  So the senior lender under Dewsnup comes in 

17

and says, okay, I have a secured interest for a million, 

18

but I can keep the  the mortgage here for 4 million, 

19

you know, in case things change ten years from now. 

20

Isn't that under Dewsnup?  The senior guy can, that's 

21

partly 

22
23
24
25

 MR. BIBAS: 

Well, in the corporate 

bankruptcy, this doesn't apply 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  Then I'll say  I 

just want some numbers.  The senior  the senior person 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

says  put it on whatever you want.  The senior person 

2

says, oh, I get to keep my $4 million mortgage.  Maybe 

3

things will change, you know, and eventually I may be

4

able to collect some.  Right?  That's Dewsnup. 

5

 MR. BIBAS: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7

 MR. BIBAS: 

Except 
Except what? 
The  the difficulty there 

8

so you're saying that there's a completely unsecured 

9

second mortgage that the individual 

10
11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
example yet. 

12

 MR. BIBAS: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

All right. 
I just want to know if I'm 

right so far. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

No.  No.  I haven't made my 

There's  there's one 

mortgage.  It's $5 million.  The property is worth one. 

18

 MR. BIBAS: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
And so what happens to 

20

to bank X is he gets maybe, as a secured creditor, the 

21

million, if he wants, but if he doesn't want to collect 

22

it now, he doesn't have to, and he keeps $5 million.  He 

23

keeps that mortgage going as long as he wants. 

24

 MR. BIBAS: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
Yes.  Okay.  So junior 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comes in, and junior says, hey, he got to keep 4 million 

2

just in case.  I have my mortgage for two.  Why can't I? 

3

Now  now, I can  I can think of some words here that

4

might say, well, there's the difference, is what you are 

5

pointing to.  I just want to know, in terms of 

6

commercial practice or anything else, what's the answer 

7

to his point?  He got to keep four on the hope it will 

8

go up eventually.  Why can't I keep my two?  My 

9

documents are just as good as his.  My mortgage is just 

10
11

as good as his.  I mean, why can't I? 
 MR. BIBAS: 

So there is a functional answer, 

12

and a historical answer.  I take it you're interested 

13

more in the functional answer. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15

 MR. BIBAS: 

Yes. 
I'll start there.  There is a 

16

big difference between a single creditor, single debtor 

17

situation.  In Dewsnup, the debtor was just trying to 

18

stop a foreclosure, so the debtor could get a better 

19

deal.  Here we have a multicreditor situation.  The 

20

creditor  this junior creditor is seeking a better 

21

outcome than it would get in state law foreclosure. 

22

 That better outcome comes in part from hold 

23

up or hostage value that can limit the ability of the 

24

senior lender and the property holder to negotiate a 

25

loan modification, a work out, that makes everybody 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

better off, makes assets more freely transferable, and 

2

improves the  the market.  And that does come at the 

3

price of a junior lender, but that's what happens in a

4

cram down as well.  In a cram down, junior interests are 

5

squeezed out so that the senior people can  can 

6

maximize the value of the assets and deal with them 

7

freely. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why can't you say the same 

thing about only one lender?  He doesn't have to keep 

10

that four, you know.  He could say, give me 30 cents 

11

extra.  I will foreclose today, and  and there you 

12

are, free, never having this hanging over your head. 

13

And I'll do it for an extra 30 cents, you find it.  Now, 

14

that's called  the same thing you say  it's 

15

called  what did you call it?  Whatever it is.  You 

16

see, people with mortgages can do that. 

17

 MR. BIBAS: 

18

multicreditor 

19

Right.  But there's not the same 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No.  There is one rather 

20

than two, and maybe two would be better than three, or 

21

three would be better than four. 

22

 MR. BIBAS: 

Since you are asking 

23

specifically in functional terms  and I will get to 

24

the bankruptcy history later  it's  there is a 

25

coordination problem when  a coordination problem can 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be a game of chicken.  Each of them holding out for more 

2

money and then people  two people can drive over a 

3

cliff in a game of chicken.

4

 Now, on to the bankruptcy history. 

Why is 

5

this relevant to the law?  There's a steady trajectory 

6

in bankruptcy law of increasing lien voiding power. 

7

Under  in 1934, section 77(b) authorized lien voiding 

8

in business or organizations.  In 1938, the Chandler 

9

Act, Chapter 12, extended that to individual 

10

organizations.  In 1952, the amendments broadened it. 

11

They rejected the absolute priority rule for individual 

12

debtors, so the debtor can hang on to the assets, and 

13

the liens can still be voided. 

14

 Then in 1978, the modern code enacted 

15

Section 506, which applies across the code, Chapter 7, 

16

11, 12, and 13.  So this is part of an increasing 

17

recognition over time that it's necessary to solve these 

18

hold up problems.  And the ­ the realistic alternative 

19

my  my friend, Ms. Spinelli, in her reply brief says, 

20

well, if we hang on to this lien, ten years from now, 

21

first, we will keep getting paid down, and then our 

22

second will come into the money.  Right? 

23

 Well, that is not realistically what happens 

24

in these cases.  In borderline cases, 105, 110 percent 

25

of loantovalue, people stay in the houses.  They keep 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

paying.  It's too much cost to pick up the kids and move 

2

to a different home.  When you get to 130 percent of 

3

loantovalue, the median home that's underwater with a

4

second that is underwater is 135 percent loantovalue. 

5

 When you get to 150 percent of 

6

loantovalue, at those ranges, lots of people are in 

7

default.  They qualify for bankruptcy because they've 

8

lost a job, or they are ill.  They can't make the 

9

payments and pay into a black hole of negative equity. 

10

They walk away.  The home is thrown into foreclosure 

11

anyway, and the senior creditor is worse off.  And the 

12

junior doesn't care because the junior doesn't get 

13

anything either way. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Bibas, can I take you 

15

back to Justice Alito's question, which was about stare 

16

decisis, and why you haven't argued it?  Because I tell 

17

you that my sort of reaction to this case is that these 

18

distinctions that you are drawing between partially 

19

underwater and fully underwater are not terribly 

20

persuasive.  But the only thing that may be less 

21

persuasive is Dewsnup itself. 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And so the  so the 

24

question, to me, is  or at least one question is 

25

whether we should bite the bullet and overturn Dewsnup, 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and maybe you are right, that that's for us to decide. 

2

And you  but if  if you do have something relevant 

3

to say about that matter, here's your chance to say it.

4

 MR. BIBAS: 

I think it's worth  if 

5

the Court wishes to consider that, and, again, that's 

6

not been the position we've advocated, because we don't 

7

need it to win.  It's worth starting with Justice 

8

Thomas's concurring opinion in 203 North LaSalle, which 

9

pointed out the massive confusion that has been sewn in 

10

the Court's trying to grapple with this ruling, which 

11

Judge Gorsuch's ruling Woolsey that says that Dewsnup 

12

has lost every away game it's played, that it doesn't 

13

fit with the other provisions of the code.  There is a 

14

lot of confusion there. 

15

 It has almost uniform criticism in scholarly 

16

commentary.  My colleague can't point to reliance 

17

interest in the markets.  And the empirical studies 

18

discussed in the Levitin brief suggest that there isn't 

19

substantial reliance on this, in part, because you 

20

benefit from first mortgagees who manage to maximize 

21

their value by voiding some of these junior ones.  And 

22

so the reliance interest that my friend has walked away 

23

from and the uniform criticism of Dewsnup might interest 

24

this Court in considering revisiting it, but it's not 

25

necessary, because Dewsnup itself reserved the 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

completely underwater hypothetical on the face of its 

2

opinion. 

3

 It was exceptionally narrow, and the lawyers

4

could read and see that it declined to reach this issue. 

5

And I  I do think that it is very important to  to 

6

read Dewsnup together with Nobelman, that Dewsnup doesn't 

7

stand on it's own, that Nobelman  it's true.  It was 

8

under 1322(b)(2).  It was a Chapter 13 case, but it was 

9

fundamentally about interpreting 506(a).  Is it just a 

10
11

distribution provision, as my client argued 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.  What  what 

12

the Court said  I don't understand that argument.  It 

13

said there's  yes, you  you divide it up to secured 

14

and unsecured, but you treat it all the same. 

15

 MR. BIBAS: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

 MR. BIBAS: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19
20

Yes. 
That's what it said. 

You treat it all the same 
Exactly.  For 

purposes 
 MR. BIBAS: 

You decline to cut it into 

21

pieces, and one of the reasons that you decline to cut 

22

it into pieces is because the claim secured by a lien 

23

encompasses both secured 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So once  once 

the Court has the power, what it was saying under 1322, 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to modify that, then the Court could change both the 

2

secured or  and I'm  the whole lien is what it was 

3

talking about.

4

 MR. BIBAS: 

But the last part of the opinion 

5

pointed out that if you modify the unsecured portion you 

6

have a ripple effects upon the secured portion.  You 

7

wind up changing things like the  the interest rate or 

8

the amortization or the fees.  And so you might be 

9

viewed as  as sabotaging or undermining what deserves 

10

to remain a secured component.  In this situation, there 

11

is no  no such problem. 

12

 So all  it is worth noting, by the way, my 

13

friend also says, well, this lien, it can sit out there, 

14

maybe it retains value sometime in the future; isn't 

15

that enough value.  And I think Justice Breyer was 

16

gesturing towards that.  All eight circuits after 

17

Nobelman have understood that Nobelman drew a line 

18

between some value and no value.  All eight circuits 

19

that confront lien voiding in Chapter 13 allow it 

20

because they recognize that the completely underwater 

21

junior qualifies as no value within the meaning of the 

22

code. 

23

 Present economic value is what this Court's 

24

cases have consistently focused on.  The value of the 

25

claim is equal to the value of the collateral, this 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court has said, and that's the present value of the 

2

collateral.  The statute uses the present tense in 

3

Section 506, whether it is or is not.  It's not about

4

forecasting or speculating into the future.  That would 

5

be unworkable.  But judicial valuations are workable. 

6

The Bankruptcy Rules, Rule 3012 and 7001 provide for it. 

7

And there is abundant case law that shows it to be both 

8

workable and fairer to creditors than the alternative 

9

which is a foreclosure. 

10

 The judgment below should be affirmed. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 Ms. Spinelli, you have 4 minutes left. 

13
14

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

15

 MS. SPINELLI: 

16

 Just a couple of points. 

17

 Completely underwater liens are not 

Thank you. 

18

valueless.  Their value stems from the potential for 

19

appreciation in the collateral. 

20

 Indeed, a lien that's completely underwater 

21

by a dollar might have more value than a lien that is 

22

supported by a dollar of equity, depending on the 

23

potential for appreciation. 

24
25

 The value if the houses were sold today is 
simply irrelevant because the situation only arises 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where the debtor is keeping the house.  And one could 

2

have said in Dewsnup, look, the current value of the 

3

collateral is less than the amount of your loan.  It's

4

fair to give you the current value of  of the 

5

collateral. 

6

 Dewsnup held to the contrary, and that's 

7

precisely the same here.  There is no distinction that 

8

supports drawing a line at completely underwater liens, 

9

given that the secured creditor has the same 

10

nonbankruptcy right to have its lien stay with the 

11

collateral until foreclosure and payment in full and to 

12

realize any appreciation in the value of that 

13

collateral. 

14

 This  this doesn't give a junior 

15

lienholder a better deal than it would receive under 

16

State law.  It gives it the same deal it would receive 

17

under State law. 

18

 To respond to a point that I think 

19

Justice Sotomayor made, the fact that there are specific 

20

provisions in Chapters 11 and 13 that do permit 

21

stripping down liens in certain circumstances supports 

22

the Dewsnup Court's view of 506(d).  It certainly 

23

doesn't undermine it.  506(d) is not the provision that 

24

strips down liens in Chapters 11 and 13.  Rather, there 

25

are specific provisions which are in the addendum to our 

50

1

brief in Section 1325 for Chapter 13, and actually this 

2

is not in the addendum, 1129(b) for Chapter 11. 

3

 Those provisions would make no sense if

4

506(d) were itself a lienstripping provision.  And just 

5

to take one example, if one looks at Section 

6

1325(a)(5) which appears on page 6A of the blue brief, 

7

that sets out the terms under which a Chapter 13 debtor 

8

can strip down liens, and it says that with respect to 

9

each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan, the 

10

plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the 

11

lien, securing such claim until the earlier of the 

12

payment of the underlying debt determined under 

13

nonbankruptcy law or discharge. 

14

 Now, it would make no sense to permit the 

15

lender to keep its lien until payment of the full debt 

16

if the lien had already automatically been stripped down 

17

under 506(d) to the value of the collateral, and that's 

18

just one example. 

19

 We discussed some others in our briefs, 

20

including Section 722, and we also discuss in our briefs 

21

the  the textual indications in Section 506 that 

22

support the Dewsnup's Court's holding.  So  and those 

23

are all reasons why Dewsnup was correctly decided in the 

24

first instance and shouldn't be overruled. 

25

 But to respond to Justice Kagan's question,

beyond that, the rule of law simply doesn't allow this 


2


Court in the typical situation to overrule a statutory 


3


interpretation decision in a case like this where

Congress, over the past 25 years, has acquiesced in that

decision.
