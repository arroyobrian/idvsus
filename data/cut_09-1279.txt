Mr. Yang.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. YANG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals has held that FOIA's

11
12

statutory protection for personal privacy in

13

Exemption 7(C) extends beyond the privacy of individuals

14

and protects the so-called personal privacy of

15

corporations.

16

text of Exemption 7(C), FOIA's broader context, and the

17

statute's drafting history, and would lead to anomalous

18

results.

That holding is inconsistent with the

The word "personal," standing alone, refers

19
20

to individual -- an individual human being.

"Privacy,"

21

standing alone, and even more so in the context of the

22

phrase "invasion of privacy," invokes purely individual

23

concepts.

24

statutory phrase used in FOIA, "personal privacy" -- is

25

greater than the sum of its parts.

And the sum of those terms -- that is, the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

It's long been well

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

settled that corporations have no personal privacy.
JUSTICE ALITO:

2

Isn't it true that there are

3

contexts in the law in which the word "personal" is used

4

to refer to a corporation?

5

to personal jurisdiction over a corporation, couldn't

6

you?

7

MR. YANG:

For example, you could refer

There are -- the term "personal"

8

is sometimes used as a term of art, and I think personal

9

jurisdiction is one of those.

It is the modern, shorter

10

term of art for jurisdiction in personam and reflects a

11

distinction drawn still in the law between cases brought

12

in personam and cases brought in rem.

13

That -- the evolution of that term in the

14

law as a term of art does not reflect what the ordinary

15

meaning of "personal" is.

16

term "personal property," which also invokes

17

long-established traditional distinctions between

18

property that could be recovered in rem or in real

19

actions versus property that might be recovered in

20

actions in personam.

21

It's just the same as the

So -- and, in fact, I think it -- it's

22

important to note that there are -- although maybe there

23

are some instances that -- I think there's one instance

24

that AT&T cites in its brief.

25

any use of the term "personal" to mean corporate or

13

legalese.

14

Procedure Act defines a person to include a corporation,

15

why is it relevant here or dispositive here to look to

16

the ordinary usage of term "personal" as opposed to the

17

way it's -- it's used in the law?

18

sometimes used to refer to a corporation.

19

That's -- that's

But in -- but since the -- the Administrative

MR. YANG:

And in the law, it is

Well, I think that -- that point

20

actually reinforces our position, because although

21

"person" is used in certain legal contexts to refer

22

to artificial persons and corporations and the like,

23

"personal" is not.

24
25

And "personal," as we explain in our brief,
is not simply a grammatical alteration, an inflection of
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the term "person."

It has existed in its own right

2

since the late 1300s and has developed meaning that is

3

unique to the term "personal," which -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Mr. Yang, can we go back

5

first to this -- the request came in and, as I

6

understand it, the Commission said there are two

7

exemptions:

8

financial confidential information; and then there was

9

one with Exemption 7 itself but as to the employee.

The one for trade secrets, commercial,

MR. YANG:

10

Correct.

There was an additional

11

exemption, Exemption 5, which protected internal

12

government communications.

But -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

How does the -- does the

14

Commission, unaided by AT&T, go through the papers and

15

decide what would be embarrassing for an AT&T employee,

16

as distinguished from the corporation?

17

MR. YANG:

How does it do that?

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. YANG:

Yes.

Well, I -- I don't think the

20

touchstone is necessarily embarrassment.

21

government does, following this Court's decision in

22

Reporters Committee, is tries to determine whether there

23

is a personal privacy interest about individuals, and

24

that is information that pertains to particular

25

individuals.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

What the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

For instance, in this Court's decision in

2

DOD v. FLRA, the Court explained that, although an

3

agency released the name of individuals, it could

4

properly withhold the addresses, the home addresses, of

5

those individuals, even though that might be publicly

6

available in phone books, because individuals have at

7

least some small personal privacy interest in that.
So what the agency will do is try to

8
9

identify information pertaining to individuals and then

10

will conduct -- if there is certain information, will

11

try to conduct a balancing to determine whether there is

12

a public interest in disclosure, that is, whether

13

revealing this would disclose information against the

14

government.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in that instance,

16

does the corporation have standing to raise that

17

objection on the employee's behalf?

18

MR. YANG:

Well, I think the corporation to

19

the -- in a reverse FOIA case, for instance, which is

20

what we have here, where the corporation is alleging

21

that the government's decision-making process is

22

arbitrary and capricious, it has Article III standing to

23

resist the disclosure of documents.

24

standing kind of like a Fourth Amendment concept of

25

standing, I don't think that -

If you're using

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, as an administrative

2

matter, can the corporation make a FOIA objection on

3

behalf of its employees?
MR. YANG:

4

It can make an objection on its

5

own behalf, which is to say that the government has not

6

properly gone through the decision-making process by

7

not -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8
9
10

All right.

That's the

next -- that was going to be my next question:

So the

corporation can raise FOIA on its own behalf?
MR. YANG:

11

It's actually -- let me take a

12

step back.

FOIA actions are actions which seek to

13

increase the amount of documents that the government has

14

released pursuant to a FOIA request.
We have also reverse FOIA actions, which are

15
16

actions under the APA and here under the Hobbs Act's

17

review provisions, that would give the court of appeals

18

jurisdiction.

19

claim is that the agency's final agency action is

20

somehow arbitrary, capricious, and not -- or contrary to

21

law.

22

regulations which govern its processing of FOIA

23

requests.

24

that the FCC did not comply with its regulations, and,

25

therefore, its decision was arbitrary capricious because

When there's a reverse FOIA action, the

And so in this case, the FCC has certain

And AT&T's claim, as we understand it, is

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

its regulations required that it consider the personal

2

privacy interest of individuals.
And I should note that, with respect to

3
4

Exemption 6 or Exemption 7(C), the government itself

5

invokes personal privacy of individuals.

6

do when we process FOIA requests, because individuals

7

normally don't get any notice that there has been a FOIA

8

request.

9

those rights, in a sense that they're rights, asserts

That's what we

The government simply processes it and asserts

10

those interests on behalf of corporations -- on behalf

11

of individuals.
Going back to the text of the statute, the

12
13

term "privacy," and particularly an invasion of privacy,

14

invokes concepts that back to Warren and Brandeis's

15

right of privacy, the -- their article which explained

16

that or identified in the law certain human dignitary

17

interests that they gave the label "privacy."
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

Well, privacy

19

certainly isn't as limited as you argue "person,"

20

"personal," is.

21

They have private documents.

22

applies in the corporate context as it does in the

23

individual.

24
25

Corporations have private property.

MR. YANG:

The concept certainly

I think the term "privacy," its

ordinary meaning, not the only meaning but the ordinary
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and the commonly used meaning, does invoke individual

2

concepts.

3

issue, normally the more appropriate word would be

4

"confidentiality" or "secrecy."

When corporations or other entities are at

Those concepts -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't have

6

confidential property or secret property.

7

private property.
MR. YANG:

8
9

privacy.

Well, true.

You have

But it's is not

When we're talking about the right of privacy,

10

those -- that word we think -- again going back to

11

Warren and Brandeis and up through the fifties and

12

sixties when Prosser was elaborating the law of torts in

13

his groundbreaking article on privacy, those concepts

14

apply only to individuals, and particularly when you

15

combine the terms.
I mean, the Restatement makes clear, and

16
17

back to Prosser it was clear, that corporations have no

18

right of personal privacy.

19

enacting Exemption 7(C), there would have been no basis

20

for it to conclude that the rights that it was

21

conferring through the phrase "personal privacy" would

22

confer rights not -- beyond individuals, to

23

corporations, and by necessarily implication, if AT&T is

24

correct, foreign governments, State governments, local

25

governments.

So when Congress in 1974 was

There's no predicate for those types of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

entities having personal privacy in the law.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Yang -
Our cases assert, do they

4

not, that the exceptions to FOIA should be narrowly

5

construed?

6

MR. YANG:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

There are cases -
And we've said that on a

number of cases.
MR. YANG:

9

In certain contexts, this Court

10

has indicated that exceptions are to be narrowly

11

construed.

12

cases and other cases of this Court explain that FOIA's

13

exemptions are to be given meaningful reach, because

14

what Congress was trying to do in FOIA -- and this is

15

somewhat against our interest in this case, and we

16

explain it more fully in our brief in Milner, which is

17

currently pending to the Court -- what Congress was

18

trying to do in FOIA was to establish a general

19

principle of disclosure, but in the exemptions it

20

identified very important interests that warranted an

21

exception from those general rules.

22

construe the exception, we think, would distort rather

23

than advance congressional purpose in enacting FOIA.

24
25

We think that, when read in context, those

JUSTICE ALITO:

And to narrowly

Suppose Congress had used

the phrase "privacy of a person," "privacy of any
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

person."

Would you make the same argument?
MR. YANG:

2

Our argument would be a little

3

different, particularly in the context of Exemptions 6

4

and 7(C), where the phrase would be "an invasion of

5

privacy of any person."

6

We think, particularly when we're talking

7

about invasions of privacy, even though a corporation

8

might have a broader definitional meaning in context,

9

Congress in that case would still, we think, be

10

referring to individuals.

But, of course, that's not

11

this case.

That would make it a little bit more

12

difficult.

We think we would probably still prevail on

13

that reading.

But -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14
15

Act?

16

human individuals -

The Privacy Act undoubtedly concerns individuals,

17

MR. YANG:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

What about the Privacy

Correct.
-- not artificial beings.

But it uses the words "individual privacy" -
MR. YANG:

20

Well, it actually uses both

21

phrases.

It uses, as we explain in our brief, the

22

phrase "personal privacy" to explain that that's what

23

the Act was protecting.

24

portions of the Act, it uses "individual," but it does

25

so for a very specific reason.

And then within the operative

Congress was intending

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to protect a subset of individuals, and it defined the

2

term "individual" to mean U.S. citizens and lawful

3

permanent residents.
So not all individuals would be protected by

4
5

the Privacy Act.

Now, Congress did that, not because

6

had it used the phrase "personal privacy" it would have

7

been extending rights to corporations and foreign

8

governments, but because personal privacy would have

9

been too broad in that it would have -- even though it

10

would have been limited to individuals, it would have

11

included a set of individuals that Congress wanted to

12

exclude, that is, everybody who is not a U.S. citizen or

13

lawful permanent resident.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

Can I ask you a

15

question?

16

Justice Scalia.

17

given two meanings, and it's not clear -- and I know

18

you're challenging the clarity question here -- I

19

thought that Congress's intent to have full disclosure

20

would necessarily mean that where there's ambiguity as

21

to the meaning of an exception, then we should change

22

the narrowest meaning.

23

I'm not sure I understood your response to
If there is ambiguity, if a term can be

MR. YANG:

Well, I think we disagree, and I

24

think this is why:

No legislation pursues its primary

25

goal at all costs, and the FOIA exceptions that are at
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue here protect very important values that Congress

2

deemed to warrant exceptions from the rule.

3

the Court were to put a thumb on one scale of that

4

balance that Congress has tried to strike, after using

5

all the normal tools of construction, we think that

6

would distort rather than advance the intent of

7

Congress.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

We're not putting a thumb on the scale.

And so if

I don't understand that.
Taking account

10

of the fact that -- that Congress has many objectives in

11

any legislation and that the limitations are as

12

important as the -- the substantive end, nonetheless,

13

when, having applied all of that, you end up with, gee,

14

I don't know, it's ambiguous -- you say, even in that

15

situation, we don't apply the rule that -
MR. YANG:

16

Well, if you were to -- after

17

using all the normal tools that the Court does and

18

you're -

19
20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:
ambiguity means.

Well, but that's what

It does -- it means -

MR. YANG:

That's usually a very rare

22

instance, that you're exactly at equipoise.

23

we certainly aren't relying on narrow construction in

24

this case, Justice Scalia.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

14
Alderson Reporting Company

And -- and

The Government wants

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to abandon the principle that we've set forth in our

2

cases -

3

MR. YANG:

Well, we think -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

are to be narrowly construed.

6

support that.

7

MR. YANG:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

-- that exceptions to FOIA
The Government does not

We do not embrace that principle.
Mr. Yang -
Even though we did?

I

mean -
MR. YANG:

Well, we think that those

12

cases -- there are -- there are two lines of this

13

Court's decisions.

14

exceptions are narrowly construed, and sometimes the

15

Court explained that its decision has given -- its

16

decisions have given the exceptions practical reach in

17

order to strike the appropriate balance that Congress

18

has tried to strike in FOIA.

19

Sometimes the Court explains that

Now, let me just say, our narrow

20

construction, to the extent the Court would want to

21

reaffirm it here -- we're not advancing that -- would

22

only help the Government's position.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your argument is based on

24

a case that will come before us.

So -- but in this

25

case, it's to your interest to say, yes, that has been
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- that has been the Court's precedent, that FOIA

2

exceptions are to be narrowly construed.
MR. YANG:

3

Well, the Government has broader

4

interests beyond a single case, and we think that,

5

again, we're not embracing strict construction in this

6

case.

7

position if you were to disagree.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9
10

But, again, that would only help the Government's

the Government's position if the Government doesn't want
to be helped.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

Well, I'm not going to help

I'm happy to leave you

where you put yourself.
MR. YANG:

14

And we -- we accept that in this

15

case, and we think that the language of the text,

16

particularly when read in context in light of the

17

statutory history, and particularly when you take a look

18

at what's gone on since 1974 -- I mean, in the more than

19

35 years since, there has been uniform agreement that

20

Exemptions 6 and 7(C) apply only to individuals.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

I suppose -- I

22

suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't

23

they?

24
25

MR. YANG:

Well, in certain contexts, family

members, as this Court decided in Favish, can have a
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right to personal privacy.

2

recognized that that was a very, you know, significant

3

departure from the prior understanding that the right of

4

personal privacy in FOIA protects information about the

5

individual, him- or herself, and recognized that there

6

was another strain of personal privacy, which from

7

longstanding tradition in terms of -- within our

8

society, the Court could draw on in saying that personal

9

privacy should also protect, at least in the context

10

But the Court in Favish

of -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

So in some

12

contexts -- in some contexts, personal privacy does go

13

beyond the individual?
MR. YANG:

14
15

18

I

mean, those are individual members of the family.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16
17

No, still it is individual.

Aggregations of

individuals?
MR. YANG:

Well, no.

I think an individual

19

member of the family has a personal privacy interest by

20

virtue of the relationship to the decedent in Favish.

21
22
23

Let me go back.

Just -- I think I would be

remiss if I didn't remark upon this Court's decision -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

To go back to

24

the Chief's question, you do not deny that the

25

individuals who form the corporation, the officers and
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the employees, are protected by the right of personal

2

privacy, and, indeed, you will -- you will edit any FOIA

3

responses to protect those individuals, even though

4

there are many of them, right?

5

MR. YANG:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7
8
9
10

Correct.

If there were -

But as individuals, not as

-- not as the corporation.
MR. YANG:

As individuals, because the

information pertains to them.
Now, going to the American Express case,

11

which we explain in our reply, I think that is fatal to

12

the proposition that -- the proposition of AT&T that

13

there's a grammatical imperative that adjectives take

14

the meaning of a related noun.

15

In American Express, the Court construed the

16

Truth in Lending Act, which includes the definition of

17

"person" to include, for instance, corporations.

18

then went on to construe a term, "consumer," which

19

concerns transactions primarily for personal, family,

20

household, or, at the time, agricultural purposes.

21

Court explained that a transaction -- the transaction

22

that was conducted for a corporation's business

23

purposes, that it could not -- there was -- "it did not

24

fall within any of the purposes specified" -- that was a

25

quote -- in the definition of "consumer."
18
Alderson Reporting Company

It

The

That is, it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did not concern personal purposes.

2

fatal.

We think that's

The Court, in fact, said it was the only

3
4

possible conclusion and that there was no other possible

5

interpretation of the statutory phrase, after repeating

6

the enumeration of those four factors three times and

7

then on the very next page saying corporate -- a

8

transaction for corporate business purposes could not

9

be fit within that definition.
Finally, I'd like to remark upon the

10
11

anomalies that this Court would set us forth upon if it

12

were to decide that corporations have personal privacy.
At least in the context of individuals,

13
14

there's an established body of law and societal

15

understanding of what a person, an individual, might

16

have a personal privacy interest in.

17

personal to include corporations, foreign governments,

18

State governments, local governments, defining what

19

would be personal privacy of those institutions would

20

require an extraordinary exercise, a simple policy

21

judgment on the part of the agencies first and then the

22

Court.

23

But if we expand

And this Court in Favish was careful to

24

explain that that type of decision making would be

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Counsel, if an

11

individual has been -- individual human being has been

12

investigated by the FBI and a FOIA request is made for

13

records related to that investigation, would the name of

14

the individual not be turned over?
MR. YANG:

15
16

Well, if someone is asking for an

investigation of Tony Yang -

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. YANG:

Yes.

-- our -- I don't -- I can't say

19

definitively, but I think I can probably answer that

20

that even -- even answering the question of whether

21

there is a responsive record answers the question.

22

I -

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

Well, that's the point.

24

So really your adversary is saying that the same harm

25

that occurs to an individual -- putting aside the
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difficulty of defining privacy more broadly, but the

2

same harm that occurs to an individual who is disclosed

3

to have been the target of an investigation is an

4

identical privacy right of a corporation, that a

5

corporation has the same negative effects as the

6

individual.

7

MR. YANG:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

I think -

concede that privacy might need to be defined

10

differently for corporations.

11

this privacy interest is not.

12

So I think they would

MR. YANG:

They're simply saying

Well, the key point is that we

13

don't deny that corporations have some interest in

14

confidentiality that exists out there.

15

AT&T has relied upon the common law of defamation where

16

a corporation's business interests, business reputation,

17

is implicated.

18

But even -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

pled guilty already.

20

exponentially more damaging -

21

For instance,

MR. YANG:

Well, parts of -- they

So it is hard to imagine how much

Well, to be fair to AT&T, there

22

was a settlement agreement in which they did not admit

23

any wrongdoing.

24
25

So -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
some sort of investigation.

But that presupposes

So that's public knowledge

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

already.
MR. YANG:

2

That is public knowledge.

But I

3

think the key point is that the corporate -- a

4

corporation's interests in maintaining its business

5

reputation has been not regarded as a personal privacy

6

interest.

7

protects those interests, for instance, interests in

8

confidential commercial or financial information under

9

Exemption 4.

It's true that they have interests, and FOIA

10

And so what really the -- we come back to

11

the key point, which is when Congress used the phrase

12

"personal privacy," it would have had no reason in 1974,

13

or even now, to think that term would have referred to

14

corporations.

15

interests and other rights that might be legitimate is

16

kind of beside the point because those interests are not

17

referred to in the law or otherwise as personal privacy

interests.

The fact that corporations have other

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEOFFREY M. KLINEBERG

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. KLINEBERG:

Thank you,

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether any

2
3

organization, including not only business corporations

4

like AT&T but also nonprofit organizations and political

5

associations, should be categorically excluded from

6

protection under Exemption 7(C), such that this

7

exemption will now offer less protection for privacy

8

interests than the Constitution and the common law.
This Court has consistently held that the

9
10

privacy protections under FOIA are broader.

11

text supports that position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

And the

Do you include in this

13

the people, the persons that you say are shielded by

14

this privacy exemption, as Mr. Yang said, foreign

15

governments, State and local governments?

16

all -- those all fall under the APA definition of

17

person.

18

MR. KLINEBERG:

Those have

Justice Ginsburg, they do.

19

And we would agree that, as a matter of statutory

20

construction, the concept of personal privacy does apply

21

to those -- those other categories of actors.

22

whether once that privacy interest is balanced against

23

the public's interest in disclosure, that balance may

24

well be different with respect to public or foreign

25

entities, but -- but certainly they -- they have a right
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to personal privacy under the terms of the statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

Can you give us an idea

3

of -- the corporation has been shielded by Exemption 4

4

for its confidential financial information, trade

5

secrets; and its employees have been protected under

6

Exemption 7.
What is it, what would be -- would fall

7
8

within this privacy exception that would not be

9

confidential business information or relate to employees

10

of the corporation?
MR. KLINEBERG:

11

Justice Ginsburg, we -- I

12

could give you two categories or kinds of examples.

13

is, for example, a series of e-mails among corporate

14

officers -- granted, whose own personal names and

15

identifying information have been redacted, but in those

16

e-mails, they may engage in a frank exchange about the

17

competence and intelligence of a would-be regulator of

18

the corporation or a -- disparaging comments about

19

potential -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

One

Why does that

21

relate to their privacy?

22

does that relate to the corporation's privacy interest?

23

Anything that would embarrass the corporation is -- is a

24

privacy interest?

25

I don't understand that.

MR. KLINEBERG:

Why

Well, Justice Scalia, the -

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the answer is simply that these were communications,

2

conversations, that were occurring with an expectation

3

of privacy by the individuals involved on behalf of

4

their employer, and to the extent that they could be

5

used to harm the reputation or the customer goodwill of

6

-- of the company, they do, indeed, have a -- a personal

7

privacy interest in -

8
9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Anything that hurts the -

the -- the image or the goodwill of the company?
MR. KLINEBERG:

Your Honor, everything that

11

with -- that is intended to be private is certainly

12

subject to the balancing that we're asking for under

13

Exemption 7(C); indeed, that Congress provided, that if

14

it's -- it's an interest in personal privacy, then it is

15

to be balanced to determine whether the disclosure of

16

that document is unwarranted.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Klineberg, can you give

18

me any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot

19

about the adjective "personal."

20

just about the adjective "personal."

21

phrase "personal privacy"?

22

But we're not talking
What about the

"Personal," yes, can indeed apply to

23

corporations sometimes, but there are certain phrases

24

where it clearly does not.

25

personal characteristics.

For example, you talk about

2

personal qualities.

You talk about

It doesn't mean the qualities of

You talk about a point of personal

It's not a privilege of a corporation.
And I think personal privacy is the same

5
6

thing.

Can you give me any examples in common usage

7

where people would refer to the personal privacy of a -

8

of a corporation?

It's a very strange phrase to me.

MR. KLINEBERG:

9

Well, Your Honor, as

10

Justice Alito asked my -- my colleague earlier, the -

11

the whole concept of -- of "person" as including a

12

corporation would surprise many people, the proverbial

13

person on the street.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Yes.

I'm not talking about

15

that.

I'll grant you that -- that "personal" could

16

sometimes refer to a corporation, although the

17

Government distinguishes it by etymology and so forth.

18

Never mind that.

19

Do you have any examples from the New York Times, from,

20

you know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to

21

the interests of a corporation as the "personal privacy"

22

of General Motors?
I cannot imagine somebody using the phrase

23
24
25

I'm talking about personal privacy.

like that.
MR. KLINEBERG:

Your Honor, we're not aware

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of that phrase being used certainly in any statutory

2

context -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

But you were about to

4

give a second example of where, even though it hasn't -

5

personal privacy hasn't been used in -- but you said one

6

example is the two officials who are saying unpleasant

7

things about a regulator.

8

example?

9

And what was your other

MR. KLINEBERG:

Well, there's a -- there's a

10

sub-example within that category which is the

11

disparaging of an important customer, some unpleasant

12

comments about an important customer of the corporation

13

that could then be used quite -- quite clearly by a -

14

by a competitor to -- to harm the goodwill of the -- of

15

the corporation with respect to that customer.

16

But there is indeed another whole category

17

of documents that goes beyond the -- the context of

18

AT&T's interest here, and the example is internal

19

documents within, say, an environmental nonprofit

20

organization talking about their political strategies

21

for defeating an amendment to the Clean Air Act.

22

As an example, those political strategies

23

that were shared internally by -- by members of the

24

organization without any intent to -- to have them

25

become public would become subject to -- to automatic
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disclosures, categorical disclosure, were the Government

2

to prevail in this case.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think it's -

4

how does that work?

5

environmental organization says something about whatever

6

it is -- we can lobby this guy to get this change -- is

7

he able to protect that on the grounds of his personal

8

privacy, even though the embarrassment would go to the

9

-- the organization as a whole?

10

If you have -- the president of the

MR. KLINEBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe

11

the answer is in most cases "yes," that in -- that the

12

identity of the -- the specific speaker and any

13

identifying information corresponding to him or her

14

would be protected.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why is it such

16

a big deal, then, to extend that to the organization as

17

a whole, if the individual's privacy is already going to

18

be protected?

19

MR. KLINEBERG:

Indeed, Your Honor, I think

20

that is -- that is our position, that -- that the

21

personal privacy of the corporation is -- is affected by

22

such disclosure.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

I mean

24

you're -- you're already protected, at least to a

25

significant extent, because the individual officers
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be able to assert a privacy interest, to the

2

extent at least that what you find embarrassing to -- to

3

the corporation is also individually embarrassing to

4

them.
MR. KLINEBERG:

5

Right.

But the -- but the

6

redactions that would occur would in all likelihood

7

simply be redactions of their names and perhaps their

8

titles, but their -- the substance of their comments

9

would certainly be -- would be disclosed under the

10

Government's view.
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Are there any examples that

12

you have?

13

any instance where the Justice Department or some other

14

law enforcement agency compiled a file for law

15

enforcement purposes, that in that file there were, for

16

whatever reasons, a bunch of conversations about the

17

organization's strategy, and it did not interfere to

18

release it with -- with anybody's personal privacy, but

19

it might interfere with that organization's strategy,

20

and so the organization, whatever it was, the NRDC or

21

something, was very upset about it?
Did you find a single example or a thousand

22
23

examples?

24

happening?

25

That is, in the last 35 years, has there been

Or how many examples did you find of that

MR. KLINEBERG:

Well, Justice Breyer, one of

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the -- one of the things that has puzzled us in this

2

case is why -- why it has taken 35 years -
JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Well, one reason might be

4

that this has really never been a problem because all

5

the legitimate -- or most of them, anyway -- that these

6

organizations that have interests in privacy are

7

actually taken care of by the other 17 exemptions here.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9
10

Another reason might be

that personal -- nobody ever thought that personal
privacy would cover this.
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

This may be the first one.

12

That's why I want to know, is there -- one of the things

13

you would have looked for is an example of a real

14

problem of the kind you're talking about.

15

saying you don't have one.

16

you found any, and what they are, so I could read them.
MR. KLINEBERG:

17

I'm not

I would just like to know if

Your Honor, we haven't found

18

anything specific to the -- in response to your

19

question.

20

But I -- I will say that one of the

21

explanations for why this issue has become more

22

important today than maybe it has been in recent past -

23

there really are three reasons.

24

4, which Mr. Yang discussed, has been increasingly

25

narrowed by the courts of appeals to the point where

One is that Exemption

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they specifically say, and, indeed, the Government

2

concedes, that -- that the reputational concerns and the

3

harm to customer goodwill is not the sort of harm that

4

Exemption 4 guards against.
And so that has become increasingly clear

5
6

among the courts of appeals, that the interests in

7

confidentiality that we're talking about under exception

8

7(C) are not -
JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I mean, one possible reason

10

you don't find them is because it's very rare that a law

11

enforcement agency is going to try to subpoena the top

12

strategy of the -- of the NRDC, confidential strategy.

13

There might not be too many such records.
It -- another reason might be is that they

14
15

don't really care.

16

know.

Another reason might be -- I don't

But if you haven't found any examples, what

17
18

we're back to -- or -- and maybe there are actual

19

examples of that -- of what you said to Justice Ginsburg

20

of the other instance, where the -- what was that first

21

one?

22

MR. KLINEBERG:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

example.

Right.
I'd like to know about the

What was the first one again?
MR. KLINEBERG:

Well, the -- the first one

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was comments -- comments about a regulator or -
JUSTICE BREYER:

2

They're worried about

3

saying something mean about a regulator.

4

fine.

5

one, and what's the empirical state?

Are there examples of that?

Okay.

Yes,

Is this the first

6

MR. KLINEBERG:

Your Honor, it's a -- I

7

cannot point you to specific examples.

8

they're sort of hard to -- hard to find in the -- in the

9

sense that they are -- that they're not typically

They're -

10

litigated, and they certainly haven't been litigated

11

under -- under this -- under this exemption before.
But -- but I think the other explanation for

12
13

why this matters today in a way that it might not have

14

mattered so much before, two -- two other reasons:

15

is that -- that increasingly, FOIA is being used by -

16

by competitors and legal adversaries to obtain

17

information, not about what the government is doing, not

18

about what the government is up to, but about what

19

evidence the government might have gathered from private

20

parties.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

One

Is that a reason to

22

change what was the understanding of Exemption 7?

23

of the items that doesn't work in your favor was the

24

Attorney General's memorandum at the time of the '74

25

amendments.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

One

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KLINEBERG:

Well, actually, Justice

2

Ginsburg, at the time of the '74 amendments the only

3

existing Attorney General memorandum was that of

4

Attorney General Clark, which read "personal privacy" -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5
6

I'm talking about the --

Attorney General Levi.
MR. KLINEBERG:

7

Right, and that -- that was

8

issued subsequent to the amendments in 1974, and that

9

was an -- an interpretive gloss on the recent

10

amendments.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. KLINEBERG:

Yes, that's what I meant.

Right.

And so at the time

13

that Congress enacted the amendments, both under the

14

Privacy Act as well as Exemption 7(C), the -- the only

15

existing statement about what personal privacy might

16

mean would be -- would have been Attorney General

17

Clark's understanding that personal privacy can in fact

18

incorporate interests of corporations.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if Attorney General

20

Levi's description, which was -- which was issued for

21

the purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal

22

Government what this new statute meant -- and it had a

23

lot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about -

24

about this subject, you'd have thought somebody would

have objected.

1

I mean, did some members of Congress who -

2

who had passed FOIA say this is outrageous; what about

3

the personal privacy of General Motors?

4

of any objections along those lines.
MR. KLINEBERG:

5

I'm not aware

Well, Your Honor, the --

6

Attorney General Levi's memorandum did not go into a

7

long discussion or description of the -- of the

8

analysis.

9

seem to apply to -- to corporations.

It simply said it does not appear or does not
And it's

10

absolutely true.

11

hasn't -- hasn't really been litigated and presented.

12

There -- this is not -- this issue

But our position is that there is nothing in

13

the plain language that would indicate that Congress

14

intended to categorically exclude corporations.

15

certainly true that the legislative history at the time,

16

as the Government spends quite a bit of time exploring,

17

does suggest that what was -- what was in most people's

18

minds was protection of individual privacy.

19

is no indication that they intended to exclude -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is

But there

Is it the burden of the

21

Government to show that they intended to exclude

22

corporations, or is it your burden to show that this

23

exception was meant to include corporations?

24

think the latter is where the burden lies in this case.

25

MR. KLINEBERG:

I would

Well, Justice Scalia, our -

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

our burden is to -- is to defend our view of the

2

statute.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Well, but if you're asking

4

the Government to show that the -- there was an intent

5

to exclude corporations, I don't think that's their

6

burden.

7

exemption was intended to include corporations.

I think it's your burden to show that this

MR. KLINEBERG:

8

I agree, Your Honor, that we

9

are -- our burden is to demonstrate to you why the words

10

"personal privacy" in the statute apply to corporations.

11

I think one of the background facts is that there is no

12

indication that anyone thought that it was not to be

13

included.

But let me -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Counsel, your

15

central argument is that because "person" is defined to

16

include corporation, "personal" in the same statute must

17

include corporate.
I tried to sit down and come up with other

18
19

examples where the adjective was very different from the

20

root noun.

21

have "craft" and "crafty."

22

doesn't have much to do with "craft."

23

"squirrelly."

And it turns out it's not hard at all.
Totally different.

You

"Crafty"

"Squirrel,"

Right?

24

(Laughter.)

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
35
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, "pastor" -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you have a "pastor" and "pastoral."

2

different.

3

Same root, totally

So I don't understand -- I don't think

4

there's much to the argument that because "person" means

5

one thing, "personal" has to be the same relation.

6

MR. KLINEBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me

7

try to explain precisely what our proposed rule of

8

construction is, because I think there's been some

9

confusion, and I -- and I think the Government has -

10

has not properly characterized it, and certainly in

11

their reply brief.

12

We do not agree -- or we do not sign on to

13

the term "grammatical imperative," because our concern

14

with that phrase is that it might suggest that the rule

15

is to be applied regardless of the consequences, and

16

that is not our position.

17

Our position is that where the adjective

18

means "of or relating to" a term that Congress has

19

expressly defined, that definition should be applied, so

20

long as it makes sense to do so in light of the text and

21

structure of the statute as a whole.

22

So, in this case, Your Honor, "personal"

23

does -- is defined -- when you open up the dictionary,

24

the very first definition is "of or relating to a

25

particular person."

"Person" is, then, defined by
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress as -- to include not only individuals, but -

2

but corporations and other associations.

3
4
5

So in this particular context, it makes
perfect sense to look to -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Klineberg, you have

6

read the brief of the Project on Government Oversight,

7

where they give dozens and dozens of examples to show

8

that, overwhelmingly, "personal" is used to describe an

9

individual, not an artificial being.

10
11

And it is the

overwhelming use of "personal."
MR. KLINEBERG:

Justice Ginsburg, we do not

12

dispute that personal is often, even many, many times,

13

used to describe an individual and can only be

14

understood in that context.

15

Lending Act argument that the Government made in its

16

reply brief is a perfect example.

17

there is -- is mentioned alongside "personal," "family,"

18

and "household."

19

Indeed, the Truth in

The word "personal"

And, indeed, even in that very same

20

statutory definition of "consumer," the word is referred

21

to as "a natural person."

22

be absurd or inappropriate to -- to borrow the concept

23

of the definition of "person."

So, in that context, it would

24

All we're saying is when it is not absurd,

25

when it is not -- does not do violence to the statute,
37
Alderson Reporting Company

1

under those circumstances, it makes perfect sense to

2

borrow the definition that Congress provided.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would be similar to

4

medical files and such, under Exemption 6, that uses the

5

same phrase, "unwanted invasion on personal privacy"?

would we create or even make sense of Exemption 6?

MR. KLINEBERG:

Your Honor, we don't believe

our reading does any -- any damage to this Court's

10

jurisprudence in Exemption 6, and the -- and the simple

11

reason is that while the words "personal privacy" in

12

Exemption 6 do mean -- and we agree with the Attorney

13

General Clark in this -- do mean that -- that -- the

14

same thing as it means in Exemption 7(C), but because -

15

precisely for the reason you said, Justice Sotomayor -

16

the personnel and medical and similar files limits the

17

likely scope of that privacy interest to individual,

18

natural -- natural persons.

19

because of the words "personal privacy," but because of

20

the company that those words keep in that -- in that

21

particular exemption.

22

And that's simply not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

I mean, if you're

23

saying that personal privacy has some overlap with

24

individual privacy -- obviously, it has to if you're

25

going to give meaning to personal privacy -- don't we

1

have to give meaning to "and similar files"?

2

what would those be?

3

MR. KLINEBERG:

And so

Well, Your Honor, as this

4

Court said in the Washington Post case, the

5

understanding of "similar files" is defined by the two

6

benchmarks that are expressly provided, right?

7

Personnel and medical.

8

limited to the sorts of files in which individual

9

information is likely to be contained.

10
11

So the kinds of files are

In that case, it

was a passport file.
Again, our -- our argument is simply that

12

it's that part of Exemption 6 that does the limiting

13

work in terms of its scope.

14

privacy" mean the same thing in Exemption 6 as -- as

15

they do in Exemption 7(C).

The words "personal

16

The -- the other point that I -- I certainly

17

want to make clear is that our position is that personal

18

privacy is only the first step in the determination

19

whether or not a particular document is disclosed,

20

because if the Government prevails, there will be no

21

need even to articulate a public interest in the

22

disclosure of potentially harmful documents.

23

they will be automatically available to any competitor

24

or legal adversary.

25

Instead,

And all we are asking for and, indeed, all
39

1

that Congress provided for is that the privacy interest

2

be weighed against the public interest in disclosure.

3

And what the -- what the FCC did here was to

4

categorically exclude corporations from the protections

5

of Exemption 7(C).

6

those interests are legitimate and just need to be

7

balanced.

8

these circumstances are is that they need to weigh the

9

private interests in -- in the documents against the

And -- and all we are saying is that

And what the government's obligations under

10

articulated public interest in disclosure.

And that

11

interest, of course, has to do with what the government

12

is up to.

13

the government is doing?

What do these documents tell us about what

And if, as the amici on the Government's

14
15

side suggests, there are lots of public -- lots of

16

public value and public interest in the disclosure, then

17

that balance is more likely to be weighed in favor of

18

disclosure.

19

that balance take place.

20

that -- is, as I said; it's a categorical exclusion that

21

simply is inconsistent with the terms that Congress laid

22

out in exemption 7(C).

23

And all we are asking for, though, is that
And what's happened here is

Congress did not intend for FOIA to be a

24

tool for an organization's adversaries to obtain access

25

to harmful or embarrassing documents compiled for law

1

enforcement purposes where such documents do nothing to

2

open agency action to public scrutiny.

3

Government has its way in this case, the result will be

4

what this Court decried in Favish, which was that it

5

would be the failure to protect the privacy of citizens

6

against the uncontrolled release of information compiled

7

through the power of the state.
If there are no further questions, I urge

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15

MR. YANG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

16

AT&T appears to have changed or at least

17

modified its position somewhat from the position

18

articulated at page 14 of its brief.

19

says, "By expressly defining the noun 'person' to

20

include corporations, Congress necessarily defined the

21

adjective form of that noun -- 'personal' -- also to

22

include corporations."

Now, AT&T has given up on the grammatical

24

imperative that guided exclusively the court of appeals'

25

decision in this case.

There's nothing left.
