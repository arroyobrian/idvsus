ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


9
10
11

MR. ECKLAND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

This Court has held that statutes of limitations


12

involve fundamental considerations of fairness. 


13

Petitioners submit that the cases before Your Honors this


14

morning involve precisely that. 


15

In these two civil actions, petitioners seek


16

fair compensation for continuing to be bound to the


17

Section 515 housing program and continuing to house low-


18

income tenants for up to 50 years.

19

succeed in obtaining that fair compensation only if this


20

Court continues to apply the same ordinary principles of


21

law to the United States Government that it applies to


22

United States citizens. 


23

Petitioners can


The ordinary principles of law and their


24

continuing application to the United States Government


25

that are at issue here are, first, that a breach of


Page 3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

contract claim does not accrue until the date of breach;


2

that is, until the time for performance by the defendant


3

arrives and the defendant fails to perform.

QUESTION:

4

Mr. Eckland, you -- you began by


5

saying you're seeking fair compensation for something. 


6

Which is it?

7

Government's violation of the Constitution by impairing


8

the obligation of contracts, or are you simply seeking


9

your contractual rights?

10
11
12
13
14
15

claim?

Are you seeking fair compensation for the


Are you seeking a contract


Which -- what do we have before us? 

MR. ECKLAND:

We are -- Justice Scalia, we are


seeking compensation for the breach of contract.

QUESTION:

Okay.

So, it's a -- it's a simple


contract case.

MR. ECKLAND:

Very much so, Your Honor.

I mean,


16

included in the compensation that the petitioners are


17

seeking, it was not merely the lost income because of


18

their lost right to opt out, but given the situation,


19

petitioners are not receiving really sufficient income to


20

even cover the costs of maintaining the housing for their


21

current tenants.


22

QUESTION:

Do you think you have a separate


23

cause of action for the Government's violation of the


24

Constitution, assuming that -- that you're correct that


25

that's what it's done?

MR. ECKLAND:
Scalia? 

QUESTION:

3
4

MR. ECKLAND:

But --


Oh, quite so, Your Honor, yes.

QUESTION:

This is a -- this is a Federal


contract?

MR. ECKLAND:

9

It is with the Department of


10

Agriculture, Your Honor, through the Farmers Home


11

Administration. 

QUESTION:

12
13

So, the impairment clause doesn't


apply. 

MR. ECKLAND:

14
15

We


believe that although it's for purposes --


7
8

Well, no, not the takings.

but impairing the obligation of contracts.


5
6

Under the takings claim, Justice


Well, it -- it comes -- no.

That


only applies to the States.

QUESTION:

16

My difficulty with your argument is


17

that if you have -- your whole property claim here rests


18

upon the contract.

19

your contract will be enforceable.

20

contract claim, then I'm not sure what the source of your


21

property taking is on the -- on the unconstitutionality


22

claim. 


23

And if you have a contract claim, then


MR. ECKLAND:

If you don't have a


Well, petitioners pled, Justice


24

Souter, the takings claim in the alternative to the breach


25

of contract claim.

And in fact, the lower courts have


Page 5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

held that there is no enforceable contract here.

QUESTION:

Well, if -- if they are correct, then


3

I don't see how you've got a taking because your -- your


4

whole property interest -- the only property interest


5

you're asserting is an interest under that contract.

6

if you haven't got the -- if you have no breach of


7

contract, then I don't see what's being taken from you.


8
9

MR. ECKLAND:

What's being taken, Justice


Souter, is the expected use of the petitioners'


10

properties.

11

certain period of time --


12

And


What happened is they volunteered to a


QUESTION:

If you don't have a contract for it,


13

you have no right to expect it.


14

MR. ECKLAND:

But there were representations by


15

the Government that created a reasonable investment-backed


16

expectation on the part of --


17

QUESTION:

18

there was no contract claim?

19
20

Why did the lower courts find that


MR. ECKLAND:

Because of the statute.


Because of the -- one judge, in


particular, because of the unmistakability doctrine.


21

QUESTION:

Because of the --


22

MR. ECKLAND:

In other words, the contract was


23

not clear enough to constitute an enforceable contract


24

with the Government. 


25

QUESTION:

I thought the Federal Circuit went on


Page 6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the statute of limitations.

2

opposing, that the statute of limitations didn't expire?


3

MR. ECKLAND:

Isn't that what you're


Yes, Your Honor.

The lower court


4

opinions were denying our motion for summary judgment, so


5

we've not been able to get to trial on the existence of


6

the contract.

7

there is a contract, the Federal Circuit did affirm the


8

dismissal on the basis of the statute of limitations.


9

Assuming for the purposes of our case that


QUESTION:

Yes.

The question you presented is


10

whether a breach of contract claim accrues for purposes of


11

section -- when Congress enacts a statute alleged to


12

abridge a contractual right to freedom from regulatory


13

covenants upon prepayment of Government mortgage loans. 


14

Basically the -- the court held that your -- the statute


15

of limitations barred your contract claim, didn't it?


16

MR. ECKLAND:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ECKLAND:

19
20

That is true, Your Honor. 


And that's the case we have here.

Well, in -- yes.

Yes, it is,


Judge, a statute of limitations case. 

In our case, the petitioners alleged that their


21

claims accrued when they tried to prepay and when the


22

Farmers Home Administration failed to accept their


23

prepayment requests and refused to release them from the


24

regulatory covenants imposed by the Section 515 program. 


25

Petitioners all commenced suit within 6 years of that


Page 7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

date, and therefore they maintain here that their claims


2

are timely.


3

Now, the Government maintains that the


4

petitioners' claims accrued not on the date dictated by


5

the ordinary principles of law, breach of contract and


6

takings, but rather automatically in the enactment of the


7

1988 legislation.

8

1988 legislation, it's clear that it has no immediate


9

impact whatsoever on the owners.

But if you look at -- closely at the


All of its commands,


10

directives, requirements, and authorizations are directed


11

solely at the agency. 


12
13
14

QUESTION:

Didn't the Federal Circuit rely on


anticipatory breach?

MR. ECKLAND:

No, Your Honor.

They maintained


15

that the actual passage of the -- of the statute


16

constituted an automatic breach.

17

anticipatory breach.


18

QUESTION:

19

breach, as I understand it. 


20

They did not rely on the


You were relying on anticipatory


MR. ECKLAND:

We do not either, Your Honor,


21

although the petitioners here have the option of suing --


22

assuming -- suing before the breach, assuming that they


23

had the ability to perform at that time -- and there's


24

nothing in the record --


25

QUESTION:

You rely on the notion that before

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they went to pay it off, it was an anticipatory breach.

MR. ECKLAND:
actual breach.

No, Judge.

We are relying on the


All petitioners --


QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

Then I'm confused.

I


5

thought that your argument was that the reason the statute


6

of limitations doesn't arise, doesn't start to run prior


7

to the time that they paid it off, is because prior to


8

that time, there was no actual breach.

9

anticipatory breach. 


10

MR. ECKLAND:

11

QUESTION:

12

Justice Ginsburg was asking.


Correct, yes.


All right.

13

MR. ECKLAND:

14

QUESTION:

There was only an


That's what I thought


Yes.


Now, but you take the position that


15

your clients could have filed suit soon after the passage


16

of ELIHPA.


17

MR. ECKLAND:

Justice O'Connor, not necessarily. 


18

Under the doctrine of anticipatory repudiation, they did


19

have a option to sue before.

20

footnote --


21

QUESTION:

But as we pointed out in


Well, that's what I'm asking you. 


22

You take the position -- let's be clear about your --


23

please -- that after the enactment of the statute, your


24

clients could have filed suit for breach of contract on an


25

anticipatory breach theory?

MR. ECKLAND:

ability to prepay at that time.

3

of -- of the contract is that the petitioners had the


4

requisite funds to prepay before submitting a prepayment

request.

MR. ECKLAND:

QUESTION:

9
10

Yes, but only if they had the

One of the requirements


Well, no, no, no, no, no.

That is --


You -- you don't -- you don't -- no. 


You have to -- you say for anticipatory breach you have to

show that you're ready to --


11

MR. ECKLAND:

12

QUESTION:

13

obligation to perform comes.

14

show that you're ready for immediate performance.


-- to perform when -- when the


MR. ECKLAND:

15

Ready, willing, and able, Judge.


You -- you don't have to


You do have to show that you're --


16

but for the repudiation, you do have to show that you are


17

able to perform.

QUESTION:

18

But performance here -- what you're


19

talking about here in performance means the ability to


20

prepay.

21

prepaid because we didn't have the money, and therefore we


22

couldn't have proved damages.

23
24
25

And I take it your argument is we couldn't have


MR. ECKLAND:

Is -- is that it?


Essentially so, Your Honor.

We


don't rely on --

QUESTION:

I have a contract to deliver 100,000

1

widgets 3 years from now.

2

is committed to buy those widgets announces I am not going


3

to buy those widgets, and you say there is no anticipatory


4

breach unless I have on hand the 100,000 widgets, which I


5

have no obligation to deliver until 3 years from now. 


6

That's -- that's how you envision the -- the law of


7

anticipatory breach?

8

10

The party who -- the party who


I'm sure that's wrong. 


MR. ECKLAND:

Well, no.

Well, footnote 23.

We


address this in our reply brief, Your Honor. 

QUESTION:

The whole purpose of anticipatory


11

breach -- most people use it not to get damages but to


12

relieve themselves of the obligation of -- of remaining in


13

-- in the status of being able to perform the contract. 


14

The person who would sue in the case that I gave you would


15

be suing so that he wouldn't have to go and acquire the


16

100,000 -- the 100,000 widgets.

17

he's ready -- or almost never the case that he's ready


18

here and now to perform.


19

MR. ECKLAND:

It's never the case that


But, Your Honor, if the person who


20

had the obligation to accept the delivery did not have the


21

funds, for example, even to purchase them, then that would


22

be sort of almost a fraudulent --

1

QUESTION:

Could we agree to this? 


2

Could we agree to this, that so far as the element of an


3

anticipatory breach claim involves the act of the


4

Government, you had that element, and at least to that


5

extent, you could have brought an anticipatory breach


6

claim when the statute was passed?

7

other elements.

8

had the -- you had the -- the Government's fault element. 


9

Is that correct?

11
12

That's what we're arguing about, but you


Do you agree?


MR. ECKLAND:

10

Maybe you didn't have


Well, certainly, Justice Souter,


the --

QUESTION:

But you're saying, whether I could


13

have sued then or not, I certainly can sue at the point at


14

which I would claim my right to redeem without these


15

various conditions, and they refused to honor it.

16

saying, even if I could have sued when the statute was


17

passed, I can also under contract principles sue when the


18

moment comes that I want to exercise my right to prepay.


19

MR. ECKLAND:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ECKLAND:

Correct, Your Honor. 


Okay. 

And -- and the doctrine does not


22

require you to sue until that date.

23

to sue prior to that date. 


24
25

QUESTION:

You're


It's merely an option


So, you're arguing for total control


then over timing because your client could say, we're not

not ready after 10 years.

never run.

from the earliest, which is when the law is passed, until,


5

say, 20 years later. 


6

MR. ECKLAND:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. ECKLAND:

So, the statute would -- would


In other words, you're asking for any time


Yes, Your Honor, we are.


So, you could --

Because the Government negotiated


9

option terms up to 50 years. 


10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ECKLAND:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ECKLAND:

That was the deal. 

That was the deal.


Yes. 

And the owners relied on that when


14

they signed up, and they had, you know, a clear


15

expectation that at some point in time they would be able


16

to prepay, opt out, and convert their markets --


17

QUESTION:

May -- may I interrupt you?


18

MR. ECKLAND:

19

QUESTION:

-- to market rate -- yes.


Did they have a right to assume right


20

after the -- the day after the statute was passed, did


21

they continue to have a right to prepay --


22

MR. ECKLAND:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ECKLAND:

25

The right --


-- without any objection?

Well, the right still existed,


Your Honor, but it wasn't -- it was repudiated at the time


Page 13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the statute. 

QUESTION:

2

Well, it wasn't just -- it's not like


3

a private citizen saying, I don't intend to perform 3


4

years from now.

5

certain contract right.

6

was passed? 


You have a law passed that takes away a


MR. ECKLAND:

7

Was there a breach when the law


Well, Your Honor, petitioners


8

maintain that the right was not eliminated.

9

you will, conditioned --

QUESTION:

10

It was, if


Do you maintain there was no breach


11

at the time the law was passed? 


12

MR. ECKLAND:

That's correct, Your Honor. 


13

That's merely repudiation.

The breach did not occur


14

unless and until the prepayment request was submitted and


15

denied. 


16

QUESTION:

17

statute changed your rights.


18

But you would concede that the


MR. ECKLAND:

The statute did condition them,


19

and that conditioning, or fettering as the Government


20

says, is a repudiation, but like any other situation in


21

the private sector, when you repudiate a right, the breach


22

doesn't occur until the time for performance comes due.


23

QUESTION:

The repudiation --


24

QUESTION:

Well, that's because a private party


25

has the right to change his mind.


Page 14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ECKLAND:

Correct.

Right, the defendant


2

could change their mind or the petitioner here could, in


3

fact, be able to --


4

QUESTION:

5

to change its mind?

6

statute going back to what the situation was before this


7

one?


Doesn't the Government have the right

Couldn't the Government pass another


8

MR. ECKLAND:

9

QUESTION:

10

Yes, Justice Scalia.


In fact, it did that at one point,


didn't it?


11

MR. ECKLAND:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. ECKLAND:

They could and they did. 


They did at one point, didn't they?

In 1979 they initially conditioned


14

the right, and in 1980 they repealed it, retracted it. 


15

Now, under the Government's proposed rule, if -- if the


16

statute of limitations began to run immediately upon the


17

enactment of the statute, all of the petitioners here


18

would have been compelled to file their suit within 6


19

years of 1979, i.e., by 1985. 


20

QUESTION:

So, we're arguing about whether a


21

statute itself, without any action from the agency, can be


22

a repudiation.


23

MR. ECKLAND:

We believe it can be a


24

repudiation, yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

But the breach does


25

not ripen, if you will, unless and until the prepayment


Page 15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

request is denied. 


2

QUESTION:

Does the repudiation give you the


3

right to the same damages that you would receive for a


4

total breach of the contract?


5

MR. ECKLAND:

In our case, no.

The petitioners


6

maintain that since the housing is within a restricted


7

program, it really has no market value unless and until a


8

petitioner actually attempts to prepay.

9

assuming, Your Honor, that there was some type of damage


But even


10

caused by the enactment of the statute, still the


11

limitations period would not commence to run until the


12

time for performance came and was not rendered. 


13

QUESTION:

I think it's usually the case, is it


14

not, that when there's an anticipatory repudiation, it's


15

-- it's very difficult for the -- the other party to


16

determine what his damages are going to be.


17

MR. ECKLAND:

18

QUESTION:

Very difficult. 


Which is why he uses the doctrine to


19

get out of the contract rather than to seek damages.

20

the widget case I gave you, who knows?

21

years from now the price of widgets will be?

22

use it to get out of the contract.


23

MR. ECKLAND:

In


Who knows what 3

So -- so you


Petitioners here, being in the


24

Court of Federal Claims, have as their only remedy the


25

monetary judgment.

And -- and they are seeking damages


Page 16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

starting only as of the date that their prepayment request


2

was denied by the agency.

3

QUESTION:

So --


So are you -- you're saying that


4

there was a claim, or you're saying that -- that your


5

claim really doesn't accrue until you -- until you have


6

the -- the wherewithal to prepay.

7

have a ripe claim until then? 


8
9

MR. ECKLAND:

So, you don't really


We're saying the petitioners would


at least have to have the money to prepay.

They would


10

have to have the ability to perform.

11

situation, for example, where someone was unable to


12

prepay, they experienced repudiation and a breach, a later


13

breach, and then say, well, we would have performed if you


14

hadn't repudiated. 


15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ECKLAND:

17

You couldn't have a


Well --

They have to have the honest


intent to perform and have the ability to perform.

I have a problem with that. 


18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ECKLAND:

20

QUESTION:

Yes. 


But let's get -- if we can get -- for


21

the same reason Justice Scalia mentioned.

22

assume you had cash in the bank that would allow you to


23

prepay, and then there's a repudiation.


24

MR. ECKLAND:

25

QUESTION:

But let's


Sure. 


At that point, can't you show your


Page 17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

damages?

2

have an expert in and say, this property has a certain


3

value and part of the value is the right at any time to


4

prepay the -- the loan and use it for another use?

5

this can be valued in the real estate market.

6

more if I can prepay than if -- if I can't, and you have


7

some expert come in and tell you the difference in the


8

values.

9

occurs. 


10

You don't want to prepay, but can't you say --


And


It's worth


And you do that at the moment the repudiation


MR. ECKLAND:

But here, Justice Kennedy, a 50-


11

year option exists.

12

they didn't know in 1979 and many didn't know in 1988 what


13

the value of their properties would be, given interest


14

rate structures and other market conditions at any given


15

point in time --


16
17
18

QUESTION:

Petitioners don't know, frankly --


Well, you mean 50-year options are


not subject to valuation?
MR. ECKLAND:

Experts do this all the time.


Well, but even so, even if you


19

could come up with a damage theory to cover this, still


20

it's clear that under the law, the breach would not be


21

deemed to accrue for limitations purposes until the time


22

for performance has arrived and performance failed.


23
24
25

I mean, if you take a hypo of the GSA leasing

some space in a building --

confused again.

a suit could have been filed for anticipatory breach of


3

some kind after the statute was enacted. 

MR. ECKLAND:

5

I thought we established that you thought


If they're able to perform, yes,


Your Honor. 

QUESTION:

very confusing.

8

arguing. 


And now you're saying no.

I don't know what in the world you're


MR. ECKLAND:

9

It's just


Justice O'Connor, no.

If the


10

petitioners had the ability to pay, they could have


11

brought an anticipatory breach claim --

QUESTION:

12
13
14

Only if they had the ability to pay,


you say.

MR. ECKLAND:

According to Corbin and the case


15

law that we cite at footnote 23 of our brief, yes.

16

we get beyond that, okay --


17

QUESTION:

But if


Footnote 23 just says that ordinary


18

contract law applies to this kind of case.

We still --


19

but we still -- we still have to figure out what ordinary


20

contract law is.

21

that that I saw. 


Footnote 23 doesn't shed any light on


22

MR. ECKLAND:

23

QUESTION:

But in this case --


And -- and I might add that on page


24

27 of the blue brief, you say that the law constituted an


25

anticipatory repudiation and petitioners had the option of


Page 19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

suing immediately.

MR. ECKLAND:

3

Honor.

4

the actual breach.


5

QUESTION:

6

In general, yes, that's true, Your


But here the petitioners sued within 6 years of


And in fact, you did not sue until


after the passage of 6 years. 


7

MR. ECKLAND:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ECKLAND:

From the statute, yes, Your Honor.


From the enactment of the statute.

But -- but all petitioners


10

commenced suit within 6 years of the date of the actual


11

breach, which is the date that the prepayment requests


12

were denied.

QUESTION:

13

So, what apparently the Government's


14

arguing -- does it matter if we call this anticipatory


15

repudiation or anticipatory breach?

16

technically --


17

MR. ECKLAND:

18

QUESTION:

19

I guess


Technically --


-- we should say anticipatory


repudiation?


20

MR. ECKLAND:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor. 


Fine.

And so, what they say, in


22

part, which I'd like to hear your response, is if you're


23

right that where there is anticipatory repudiation of a


24

contract, the other side, if it's a private contract, has


25

a choice.

They can either sue immediately if conditions

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

X, Y, and Z are fulfilled, or they wait until the contract


2

is actually breached.

3

have to interpret this statute strictly, and therefore we


4

interpret it to mean that even if where you're dealing


5

with a private person, you'd have your choice; here


6

there's no choice. 


But we are the Government and we


7

Now, your response is what? 


8

MR. ECKLAND:

Well, here, Your Honor, although,


9

yes, we need to construe the statute strictly, we cannot


10

do so in such a manner, however, to narrow the waiver of


11

sovereign immunity that has already occurred under the


12

Tucker Act.

13

against New York, the tolling -- equitable tolling


14

principles at issue in those cases, which applied to the


15

private sector, were nonetheless deemed to apply to the


16

Government, despite the strict construction of the statute


17

of limitations involved in those cases.

18

although there's a conditioning of the right at the point


19

of the repudiation, no breach occurs until the performance


20

comes due and is not rendered. 


21

As this Court held in Irwin and in Bowen


Here there is --


If -- again, if you look at the statute, under


22

ELIHPA, page 74 of our appendix 4a, all of its directives


23

are towards the Secretary.

It's the Secretary that needs to make those

There's no directive directly to the


If -- if that's the -- I mean, I


5

really do think that your takings claim, which is the


6

reason you're going into this thing -- well, it was just a


7

conditioning of the right; it wasn't an elimination of the


8

right; it just reduced it -- you do all of that to -- to

support your takings claim.

wasn't enough for a taking.

Justice Scalia --


You're carrying water on both


shoulders, it seems to me, and you're spilling a lot.

MR. ECKLAND:

Well, Your -- Your Honor, no.

At


10

the point of the denial of the prepayment request, there


11

is a definite breach and that's where the damages occur. 


12

But the takings --

QUESTION:

14

And you say in every breach there's


also a taking?

What -- what are you adding with this


so-called takings claim? 

MR. ECKLAND:

Well, in the event that the lower


22

courts do not rule in the petitioners' favor on the


23

contract claim, they have their wholly independent takings


24

claim, which is based not -- it's not predicated on the


25

existence of a contract.

It's simply the unilateral

MR. ECKLAND:

Scalia, if we do prevail on the contract claim at trial, I

That's fine, except what you're

asking us to do then is to write a little essay on a

matter that affects millions of other people in a very

serious way, in a case which doesn't seem completely to

present the issue.

MR. ECKLAND:

It's just their inability to go

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


9
10
11

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

Petitioners' claims are barred because they


12

weren't filed within 6 years of when they first accrued,


13

on the enactment of ELIHPA.

14

contracts gave them the option to prepay their mortgages


15

at any time subject to only those legal restrictions in


16

place when the contracts were made.

17

alleging that the Government promised not to impose


18

additional legal restrictions on their option to prepay


19

and ELIHPA itself breached any such promise because ELIHPA

itself imposed additional legal restrictions on


21

prepayment.

We're -- for --


-- do we assume it for purposes of


deciding this case? 

MR. ROBERTS:

For the purposes of deciding the


statute of limitations question, yes.

QUESTION:

And that the contract included a


right of prepayment.

MR. ROBERTS:

Included a right of prepayment and


not only a right of prepayment, because if the contract


10

just said you can prepay at any time, it like all


11

contracts would be presumed to be subject to subsequent


12

legislation.

13

also include a promise that the Government wouldn't change


14

the rules and impose additional legal restrictions on --


15

So, the -- that right to prepayment had to

And we're not arguing


So long as it does it by legislation,


it's okay.

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

No, no, Your Honor.

The


Government --

QUESTION:

I thought that was your point, that


17

this -- this breach is different because it was done by


18

legislation. 


19

MR. ROBERTS:

That doesn't mean -- that -- that


20

doesn't mean that it's not a breach, but what it means is


21

that the breach is occurring at the time the legislation


22

is passed.


23

QUESTION:

So, fine.

The legislation says, ha-


24

ha, we won't pay.

You know, I just want the legislation


25

to say precisely what the private person said.

Now, you


Page 31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

say we reach a different result because it's in the form


2

of legislation? 


3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

Yes. 


Okay.

Now, one thing -- I'm just


5

curious to get into that a little bit -- is, I don't


6

understand why the Government is taking the position it


7

does, as well as what the position is.

8

wouldn't you, if you win -- and this will help me


9

understand it -- have millions of people who have entered


10

into contracts with the Government poring over every law


11

that is passed, and probably every regulation, to decide


12

whether or not that law and that regulation will somehow


13

10 or 15 years from now impact on a real estate contract


14

they have with the Government?

15

anticipatory breach, not really, lawyers will develop in

16

order to bring those claims immediately in the Court of


17

Claims because we might lose them later even though


18

everything would have been worked out. 


19
20
21

That is to say,


A whole industry of


Now, if you can explain that to me, I suspect

I'll have a better time understanding your argument. 

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

What -- what we're -- what


22

we're asking for is that people who believe that their


23

contractual rights have been injured -- have been


24

infringed by a statute give the Government reasonably


25

prompt notice, in accordance with the statute of


Page 32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limitations, of their claims.

2

ability to have a prompt accounting outweighs, in the


3

Government's view, any additional lawsuits that may


4

result. 


5

And the benefit of the


And we don't think that there will be a


6

significant number of additional lawsuits because, as the


7

Court was explaining before, there's an ability to sue


8

immediately on the anticipatory repudiation theory.

9

it isn't that the petitioners -- or that the Government is


10
11
12
13

So,


not going to be subject to suit or --

QUESTION:

But what would the damages be when I


haven't got the wherewithal to pay? 

MR. ROBERTS:

The -- the damages are that


14

petitioners had a loan that they allege gave them an


15

unfettered option to prepay at any time.

16

was passed, that loan no longer had that unfettered option


17

to prepay.

18

prepayment option is worth more than a loan with a


19

severely restricted prepayment option.

20

the value of the loan is reflected in the difference of


21

the value of the property that's encumbered by the loan,


22

and it's -- it's easy to measure by comparing the --


23

And after ELIHPA


And a loan that has an -- has an absolute


QUESTION:

The difference in


You -- you'd bet

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

anticipatory breach as just an option is precisely because


2

it is often so difficult to anticipate what your damages


3

will be.

4

who hasn't broken the contract to either sue immediately,


5

if he can calculate his damages and get them, or to wait


6

until the -- the time for performance comes. 


And so, it leaves it up to the innocent party


And what the Government is doing with this


7
8

theory is forcing everybody who has a contract with the


9

Government to come in with -- with speculative damages and


10

hoping that some court will find a difference between the


11

value of this contract now and what it would be 50 years


12

from now.

13

would want to impose this kind of a regime upon


14

contractors with the Government. 


15

2

give the option to the innocent party is precisely because


3

it's a guess.

4

it's a guess. 


It may be, you know, an educated guess, but


MR. ROBERTS:

5

But -- but the reason we


With -- with due respect, Your


6

Honor, I -- I don't think that's the reason why the law


7

gives the -- the option to the innocent party.

8

gives the option to the innocent party so that the -- the


9

party has the ability -- the opportunity to convince the


10

The law


defendant to retract its wrongful repudiation.

QUESTION:

11

But if -- if it is an option, why


12

should the innocent party be penalized by having the


13

statute of limitations start to run then?


14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

the statute is a present breach.

16

that --


17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROBERTS:

It's not an option here because

And -- and to understand


Well, are you --

-- it's important to understand


19

the nature of the promise that's -- that's at issue here,


20

I think, and if -- if I could try to go back to -- to do


21

that.


22

QUESTION:

Yes.

I was going to ask -- I -- I


23

think it's consistent with the Chief Justice's inquiry. 


24

Are you saying that there's only one cause of action here,


25

or do you concede that there are two causes of action, one


Page 35
Alderson Reporting Company

1

for repudiation or anticipatory breach and the other for


2

the actual breach?

MR. ROBERTS:

3

Our position is that there is an


4

actual breach at the time that the statute is passed, and


5

it's a breach of -- of the promise that the Government


6

made that it wouldn't impose additional legal restrictions


7

on prepayment.


8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

10
11
12

Even though --

It's different from --


Even though performance is not yet


due.

MR. ROBERTS:

Performance on that promise is


13

due, Your Honor.

14

throughout the life of the loan.


15

Performance on that promise is -- is due


QUESTION:

No.

But you can make that argument


16

with respect to any contract that is ever made.

17

saying there is always an implicit term that they won't


18

monkey around with the terms of the contract, and whenever


19

in anticipation they do so, there's an immediate breach. 


20

And if you follow that analysis, then in fact the


21

distinction between repudiation and anticipatory breach on


22

the one hand and actual breach on the other will disappear


23

in every contract, public or private. 


24
25

MR. ROBERTS:

You're


No, Your Honor, because -- because


the -- the difference is between legislation and the --


Page 36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the role that legislation has under background


2

principles of contract law and other actions. 


3

QUESTION:

The background principle of contract


4

law is that we try to treat the Government and a private 


5

contracting party together. 


6

MR. ROBERTS:

7

QUESTION:

Yes. 


And you're saying the fact that the


8

Government can speak through legislation, whereas a


9

private party cannot, alters that rule.

If so, then that


10

rule is going to have a remarkably short life because the


11

Government can do anything it wants to across the street


12

and displace the rule.


13

MR. ROBERTS:

The -- the distinction, Your


14

Honor, is that -- is -- is twofold.

15

changes the legal rights and so there isn't an ability


16

anymore to perform. 


17

QUESTION:

The legislation


Why does it change the legal rights


18

if the contract exists?

19

right into a -- a right to damages as opposed to a right


20

to performance, but the theory of contract is that by


21

repudiation you can't just change the legal rights.


22

MR. ROBERTS:

It may -- it may convert one


It does -- it does exactly that. 


23

That's what I mean by changing the legal rights, that it


24

changes -- there's no longer a -- a right to performance. 


25

There's only a right to the damages.

If it was a contract

-QUESTION:

2

All right.

If that is so, then


3

exactly the same thing is true in a private contract when


4

there has been an anticipatory breach.

MR. ROBERTS:

5

No.

No, Your Honor, there might


6

be a right to specific performance if it was the kind of


7

contract that you could specific performance, but we would


8

submit that you couldn't get specific performance once the


9

Government --


10

QUESTION:

11

MR. ROBERTS:

12

law.

How does the fact that you cannot --

-- precluded the performance by


You could only get damages. 

QUESTION:

13

Let's assume you're right.

How does


14

the fact that you may not get specific performance against


15

the Government affect the right to damages, which you 


16

perfectly can get against the Government, as -- as against


17

any other private contract?

MR. ROBERTS:

18

The -- what it does is show that


19

there's -- that there's a change and an -- an injury right


20

at the time that the legislation is passed. 

QUESTION:

21

Then that gets back to the original


22

point.

23

apply in every contract, public or private.


24
25

If that's so, then the same argument is going to


MR. ROBERTS:

It -- it's not going to apply in a


private context because there isn't going to be a breach


Page 38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

by virtue of -- of legislation unless there's a promise by


2

the private party that --


3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ROBERTS:

5
6

You -- you have invented --

-- that the laws aren't going to


change. 

QUESTION:

I understand.

You have invented a


7

promise that I won't change the laws.

You can invent in


8

-- in private contracts an implicit promise that I will


9

not repudiate, and therefore, when you repudiate


10

anticipatorily, you have broken the contract and, bingo,


11

there is a breach of contract and you must sue at once.


12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ROBERTS:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

You -- you have --


You no longer have the option.

You have --


You could do it.

I mean, it's just


-- you know. 

MR. ROBERTS:

You have no need to invent that. 


18

You have no need to -- to have that additional promise in


19

the private contract because -- because there isn't the


20

presumption.

21

circumstance that the contract is subject to legislation


22

even though the Government is -- has the ability to


23

legislate. 


There -- there isn't the presumption in that

QUESTION:

I see your point. 


25

QUESTION:

Well, what is -- what is your


Page 39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

authority for the proposition that the -- an -- an


2

anticipatory breach not accepted by the other party starts


3

the statute of limitations running?

4

MR. ROBERTS:

I mean, what case?


My -- my argument is not that this


5

is an anticipatory breach.

6

submission is that this is a present breach, but -- but


7

it's a present breach of a promise that the Government --

We -- but you could read the statute -- you


QUESTION:

Even though that's not the law as


between private parties. 

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, given the principles of


24

sovereign immunity and the principle that the statute


25

should be narrowly construed.

But -- but --


Page 40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But that -- that narrow construction


2

notion, or construed strictly notion, applies to deciding


3

whether there's a waiver by the Government of any


4

privilege of sovereign immunity.

5

yes, the Government did waive it, the Government has said


6

it can be sued, we don't continue to look at every issue


7

and say, oh, it's the Government, we're going to strictly


8

construe it somehow. 


9

MR. ROBERTS:

And once we've decided


The Court -- the Court has held


10

several times that statutes of limitations, as conditions


11

on the Government's waiver of its sovereign immunity,


12

should themselves be -- be narrowly construed and has


13

applied it in -- in cases, for instance, involving a


14

situation where a private party claimed that the


15

limitations period didn't run until an administration --


16

administrative determination had been made that there


17

wouldn't be -- that there was a -- was a loss and --


18

QUESTION:

Well, in this sense -- in this sense,


19

the Government actually needs less protection than the


20

private party because the Government at least is in the


21

position where it can always pass a statute of


22

limitations --


23

MR. ROBERTS:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, the Government --


-- which -- and if you're -- you're


concerned about your liability 50 years out or something,


Page 41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I suppose you could pass a statute of limitations.

MR. ROBERTS:

2

The Government can do that and has


3

done it here, and the statute of limitations provides that


4

when the action first accrues, there are 6 years to sue.


5

And if -- if --

QUESTION:

6

Well, but again, I'm back to the


7

problem.

8

are two causes of action, anticipatory repudiation,


9

anticipatory breach, and breach.

10
11

It -- it seems to me that on contract law there


And you're conflating


the two.

MR. ROBERTS:

In the -- in the ordinary


12

situation, if a private party -- let's -- if -- if I may,


13

let's -- can I pose a hypothetical?

14

private party had promised that you could prepay, that the


15

other party could prepay at any time, and Congress passed


16

a statute that imposed restrictions on prepayment, that


17

statute would be neither an anticipatory repudiation or a


18

breach, but would provide a discharge. 


19

If -- if a -- if a


And -- but if the private party had promised,


20

subsidiary to the promise that it would be prepaid at any


21

time, that there -- that notwithstanding passage of


22

legislation, that if -- if there was legislation passed


23

that -- that -- excuse me -- that the private party had


24

promised that legislation wouldn't be passed or had


25

promised to indemnify, notwithstanding the passage of


Page 42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

legislation, then there would be a breach at the time the


2

legislation is passed. 


3

And the Government has to make that promise, and


4

petitioners have alleged that the Government made that


5

promise here.

6

summary judgment motion in the -- in the lower court about


7

on the merits --


8
9

That's what -- that's what they lost on the


QUESTION:
your argument.

I see that.

I think I understand


It doesn't work with the private party. 


10

Your analogy isn't so great because it's not the private


11

party who can pass the law. 


12

But I think your argument is that unlike private


13

contracts, many, many, many Government contracts have the


14

following problem in them which was in Mobil.

15

parties here saying that if Congress passes a law, that


16

that -- all bets are off?

17

promises to do this, Congress's law to the contrary in the


18

future notwithstanding?

19

Are the


Are they saying the Government


What's the promise? 


And here you're saying the promise was in their


20

view we will do this irrespective of Congress's new law


21

and their -- your view is, no, it was conditioned on


22

Congress not passing a law.

23

have it backwards.

24

Government contracts, there is a promise and there is an


25

issue whether the Government means that promise


Is that right?

Or maybe I


But you're -- you're saying that in

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

irrespective of what Congress does in the future.

MR. ROBERTS:

That --


That's an issue.

That's an issue, and then there's


a separate --

QUESTION:

And therefore, they're saying what

the Government meant was irrespective of what Congress

does, and you're saying no, it meant only if Congress

doesn't do to the contrary.

12

MR. ROBERTS:
merits, yes.

On -- on the merits -- on the


But -- but --


QUESTION:

On the merits.

And you're saying


13

that kind of a contract issue is breached when Congress


14

passes the law to the contrary. 


15

MR. ROBERTS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.


Okay.

And that's special for


Government. 

And now all I would like on that is:

A, does


19

that apply to administrative regulations too; and B,


20

what's the authority for that? 


21

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

It would apply to


22

administrative regulations if -- if that was the -- the


23

issue whether the promise -- if -- if the issue was there


24

wouldn't be regulations -- different regulations that


25

imposed restrictions on prepayment.

It would apply to


Page 44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that and it would be breached at the time the regulations


2

were promulgated.

They have the effect of law.


The authority for that is the -- is the


3
4

background principle that's -- that's recognized in the


5

Winstar case, that's recognized in Bowen v. Posse, that's


6

recognized in --

QUESTION:

7

All right.

But if it's just a


8

background principle, I would worry about the practical


9

consequence being of people, particularly in real estate


10

contracts, having to study every regulation, every statute


11

in order to tell their clients what to do.

12

investors are nervous people sometimes.

13

would say, my God, I better bring a lawsuit and the lawyer


14

would say, don't worry about it.

15

going to arise anyway.

16

then. 


17

Real estate


And -- and they


This condition is never


Who cares?

And if it does, sue


Now, that -- that's the practical thing I brought up


18

at the beginning, and if we're trying to say what's the


19

right legal principle, I think that practical problem is


20

relevant.


21

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

And then to return to the


22

-- to practical considerations that -- that we think argue


23

in our favor on that side, that's because the Government


24

has a prompt interest in -- has a -- has a strong interest


25

in a prompt accounting of the costs of legislative action. 


Page 45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And it's particularly important that -- it's -- it's


2

important that, one, that -- that a Congress close to the


3

Congress that enacts a statute be able to address the


4

consequences of the enactment.

5

that Congress --


6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

QUESTION:

9

And it's also important


Which it could enact by repealing --

-- be able to cause a --


It could enact -- the -- the Congress


that's close to the first one could say, okay, we'll


10

repeal it.

11

problems I have with your argument.

12

legislation is magic, and you can't have an anticipatory


13

repudiation because when Congress has spoken, that's it. 


14

But in this very case, Congress goes back and forth a


15

couple of times. 


16

And that's, Mr. Roberts, one of the major


MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

You seem to say that


Congress can repeal the


17

legislation, but it doesn't change the fact that during


18

the -- the period the legislation was in effect that


19

there's an alteration of legal rights, and there's also,


20

if there was a promise that -- that the -- that the rights


21

wouldn't be changed, a breach during that time. 


22

And although Congress did -- although Congress


23

did repeal the statute here, it -- it's far less likely in


24

the ordinary situation that Congress is going to repeal


25

statutes than it is that a private party is going to


Page 46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

change its mind about its intention to repudiate a -- a


2

contract, and --

QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. -- Mr. Roberts, in the case


4

in which the Government, we'll assume, doesn't change its


5

mind, your argument in -- in response to Justice Breyer's


6

question seems to boil down to something like this.

7

the poor Government as the contract breaker because it may


8

not know just how much damage it's causing.

9

put a burden on the people harmed by the Government's


Pity


Therefore,


10

breach of contract to run in in a hurry and let the


11

Government know early on just how much damage it has


12

caused. 

Why should the burden of the Government's breach


13
14

of contract be shifted entirely for limitations purposes


15

to the victims of the breach? 

MR. ROBERTS:

16

When -- when there's a present --


17

when there's a breach, the general principle is the


18

statute of limitations starts to run at the time of the


19

breach.

20

It doesn't wait to run until --

QUESTION:

No, but your -- no, but your


21

argument, as I understand it, is that because of the


22

Government's peculiar power to pass legislation, the


23

Government should not be in the position of the usual


24

contract breaker who may be subject to an anticipatory


25

breach claim or an actual breach claim later.

You're


Page 47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

saying the Government should be subject only to one claim


2

at the first moment that an anticipatory breach claim


3

should be brought.

4

the Government ought to have a right to make its victims


5

come in and tell it as early as possible how much damage


6

it has caused.

7

has a legislative power, have that kind of a moral claim


8

that the private contract breaker does not have?


And your argument for saying that is


Why does the Government, simply because it


MR. ROBERTS:

9

There's this -- there's a -- a


10

very strong interest in permitting the Government to -- in


11

permitting Congress to decide it wants to wrap up the


12

costs of improvident Federal contracts that they have --

QUESTION:

13

Then why don't we let Congress -- why


14

don't we let Congress survey through the departments of


15

the Government how many contracts it has entered into or


16

guaranteed and tote up the damages in advance?

17

Government has access to this information if it wants to


18

get it.

MR. ROBERTS:

20

who's going to sue, for one.

21

rule does is --

22

The


And so -- so it -- what this


In other words, the Government may


23

get off a little cheaper if it puts the burden on the


24

victims. 


25

MR. ROBERTS:

Well -- well, it -- there's a


Page 48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

dispute here as to whether the contract made this promise


2

or not, and the Government doesn't -- doesn't know how


3

that dispute is going to be resolved.

4

that -- that there was a promise that prepayment would not


5

be subject to subsequent legislation. 


6

QUESTION:

We don't believe


Well, certainly general contract law


7

is not -- you know, you could say it from the point of


8

view of general contract law, it's important that people


9

who breach contracts know as soon as possible how much


10

damage they've done, but obviously that doctrine has not


11

commended itself in the area of general contract law.


12

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, when they breach a contract


13

and it's a breach, the statute of limits does start to run


14

and the rule is that even if the damages can't be fully


15

ascertained, that -- that the statute of limitations run. 


16

And that's true with -- if -- if there was a contract


17

between one party to -- to employ another party for the


18

other party's life and that contract was breached, the


19

statute of limitations would run at the date of breach


20

even though it wouldn't be possible with certainty to know


21

the length of the damages.

22

of warranty of merchantability --


23

QUESTION:

A -- a contract for a breach


I think it's so hard to look at this


24

as an actual breach if we take it on the assumption there


25

was a contractual right of prepayment on demand by the


Page 49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

borrower.

I would think normally you would wait and see


2

if and when there was a request for repayment -- or early


3

payment, and you wouldn't really know that, of course,


4

with a -- the owner of real estate who goes out and he


5

gets a low interest loan from the Government to develop


6

it.

7

the future within the 20-year period, then he might well


8

want to go have early payment so he can get an even better


9

deal.

Now, if interest rates decline below that low rate in


But if interest rates are going higher, there's no


10

incentive for him to.

11

an immediate breach because the Congress attached new


12

conditions to the circumstances of the prepayment.


13

MR. ROBERTS:

I wouldn't think you'd treat it as


Even under the scenario you posed


14

that -- that there wasn't an incentive to prepay right at


15

the moment, there's still a -- a change in what -- in --


16

in the loan that petitioners have, and it's a loan where


17

they no longer have that option to prepay with unfettered


18

--

19

QUESTION:

No.

As I read the legislation, there


20

still is consideration of the possibility of prepayment,


21

but there are some new conditions imposed whereby the


22

Government tries to assure itself that there will still be


23

a certain number of low-income housing units out there on


24

the market.


25

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor, but petitioners

here aren't complaining about the fact that they're

ultimately not able to prepay.

3

about the -- about the restriction in the circumstances


4

At that point, there's an

I think you'll find it's an

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

-- is really different because of


2

this.

3

not -- I'm not saying I do -- that the Government was


4

really different for that reason, then this is a unique

kind of case and maybe we should have a different rule as

to when you have to sue.

people who don't know what their damages are at this point

have to sue right away or it can wait until -- until they

Now, if I believed that the Government -- and I'm


it.

Would that make you happy? 

MR. ROBERTS:

All -- all I can say to that, Your


14

Honor, is that -- that there are many situations in which


15

damages cannot be ascertained fully.

16

situations in which courts have confronted situations


17

where the damages can't -- no measurable damages could be


18

found at all at the time of breach, and they hold that it


19

-- it runs from the breach. 


20

In fact, there are


And the -- the policy arguments on our side are

the -- the Government's interest in a prompt accounting,


22

in being able to wrap things up and in not having --

Well, but the Government has --

MR. ROBERTS:

able to deal with people on a commercial basis in some

areas.

from the private sector or to engage in loan agreements. 


5

And to adopt the kind of proposal you're making

a very peculiar rule.

MR. ROBERTS:

9

You might want to be able to buy certain things


It's


I -- I don't think it discourages


them, Your Honor, because they -- they can sue and their

damages are measurable, and they can get the damages.

12

interest rates are going to go down and -- and other

possibilities are -- are reflected in the -- in the change

The


And -- and if petitioners think they might be


17

able to prepay later, subject to the restrictions, so they


18

wouldn't be injured in that way, they can sue, get their


19

damages and then they'll be subject to the restrictions in


20

the program. 


21

And if they prepay and -- and the restrictions


22

don't prevent them in any way from prepaying or don't


23

impose any limitations on them, then they've gotten the


24

damages for what they've lost and they also get the


25

ability to prepay.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFF H. ECKLAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. ECKLAND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

it please the Court:

The Government has not been able to cite to one


7
8

case in which a congressional statute has been treated


9

differently, in other words, that it constitutes an


10

May


immediate breach of a contract. 

In the petitioners' briefs, we have a total of


11
12

six cases that make the distinction between a


13

congressional statute as being merely a repudiation and


14

the breach not occurring until there has been some adverse


15

agency action.

16

Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases, Bank of America, and


17

18

Schism, and Stone Forrest.

19

Plaintiffs in Winstar-Related cases and Bank of America,


20

dealt with the statute of limitations and have ruled in


21

favor of the petitioners' position advocated here.


22

In the Court of Federal Claims, we've got


The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Far West,

And two of those cases,


Congress makes policy.

It directs agencies what


23

to do, and petitioners maintain that in that sense it is


24

no real different than a board of directors of a


25

corporation.

A board of directors can direct the CEO or a

the program manager or CEO actually fails to perform at

the time that performance comes due.

It's merely a repudiatory


The -- the breach does not ripen unless and until


Here it's clear that since the petitioners can


8

reach their central right of opting out of this program


9

upon prepayment -- and the statistics show that -- it


10

can't be that the statute is an immediate breach.

11

breach occurs only if and when the agency acts and denies


12

a prepayment request.

A


In closing, Your Honors, petitioners here


14

understand that as U.S. citizens they have an obligation


15

to follow the law and to know the law.

Government enticed the petitioners into this program by


17

holding out a 50-year option term, only to withdraw it


18

upon the time that the petitioners built the properties.

But here the


If the Government is not willing to give the


20

petitioners the benefit of their bargain, fundamental


21

considerations of fairness at least require that they get


22

the benefit of the doubt and that these ordinary


23

principles of law regarding the accrual of breach of


24

contract and takings claims should be able to be invoked


25

by the petitioners such that they do not need to file suit
