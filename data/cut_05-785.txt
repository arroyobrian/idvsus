We'll hear argument next

Mr. Ott.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. OTT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. OTT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

11

This Court has never addressed the

12

constitutionality of photo buttons worn by spectators

13

during a criminal trial.

14

this Court, Estelle v. Williams and Holbrook v. Flynn

15

established only a general rule that some courtroom

16

practices may be so inherently prejudicial that they

17

violate the defendant's right to a fair trial.

18

Flynn nor Williams -

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The two closest decisions of

Neither

Well, it went a little bit beyond

20

that.

21

merely the possibility of inherent prejudice, but he

22

spoke in terms of practices that raised a risk that

23

improper factors would come into play in the jury

24

decision.

25

I mean, the -- Justice Marshall announced not

Isn't that the criterion?

MR. OTT:

An unacceptable risk, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

2

MR. OTT:

3

Well, the test has been formulated

different ways -

4
5

That's the criterion.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's the way he formulated it.

That's the way the Court in Flynn formulated it.

6

MR. OTT:

In Flynn, it did, but it also, just a

7

paragraph or so earlier said that the only question we

8

need to answer is whether this practice, and there the

9

courtroom uniformed guards, is so inherently prejudicial

10

that it violates the defendant's right to a fair trial.

11

We don't believe that those are material -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That was the end point that they

13

were reaching, and then he elaborated on that by

14

referring to the unacceptable risk that improper

15

considerations would come into play.

16

that if you're going to talk about the criterion of the

17

test or the standard, however you want to describe it in

18

Flynn, you've got to get that latter point about

19

unacceptable risk of improper factors.

20

MR. OTT:

And it seems to me

That certainly was a formulation of the

21

test.

It's been -- we can accept it as the formulation

22

of the test.

And it was accepted by the California

23

courts below.

They attempted to apply that test.

24

announced the proper -- the correct clearly established

25

law of this Court, and then proceeded to analyze the
4

issue.
Below, however, on Federal habeas review, the

3

circuit court of appeals used its own circuit case to

4

define clearly established law under AEDPA.

5

assessing the state court's application of the general

6

rule, the circuit court narrowed this Court's general

7

rule into one that specifically condemned buttons.

8
9

Instead of

Instead of granting the state court wide leeway to
apply this Court's general rule, it -- the circuit court

10

created a narrow rule that would seemingly prohibit

11

buttons in any case.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I suppose if the court of

13

appeals had case A, and it said, we interpret the Supreme

14

Court rule to be as follows, it could then later say in

15

case B, this is how we've interpreted the Supreme Court

16

rule, and we're bound by case A.

17

we've given to it.

18

court, of course, isn't bound by what we do, but we're

19

bound by what we do when we review what the state court

20

has decided.

21

MR. OTT:

This is the elaboration

And we have to find that the state

Well, Your Honor makes a distinction

22

between a post-AEDPA case and pre-AEDPA cases.

23

post-AEDPA setting, it is -- the circuit court of appeals

24

is looking at its own post-AEDPA case -- post A-E-D-P-A,

25

AEDPA case which has said that this set of facts

constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly

established law.

3

We don't disagree that stare decisis might come

into play there.

5

decision was correct, but we don't -- what happened here

6

in contrast was a pre-AEDPA decision that was used to

7

define the clearly established law of this Court, give it

8

more detail such that the circumstances here fell outside

9

of it.

10

It doesn't mean that that first

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To apply an opinion of this Court

11

to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of

12

the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not

13

Supreme Court law.

15

guess as to how it comes out, right?

It just means that it is their best

It specifically stated that this

Norris.

It specifically stated that the state court's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We're looking under AEDPA

5

at an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.

6

What do you do in a situation where you think the state

7

court has incorrectly articulated Supreme Court law, but

8

nonetheless reached the correct result?

9

correct understanding of the established Supreme Court

In other words,

10

law would have led to the same result as their incorrect

11

articulation of it.

12

MR. OTT:

Mr. Chief Justice, at first, the -- the

13

first thing to do would be to look at the fair import, as

14

this Court stated in Wilford v. Biscotti.

15

fair import of the decision.

16

Look at the

Now, I don't know if you are referring to the

17

issue about the arguable misarticulation of the text at

18

the end of the state court's decision here, but the first

19

question is to look at the fair import.

20

import is that the correct test was applied, then habeas

21

relief does not lie.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And if the fair

My hypothetical,

23

and we'll debate later whether it is this case or not, is

24

let's say that the state court wrongly articulates

25

Supreme Court law.

But under the correct articulation,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it leads to the same result.

2

under AEDPA?

3

MR. OTT:

What happens in that case

I believe that the habeas relief should

4

not lie.

Now, I have seen circuit courts treat it

5

different ways.

6

deference and review it de novo, but I don't think

7

Congress intended, in enacting AEDPA, the A-E-D-P-A, that

8

a state habeas -- a state conviction should be overturned

9

simply because of an accident in a statement or

Some courts will decline to give

10

formulation of the test, but the conviction is otherwise

11

constitutionally balanced -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You are actually saying the

13

answer to the Chief Justice's question is that you would

14

then review it de novo.

15

sustain the conviction if it came to the right result.

16
17
18

MR. OTT:

Yes.

But on de novo review, you would

I believe so.

If I understood you

correctly -- the question correctly, yes.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

You would not affirm -- you

19

would not sustain the conviction relying on AEDPA.

20

would say AEDPA authorizes review, but on review, we

21

conclude the conviction was correct.

22

understand the AEDPA to be.

23

MR. OTT:

You

That's what I

Yes, with the caveat that we're assuming

24

that the hypothetical is that the state court has

25

misapplied, that the fair import has -- they have
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

misapplied the holdings of this Court.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Correct.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It misarticulated them.

I

4

guess the question of application is -- I mean, I assumed

5

they reached what we would regard as the correct result

6

under the correct standard, they just articulated the

7

wrong standard.

8
9
10

Your answer, I take it, is that it would then be
reviewed without AEDPA deference?
MR. OTT:

No, Your Honor.

Then I misunderstood

11

the question.

12

could look at the decision as a whole and see that the

13

correct standard was applied.

14

stated the standard -- if the state court erroneously

15

stated the standard, but you can look to the decision as

16

a whole, and see that the correct standard was

17

nevertheless applied, deference is still due.

18

The deference would still apply if you

If they have erroneously

We're concerned here with the

19

court of -- the role, if any, that a circuit court, that

20

opinions of courts other than this Court have in

21

determining whether law is clearly established.

22

Do you exclude entirely from the province of what

23

is proper for the Federal court to consider any court of

24

appeals, Federal court of appeals decisions?

25

MR. OTT:

Yes, we do, Your Honor.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that the only thing -- your

2

argument is the only thing that is proper to look to are

3

decisions of this Court, and that if you don't have a

4

case on all fours, as we have no buttons case, then

5

that's the end of it?

6

MR. OTT:

No, Your Honor.

We -- our position is

7

that a Federal habeas court may not look at all to state

8

or circuit authority on the question of what is clearly

9

established, only the holdings of this Court, and what

10

appears on their face.

11

If there's a general rule, such as here, the

12

question moves to the reasonable application prong.

13

And under that prong, because the rule is general, as

14

this Court stated in Yarborough versus Alvarado, the more

15

general the rule, the more leeway there is.

16

still lie under certain circumstances, but it's -- it

17

moves into a question of objective reasonableness of the

18

state court's decision.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Relief can

Suppose all of the -- suppose

20

there are five circuits.

They're the only ones that

21

looked at the issue.

22

general rule of the Supreme Court is as follows, isn't

23

that entitled to some weight?

24

cite that when you go to the Sixth Circuit court or you

25

go to the state court?

And they all say, we think the

You're not supposed to

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. OTT:

If Your Honor is speaking only to the

2

clearly established prong, my answer would be no.

3

circuit court says Jackson v. Virginia is clearly

4

established law on the sufficiency of the evidence, we

5

have no dispute with that.

6

Court's holdings beyond the face of those holdings, our

7

position is that cannot be done with state or circuit

8

law.

9

If a

Circuit law and state law may be relevant to the

10

question of reasonable application, but not on the first

prong.

13

reasonableness becomes a foregone conclusion.

14

two -- the two sections of the statute collapse into what

15

is essentially de novo review, as what happened here.

16

Once, for instance, the habeas court here decided that

17

its own circuit authority required -- or prohibited

18

buttons, reasonableness was a foregone conclusion, even

19

though it was addressed by the circuit.

20

If a Federal habeas court looks to circuit or

The

But in further response to your question, Your

21

Honor, our position is that on the reasonable application

22

prong, a Federal habeas court may look to state and

23

circuit cases.

24

should look to state and Federal circuit cases equally,

25

but not all those cases have the same relevance.

They are of varying relevance, but they

11

Alderson Reporting Company

We have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- there is a distinction between pre-AEDPA and

2

post-AEDPA cases, and the distinction between whether

3

those cases support or contradict the state court's

4

opinion.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So would there be any

6

difference if this had been a post-AEDPA -- if the

7

circuit precedent had been post-AEDPA.

8
9

MR. OTT:

There would be a difference, Your Honor.

The -- depending on the prong we're looking at, under --

10

our argument would still be the same under -- on the

11

clearly established prong of 2254(d)(1), that even if

12

Norris was a post-AEDPA case, that the circuit court

13

could not look to Norris to define this Court's holdings.

14

But Norris, if it were a post-AEDPA case would

15

have more relevance on the reasonable application prong.

16

There, stare decisis might come into play.

would be correct, but it would certainly be more

relevant.

MR. OTT:

Is that the test?

That is a test, the test, one of the

3

formulations of it.

4

differs from -- our position is it doesn't materially

5

differ from the general due process, fair trial standard

6

that applies in all cases.

7

I don't believe it materially

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but you should make it

8

more specific for us.

You say general due process.

9

does that work in this case?

How

I want to know whether or

10

not I can order or must order someone to remove a sign, a

11

button, a piece of clothing.

12
13

MR. OTT:

What's the test that I use?

Your Honor, it is an assessment of all

the circumstances, that if you're a trial judge -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -- unless you want to go

15

on, that doesn't help me.

16

the country to assess all the circumstances, we say no

17

more?

18

MR. OTT:

We just tell all the judges in

No, Your Honor.

Let's take the

19

impermissible factor test.

20

look at the circumstances before him and determine

21

whether he believes that there is an unacceptable risk of

22

impermissible factors coming into play.

23

The state court judge should

Whether the practice at issue, whether it be

24

buttons or ribbons or what have you, is so likely to

25

prejudice this defendant or violate or infringe on his
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fundamental rights that we need to order them removed.

2

Not just as a matter of supervisory power, but as a

3

constitutional requirement.

4

So it is a spectrum test, Your Honor.

And it's

5

essentially a totality test of the circumstances of the

6

buttons, let's say, and there can't be a bright line

7

rule.

8

Why couldn't there be here?

mean, at some point, at some point, seeing every judge in

10

this case say this is a thoroughly -- no, let me not

11

exaggerate.

12

For obvious reasons.

13

I

But they say wearing buttons is a bad idea.

Now, at some point, if enough judges say that,

14

each time they say, well, it is a bad idea, but we can't

15

say in this case that it was so prejudicial, there's that

16

inherent risk that it's unconstitutional.

17

point, if people begin enough is enough to say, this is

18

quite a bad idea to have buttons being worn in a

19

courtroom, which is not a place for demonstration, does

20

it not become pretty clear, irrespective of exactly what

21

opinions say what, that this is just very unfair and

22

unconstitutional?

23

MR. OTT:

But if some

Your Honor, my answer is no.

As a

24

supervisory matter, a state court can do whatever it

25

wishes.

Under the state constitution, state statutes,
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

state rules of court, can do many things under its

2

supervisory power or even state constitutional power.

3

That is different altogether, however, from saying

4

that all buttons violate the Constitution, which is

5

different in turn from saying all buttons require habeas

6

relief.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about banners?

MR. OTT:

Would it make sense to say all banners are banned from

a lot of sense.

Banners?
Yes.

Your Honor, I haven't seen a case

involving banners.

I imagine that -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think I know why.

Because it

affects the atmospherics of the trial.
MR. OTT:

And likewise, we don't see all the

button cases where the buttons have been precluded.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you also don't allow people

23

to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't

24

allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats.

25

Everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the

2

trial; isn't that right?

3

MR. OTT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe that's why we don't allow

5

banners, because a courtroom is not the place for

6

banners.

7

MR. OTT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

8

should not be confused with -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Absolutely right.

Decorum

Suppose you

10

think in this Federal court, which we are, that banners,

11

posters, and buttons are a thoroughly bad idea.

12

Now, why?

Not just because of decorum.

But

13

because they introduce an extraneous factor into the

14

judgment of the jury.

15

And suppose I also think -- I'm not saying I do,

16

I'm trying this out -- but it is pretty hard to draw

17

lines among buttons.

18

among banners.

19

in whole -- is to have a wholesale rule on this.

20

buttons, no banners, no petitions, no posters.

21
22

And the only way to guarantee fair trials
No

How would you explain -- you just say the law
just doesn't permit that.

23

MR. OTT:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

It is pretty hard to draw lines

that?

Well, Your Honor What do you want to say about

Because that is a concern I have.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. OTT:

I understand, Your Honor.

And this

2

Court obviously has the power to enact a prophylactic

3

rule that -- but a prophylactic rule covers many

4

unconstitutional as well as constitutional practices.

5

And that a prophylactic rule requires -- the prophylactic

6

rule that might be enacted would require preclusion of

7

buttons does not mean that all the buttons that might

8

come up are necessarily prejudicial.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not so sure.

You think that

10

we could just say we're going to exercise our best

11

judgment, not necessarily amend the Constitution, just

12

because it is a good idea, banners and buttons are hereby

13

banned forever?

14

that?

15

MR. OTT:

Do we have the authority to just say

Well, Your Honor, in this case, this

16

case has -- this Court granted certiorari on the question

of application of the AEDPA.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

So we are not asking --

We're exploring initially what

the rule ought to be.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

22

Supposing we all thought that this practice in this

23

particular case deprived the defendant of a fair trial,

24

but we also agreed with you that AEDPA prevents us from

25

announcing such a judgment.

What if we wrote an opinion

17

Alderson Reporting Company

saying it is perfectly clear there was a constitutional

2

violation here, but Congress has taken away our power to

3

reverse it.

Then a year from now, the same case arises.

we follow -- could the district court follow our dicta or

6

could it -- would it be constrained to say we don't know

what the Supreme Court might do?

under this Court's statement in Williams v. Taylor that

10

only the holdings, not the dicta, of this Court establish

We're not asking for a new rule applicable to buttons.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if the button had said --

2

the three buttons had said "Hang Musladin," would you say

3

that there was not -- there was not sufficiently clear

4

law from this Court to find that practice

5

unconstitutional under Justice Marshall's formulation.

6

MR. OTT:

Your Honor, it wouldn't change the

clearly established prong.

rule, but I think that your instance is one that all

judges would agree is so egregious that it falls within

We still have the general

the ambit of that, and would require habeas relief.

Falls within the ambit of what?

No, Your Honor.

My -- what I -- the

point I meant to make was that we're not urging that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. OTT:

All right.

It's a spectrum.

Well, as Mr. Chief Justice pointed out,

three family members of the victim sitting in the front

9

if anything, to the three victim's family members sitting

10

there grieving through a trial.

11

for instance, in this case -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They add very little,

I don't know whether they are

13

grieving or not, but I certainly know the sentiment that

14

they are trying to convey to the jury if they wear a

15

button that says "Hang Musladin."

a state court to conclude that those buttons did not add

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is it reasonable for a state

court to say that three family members sitting in a

MR. OTT:

At the guilt stage, that's right.

7

California statutes do require that victims' families be

able to make a statement at sentencing.

require that the victim's family, if the victim is not

the guilt phase of the trial.

any, is there any question in your mind that allowing the

family members to display this message to a jury

throughout the trial at the guilt stage is raising a

improper influences in reaching its verdict?

Is there any question?

MR. FERMINO:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:

I want to direct this Court's attention to the

state court opinion which appears at 55A to 78A of the

16

appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari in this

17

case.

18

It is 25 pages in length, but the portion of the opinion

dealing with the buttons issue is two pages in length.

20

I want Your Honors to take a look at that opinion.

Of those two pages, all but a few sentences deal

21

directly with the Norris case.

roughly page 72A in their -- 73A of the appendix.

of behavior by a courtroom spectator can be controlled by

You write for me the words I'm

supposed to put on paper to achieve your position.
MR. FERMINO:

Justice Breyer, I think that the

rule derived from the Williams and Flynn cases is that

7

courtroom -- courtroom behavior that creates an

8

unacceptable risk that impermissible factors have -- or

9

have caused a jury's verdict to be based not solely on

10

evidence introduced at trial is inherently prejudicial.

11

And unless it advances some important state

12

interest, some compelling state interest like the concern

13

that I believe Justice Ginsburg raised about the forcing

14

a defendant to appear in prison garb or the shackling

15

cases, that rule I think allows the opinion in this case

16

of the court below to not violate the prescriptions of

17

the AEDPA.

below did was essentially apply the rule that I just

19

discussed.

I think that's clear.

I think what the court

4

black gets closer to the kind of message import -- again,

5

the risk, not the reality -- that this case is -- that

6

the court below was concerned with.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think a defendant's -- excuse me, a victim's

No, my question is under

8

AEDPA, if the state court said, you know, I'm not going

9

to keep the family out even in mourning, that would

10

violate the clearly established rule that you've just

11

articulated?

12

MR. FERMINO:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Even if it didn't, though, I

14

suppose you could draw a line between people who were

doing what they naturally do, and some people do wear

be reminded of the person who died and sob.

18

case, they're going out of their way to do something that

19

people in mourning do not normally do.

20

MR. FERMINO:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22
23

But in this

That's correct.
And so you've got -- I think

you've got a stronger argument.
The problem that I have in this case is that,

24

number one, I view the wearing of the buttons, as I just

25

described it, as something that is abnormal and something
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that is intended to presumably get the jury's attention.

2

I don't know why otherwise they would be doing it.

3

And from whatever source, we do know that the

4

button was at least two inches wide and maybe larger.

5

So it's reasonable to suppose that the jury saw it and

6

understood perfectly that these were people who were

7

raising, in effect, an issue of sympathy.

8

understand that, and under the general rule out of

9

Williams and Flynn, it seems to me there's a pretty darn

I can

10

good argument for saying, yes, an unacceptable risk has

11

been raised of emotionalism in the jury's deliberations

12

as opposed to dispassionate consideration of courtroom

13

evidence.

14

What, however, do I make of the fact that not one

15

single court has ever reached that conclusion and -- you

16

know, as a constitutional matter?

17

of sort of being Jim, and they're all out of step with

18

Jim?

19

in relation to the fact that no other court seems to have

20

come to that conclusion.

21

of that?

22

Am I in the position

I'm raising a question about my own judgment

MR. FERMINO:

What do you think I should make

I think it is a factor to consider

23

in the Court's analysis.

However, I think the facts of

24

this case are unique precisely because this typically

25

doesn't -- we don't get this far because most trial
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judges don't allow this kind of conduct.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there have been -- haven't

3

there been court decisions that have held that buttons

4

didn't compromise a fair trial right?

5

MR. FERMINO:

That's correct.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So in assessing the

7

reasonableness of the California Supreme Court's

8

decision, how could we say Federal law was clearly

9

established when other courts considering our precedent

10

have gone the other way?

11

MR. FERMINO:

Because I think that under -- I

12

think that this Court looking at the "contrary to" prong

13

of the analysis would -- can come to a conclusion that

14

the state court's decision wasn't -- I'm getting ahead of

15

myself.

16

I think the Court can properly, in looking at it

17

from a "contrary to" analysis, come to the conclusion

18

that, even with that body of case law, that the state

19

court got it wrong, that it misapplied the clearly

20

established law of this Court.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't want to put your

22

23

9

unreasonable application.

10
11

So it's not contrary to clearly

We have cases stating the general

But "contrary to" seems an

awful stretch.
MR. FERMINO:

I wouldn't go -- Mr. Chief Justice,

12

I would not go as far as "an awful stretch," but I would

13

think that we, under the unreasonable application prong,

14

we certainly win.

15

under the "contrary to."

16

I think that there is also an argument

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The record is confusing, at

17

least as I read it -- please correct me if I'm wrong --

18

on the showing of how many days these buttons were worn.

19

A, is it clear from the record how many days the buttons

20

were worn?

21

MR. FERMINO:

It is not.

22

from the record how many days.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

It is not clear at all

So it may have been for just one

day of the trial?
MR. FERMINO:

It may have been.
40

the declarations that were submitted in the petition for

In his opinion on denial of

So what is it about these

particular buttons that's reflected in the record that

10

shows that it goes significantly beyond what would be

11

inferred just from that rather common feature of trials?

12

MR. FERMINO:

I think in looking at the rule again

13

derived from Williams and Flynn, we don't have to go

14

there.

15

what could be inferred, and we don't know what was in the

16

jurors' minds as they saw those buttons.

17

is that it could affect the outcome.

impermissible factor that causes the possibility that the

19

jurors' verdict is based on something other than the

20

evidence.

21

It's the risk, not the reality.

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't know

But the point

It is an

Why is there a greater risk?

Why

22

do the buttons convey -- involve a greater risk than the

23

kind of behavior that Judge Kleinfeld was referring to?

24
25

MR. FERMINO:

Because you can imagine as a juror

-- jurors are very attentive during trials -- that they
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

look out into the audience and see in the jury box -- I

2

mean, out in the audience, a group of people wearing

3

buttons.

4

What's the point of -- there's a degree of scrutiny

5

that's naturally going to occur by an attentive juror.

6

That's really the issue.

7

What are those buttons?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's on there?

Let's assume -- risk of what?

8

That's what I'm puzzled by.

Let's assume that the

9

buttons were big enough that they could recognize that

10

the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose

11

murder the trial was about.

12

risk is that?

Let's assume all that.

You know, during sentencing I can understand, oh,

It is the possibility that it could have an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there a real possibility that

4

a jury is going to say, since this man's -- this victim's

5

family loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?

6

MR. FERMINO:

But that's only one possible message

7

of this button.

the risk versus the reality.

9

message that's sent.

10

And again, that's where I'm contrasting

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's that it could be any

Do you have to depend on there

11

being a message?

Isn't it enough if there is an

12

influence that is conveyed?

13

problem was, was that there was as a result of the

14

obtrusive wearing of the button, that it created a risk

15

simply of an emotional approach to the determination of

16

guilt or innocence.

I mean, what I thought the

Perhaps they may be more likely to feel sorry for the

21

would be that improper influence of emotionalism as

opposed to a particular message that is the problem here,

23

isn't it?

that you've advanced.

I would agree with the argument

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. FERMINO:

Okay.

The -- I think it is important here

6

to look at the fact that no party in this case -- that

the state has not advanced that this is a practice that

It is clear that everyone

any other kind of introduction into the proceeding that

13

And I do believe if you look closely at the state

14

court opinion in this case, you will see that the court

15

below's opinion was correct, that they did not tease out

16

of the opinion or parse or apply any kind of tendentious

17

reading, when you look at exactly what the state court

decided.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's just because we
