(10:09 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

We'll hear

4

argument this morning in Case 09-337, Krupski v. Costa

5

Crociere, S.p.A.

6

Mr. Bendure.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. BENDURE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BENDURE:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case revolves around Rule 15(c)(1)(C)

11
12

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

In pertinent

13

part, if two subsections are -- are satisfied, the rule

14

permits relation back of an amendment adding a new

15

defendant after expiration of the limitations period.
The courts below found, and Respondent does

16
17

not question, that we satisfied the first subsection:

18

Notice and no prejudice.

19

the original complaint upon Costa Cruise, the agent and

20

corporate affiliate represented by the same attorney as

21

Respondent Costa Crociere.

That arose from the service of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

Do you know, Mr. Bendure,

23

what exactly the corporate relationship was between the

24

two?

25

MR. BENDURE:

No, Your Honor, not the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

corporate relation.

2

described in the affidavit is that Costa Cruise is the

3

booking agent for Costa Crociere.

4

procedure, according to the affidavit of Mr. Klutz,

5

Costa Cruise engaged the IRSI adjustment service to

6

resolve claims arising on the ship.

7

it was also, in our view, an agent of Costa Crociere.

8

But the specific corporate relationship is not known.

9

The functional relationship as

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. BENDURE:

And for the notice

So in that respect

Thank you.

Because of that timely service

11

on Costa Cruise, we satisfied the first subsection.

12

as this Court noted in Schiavone, timely service on one

13

defendant may serve to give imputed notice to a related

14

defendant, which is what we have here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

And

Counsel, your --

your client tripped over the cable, right?

17

MR. BENDURE:

Correct.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the case

19

were there were two people behind her and she was

20

pushed?

21

or Smith.

22

it because, of course, he's a key witness or whatever.

23

Can he be substituted later on because he was the person

24

she should have sued?

25

And she didn't know which one pushed her, Jones
So she sues Jones, and Smith knows all about

MR. BENDURE:

If you're talking about a lack

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of knowledge of the real name, probably --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

name.

4

is Johnson.

5

forget -- but one guy --

Not just the real

It's not that Jones pushed her, but his real name
It's that Jones -- whoever pushed her; I

6

(Laughter.)

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the people pushed

8

her, and she named that -- she named the other person.

9

made a mistake about who pushed her.

10

Can they have

substitution in that case?
MR. BENDURE:

11

I would say yes, because --

12

again, assuming that all of the other criteria are

13

satisfied.

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. BENDURE:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

Yes.

The non-pusher

has notice --

16

18

She

Yes.
-- and everything else.

But there's no relationship between the two of them.
MR. BENDURE:

It's -- it's obviously a

20

slightly different and more difficult case from our

21

perspective, but what I think is critical is the status

22

that's involved.

23

filed against the vessel operator, and that vessel

24

operator was identified as Costa Cruise, when we know

25

that the actual identity was Costa Crociere.

In this particular case, the suit was

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the first --

2

when was your first notice of that?

3

the first page of the ticket, but the answer came after

4

the statute of limitations.

5

that there was this different entity, or did you know

6

that earlier?

7

MR. BENDURE:

I mean, it was on

Was that your first notice

It was -- we say that was the

8

first notice.

Now, the circuit court used an imputed

9

knowledge rationale to suggest that the inclusion of the

10

name "Costa Crociere" within the definitions section

11

gave us what I would call constructive notice.

12

terms of actual knowledge that -- that we had sued the

13

wrong party, it was the answer which was filed after --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But in

Well, you don't -- I didn't

15

understand you to deny that the ticket made it very

16

clear who operated the ship.

17

MR. BENDURE:

I'm not sure --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. BENDURE:

Do you contest that?

I contest that it makes it

20

very clear, but I don't contest that one could conclude

21

that that provided constructive notice, that if read

22

carefully one might infer.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why not?

Don't you

read the contract carefully before you bring a lawsuit?
MR. BENDURE:

Well, actually it was under

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

definitions.

2

Crociere fell within the same definition of "carrier" as

3

the steward, the ship itself, any --

4

And according to the definitions, Costa

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you are -- you either

5

are contesting or you're not contesting that it's clear

6

from the ticket.

7

ticket.

8
9

I had assumed it was clear from the

MR. BENDURE:
that it's clear.

I'm not -- I am not agreeing

I am agreeing that it provides

10

constructive notice from which one might infer that.

11

Not clear, but discernible.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you had -- so then you

13

had notice even before the suit was filed.

14

the -- it was on the ticket.
MR. BENDURE:

15

We had what the circuit court

16

referred to as "imputed knowledge."

17

a -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

It was on

Now, I think there's

Did the -- did the name

19

show up any place other than page 1 of the general

20

conditions of passage?

21

MR. BENDURE:
Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't believe so, Your

what?

That's -- and this is

An 11-page, very small print -MR. BENDURE:

It's an 11-page, small print

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

document.

2

reference is under the designation "Definitions,"

3

because Respondent makes some hay out of the fact that

4

we complied with other requirements which are under a

5

different heading which says "Limitations of liability."

6

And one thing that bears mention is that

But what we also had was that we purchased

7

the ticket from Costa Cruise; it was sent by Costa

8

Cruise.

9

Cruise, responded by the -- the gentleman under the

10

heading "Costa" that says "claims administrator for

11

Costa Cruise."

12

conflicting information at best about which was the name

13

of the actual vessel operator.

We had the pre-suit notice sent to Costa

So there was certainly what I would call

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Not -- not if you read the

15

definitions on page 1.

16

all 11 pages before you file suit, I would think you

17

would at least read page 1.

18

made it clear.

19

MR. BENDURE:

And if you are not going to read

And that, it seems to me,

Well, it -- well, under the

20

same definition, the steward would be a carrier every

21

bit as much as Costa Crociere, S.p.A.

22

by that reasoning you could conclude that the steward or

23

the janitor is the vessel operator because they are

24

likewise defined as the carrier in that definitional

25

section.

8
Alderson Reporting Company

So it seems to me

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And, in fact, it also includes the vessel

2

itself within the definition.

So let's assume that my

3

client had, instead of suing Costa Cruise, sued Costa

4

Magica, the name of the vessel itself.

5

cases would say that an amendment like that to add the

6

actual name, once you have identified the status of the

7

defendant you seek to sue, falls within the

8

subsection (ii), which is addressed primarily to the

9

constructive notice of the defendant, that they knew or

Most of the

10

should have known that they would have been brought in

11

the suit but for a mistake concerning the proper party's

12

identity.

13

But the general focus of that second subsection,

14

I think, is to look to whether this defendant knew or

15

should have known that it was the intended target.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me -- I've been

17

thinking about the Chief Justice's question where the two

18

people are pushed and you don't know which person -- or

19

two people fired the shotgun, and there's only one pellet,

20

and you don't know which gun the pellet came from.

21

that case, I think we could stipulate that even by

22

reasonable inquiry, you wouldn't know.

23

In

In your case, I think the -- and I think the

24

difference in the case is that "reasonable inquiry"

25

means you should have known.

So now we have a rule that

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

excuses something you should have known but doesn't

2

excuse something you -- you couldn't have known, which

3

seems odd.

4

that's why it only applies to clerical errors.

5

And because it's odd, therefore, maybe

MR. BENDURE:

Well, actually when it talks

6

of mistake, it seems to me that the very notion of

7

mistake connotes error.

8

definitions, dictionary definitions.

9

defines a mistake as, quote, "a wrong judgment" or,

10

quote, "a wrong action or statement proceeding from

11

faulty judgment, inadequate knowledge, or inattention."

12

So, at least in that colloquial sense, the very nature of

13

mistake implies some measure of blameworthiness.

14

I looked at a couple of
Merriam Webster's

And, indeed, it's hard to conceive of a

15

mistake that couldn't be avoided.

And I think that's

16

the problem with looking to the ticket, because what the

17

definition on the ticket essentially says is:

18

diligence, you might have avoided the mistake.

With due

19

But in my view, and I think in the view of

20

the language of the rule, that doesn't change the very

21

nature of it as being a mistake.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. BENDURE:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Counsel --

Certainly.
-- assume I accept

your argument, and I am the cruise operator -- the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cruise owner, cruise ship owner, and I look at the

2

complaint, and I say:

3

but -- I think.

4

the period in which I am supposed to reasonably know

5

that I would have been named absent a mistake, here an

6

answer is filed, and you are told there is a mistake,

7

and you don't correct the mistake.

8

would a reasonable person at that second juncture make

9

about whether you made a mistake or not?

I think they really meant me,

Now, within the 4(m) period, which is

10

MR. BENDURE:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What conclusion

I think -And I think that's what

12

the issue is here, which is, assuming the complaint

13

could be read as a mistake during the 4(m) period,

14

wasn't that mistake corrected, and you refused or failed

15

to act?

16

MR. BENDURE:

Let me respond both legally

17

and factually.

18

difference because under the text of the rule if during

19

that 4(m) period they had the knowledge that you're

20

suggesting and which would be suggested by the

21

Respondent when they say, I think, if you had filed the

22

amended complaint and served it a month after the answer,

23

it would have been timely, we would have done it.

24
25

Legally, I submit that it doesn't make a

That acknowledges that there was a mistake,
and once there is a mistake, if during that 120-day

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

period they knew or should have known that it would have

2

been brought against them but for the mistake, that

3

knowledge doesn't evaporate by later events, as long as

4

there is knowledge during that period.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That makes so little

6

sense to me.

Here I think -- and for the following

7

reason:

8

if you had sought to amend a year later, that that would

9

have been timely, correct?

You seriously I don't think could contend that

10

MR. BENDURE:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

Correct.
All right.

But putting

aside prejudice --

13

MR. BENDURE:

Okay.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- what the lower court

15

said was because your delay speaks to a choice, that

16

that's the only thing a reasonable defendant would have

17

assumed, that having been told that you sued the wrong

18

party and you continued in that action, that that's what

19

you intended to do, to sue that wrong party.

20

MR. BENDURE:

Let me point out factually --

21

and I did not stress it in my brief.

22

filed on February 25th.

23

March 20th, the court entered a scheduling order which

24

said:

25

complaint to add parties.

The answer was

Twenty-three days later, on

You have until the end of June to amend your

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So it seems to me that a defendant faced

2

with a court order that says the time for amendment

3

extends till the end of June would not be drawing any

4

conclusions that the plaintiff's state of mind had

5

changed.

6

different points during the 120-day period is that it

7

seems to me you'd have a constantly moving target.

8
9

And one difficulty with trying to look at

If you say that we satisfied 120(m) at one
point in time but somehow that's not enough and at a

10

later point in time maybe they didn't know it any more,

11

and then perhaps I guess in theory you could have them

12

again -- if we had sent them a letter even after that and

13

said, you know, we really did mean it, and then for some

14

reason they concluded otherwise, you'd have a constantly

15

moving target.

16

And that's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Bendure, would you

17

explain one factual matter to me?

18

this wrong, but I thought the answer was filed after the

19

1 year had run.

20

MR. BENDURE:

It had.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I might have gotten

It had.

So when the answer was

22

filed it was too late for you to come within the statute

23

of limitations.

24

MR. BENDURE:

Absolutely true.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I thought that would be

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the answer that you would give to Justice Sotomayor,

2

because when you got the answer -- which was filed after

3

how many days?
MR. BENDURE:

4
5

It was filed I think 24 days

after the complaint.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

If you had gotten that a

7

few days earlier, you could have amended, and then we

8

wouldn't be here.
MR. BENDURE:

9
10

Honor.

That's certainly true, Your

And I think it also -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

I'm sorry.

You have

12

120 days to amend, don't you, from the filing of the

13

complaint?
MR. BENDURE:

14
15

No, Your Honor.

is the time frame for the notice to the defendant.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. BENDURE:

18

The 120 days

Right.

It -- 120 days after the amended

complaint is our time for service of the amended --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. BENDURE:

Complaint.

-- complaint on the new defendant.

21

But I think the point that is raised by Justice Ginsburg is

22

this:

23

expired, school's out.

24

thereafter -- if we hadn't made a mistake -- we couldn't

25

amend 1 day after expiration of the limitation period.

Once we find out and the limitation period has already
If we tried to amend immediately

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So if we had acted immediately, we still

2

don't get relation back unless we've satisfied the two

3

criteria of the subsections.

4

within the 120-day period, then we fall in the safe

5

haven provided by the rule whether the amendment itself

6

occurs 1 week, 3 weeks, or 7 weeks afterwards.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if we do satisfy those

That --

But the basic point is

8

the answer didn't come in until you were already out

9

under the statute of limitations.

10

MR. BENDURE:

Correct.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So from their point of

12

view, nothing else matters; you were out when they filed

13

their answer, and you could do nothing to cure that.

14
15
16

MR. BENDURE:

We could do nothing to, as a

matter of right, file within the limitation period.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did your amended complaint

17

contain any new and material allegations other than the

18

name correction?

19

MR. BENDURE:

It actually was a second

20

count, but it was the same allegations against Costa

21

Crociere that had been made against Costa Cruise.

22

did not amend the theories of liability.

23

getting back to the question of status and theories, I

24

think that's the critical distinction between this case

25

and the cases they rely upon, Ish Yerushalayim and

15
Alderson Reporting Company

We

And, again,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

things like that, where you're changing from an

2

individual defendant to an institutional defendant or

3

vice versa on a different theory.

4

couldn't mistake an individual for an institution.

5

And, of course, you

And that I think is the line of demarcation

6

that we're asking the Court to draw, and it explains

7

why in the lower courts the decisions which present our

8

paradigm all or virtually all allow relation back;

9

whereas, those that seek to amend a change from an

10

individual to a corporation or vice versa often don't

11

permit relation back.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought that the only

13

condition was that it had to arise out of the same event

14

or transaction, which would give you much more running

15

room than -- than what you assert.

16

MR. BENDURE:

Only if you're amending

17

against the same defendant.

18

defendant, you have to satisfy (i) and (ii), which look

19

to the notice and reason to know of the new defendant.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you are adding a new

Mr. Bendure, in addition

21

to the mailing of the ticket -- the mailing of the

22

ticket came; it said "Costa Cruise" -- were there any

23

other connections between the plaintiff passenger and

24

Costa Cruise beyond the ticket coming in an envelope

25

that says "Costa Cruise"?

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BENDURE:

There was the -- the pre-suit

2

claims notice which was sent to Costa Cruise at the

3

Florida address, in attempted compliance with the

4

provision of the ticket which says you must file notice

5

to the carrier before filing suit.

6

that within 185 days.

7

And you have to do

So we not only got the ticket from Costa

8

Cruise -- we bought it from Costa Cruise -- the ticket

9

itself, if you look at I think it's 25a of the

10

appendix to the petition for certiorari, there is a

11

prominent page which says "Costa Cruise, cruise company"

12

next to a picture of the vessel.

13

So we have that.

Then when we filed the notice, we sent it to

14

Costa Cruise, we get a letter back from a person who

15

claims to be in a position to resolve the liability of

16

the vessel over -- owner, signed by him as claims

17

administrator for Costa Cruise.

18

Those are the things -- oh, and then we

19

have, prior to the commencement of suit, the

20

Internet investigation about which Florida company is

21

registered to do business in the State of Michigan, and

22

we look at the Costa Cruise Web site, which says:

23

Crociere with several offices in several countries,

24

United States office, Costa Cruise, Florida."

25

"Costa

So those are some of the things which give

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rise to the mistake --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Bendure, can -- can I

3

come back to your -- I'm not sure why it matters, but it

4

seems to me you're giving too narrow an interpretation,

5

and I would not like our opinion to read any more

6

narrowly than the statute allows.

7

It seems to me that if you assert a

8

different claim arising out of the same transaction, you

9

would be able to amend.

If you will look at (c)(1)(C),

10

which is what you're asserting here, right?

(C)(1)(C)

11

says, "the amendment changes the party or the naming of

12

party against whom the claim is asserted, if Rule

13

15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied."

14

and it says, "the amendment asserts a claim or defense

15

that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence

16

set out."

Then you go back to (1)(B)

17

It doesn't say it has to be the same claim.

18

MR. BENDURE:

19
20

satisfy that.

There's no question we

Everybody agrees.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that.

21

why I don't understand why you're arguing a more

22

narrow -- a more narrow interpretation.

23

MR. BENDURE:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

That's

Because I'm forced to -It seems to me you're home

free with (B).

18
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BENDURE:

2

on and says:

3

and (ii).

4
5

Unfortunately, (C) then goes

"And if, within the period provided," (i)

So -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, yes, but -- but those

are the only things we -- we have to argue about.

6

MR. BENDURE:

That's correct.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's no doubt that you

claim, it certainly arose out of the same transaction or

Certainly.

No question about

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT S. GLAZIER
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

Thank you, counsel.

MR. GLAZIER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are, we suggest, two issues before the

23
24

Court:

The first is the legal question of whether a

25

plaintiff's knowledge about the identity of the proper

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

party can preclude a finding that there was a mistake

2

concerning the identity of the proper party.

3

suggest, is in some ways the easier issue, because there

4

are -- there's abundant authority from the circuit

5

courts of appeal and from this Court in Nelson v. Adams

6

USA, where the Court said the rule requires a mistake.

7

In that case, there was no mistake.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That, we

Mr. Glazier -It's no mistake if you

10

happen to know it, if you happen to know who the right

That's a different matter.

My wife told me to turn left and I turned right, okay?

MR. GLAZIER:

Well -So that's a different

12

matter.

Where does it say that he did know the facts as

13

opposed to he should have known the facts?
MR. GLAZIER:

14

The circuit court refers --

was no need for imputed knowledge in this case.

point.

Where does it say that on 19a?

10

MR. GLAZIER:

but it says, "Her failure to timely named Costa Crociere

12

as defendant was not the result of a mistake."

It does not

Well, I -- I know.

I would

elementary mistake of the English language in thinking

that when a person doesn't know something but should

have known it, that that's inconsistent with a mistake.

That's the very definition of a mistake.

Costa Crociere is parent, and I

believe there's a corporation below them, and then that

corporation owns Costa Cruise Lines.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When it's below them, you

18

mean it owns all the shares in its -- in its subsidiary

19

company?

20

MR. GLAZIER:

Yes.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know, the -- the

22

definition of carrier includes independent contractors.

23

I mean -- I -- I would -- other than that they are more

Cruise is at least an independent contractor with which

Costa Crociere does business.
MR. GLAZIER:

There might be more than one

It is the first -- it is the first person listed.

5

Crociere is the carrier.

6

reads the first page of the ticket, one might have

7

questions about whether there might be some other

entities that are carriers, but there is simply no doubt

that Costa Crociere is the carrier.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I want to ask you

21

about that, because in your brief you refer in your

22

footnote on page 6 to requirements of the Federal

23

Government 44101-44103.

24

discovered that 44103 says that it is a requirement, and

25

you say you follow these requirements, that you shall

So I looked those up.

36
Alderson Reporting Company

I

establish under regulations of the FMC financial

2

responsibility.
And those regulations tell you that, at

3
4

least as best I could read them, that you must furnish a

5

written designation of a person in the United States as

6

a legal agent for service of process, and they are

7

referring to instances in which somebody on a ship

8

suffered an accident.

9

So since you say that you are complying with

10

that, I would like to know the name and address of that

11

person in the United States for whom you must send legal

12

process, because if obviously that had been on the

13

ticket, that is precisely the man to whom this plaintiff

14

would have sent the notice.
MR. GLAZIER:

15
16

I cannot answer the question

now.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well then, were you correct

18

when you said in your -- in your brief that this company

19

which you represent does comply with 44103?
MR. GLAZIER:

20

My understanding is the answer

21

is yes, but I cannot address the specific question.

22

I submit --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is relevant, I think,

24

because it adds to the confusion if they are under a

25

legal requirement to have a service -- an agent to

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

receive service, and then they not only don't do it, but

2

they don't have it printed on the ticket.

3

everybody mixed up by having the same name in English,

4

or a very similar one, and announcing someone you're

5

supposed to serve, and then it turns out to be not that

6

person you're supposed to serve.

7

person that you can't find.

8

MR. GLAZIER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

And they get

It's a mysterious

But the question, though -It seems odd.

I'd like

to know what the explanation is of this.
MR. GLAZIER:

Well, the question is not a

12

more generalized blame explanation, but under the rule,

13

the language of the rule, whether Costa Crociere knew or

14

should have known that the action would have been

15

brought against it but for a mistake concerning the

16

proper party's identity.

17

And the most problematic case -- part of the

18

case for the plaintiff is why, when they were told in

19

the answer that they had not sued the proper party, that

20

Costa Cruise Lines was not the carrier, was not the

21

operator, but Costa Crociere is, why did the plaintiff

22

not do anything?

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we -- let's clarify

24

that point now.

I am looking at 3a, which is the court

25

of appeals opinion, and it says that "Costa Crociere

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

moved to dismiss, arguing that it had been sued after

2

the 1-year ticket period allowed for claims set

3

forth" -- as set forth in the ticket.

4

tells us that you have this much time to serve, and

5

then the complaint will -- the -- the amendment will

6

relate back to the date of the original filing.

Then the rule

It doesn't change your statement, your

defense.

The 1-year statute of limitations isn't

9

affected.

What is affected is the complaint will

10

relate back if there's an amendment filed.

11

1-year statute of limitations remains, and you didn't

12

bother to answer until the -- that time had run.
MR. GLAZIER:

13

But the

But if -- if, during the

14

120-day period -- you know, the Rule 15(c) happens to

15

rely upon the measuring point, but service is not the crucial

16

point.

17

done anything, anything at all, to indicate that she had

18

not sued Costa Crociere because of a mistake, then the

19

complaint would have related back, a very easy case.

Within that 120-day period, if the plaintiff had

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

Yes, but the relation

Why does that even matter?

5

I'm not really sure I'm following this argument.

8

solo practitioner, and he or she is out of the office

because the lawyer's on a cruise --

It's still a mistake.

knowledge or actual knowledge?

20

MR. GLAZIER:

It just talks about a mistake.

We do not rely at all upon

21

imputed knowledge.

22

don't think there is imputed knowledge here.

23

The Court granted review, but we

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, where -- just -- where do

24

you -- where in the rule is there anything that relates to the

25

reasonableness of the mistake?

What if it is the most

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

foolish, negligent mistake you can possibly imagine?

2

it not still a mistake?
MR. GLAZIER:

3

Is

The rule contemplates by its

4

structure that the mistake will be the cause of the

5

reason why the -- the plaintiff did not sue the parties.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's not what the

7

rule says.

That's not what the rule says.

The rule

8

doesn't talk about what kind of mistake or why.

The

9

rule says what the defendant should have known.

And so,

10

when you read this complaint, it's very clear you know

11

you're the carrier.

12

MR. GLAZIER:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You know cruise -- the

14

other line, the sales agent, can't be the carrier,

15

correct?

16

MR. GLAZIER:

We --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's either a factual

18

or a legal mistake.

There is no other way to read that

19

other than that there is a mistake.

20

MR. GLAZIER:

And then --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because -- then have you

22

to answer Justice Breyer's question, which is:

23

conceivable reason that is not either negligence or

24

unintentional or inadvertent or just plain stupidity,

25

however you want to define it, that someone who is

41
Alderson Reporting Company

What

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

injured would want to name a party who wasn't

2

responsible for the injury?
MR. GLAZIER:

3

The most powerful evidence is

4

simply when they were informed of the claimed mistake,

5

they did nothing for 95 days to indicate in any manner

6

whatsoever that it was a mistake.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

They had --

Well, that's evidence from

8

which the absence of a mistake might be inferred.

9

agree with that, but that doesn't establish that it

10

I

wasn't -- it wasn't a mistake.
MR. GLAZIER:

11

Well, this -- whether

12

something is a mistake ultimately is a factual issue.

13

There's a legal question of whether a plaintiff's

14

knowledge of the identity of a proper party can preclude

15

a finding of mistake.

But once we get past that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

But, counsel, don't --

17

what you're really talking about is whether once the

18

answer was filed, they were dilatory in making their

19

motion.

20

day you received this complaint, you didn't understand

21

that some sort of mistake had been made.

22

I don't understand how you can argue that the

The day that the answer came in, you might

23

start to have a doubt because of their delay in the

24

motion to amend, but doesn't that go to a 15(a)

25

question, whether the judge should have given leave to

42
