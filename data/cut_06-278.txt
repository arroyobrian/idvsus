MR. STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Illegal drugs and the glorification of the

13

nation.

time and again.

17

McCaffrey, Secretary Bennett, and a number of

the school can make any rule that it wants on any

The argument is that this Court

boards considerable discretion both in identifying the

10

educational mission and to prevent disruption of that

11

mission, and this is disruptive of the mission -

the same reaction, that this was demeaning to the

22

Olympics and it was unruly conduct, that there would be

23

a protected right under Tinker because the message was

24

not promoting drugs?

25

MR. STARR:

She stated in her answers to
5


Alderson Reporting Company

interrogatories that she may very well not have

2

interfered with the banner had it in fact said legalize

3

marijuana.

4

interfered with that because it was disruptive to the

5

event, it was disorderly to the event itself, but the -

6

Under our theory, we think she could have

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What would be disorderly?

7

I don't understand this disorder.

If somebody holds up

8

a sign and says change the marijuana laws, why is it

9

disruptive of anything, simply because the school quite

10

naturally has said we support the enforcement of the

11

law, and the law right now does forbid the use of

12

marijuana.

13

MR. STARR:

I -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's political speech, it

15

seems to me.

I don't see what it disrupts, unless

16

disruption simply means any statement of disagreement

17

with a position officially adopted by the school.

18

that what you mean by disruption?

19

MR. STARR:

No.

Is

Your Honor, first of all,

MR. STARR:

I apologize.

The Court can

2

certainly decide this on very narrow grounds, that there

3

are certain substances, illegal drugs, we would include

4

alcohol and tobacco, that's part of the school's policy,

5

because those are illegal substances which are very

6

injurious to health.

7

Bernonia and in Earls, time and again, it is that these

8

are very dangerous substances and we have a clear policy

9

sanctioned by Congress, and also noted by courts across

And this Court has noted that in

10

the country, that illegal drugs are so dangerous that

11

schools are entitled to have a message going -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the problem -

13

the problem, Mr. Starr, is that school boards these days

14

take it upon themselves to broaden their mission well

15

beyond education or protection from illegal substances,

16

and several of the briefs have pointed out school boards

17

have adopted policies taking on the whole range of

18

political issues.

19

content of speech on all of those issues simply because

20

they have adopted that as the part of their educational

21

mission?

22

Now, do they get to dictate the

MR. STARR:

No, because that may very well

23

be inconsistent with Tinker.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think that

2

-- I think you're right about that, and I guess my

3

question goes to how broadly we should read Tinker.

4

mean, why is it that the classroom ought to be a forum

5

for political debate simply because the students want to

6

put that on their agenda?

7

agenda is a little bit different and includes things

8

like teaching Shakespeare or the Pythagorean Theorem,

9

and just because political speech is on the student's

I

Presumably the teacher's

10

agenda, I'm not sure that it makes sense to read Tinker

11

so broadly as to include protection of those, that

12

speech.

13

MR. STARR:

This Court has not read Tinker

14

quite so broadly in both Frazier and in Kuhlmeier, and

15

there are a couple of aspects of Tinker that I think are

16

worthy of note.

17

there, so there was an issue of standardless discretion

18

being exercised.

19

One, that there was no written policy

And also -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it may have made a

20

difference in Tinker.

If the school had a policy,

21

defend our troops in Vietnam, would that have brought

22

this into the category that you are now carving out?

23

You said that Tinker had no policy, but suppose the

24

school did have a policy, patriotism, we support our

25

troops, no bad speech about the war in Vietnam.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Should

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Tinker have come out the other way?

2

MR. STARR:

No, it should not, because there

3

-- I think there are concerns with respect to what this

4

Court has identified it is trying to, even in the public

5

school setting, quite apart from the university setting,

6

to cast a pall of orthodoxy to prevent the discussion of

7

ideas.

8

it can be decided very narrowly, that drugs, alcohol and

9

tobacco just have no place in the schools.

What is happening here of course in this case,

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -

Yes, but the rule you

11

proposed, I thought, in response to my question is that

12

the school has wide discretion to define its educational

13

mission and it can restrict speech that's inconsistent

14

with that mission.

15

MR. STARR:

And that's what this Court in -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it seems to me that's

17

much broader than Tinker.

18

an exception for political speech.

19

you're right with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, let's

20

suppose that they have a particular view on a political

21

issue, No Child Left Behind, or foreign intervention and

22

so forth.

23

MR. STARR:

Now you said, well, there is
Well, but then

Justice Kennedy, the words that

24

you articulated are essentially quotes of Frazier and

25

Kuhlmeier, so there is a broadening of the lens and a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

restoration, frankly, of greater school discretion in

2

those two cases than one might see in Tinker.

3

course drew, as you well know, from Justice Black's

4

warning in dissent of Tinker that the Federal courts,

5

Federal judiciary should not be extending itself unduly

6

into the work of the school boards' -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do we have to get into

the question of what the school board's policy is and

MR. STARR:

Of course.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. STARR:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is not -

Of course it would, so -

The answer is yes.
Why can't we decide this

19

case on that narrow enough ground, that any school

20

whether it has expressed the policy or not, can suppress

21

speech that advocates violation of the law?

22

MR. STARR:

I think it can, but it raises

23

some interesting potential hypothetical questions, what

24

about listening to the voice of Martin Luther King

25

Junior, conscientious objection and so forth.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think the Court needs to stray into those areas because

2

here we have a written policy which does in fact respond

3

to concerns about the exercise of standardless

4

discretion.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does it have -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just clear up one

7

thing to be 100 percent sure I understand your position.

8

It does -- the message is the critical part of this

9

case.

If it was a totally neutral message on a 15-foot

10

sign, that would be okay.

11

signs are disruptive?

12
13

MR. STARR:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We're not saying that
And so we're focusing on

the message and that's the whole crux of the case.

16
17

Not inherently disruptive, but

in fact -- the answer is yes.

15

You're not saying 15-foot

MR. STARR:

That's why this case is here

because of the message.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. STARR:

5

You just said suppose -

10

it, necessarily.

Is that a correct statement of the law or not?

because what we know about this case is that, and you're

4

of practical, real world sense, disruptive of anything.

5

And if there is such a question, shouldn't the answer

6

favor the right to, to make the speech as opposed to

7

favor the right to suppress it?

And there is a real question as to

8

MR. STARR:

Your Honor, the answer is no.

9

We do think that if the test that this Court

10

has articulated which we embrace, looks not simply to

11

"disruption" but inconsistency with what this Court has

12

focused -- this Court's language, the basic educational

13

mission, then surely -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Let me, let me

have a policy that forbids violating the law and calling

19

for violations of the law.

Because in response to Justice Scalia's question

Advocacy of

illegal conduct generally; more specifically advocacy of

illegal drugs.

to recognize that this Court's precedents recognize -

recognize several different justifications for

dealt with political speech, the Court was careful to

21

point out that even then, if the speech could be shown

22

to present a threat of a material disruption to the

class work, and I think this would answer your question,

she?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

This isn't, the principal

No.

And -- and, and

7

just to finish, in Tinker even with a viewpoint concern,

8

the Court said if you could show material disruption,

9

and --- and the Court made that clear in Tinker, by, by

10

its comparison to several lower court decisions where

11

wearing buttons had been prohibited because they had

12

caused disruption.

13

itself was where there would be an intrusion upon the

14

rights of other students to be secure and be let alone.

15

That's Tinker dealing with political speech.

16

And the third category in Tinker

17

identified additional categories of speech that could be

18

governed by the school, and this is in footnote 4 of

question of whether there would be disruption or whether

could be inconsistent with the school's mission and

prohibited on that basis?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

if the button is legalize marijuana during a referendum

6

in the State, then that, that might be the category of

7

political speech that could not be regulated.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

encourage the use of illegal drugs.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Given the fact

that this is a First Amendment case, isn't a court

18

forced into the position if it's going to be consistent

19

with what else we have said, even at the final appellate

20

level, of giving pretty careful scrutiny to the

21

statement itself in determining whether it may be

22

suppressed or punished?

One sense is disrupting the

Now, you think both of them, however, are

bad and both of them can be a basis for suppressing the

speech?

19

MR. MERTZ:

If I understand your question

20

correctly, the second of them might better be called

21

allowing competing viewpoints.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you think undermining is

perfectly okay?

be disruption and therefore bad?

25

You would never consider undermining to

MR. MERTZ:

I think undermining in the sense

of preventing impeding the school from delivering its

own message -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MERTZ:

Okay, but only that.

-- would be substantial

disruption.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right after a class on

7

drugs, he can be standing there in the hall and say:

8

This class was ridiculous, drugs are good for you, I use

9

them all the time, I urge all of you.

10

okay?

That's not undermining?

11
12

MR. MERTZ:

I believe that is the kind of

speech -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. MERTZ:

15

That's perfectly

That's not disruption?

-- that we must tolerate no

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But couldn't the school,

17

couldn't the school board have a time, place, or manner

18

regulation that says you're not going to use the halls

to proselytizer for your cause, whatever it may be?

20

MR. MERTZ:

I believe that's correct.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You could have reasonable

22

rules of decorum for what goes on inside the school

23

building.

24

MR. MERTZ:

Right.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Does the school have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to be completely neutral in that respect?

2

to punish who says that was a good program, I'm not

3

going to use drugs, and you shouldn't either, because

4

he's taking position on a public issue?

5

MR. MERTZ:

Does it have

I think a content neutral,

6

content neutrality is critical here, and if the school

7

wants to allow anti-drug comments, messages, then it has

8

an outside of the official forum -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where does that

10

notion that our schools have to be content neutral -- I

11

thought we wanted our schools to teach something,

12

including something besides just basic elements,

13

including the character formation and not to use drugs.

14

They have to be neutral on whether you should use drugs

15

or not?

MR. MERTZ:

17

speech is suppressed or punished.

MR. MERTZ:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not my vision of

what a school is.

8
9

I don't believe that's the case

at all, Your Honor.

6
7

And you're turning it into an open forum.

MR. MERTZ:

In the classroom delivering the

prescribed messages, in the school assemblies, when the

10

school wishes to present a particular message, that's

11

one case.

12

across the street, that is a quintessentially open forum

13

where it would not be proper, I think, to tell students

14

you may not mention this subject, you may not take this

15

position.

16

However, in the lunchroom, outside in recess,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But do you concede that

17

there was some right of school control for what was

18

going on across the street?

19

MR. MERTZ:

No.

Actually our primary

20

position on that is that he was in a public place at a

21

public event among public people -

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If kids were throwing

23

bottles and injuring passers by, the principal had no

24

right or duty to go over there and stop it?

25

MR. MERTZ:

Oh, I think if they were

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's because the

school has a right of control.

4

MR. MERTZ:

There is a distinction here.

5

This young man had not been in school today, had not

6

been an campus, was not in any class that was released

he went?

10

MR. MERTZ:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Why did he go where

Pardon?
Why did he choose

that location to unfurl his banner?

13

MR. MERTZ:

He explained because it was the

14

only place where he actually knew the route of the

15

relay.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I mean, that's -- I

17

have, I guess his note, you accept this with what the

18

teacher said.

Individual students -- this is at 9:30 in the morning.

20

They were not given the option of remaining in class,

21

nor were they released to do as they pleased.

22

to watch the relay with the rest of the student body,

23

either just in front of the school or just across the

24

street -- that's me, not them -- and then return

25

directly to their classrooms, which I guess the school

So it sounds like you're going to one place, stand

together, behave yourselves, watch the relay, and the

teachers will be there and take you back to class.

is there something else in the record that suggests

something different?

2

there were no findings, actually no factual findings at

3

all, and certainly nothing on that particular point.

4
5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can I ask you another

record point, just so I know where to look?

6

MR. MERTZ:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

You've also asked for an

8

injunction that would require expunging his 5-day

9

suspension from his record.

10

MR. MERTZ:

Correct.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

10 days.

Well, 10 or 5,

12

unclear.

13

page 66A when he's reviewing this, what he says is,

14

"Joseph contends that all his behavior is excusable

15

because he was exercising his free of speech right.

16

Even if I were to concede his speech across from the

17

high school is protected, which I do not, the rest of

18

his behavior warranted the suspension."

19

says, "And I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5.

20

that, if you win, suppose you were to win, and you -

21

that it is protected and so forth -- then would you

22

concede or not concede the suspension, the 5 days, it's

23

over, it still stands, I don't care about the

24

expungement or not?

25

I noticed the superintendent of schools on

MR. MERTZ:

And then he
So given

The -- whether it remains on the
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

record, anything that remains on his record is obviously

2

much more -

3
4

JUSTICE BREYER:
think about it.

5
6

No, but I'm asking that you

I'm putting you on the spot.

MR. MERTZ:

In that case, I missed the point

of your -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to know what the

8

superintendent said.

9

don't care if this was protected or not.

I'll give you

10

that.

11

the way he treated the principal, what he did, the

12

reluctance, et cetera, et cetera, that warrants a

13

suspension too, and I'm cutting it from 10 days to 5.

14

So it sounds to me as I read it that the teacher is

15

saying even if you're right, he's still suspended for 5

16

days.

17

It's protected.

As I read it is, he says, look, I

But the rest of his behavior,

That's what the superintendent says.
Now suppose you win your point that you're

18

interested in winning, which you may not or you may.

19

Are you still then going to pursue this case on the 5

20

days, that that should be erased?

21

MR. MERTZ:

If the only thing left were

22

discipline because he was tardy that day, was -- didn't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can we get back to

14

what the case is about.

You think the law was so

15

clearly established when this happened that the

16

principal, that the instant that the banner was

17

unfurled, snowballs are flying around, the torch is

18

coming, should have said oh, I remember under Tinker I

19

can only take the sign down if it's disruptive.

20

then under Frazier I can do something if it interferes

21

with the basic mission, and under Kuhlmeier I've got

22

this other thing.

23

point that she could not take the banner down, and it

24

was so clear that she should have to pay out of her own

25

pocket because of it.

But

So she should have known at that

48
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MERTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, there are two

2

different time points we have to talk about.

There's

3

the heat of the moment out there on the street, but then

4

later back in the office when she actually decided to

5

levy the punishment after she had talked to him, after

6

she heard why he did it and why he didn't do it, after

7

she had had a chance to consult with the school

8

district's counsel.

9

her office, then she should indeed have known it.

At that point in the calmness of
And

10

she did testify that she had taken a master's degree

11

course in school law in which she studied Kuhlmeier and

12

Frazier and Tinker.

13

So -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so it should be

14

perfectly clear to her exactly what she could and

couldn't do.

MR. MERTZ:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE SOUTER:

As it is to us, right?

I mean, we have had a

2

Should the teacher have known, even in the, in the calm

3

deliberative atmosphere of the school later, what the

4

correct answer is?

5

MR. MERTZ:

We believe at the very least she

6

should have known that one cannot punish a nondisruptive

7

holding of a sign because it said something you

8

disagreed with.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course I disagree with

10

the characterization on disruptive.

11

disruptive of the message, of the theme that the school

12

wanted to promote.

13

for letting the students out to begin with.

disruptive of the school's image that they wanted to

portray in sponsoring the Olympics.

today, and intentionally was not there today, turns this

19

into a pure free speech case where you have a citizen in

think she loses a basis for punishing him as a student

sponsored, not sponsored, but to which the school had

2

directed the students to go?

3

MR. MERTZ:

So it seems to me it's like

5

joining a school trip at the zoo, you know.

don't make it to the -- to the school, but you drive

7

there yourself and then join the class as it's going

8

through the zoo.

It seems to me he's in school.

MR. MERTZ:

A better analogy might be if he

10

had gone on his own time to the zoo and was engaging in

11

some expressive act, and there happened to be a school

12

group there at the same time, could the teacher with

13

that group then have disciplined him for what he was

14

doing?

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That gets back to

16

the point I was trying to make earlier.

17

because it was the school event, the school sponsored

activity.

19

He knew that it was coming by the school, he knew that

20

they were going to be, the students were going to be

21

released to see it.

22

even if he were truant that day.

23

He came here

He could have gone anywhere along the route.

He went to join up with the school

No, Your Honor.

that's incorrect.

In the afternoon he was.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the question is whether

4

joining the school group, intentionally joining the

5

school group, going there because the school group was

6

there, whether that places him in school.

7

MR. MERTZ:

As a hypothetical, if he were

8

intentionally joining a school group, I would have to

9

say that puts him within whatever jurisdiction the

10
11

school has.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Why does it matter?

That

12

is, why doesn't the -- you're suing the teacher or the

13

principal and why wouldn't the issue be what that

14

principal really reasonably thought the situation was?

15

I mean, if a principal reasonably thought he was part of

16

the school group, if the principal reasonably thought

17

that this was a school outing, if the principal

18

reasonably thought that students are staying together,

19

why wouldn't that just be the ground on which you'd take

20

the case, we should take it that way, because the

21

principal reasonably thinks?

22
23

MR. MERTZ:

As far as qualified immunity, I

think that's correct, if she had a reasonable belief.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. MERTZ:

But even on the merits?

On the merits I don't think so,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Even if the principal

4

couldn't tell him to take down the manner even if she

5

thought he was part of the school group reasonably, if

6

he really wasn't?

7

MR. MERTZ:

I do not believe there's

8

anything in the law that allows a principal to convert a

9

pure free speech exercise into a school exercise because

10

it's -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought you were going to

12

appeal to the calm of her office the next day.

13

thought that was going to be your answer to my question.

14

Whatever she thought at the time, she didn't think it

15

later.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask to you clarify

17

one thing.

said I was surprised that your brief made such a big

19

deal that he was late to school.

making the argument about the free speech right if he

21

had diligently showed up for his math class first period

22

in the morning, gone out with the others, and had his

banner to unfurl when the torch came by?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. STARR:

For the reasons that have been

14

discussed, under no circumstances should Deborah Morse,

15

a conscientious principal, be subjected to the

16

possibility of punitive damages or compensatory damages.

17

A very brief factual point.

In light of the

18

richness of the discussion with respect to the facts, I

19

would guide the Court to page 109 of the joint appendix.

20

This is Deborah Morse's interrogatory answer and there

21

she sets forth the facts, and that bleeds into the law.

22

To promote drugs -- and this is our

23

fundamental suggestion and submission.

24

is utterly inconsistent with the basic educational

25

mission of the school, and for this Court to suggest to
58
Alderson Reporting Company

To promote drugs

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the contrary would really be quite inconsistent with

2

much of its drug jurisprudence, Bernonia and Earls.

3

opinion of the Court in Earls 2002 is especially

4

powerful with respect to the scourge of drugs and their

5

dangers.

6

The

More broadly, the Court does not need to go

7

more broadly, but the Court has spoken more broadly with

8

respect to the need to defer to school officials in

9

identifying the educational mission.

But we know that

10

there are in fact constitutional limits.

11

are captured in Tinker.

12

that reflects on the part of the school board a

13

standardless discretionary effort to squelch any kind of

14

controversial discussion, that casts a pall of orthodoxy

15

over the classroom.

A passive pure political speech

We are light years away from that.

16

I thank the Court.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you counsel,

the case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
