Ms. Zieve.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. ZIEVE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Rule 54(d) provides a standard for an award

12

of costs to a prevailing party that, by the Rule's

13

express terms, does not apply where Federal statute

14

provides otherwise.

15

Act provides otherwise because it states a different

16

rule for awarding costs than does Rule 54(d).

17

Rule 54(d) gives district courts wide discretion toward

18

cost-prevailing defendants, the FDCPA limits courts'

19

discretion to cases brought in bad faith and for the

20

purpose of harassment.

21

The Fair Debt Collection Practices

Whereas

The text of the Act provides that, on a

22

finding that action was brought in bad faith and for the

23

purpose of harassment, the court may award attorneys'

24

fees of reasonable relation to the work expended and

25

costs.

That's a matter of grammar.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

The unmistakable

Official

1

meaning of that sentence is that an award of costs, like

2

an award of attorney's fees, is subject to the condition

3

that the plaintiff's suit be brought --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Under -- under that

5

provision, that's certainly true.

You can't -- you

6

can't get costs under that provision unless there has

7

been that prerequisite.

8

ancient law that repeals by implication are not favored.

9

And what you're arguing here is that that provision

But it's -- you know, it's

10

effectively repeals another provision which allows costs

11

in all cases, whether or not there has been misbehavior.

12

Now, why -- why is this an exception to our

13

general rule?

I just don't -- this doesn't seem to me

14

like a clear repealer.

15

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, there's no need to

16

consider repeal by implication in this case, Your Honor,

17

because Rule 54(d) expressly states that its presumption

18

does not apply for a Federal --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, indeed, but -- but

20

you are assuming a conflict.

You're saying either

21

the -- the statute applies or Rule 54(d) applies, but

22

the statute can be read to say, we're describing one

23

category of case, we are describing the worst case, the

24

bad-faith harassing plaintiff, and the statute deals

25

with that category of person and no other.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

So if you're not a bad-faith harassing

2

plaintiff, but you, nonetheless, lost, then you're under

3

54(d).

4

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, Your Honor, if you look at

5

Section k(a)(3), as a whole, the two sentences together

6

confirm that this is not a provision about bad-faith

7

plaintiffs, that rather, the provision is addressing

8

both fees and costs to -- to plaintiffs and defendants.

9

And if -- if the Congress merely wanted to state in that

10

second sentence that fees were available and didn't mean

11

to say anything about costs to defendants, there would

12

have been no reason for Congress to have put costs in

13

that sentence.

14

If --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there are a number

16

of reasons.

17

the part about defendants.

18

if we leave out costs for the bad-faith harassing

19

plaintiff, then it -- it may be assumed that they get

20

only attorney's fees and not costs.

21

One is symmetry because they have costs in
And the concern that, well,

So the statute's provisions like this may be

22

redundant, but one can see that a drafter might very

23

well want to say, well, we said we're dealing with the

24

defendant costs, we want to put the same thing in with a

25

plaintiff.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, you've made a few points,

and I'll try to address each of them.
First, there -- there would be no reason to

4

include costs in the second sentence, just because it

5

was in the first sentence, because the first and second

6

sentences are not parallel.

7

award of costs mandatory, and, therefore, it does do

8

some work beyond 54(d).

9

function in that sentence.

The first sentence makes an

It clearly has -- has a
Whereas the second sentence,

10

the award is subject to the "may," that is, that it's

11

not mandatory that the court award them.

12

If -- if Congress was -- Congress would have

13

no need to be concerned that if it left costs out of the

14

second sentence there would be some negative implication

15

because there are several statutes that mention fees

16

without costs.

17

court has read a negative implication into that.

18

And GRC has cited no instance in which a

We, in our reply brief, cited a couple cases

19

that do the opposite.

If -- so, therefore, if

20

Congress had omitted costs, left it out of the sentence,

21

then Rule 54(d) would have continued to apply in cases

22

where the defendants.

23

One more example --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Didn't -- don't district

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sanctionable behavior like bad faith?

2

is duplicate, no matter how we read it.

3

duplicative of a power the court already had to award

4

costs for bad faith, or it's duplicate of Rule 54.

5

MS. ZIEVE:

So this provision
It's either

Well, if you read this sentence

6

as a misconduct provision, then it does repeat the

7

Court's inherent authority; although, as this Court has

8

mentioned in a couple cases, sometimes, statutes want to

9

reiterate authority that exists elsewhere.

10

If you read it our way, however, the

11

statute -- this provision does actually do some work

12

that it wouldn't otherwise do; that is, it limits cost

13

awards to prevailing defendants of these circumstances.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MS. ZIEVE:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It limits Rule 54.

Right.
I think your -- your

17

answer is always that Rule 54 obligates courts to give

22

And this rule, as you read it, is a permissive

Well, Rule 54 doesn't obligate a
It establishes a presumption --

23

MS. ZIEVE:

True.

Alderson Reporting Company

purposes of harassment.

2

do -- similarly, do what we've -- what's done here.

3

Congress could have omitted -- if GRC is correct,

4

Congress could have just omitted the words, "and costs,"

5

leaving the costs to be determined under Rule 54.

6

There are other statutes that

An example of that is 15 U.S.C. 15c(d)(2),

7

which is actions by state attorneys general and provides

8

that the court may award attorney's fees to a prevailing

9

defendant upon a finding that the action was in bad

10

faith.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Zieve, if we look at

12

other statutes, it seems to me we would want to look at

13

statutes involving lenders, so we would look at the --

14

the Truth in Lending Act and the -- what is it, the

15

Credit Organizations Act --

16

MS. ZIEVE:

Fair Credit?

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- and those do not

18

provide for attorney's fees.

19

under 54(d), which is costs, not fees.

20

read this Act in a way that -- so -- so that a defendant

21

under this Act who can get attorney's fees is worse off

22

with respect to costs than defendants under the other

23

lending legislation, the ones that have only 54(d)?

24

Congress gave defendants something more

25

here.

They are covered only
Why should we

Why -- why would -- why should it be that 54(d)
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would apply to the lender under the Truth in Lending

2

Act, but not to the lender under -- under this Act?

3

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, first, Your Honor, the --

4

Congress' purpose was not simply to -- this isn't just a

5

defendant-friendly provision.

Congress had dual

6

purposes in enacting k(a)(3).

On the one hand, Congress

7

wanted to deter nuisance suits.

8

Congress wanted to ensure that meritorious suits by

9

impecunious debtors were not deterred by the prospect

But on the other hand,

10

that an award of costs would exceed the value of the

11

damage that could be recovered in a successful suit.

12

And the two provisions of k(a)(3) show the line Congress

13

drew -- drew and how it balanced those two objectives.

14

As to the other statutes, the Truth in

15

Lending Act, the Credit Repair Organizations Act, they

16

were enacted at different times by different Congresses.

17

They have different sorts of provisions, some better for

18

plaintiffs, some better for defendants.

19

And -- but this category -- in -- in

20

enacting this statute, Congress emphasized that the

21

widespread and national serious problem of collection

22

abuse that Congress said inflicts substantial suffering

23

and anguish, and noted specifically in the Senate report

24

this Court has cited to in the Jerman case, that

25

consumers, the impecunious -- the people who can't even
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

afford to pay their debts, are the primary enforcers of

2

the statute.

3

The FTC got about 120,000 complaints from

4

consumers about debt collectors last year, more than any

5

other industry.

6

that the primary enforcers of this statute weren't going

7

to be doing that work if they were -- if they were at

8

risk of significant cost awards in cases that have

9

frequently small value.

10

So Congress may reasonably have decided

There are other ways, if Congress wanted to

11

preserve Rule 54(d), that it could have done it, that

12

did not happen here.

13

14707(c), Congress has a similar provision about

14

attorney's fees to prevailing -- attorney's fees to

15

prevailing parties, and then states expressly that fee

16

is in addition to costs allowable under the Federal

17

Rules of Civil Procedure.

18

For instance, in 49 U.S.C.

Congress didn't do that here.

Or Congress could have made it clear that it

19

was not displacing Rule 54(d) as to cost awards by

20

stating that the Court could award attorney's fees as

21

part of the cost, therefore, distinguishing fees and

22

costs.

23

including in a statute that provides for an award in

24

cases of bad faith.

25

Congress has done that sort of thing frequently,

I'm looking at 28 U.S.C. 1875, that provides
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the courts may award fees as part of costs if an action

2

was frivolous or in bad faith.

3

So -- but Congress did none of those things

4

here.

Instead, what it did was draft a sentence that

5

links the term "cost" to the term "attorney's fees" with

6

the conjunction "and" and subjects both of those objects

7

of the sentence to the same condition, the condition

8

that the plaintiff suit was brought in bad faith and for

9

purpose of harassment.

10

GRC suggests that the reading -- that the

11

statute the Justice mentioned -- benefits plaintiffs.

12

But what Congress wanted to do here -- I mean, would

13

benefit plaintiff -- what Congress wanted to do was to

14

help defendants.

There's actually no legislative

What we have instead, for what it's worth,

17

is a markup later where this provision is discussed in

18

response to concerns that frivolous suits -- suits

19

should be deterred, and this provision, which is now

20

already in the statute, is discussed as one means of

21

deterring frivolous suits.

22

But the bad faith and harassment standard is

23

the dividing line that Congress drew between nuisance

24

suits and other suits.

If the Court has no further questions?

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I would assume that, if

4

Rule 54, instead of saying what it currently does, said

5

something like, "except as expressly repealed in another

6

statute," would what happened here meet that express

7

requirement of repeal?

8

to you, but reformulated in a different way.

9

MS. ZIEVE:

It was Justice Scalia's question

If Rule 54(d) incorporated a

10

requirement that a statute expressly referred to Rule

11

54(d)?

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Expressly repealed

54(d).

14

MS. ZIEVE:

That would be a very different

15

case.

But of course, Rule 54(d) doesn't do that.

16

Instead, when Rule 54(d) was adopted, the Rules

17

Committee actually -- the advisory committee notes list

18

25 statutes that it says will not be affected by the

19

rule.

20

Those are statutes that allow fees, forbid

21

fees, condition fees, allow fees in a broader scope of

22

cases than Rule 54(d) does.

23

those would have mentioned Rule 54(d) because they

preceded adoption of the rule.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN,

4

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

5

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

6
7

MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

Rule 54(d) expressly codifies in absolute
form the well-established principle that a specific

10

provision displaces a more general one.

11

that principle is very helpful here in answering a

12

couple of the questions that have come up.

13

And I think

First of all, it makes clear that no express

14

textual conflict is necessary.

15

required one, and the specific governs the general

16

cases.

17

This Court's never

That's made even clearer, if you look at the

18

pre-2007 version of the rule, which is meant to be

19

substantively identical to the current version of the

20

rule -- this is at page 12 of the government's brief --

21

and the original version of the rule said, "Except when

22

express provision therefore is made either in a statute

23

of the United States or in these rules, costs shall be

24

allowed as of course to the prevailing party, unless the

25

Court otherwise directs."
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think that makes quite clear that

2

when, as the FDCPA does, there is a specific statutory

3

provision that addresses an award of costs incident to

4

the judgment, that specific statutory provision prevails

5

over the default rule that Rule 54(d) contains.

6

Another point about the specific governS

7

the general principle is it would apply here, even if

8

the Court believed that Section 1692k(a)(3) covered some

9

type of circumstances that Rule 54(d) and other things

10

don't.

11

And that's made quite clear by this Court's

12

recent eight-Justice unanimous opinion in RadLAX Gateway

13

Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank, in which the Court said --

14

and I quote -- "We know of no authority for the

15

proposition that the canon," -- they're talking about

16

the specific governs, the general canon -- "is

17

confined to situations in which the entirety of the

18

specific provision is a" -- quote -- "'subset' of the

19

general one."

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, my problem with

21

this is I don't -- I mean, I read the whole statute, and

22

they have a good claim until I think you read the whole

23

statute.

24

impression -- the impression is that subsection 3, which

25

is what's at issue, the whole thing is meant to say that

And I don't know what to say, other than the

5

sentence of that, it means, and if you're in bad faith,

6

the plaintiff, then the defendant gets attorney's fees.

7

It doesn't really mention costs.

8

rule.

That's the background

9

So -- and I look at the legislative history,

10

there's some staffer, at least, who's tried to find that

11

interesting; the -- they're talking about what the point

12

of this is, and say the whole point of this section is

13

to help prevent frivolous suits.

2

3

think that's an implausible hypothesis of what Congress

4

was trying do for the following reason:

5

congressperson who is concerned that a reference to fees

6

alone in the second sentence of Section 1692k(a)(3)

7

would preclude application of the default rule in -- in

8

Rule 54(d), couldn't possibly have thought that the way

to make clear that Rule 54(d) applies in full was to add

12

drafting it, perhaps.

But the people who actually draft

these things are a whole section over in Congress, they

fact that, in a pro defendant -- this is a pro-defendant

no legislative history directly addressing the sentence

14

15

look at the Court's opinion in Jerman and the hearing

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's a

24

pretty odd way to balance.

I mean, if you're -- if

25

you're trying to balance, then you say, well, here's an
19

Alderson Reporting Company

1

idea, let's give them attorney's fees, but let's not

2

give them costs.

3

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, the reason not to give --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a very

5

curious way to dilute what was otherwise a

6

defendant-friendly provision.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

8

the provision is uniquely defendant-friendly.

I think

9

it draws a dividing line between nuisance suits and

10

non-nuisance suits, premised on a finding of the suit

11

being brought in bad faith and the purpose of

12

harassment.

13

And the reason why Congress thought it was

14

necessary to shield good-faith plaintiffs from costs

15

here in order to incentivize enforcement, is, first of

16

all, these are particularly low-value suits, especially

17

Did you look up -- did you

We just did a random sample of 28 successful

4

one outlier, where it was very high, -it was around

$4,000 -- 3 to 4, and the average costs on the ones that

6

the defendants won, I guess, was around a thousand.

That's why attorneys -- and that's why the

Now, if plaintiff's looking to bring this

23

kind of case, the only out-of-pocket expense the

24

plaintiff is facing is the potential that if it loses

25

the case for some reason that it can't be aware of

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

initially, such as a bona fide good-faith defense or the

2

law being interpreted against them in an area where the

3

law is unclear, they're going to have to pay out of

4

pocket against the plaintiff himself, not the

5

plaintiff's attorney, who are the people the defendant

6

claims is -- are responsible for the abuses they allege

7

in FDCPA cases.

8

directly against the plaintiff.

9

This is going to come out via judgment

It's difficult to believe that Congress

10

enacted a provision specifically because it believed

11

the -- the debt collection industry was forcing, among

12

other things, personal bankruptcies and wanted the kind

13

of plaintiffs who were going to be in a position to

14

enforce the FDCPA to have to face the risk of incurring

15

thousands of dollars in costs if they lose a suit that

16

they bring in good faith.

17

And the reason --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Am I to understand your

19

simple position to be that what Rule 54(d) does -- says

20

is if another provision deals with costs, you're

21

relegated to that other provision?

22

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Unless, and this --

24

you're inverting the express -- unless that provision

25

refers you back to 54?
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

MR. FEIGIN:

1

Well, no, Your Honor, I'd

2

qualify that a little bit.

I think what -- we just

3

think it codifies an absolute form of the

4

specific governs the general principles.
So the first question you asked is whether

5
6

they're covering the same territory, and they are here.

7

Both 1692k(a)(3) and 54(d) cover awards of costs

8

incident to the judgment.
The second question you asked is the scope

9
10

of the displacement.

So it's possible that you might

11

have a provision, as the first sentence of 1692k(a)(3)

12

does, that only governs in certain circumstances and

13

mandates an award of costs in those circumstances.
We don't think a sentence like that,

14
15

standing alone, would displace a court's discretionary

16

authority under Rule 54(d) to award costs in other

17

circumstances.

18

may I finish the sentence, Your Honor?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19
20
21

But we don't think there's any need --

Finish that

sentence.
MR. FEIGIN:

We don't think there's any need

22

to adopt some new special rule for Rule 54(d) that's

23

different from how this Court normally applies the specific

governs the general principle.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Our position is that the second sentence of

8

section 1692k(a)(3) is a pro-defendant provision that

9

does not strip courts of their discretion under Rule 54

10

to award costs to prevailing defendants.

11

first because of the text and structure and, second,

12

because of the statutory history and purpose.

13

We think that

As to the text, the second sentence states

14

that a court may award an affirmative grant of power,

15

rather than the court may award attorney's fees and

16

costs if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in bad faith.

17

text doesn't say that a court may not award costs in the

18

absence of bad faith.

19

address a court's discretion to award costs to

20

prevailing defendants as an ordinary incident of defeat.

21

The

The text doesn't say or even

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to

22

me that the -- the most natural way to read this

23

statute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look,

24

we have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that --

25

that contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't

write -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without

2

providing a cost provision.

3

And because we know that about Congress, we

later as to attorney's fees.

comprehensively is about attorney's fees.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

MS. BLATT:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's both, you know?

It is -And if I might say, I mean,

you object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to

13

say Congress should have written a separate provision

14

about costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad,

15

good, or indifferent reason, Congress didn't, and so

16

this statute basically says, here's what prevailing

plaintiffs get as to both costs and fees, here is what

18

prevailing defendants get --

provisions that say, plaintiffs shall not be liable for

costs, or a plaintiff shall not be liable for costs

award costs if a certain condition occurs.

statute, that Electronic Fund Transfers Act, that talks

about the court shall award attorney's fees and costs if

there is bad faith.

23

Nothing in this -- this case -- I don't

And there is one other statute that says,

24

for a prevailing defendant, the court may award costs if

25

the lawsuit is frivolous.

And in those three
28


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

significant ways, I think it shows why we win, and

2

that's a statute they relied on to say it's just like

3

our statute, on page 18 of their brief, page 29 of our

4

brief.

5

First, it only refers to costs.

The statute

6

is about costs.

7

being the main event upon a finding of bad faith.

8
9

Our statute is about attorney's fees

Second, it mentions prevailing defendants;
ours doesn't.

10

And, third, which I think is missing from

11

the entire 30 minutes that you heard, their argument is

12

plaintiff -- Congress sat down and wanted to incentivize

13

frivolous suits and nonfrivolous -- nonfrivolous suits

14

alike.

15

said, if it's frivolous, the defendant gets its costs.

At least in the Pipeline Safety Act, Congress

16

Here --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This statute is very -- is

18

very normal if it were just about fees, right?

19

be just like the civil rights fees statutes, where it

20

said prevailing plaintiffs get fees, but prevailing

21

defendants only get fees upon some higher standard,

22

here, bad faith.

23

and it is different -- is that this statute twice says

24

not only fees, but also costs.

25

What makes this statute different --

MS. BLATT:

Right.
29


Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, you might say that's

2

very uncommon, but in both sentences, it says, we want

3

the same rule for costs as we do for fees.

4

MS. BLATT:

Well, I mean, a couple things

5

about that, it's both very common -- fee shifting

6

provisions routinely refer to both fees and costs, just

7

like salt and pepper, peanut butter and jelly, they go

8

together as a set.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

there are some statutes that don't?

11

MS. BLATT:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

peanut butter and jelly.

21

MS. BLATT:

22

But here -- here, I think Congress -- first

Yes.

And here -Love and marriage.

I don't know about that one.

23

of all, it's just wrong that the reference to "and

24

costs" is grammatically inexplicable and devoid of

25

practical function; and that is the fundamental point of
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the blue brief, that this is just grammatically

2

inexplicable, and that's just not true.
What "and costs" does is it -- basically,

3
4

the word "and" is being used to mean "in addition to."

5

"And" means "in addition to."

6

saying is, when courts fee shift -- attorney's fee shift

7

upon a finding of bad faith, courts additionally may award

8

costs in addition to and over and above the attorney's

9

fees that were measured in relationship to the work

10
11

And so what Congress is

performed.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you're right.

What

12

about their policy argument here, that you're a --

13

you're a potential plaintiff, you've borrowed a lot of

14

money, you don't have a lot of money, and the deal is

15

this, under your interpretation, if you win, you're

16

going to get 2 or $3,000; if you lose, it will cost you

17

about a thousand.

18

That's -- that's under your interpretation.

19

MS. BLATT:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
And under theirs, it's if

21

you win, you get 2 or $3,000, and if you lose, at least

22

you don't lose anything.

never asks for relief.

13

it accommodates all the policy concerns on the other

consumer protection plaintiff, every civil rights plaintiff,

16

every plaintiff in the country faces the risk of a cost

So Rule 54 has a built-in safety valve;

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

FTC and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, and we

21

18

I think even -- I think the history is obvious; this was

19

trying to make defendants better off than the

20

defendant's suit under the Truth in Lending Act, which

21

is part of the same umbrella Consumer Credit Protection

22

Act.

23

And they're -- inexplicably, somehow, by

24

trying to make them better off, made them worse than

25

every other creditor that they serve and immunized these
35

plaintiffs from the universal risk of cost shifting that

every other litigant has to face.

don't get there from -- all they have is a negative

inference.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so -- and you

Well, Ms. Blatt, you say

6

it -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by

7

focusing on just part of the provision, but the

8

provision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things.

9

treats plaintiffs and prevailing plaintiffs in a certain

10

set of ways.

11

certain set of ways.

MS. BLATT:

It doesn't speak to prevailing

defendants.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Prevailing defendants, but

15

when -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than

16

prevailing plaintiffs because they have to show that

17

there is a bad-faith lawsuit.

18

MS. BLATT:

Yeah, I'm going -- I'm going to

19

keep repeating it because it's my position.

20

doesn't -- the fact that this doesn't refer to

21

prevailing defendants speaks volumes that what was not

22

on Congress' mind, was Rule 54.

23

mind is victimized debt collectors who were sued in bad

24

faith.

25

This

What was on Congress'

Now, I understand this is a pro-plaintiff
36

Alderson Reporting Company

statute, but this would be extraordinary to think that

2

they gave them attorney's fees when they -- but it's

3

basically saying -- this is a -- this is a defendant who

4

went to trial and won, was law-abiding, didn't do

5

anything wrong, and Congress in that situation said, not

6

only might -- might not the suit be -- be -- have merit

7

or good faith, it might have even been frivolous.

When under Rule 54 -- again, this is what I
find so mystifying about this case.

11

oh, I'm really poor, she could have asked for

I know.

Okay.

And you've took

11

it up.

So that takes out my route seeking for costs

12

under Rule 54, it doesn't exist in your world.

get fees or costs.

Because this -- in that sense, I

think this was a question that another Justice asked.

2

If you just look at this provision, the only basis for

3

costs and fees in this provision is the bad faith and

4

finding of harassment.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if you would not

get costs under that provision --

7

MS. BLATT:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Okay.

Under 1692.
-- under 1692, a provision

that talks about fees and costs, generally, as to both

10

plaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that

11

says what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal

12

statute provides otherwise change matters?

13

MS. BLATT:

Because -- because, again,

14

Rule 54 is not preemption -- a field preemption.

15

saying if Congress intended to displace -- the proviso,

16

unless otherwise provided, it was recognition that other

17

statutes might displace Rule 54.

18

the statutes that we cite on pages 19 and 20, they

19

actually do prohibit costs.

20

It's

And if you look at all

And then if you look at the statutes on

21

pages 24 and 25, where, time and time again, Congress

22

has said, a prevailing party may recover attorney's fees

23

and costs.

24

guess those statutes are inexplicable.

25

clearly they're redundant, and they overlap with Rule

Well, the "and costs," in their view, I

39

54.

They don't displace it.

2

And even the practice guides that we cite on

3

page 22, which is basically Wright and Miller and Moore,

4

say something that merely overlaps with Rule 54 doesn't

5

displace the court's discretion.

6

And again, I think you have to ask yourself,

7

what was Congress doing?

To me, this is -- this is a --

8

the attorney's fees are the main show, it goes with bad

9

faith.

Congress was not thinking about Rule 54, and I

10

think you can be quite confident Congress was not

11

thinking, we want plaintiff lawyers to go around saying,

12

not only Congress, but the government wanted us to file

13

frivolous suits.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You might be right, but

the natural reading?

2

MS. BLATT:

No, because it says expressly,

prevailing plaintiffs.

5

to me, it's just -- it's natural when you just read it

in light of sort of common sense in context in what

7

Congress was doing.

8

the court is empowered and emboldened -- it's like a

And then it says if there's --

If a plaintiff files in bad faith,

attorney's fees and costs.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

a different way of saying the following:

prevailing is not enough for defendants.

Do we think that

under that statute?

25

a court may award costs if a lawsuit is frivolous.

And that's a statute that just says

43

Alderson Reporting Company

This

one just doesn't say that.

2

You at least -- even if you don't think of

3

it as magic language or an explicit statement, the fact

4

that Congress repeatedly has used explicit language

5

casts considerable doubt that this was done by mere

6

implication.

7

And then you look at the fact that it

8

doesn't mention prevailing parties.

It's talking about

9

bad faith, it has attorney's fees, what was Congress

10

doing, you look at the legislative history.

11

that it was -- it was trying to make them, better, off

12

than a class of defendants, but their view inexplicably

13

makes them worse off.

14

It shows

And then you look at the result that they're

15

actually advocating, that the government thinks it's a

16

good idea that plaintiffs can file lawsuits cost-free

17

that are frivolous.

18

I mean --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess, in the first

19

sentence of 3, the phrase "the costs of the action" is

20

really superfluous in light of 54(d)(1).

22

23

You really

I mean, that would have been the case

So there's no reason to think that it isn't

24

frivolous in the second sentence -- or superfluous in

25

the second sentence, right?

Why did they have to say

44

MS. BLATT:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

And so this does -- it's

not superfluous because it went to mandatory?

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. BLATT:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MS. BLATT:

Gotcha.

That's true.
Well-taken.

Yeah.

The question, though,

8

was, in the case of any successful action when,

9

obviously, they prevailed to begin with, so the question

10

is whether that's superfluous.

But the whole provision

11

overlaps with the Court's inherent authority.

12

know it hasn't come up, but I just think it's strange

13

that it says, for the purposes of bad faith and

14

harassment, Congress was obviously using belt and

15

suspenders there, so it's not surprising that Congress

16

added "and costs" here.

And I

17

If you look at Rule 54 -- let me just say

18

one other thing, Justice Kagan -- if you look at Rule

19

54, it also says, "unless the statute provides

20

otherwise, costs other than attorney's fees."

21

they didn't have to say that because, in the next

22

provision, it talks about attorney's fees.

23

they wanted to make clear for whatever reason or maybe

24

they just wrote some really excess, redundant, silly

25

language, but they said costs, meaning anything that's
46

Alderson Reporting Company

So why --

They just --

not costs -- it's just that Congress sometimes uses

2

these.

3

And I guess this was the honey and peanut

butter thing, is that a lot of fee-shifting statutes

5

talk about both attorney's fees and costs.

6

went together and -- they also mentioned it.

7

it's different.

8

first sentence that's mandatory, so it trumps Rule 54.

9

And so they
Obviously,

I agree that there's a verb in the

But with respect to the two objects,

10

Congress was already thinking about attorney's fees and

11

costs anyway, and so there's nothing wrong with them

12

saying, in addition to the attorney's fees that you can

13

get in bad faith, once you calculate the attorney's fees

14

reasonable in relation to the work performed, you also

15

get costs.

16

And the only thing I would say is -- when we

17

define "and" as in addition to, they seem to think that

18

that was an extraordinary reading of the word "and,"

19

citing something -- from something called

dictionary.com, and if you just went to dictionary.com,
