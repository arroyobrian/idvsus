ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CASTANIAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

This Court in Ruhrgas against Marathon

12

encapsulated the relevant line of this Court's

13

precedents in the rule that we suggest controls in this

14

case.

15

court to choose among threshold grounds denying audience

16

to a case on the merits.

17

extending through Steel Company and Ruhrgas and

18

afterward, hold true to this statement.

19

non-merits issues may be decided by a Federal court

20

before it determines its jurisdiction, in that term

21

meant as subject matter and personal jurisdiction.

22

What it said, it is hardly novel for a Federal

Now this Court's cases

Threshold

This Court in this case should hold the

23

forum non conveniens is another one of those threshold

24

non-merits grounds for denying audience to a case that

25

can be considered first before jurisdiction.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Adopting that rule in this case will do

2

three things.

3

most faithful to the Court's precedents in the area.

4

First, it will result in a rule that is

Second, it will respect the rule of Steel

5

Company and forbid ultra vires judgments on the merits.

6

There is no chance that a dismissal in forum non

7

conveniens will exercise more power than is granted to

8

the Federal courts by Article III or by Congress in

9

statutes.

10

And finally, it will give the Federal courts

11

the appropriate flexibility in appropriate cases to

12

serve important interests such as economy,

13

constitutional avoidance, and particularly relevant in

14

this case, international comity.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just on the second point.

16

I wanted -- does the rule of the Federal

17

district court in forum non conveniens where it

18

dismisses a case for lack of a convenient form, does it

19

have any ongoing consequences as the law of the case?

20

know our Chick Kam Choo precedent where we said Federal

21

court determination forum non conveniens is not binding

22

in a state court, but supposing in this case that the

23

parties went to San Francisco with a -- and said we want

24

to sue there.

25

States District Court feel bound by the determination

I

Would the San Francisco court, the United

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that this dispute is determined by Chinese law, and that

2

the Chinese court is therefore the appropriate court?

3

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, I think there are two

4

components to your question, Justice Kennedy, and let me

5

see if I can answer both of them.

6

the determination that the Federal court in

7

Philadelphia, for example, in this case, was an

8

inconvenient forum.

9

on the court in San Francisco?

Would that determination be binding

10

probably not.

11

the forum non conveniens -

12

The first is whether

Our view would be

It would be persuasive in that case, but

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about the ruling that

13

this would be governed by Chinese law and that the

14

Chinese court is the best forum to consider that?

15

too has no lat -- has no effect beyond the court in

16

Philadelphia?

17

MR. CASTANIAS:

That

Let me -- that was the

18

second part of your question that I was going to try to

19

answer.

20

not have preclusive effect in the main -- in the mine

21

run of cases.

22

preclusive effect is that it would be one factor in what

23

this Court has described as a multifarious analysis

24

under the forum non conveniens analysis at American

25

Dredging, and so it would be hard to say that for issue

And with regard to that, I think that it would

And the reason I think it wouldn't have

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

preclusion, for example, that the choice of law

2

determination in that case was necessary to the ruling

3

dismissing the case.

4

Now one might imagine a case at the margins

5

where that was the case and there might be a case for

6

preclusive effect, but that's, I think, not likely to be

7

presented by this case.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you know any case,

Mr. Castanias, where there has been a forum non

10

conveniens dismissal in favor of a foreign forum where

11

the plaintiff has then attempted to go into a different

12

U.S. court to get a different resolution?

13

MR. CASTANIAS:

And by U.S. court you mean

14

Federal court like Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, or

15

perhaps a state court as well?

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. CASTANIAS:

Either one.

Well, I think I have seen

18

cases, and I can't cite them to you as I stand here

19

right now, where litigants have tried to go to a state

20

court.

21

one.

22

Another Federal Court, I can't think of a single
I'm hard pressed to.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you were urging

23

that this is a threshold issue and it has nothing to do

24

with the merits; but there is an argument that the

25

existence of personal jurisdiction or not might have
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some bearing on the forum non conveniens evaluation.

2

MR. CASTANIAS:

In some cases, I suppose

3

that could be true, Justice Ginsburg; but the point of

4

our rule is that the only issue presented by this case

5

is that of Federal court power.

6

where it is appropriate in the district court's

7

discretion.

8

Court pointed out that the normal court order business

9

is to determine subject matter jurisdiction first and

10
11

There may be a case

In fact in Ruhrgas, you writing for the

then personal jurisdiction.
But the point of our application of that

12

rule in this case is there may be some cases where it's

13

appropriate, and this is a paradigmatic example of the

14

sort of case where it would be appropriate to decide the

15

forum non conveniens issue first, before personal

16

jurisdiction.

17

answer to your question.

I hope that satisfies -- I hope that's an

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. CASTANIAS:

Uh-huh.

Uh-huh.

With regard to the body of

20

this Court's decisions, we cited in our briefs cases

21

like Leroy against Great Western, which holds that a

22

Federal court can decide venue before deciding personal

23

jurisdiction.

24
25

In this case it's hardly different because
again, as American Dredging pointed out, forum non
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conveniens is properly described as a supervening venue

2

provision.

3

brief, and the solicitor general relies on, says that

4

Federal courts have the power to transfer a case before

5

determining personal jurisdiction.

6

analogous here are the extension in the Tenet case.

7

the case of extension, extension documents have very

8

similar, though different, moorings as the forum non

9

conveniens doctrine.

10

The Gold Law case which we cite in our reply

And grants even more
In

And they're both discretionary

decisions to decline to exercise jurisdiction.

11

This Court pointed out, citing the Ellis

12

case, and it pointed this out in the Steel Company,

13

Ruhrgas and Tenet cases that extension can be decided

14

first.

15

of forum non conveniens, it's -- it really does follow

16

that forum non conveniens can be decided first.

17

And again, applying that precedent to the case

With regard to the Tenet case, that case is

18

very close to a merits issue, perhaps even one might

19

call it a merits issue, but it was so threshold that it

20

was appropriate to decide the totten bar that was at

21

issue in that case before jurisdiction.

22

Again, and with all of these lines of cases,

23

deciding forum non conveniens first will have -- will

24

provide no chance of the Federal court going beyond its

25

constitutionally and statutorily exercised powers.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Now, I'd like to leave the Court with one

2

final thought about the way this, and the importance of

3

applying this rule in this case.

4

The complaint that Malaysia International

5

Shipping makes against Sinochem is nothing more than a

6

claim that Sinochem defrauded a Chinese court.

7

a term used in the complaint, a fraudulent

8

misrepresentation.

9

is also used.

There is

The term negligent misrepresentation

But make no mistake about it.

The

10

complaint in this case is that Sinochem made a

11

misrepresentation to Chinese courts.

12

the sort of interference with the Chinese court system

13

which has proceeded to judgment, and judgment by the way

14

on these issues in favor of Sinochem and against

15

Malaysia International, that really cries out for the

16

flexibility inherent in our rule.

17
18

This is precisely

Unless the Court has further questions, I'll
reserve the balance of my time.

about why we're speaking of fora, judicial fora, there

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was an agreement to

2

arbitrate.

And we're talking about a suit brought by

3

one party in the United States, by the other party in

4

China, and no arbitration occurred apparently, although

5

I thought the contract called for it.

6

MR. CASTANIAS:

My understanding,

7

Justice Ginsburg, and this is a vague recollection from

8

one aspect of the record, is that the arbitration clause

9

was held not to apply in this case.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Thank you.
That's not an

exercise of law declaring authority on the merits?

13

Mr. Chief Justice, it was not held by the district court

in this case to not apply.

But at the time -

17
18

That issue was not in front

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, the

district court didn't hold that it didn't apply?

19

MR. CASTANIAS:

Yes, correct.

I think, I

20

think that, I think it was agreed by the parties or

21

understood by the Chinese court.

23

not in the record but I, on summing it up, are a little

Mr. Chief Justice, there, in abstention, an -- an

My memory on this with

But I think to answer your question,

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration clause I think provides a closer question

2

than this case does for an issue of whether it's law

3

declaring authority, I think as your question put it.

4

It's arguable that an arbitration clause is

5

little more than a, in essence, a forum selection clause

6

of the same kind that a venue provision or a forum non

7

conveniens ruling might provide.

SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In Steel Company the Court held that it is

5

impermissible to adjudicate the merits of a case over

6

which the Court may lack jurisdiction.

7

another thing entirely for the Court to decline to

8

exercise jurisdiction that it might well possess.

9

Ruhrgas clarified, in language that counsel has already

10

quoted, that a court may choose among threshold grounds

11

for denying audience to a case on the merits.

12

But it is

In

Now, the dividing line between a threshold

13

non-merits ground and a merits ground may in some cases

14

be difficult.

15

have disagreed in some cases; but there is an easier set

16

of cases and that is where the Court is declining to

17

exercise jurisdiction and especially where as here, it

18

is doing so in favor of litigation of the substantive

19

dispute in another forum.

20

And the Court has -- members of the Court

And this Court has -- has decided already

21

that it is permissible, for example, for a court to

22

decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction before

23

deciding a difficult question of whether it would

24

possess subject matter jurisdiction over the

25

supplemental claims at all.

Forum non conveniens is in the nature of an

abstention extension doctrine.

3

first cases of this Court to describe the forum non

4

conveniens doctrine and its factors, analogizes forum

5

non conveniens to a Burford abstention.

6

in Steel Company acknowledged that abstention on grounds

7

of Younger, for example, would be permissible to decide

8

before resolving a disputed question of jurisdiction.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Gulf Oil, one of the

The Court even

But the Gulf Oil case

10

does say that a forum non conveniens dismissal

11

presupposes that the forum is one in which there's

12

personal jurisdiction and one of proper venue.

13

just another forum is more appropriate.

14

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It's

That's, that's

15

right, Your Honor.

16

of rejecting an argument that because it was conceded

17

that jurisdiction and venue were proper in the Southern

18

District of New York, that the doctrine of forum non

19

conveniens could not apply.

20

And the Court said so in the course

The Court said that couldn't be so, because

21

the doctrine of forum non conveniens presupposes the

22

availability of two fora.

23

the entirely separate question of whether the Court

24

could assume that even I it had jurisdiction, it would

25

not exercise it.

But the Court did not address

And 13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It was not, not

2

felicitously put.

I think all the Court was saying was

3

that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non

4

conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction.

5

The only point of the doctrine is to get rid

6

of the case where you -- where you do have jurisdiction.

7

And so you do not have to -- but that

8

doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before

9

you can exercise the doctrine.

It is a doctrine that

10

overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction.

11

that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.

12

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

In

That -- that's

13

right, Your Honor.

And in the court already determined

14

it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or if venue was

15

improper, then forum non conveniens would have no work

16

to do.

17

question of the ordering of these restful

18

of course the doctrine of forum non conveniens, its

19

entire purpose is to allow litigation to occur in a more

20

convenient and appropriate forum, and it would undermine

21

severely the purposes of the doctrine -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But Gulf Oil certainly didn't address this
matters.

And

Do I correctly understand

23

your argument to be that, that in this case it happened

24

to be the doubt about personal jurisdiction rather than

25

subject matter jurisdiction but you would make the same
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument if it were a doubt about subject matter

2

jurisdiction?

3

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right, we

4

would.

And, and one of the cases that Ruhrgas quoted

5

and relies on was the D.C. Circuit's decision in --

6

Papandreou, which involved subject matter jurisdiction

7

under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

8

the Court quite rightly said that it would be improper

9

to force a foreign sovereign to undergo extensive

And there

10

jurisdictional discovery in this case when it was clear

11

that at the end of the day the Court would dismiss day

12

in favor of a foreign forum in any event.

13

apply to, to questions of subject matter jurisdiction as

14

well as personal -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it would

Can a district court

16

do both?

And in the alternative be dismissed on forum non

21
22
23
24
25

Can it say I've reached personal jurisdiction,

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:
do both.

I think they could

The second would be really superfluous.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But not if there's,

I presume, if there's an appeal.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

If -- if -- an

appeal, the court could, the court of appeals could
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

affirm on either ground.
Again, to emphasize the point that counsel

3

has made, the argument here is not that forum non

4

conveniens must necessarily be decided before

5

jurisdictional questions.

6

would be to decide jurisdictional issues first.

7

In fact, the natural order

But as the Court held in the analogous

8

circumstance of venue in the Leroy decision, there are

9

circumstances that counsel in favor of reversing that

10

order, such as avoiding a difficult constitutional issue

11

or, as in Mr. Papandreou, avoiding imposing the burden

12

of jurisdictional discovery on a foreign sovereign or

13

foreign entity when a case going to be dismissed in the

14

end in any event.

15

If the Court has no further questions -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In Martin, in the

17

hypothetical where this case is dismissed for forum non

18

conveniens and then they go to another Federal district

19

court, could the second Federal district court say this

has already been heard by the first district court; I'm

21

not getting into it?

22

have, have to go through the motion again?

23

Or, or does that district court

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I think the

24

second court would have to at the very least ascertain

25

that circumstances had not changed or that there weren't

1

relevant difference of facts.

2

earlier was of filing, refiling this suit in California.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your, your hypothetical

Now, why is that?

Now -

4

to some extent this is a call for the district judge.

5

There is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's

6

entirely conceivable that one district judge would

7

correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens

8

whereas another district judge faced with the same

9

question would not do so.

10

And both of them would be

acting lawfully; isn't that -- isn't that conceivable?

11

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It is in the nature

12

of a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says,

13

that -- that different judges could reach different

14

decisions.

15

Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court emphasized there

16

the question was whether a state court's forum non

17

conveniens determination had preclusive effect on a

18

Federal court's analysis of the factors.

19

held that did it not.

20

impossible to know that every factor would be the same

21

or would be weighed the same by the second court.

22

In the Parsons case, Parsons versus

And this Court

In large part because it's

And so I think it would be open to the

23

second court to, to reanalyze the issues; but even if it

24

weren't, even if there were some preclusive effects, I

25

don't think that that undermines our position, because
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it is, of course, equally true of other threshold

2

determinations such as personal and subject matter

3

jurisdiction that they may have issue-preclusive effects

4

in subsequent litigations.

5

For example, a trial court could decide that

6

it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount

7

in controversy is insufficient because under state law,

8

the plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive

9

damage.

That determination would be given

10

issue-preclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by

11

the same plaintiff in another district court.

12

Justice Scalia wrote an opinion on that subject in the

13

D.C. Circuit in the Dozier versus Ford Motor Company.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In fact

Mr. Hallward-Driemeier,

15

because your time is running out, there is a question

16

about a court without personal jurisdiction dismissing

17

on forum non conveniens ground, and that is, it's

18

common, as you know, to condition forum non conveniens

19

dismissals on the defendant's undertaking that the

20

defendant will not raise the statute of limitations and

21

other conditions.

22

jurisdiction over the defendant, it would be unable to

23

impose such conditions; isn't that so?

24
25

If the Court has no personal

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Our understanding

of a conditional dismissal in this circumstance is that
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the dismissing court is explaining its understanding of

2

the world, and that -- and facts as they bear upon its

3

analysis, such as is the defendant subject to

4

jurisdiction in a foreign forum.

5

plaintiff -- if I could answer -- oftentime the

6

plaintiff objects to dismissal because they can't sue

7

the defendant in the foreign forum.

8

agrees to waive any objection to jurisdiction.

9

understanding of fact is a condition of the dismissal.

Oftentimes, the

The defendant
That

10

If it later proves to be untrue because the defendant

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN-MICHELE G. HIGGINS,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MS. HIGGINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
We believe that this Court should affirm the

22

judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit

23

based on three reasons.

24
25

We believe that personal jurisdiction is a
requirement articulated in Gulf Oil versus Gilbert which
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remains before this judicially created doctrine may be

2

evaluated.

3

Second, we believe that adopting the Third

4

Circuit holding establishes a clear, bright line

5

discrete rule that is easy to enforce and appropriate to

6

evaluate at any other appellate level.

7

And third, we argue that the nature of the

8

doctrine of forum non conveniens itself presupposes

9

jurisdiction before making a ruling to dismiss for some

10
11

other convenient forum.
The analysis that has brought the case to

12

this Court has included a divergence of opinions between

13

various circuit courts.

14

tend to agree that forum non conveniens is a

15

non-merits-based ground for evaluating a ruling.

16

Fifth Circuit has decided otherwise.

17

some issue with the fact that in looking at a forum non

18

conveniens analysis, the Court necessarily, as the

19

Government has conceded in its brief, takes a peek at

20

the merits of the dispute.

21

In the briefing, all parties

The

We, we express

The other issue that arises is that if a

22

court dismisses a case based on forum non conveniens,

23

and then an appeal is sought, the appellate court always

24

has the opportunity to evaluate both the subject matter

25

jurisdiction and the personal jurisdiction.

1

The Seventh Circuit in the Intek versus

2

Engle case, came up with such a ruling recently.

3

expressed support for the Second Circuit and the D.C.

4

Circuit, saying that it is appropriate to be able to

5

deal with non-threshold matters such as forum non

6

conveniens without ascertaining jurisdiction.

7

the court acknowledged that they thought the dicta

8

expressed in the Ruhrgas opinion would become the

9

holding of this Court.

10

They

In fact,

However, for judicial efficiency, it decided

11

to go through the analysis to determine whether or not

12

there was personal jurisdiction in the case.

13

through subject matter of the case and personal

14

jurisdiction, and it determined that there was no

15

jurisdiction.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It went

Well, that only proved that

17

an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the

18

ground relied upon by the district court, even if the

19

ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid

20

ground.

21

available to an appellate court, especially where the

22

ground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into

23

jurisdiction and say there isn't any.

24

don't know how that adds to your case.

25

It's up to an appellate court -- - it's

I don't know, I

appropriate.

2

judicial resources that would occur if forum non

3

conveniens had to establish personal jurisdiction first.

4

And frankly, we see that as the other way.

5

case in our opinion -

6

Both parties cite the vast waste of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Insight

Well, you found one

7

appellate court that chose to do it that way.

8

if I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it

9

that way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground

10
11
12

Frankly,

was valid.
MS. HIGGINS:

Well, I tend to agree with you

on that point as well -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MS. HIGGINS:

Yes.

-- with it.

But I think what

15

the Third Circuit was stressing in its opinion is that

16

you cannot subject the parties to litigate in another

17

forum if there is some chance that your own forum does

18

not have the personal jurisdiction.

19

prerequisite of the doctrine itself.

20

And we believe that -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is a

May I ask this question.

22

We talk of course about the unnecessary burden on the

23

litigants, but I wonder if there isn't even a more

24

fundamental problem with the procedure that the Third

25

Circuit followed here.

That is, is there really a case
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

or controversy down there?

2

motivation to spend a lot of money fighting about

3

jurisdiction when he knows that the case is going to be

4

transferred anyway?

5

the issue that's left open?

6

Does the defendant have any

Is this a real live controversy on

MS. HIGGINS:

I think it is,

7

Justice Stevens, and I think the Court would address

8

that by saying certainly on the negligent

9

misrepresentation claim at this stage the record

10

indicates that there was a ruling in China, but the

11

appellate window is still open.

12

evidence has long gone into the Chinese case.

13

completely separate issues.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And certainly the
Those are

There couldn't be any

15

question about the alternate forum taking jurisdiction

17

ongoing in China.

18

the Court gives up -- if the Court dismisses on forum

19

non conveniens and then the supposedly more convenient

20

forum doesn't take the case.

21

in this case, where the other forum was in China and was

22

indeed litigating the case.

23

A proceeding was

So you brought up the question about

MS. HIGGINS:

But that can't be a factor

Yes, Justice Ginsburg; but as

24

practical matter, with the resolution of this case by

25

this Court we would certainly have to start the process,
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whatever ruling this Court finds, all over again.

2

certainly cannot participate in the action in China

3

because that has already gone on.

4

option to participate in the case in the United States

5

because those specific issues were not litigated in

6

China.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We

We would have the

I'm sorry.

I'm not

8

following you, so please straighten me out.

9

that the claim was that a fraud had been committed on

10

I thought

the Chinese court.

11

MS. HIGGINS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your claim was that a

13

fraud had been committed on the Chinese court in

14

connection with the arrest of this vessel and the

15

ensuing proceedings?

16
17

MS. HIGGINS:

That is correct,

Justice Ginsburg.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, why in the world

19

should a court in the United States get involved in

20

determining whether a fraud was committed on a Chinese

21

court?

22

MS. HIGGINS:

Justice Ginsburg, we believe

23

it was appropriate for U.S. review because of the

24

balancing of the maritime commerce that occurred in the

25

case because of the bills of ladings.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Although the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

district court believed that Chinese law would apply to

2

the contract for the sale of the steel coils, in fact we

3

would make the argument that with the various charter

4

parties in the case, including the bill of lading that

5

you reference, indeed American law would apply and there

6

would be some different issues that would be evaluated.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

American law to determine

8

whether a fraud had been committed on the Chinese court?

9

It seems just stating it that it might be offensive to

10

the Chinese court to have another court determine

11

whether it had been defrauded.

12

MS. HIGGINS:

That would have been a

13

concern, Justice Ginsburg, except that issue was brought

14

up expressly before the Chinese court; and if I may

15

refer you to page 18 of the joint appendix, the Chinese

16

court ruled that, quote, "Given that the People's

17

Republic of China and the U.S. are different

18

sovereignties with different jurisdictions, whether the

19

appellant has taken actions at any U.S. court in respect

20

of this case will have no effect on the exercise by a

21

Chinese court of its competent jurisdiction over said

22

case."

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that was a very

24

polite way of the Chinese court saying:

25

what the United States court is doing; we've got this
25
Alderson Reporting Company

We don't care

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case, we've got the ship, and we're going to adjudicate

2

it; and it doesn't matter.

3

anything to the United States to chastise it for even

4

thinking it could become involved in this matter.

5

was polite.

6

MS. HIGGINS:

We don't have to say

It

And I agree with you, Your

7

Honor, except it is the only indication in the record

8

that there is some foreign nation that has expressed an

9

opinion on this.

If you read the brief by the Solicitor

10

General, the Government would have us think that every

11

single case is going to involve foreign nations and

12

delicate foreign policy disputes and such other factors.

13

Very clearly, there is no such evidence in

14

the record and the only evidence we do have is from

15

another sovereign, China, that says if you have a U.S.

16

cause of action we have no problem if a U.S. court

17

adjudicates it on the merits.

18

Having said that, the issue here was whether

19

or not personal jurisdiction should have been decided

20

before the forum non conveniens.

21

just go back to our second point, where the court

22

believes that it can't evaluate a doctrine without

23

having -- if it's a required factor of the doctrine that

24

a sitting court making a ruling on that issue has to

25

presuppose personal jurisdiction.

And again, we would

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why -- I mean, I

2

assume that in deciding forum non conveniens -- that

3

there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that

4

judgment would assume that there was personal

5

jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that

6

into the mix.

7

is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum?

8

court can say yes, that's the end of the game.

9

Assuming we have personal jurisdiction,
And if the

I don't see what you have to gain here.

10

Suppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction

11

and dismisses for forum non conveniens?

12

what are you gambling for here?

13

what's the -- what's the desirable outcome you hope to

14

achieve?

15

MS. HIGGINS:

What, what -

I don't understand

Well, for Malaysia

16

International the desirable outcome would be upholding

17

the Third Circuit opinion.

18

district court.

19

It then gets remanded to the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right, and the district

20

court at best for you, at best, finds personal

21

jurisdiction.

22

know, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum

23

non conveniens.

24

would say:

25

assumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed

If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you

If it finds personal jurisdiction, it

Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same

2

call that I made before.

3

conveniens.

4

MS. HIGGINS:

Dismissed for forum non

And Justice Scalia, I concede

5

that, but you would also have the ability of the

6

defendant to waive personal jurisdiction.

7

get into the judicial resources.

8

choose to waive it at that point in time and then I am

9

right back again -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Again, you

The defendant could

Why would a defendant

11

that has moved to dismiss for forum non conveniens waive

12

jurisdiction?

13

this picture that is to your advantage and that is if

14

you can get the Court to say, well, we have to do

15

personal jurisdiction first, you ask for discovery on

16

that issue and it goes out on forum non conveniens

17

without deciding personal jurisdiction, you are not

18

going to get that discovery.

19

It seems to me that there is something in

MS. HIGGINS:

That is correct, Your Honor,

20

and then I would have to look for an evaluation of forum

21

non conveniens that was favorable to the client.

22

was one of the issues that we raised on appeal to the

23

Third Circuit; and the court did not make a ruling on

24

that.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That

Yeah, but discovery for its

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

own sake is no fun.

2

sake achieve?

What does discovery for its own

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Unless there's something at

5

the end of the discovery.

6

that the Republic of China would not accede to the

7

discovery and therefore, you would get a default

8

judgment or something.

9

see what's at the end of this game for you.

10

MS. HIGGINS:

Now, maybe what you hoped is

You know, I just -- I just don't

That's one possibility.

But

11

again, we talked about the policy issues of why the

12

Government came in with the position they did.

13

suggested that the United States had a very distinct

14

interest in avoiding delay, burdensome discovery, and

15

difficult legal issues; and frankly, my thought is the

16

same as yours.

17

those issues and come to a ruling in their favor.

18

They

Any party has those desires to avoid

In this case we would hope that with an

19

adoption of personal jurisdiction first, then the court

20

would be required to rule on our motion to reevaluate

21

forum non conveniens and we might be able to convince

22

the court to be able to pursuit the case here.

23

particular case, that is the goal that we seek because

24

that is, as you say, all we have to do at the end of the

25

game with it.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

In this

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I also wanted to -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess we should ask the

3

other side, but I think I know what their answer will

4

be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of

5

forum non conveniens without first addressing personal

6

jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal

7

jurisdiction?

And what do you think?

8

MS. HIGGINS:

I think it has to, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MS. HIGGINS:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I agree.

The Seventh Circuit case I agree.

So how are you

12

going to get a different result then when it goes back

13

and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal

14

jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the

15

district court says, oh, yeah, same result.

16

MS. HIGGINS:

But there is the possibility

17

of a case happening, as it happened in the In Re

18

Bridgestone case, which was a Seventh Circuit case.

19

that case the court dismissed for forum non conveniens

20

and the -- I believe it dealt with the country of

21

Mexico.

22

saying that the Mexican courts were not to take

23

jurisdiction of the case.

24

court was required to take back the case because it no

25

longer had the alternate forum in which to adjudicate

In

The parties had obtained a ruling in Mexico

Under those circumstances the

30

the dispute.

2

case that you raise.

3

So I think that's the one example of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we know that that's

4

not going to happen here, because the Chinese court has

5

adjudicated the case.

6

MS. HIGGINS:

Not on this issue, Your Honor,

7

and actually not on the bills of lading issue.

You did

8

raise that point and there is still the potential of

9

arbitration taking place under the various charter

10

parties to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of the

11

remaining parties in the action.

12

still open as well.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that matter is

We're dealing with,

14

because it's a foreign nation, not the codified forum

15

non conveniens that's in 1404 and 1406.

16

treating this as it were counterpart to 1404, which is

17

forum non conveniens.

18

you know, in the Goldlaw case this Court said a court

19

can transfer even though it lacks personal jurisdiction

20

and is a place of improper venue.

21

And you are

But 1406 is wrong venue and, as

Now, why isn't the forum non conveniens

22

doctrine as applied to foreign nations a combination of

23

1404 and a 1406, and if it includes 1406 then you don't

24

need your personal jurisdiction, you don't need venue,

25

you just transfer it to a place where those conditions
