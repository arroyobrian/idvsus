Mr. Benedon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS G. BENEDON


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9

MR. BENEDON:

Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:

The question -- excuse me.

10

The question


11

presented should be answered with the following bright


12

line rule:

13

FHA should be determined by application of established


14

rules of corporate and agency law not criteria unique to


15

the FHA. 
 Under these principles, corporate shareholders

16

and officers are not vicariously liable for the torts of


17

the other agents of the corporation.


Imposition of vicarious liability under the


The Ninth Circuit held that a different rule


18
19

should apply under the FHA, that vicarious liability could


20

be based on control alone.

21

the law. 


That is not, nor should it be,


22

While the starting -- the starting point for the


23

analysis is necessarily the statute itself, while Congress


24

has authority to expand the class of persons liable for


25

violation of a Federal law, when it has done so, it has


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

done so expressly.

2

defines nor expands the class of persons liable under the


3

act, and as this Court stated in Bestfoods, this silence


4

is dispositive.


5
6
7

The FHA was never -- which neither


Specifically, Congress has spoken directly when

it has wished to impose a control test.
QUESTION:

For example --


Suppose -- suppose that I were to


8

agree with you and the Court were to agree with you as to


9

your criticism of the Ninth Circuit's reasoning and -- and


10

that it agreed with you too that general principles of


11

agency and corporate liability apply.

12

record, could we go on to say that under California law


13

and real estate law generally, the real estate salesman is


14

the agent of the broker, and therefore the broker is


15

liable under agency law?


16

MR. BENEDON:

17

QUESTION:

Based on this


The answer --


Or -- or would I have to -- would we


18

have to remand before we did that?

19

discussed in the -- in the respondents' brief, and the


20

respondent makes it quite clear.

21

but the -- the law is cited on page 15 of the red brief,


22

that under California law, the broker is the principal. 


23

And I take it the principal would be liable under


24

respondeat superior in this case. 


25

MR. BENEDON:

Because this is


And maybe you disagree,


Correct, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

QUESTION:

If -- if we find who the principal


is, we know the principal is going to be liable.


3

MR. BENEDON:

4

QUESTION:

5
6
7
8
9

That's where --


Under California law the broker is


the principal.

MR. BENEDON:

My -- Your Honor, my answer to


that is -- is several-fold.

First, the distinction needs to be made between

a corporate broker and an individual broker.

Mr. Meyer in


10

this case is a corporate officer who holds a broker's


11

license solely as the officer of the corporation.

12

corporation is the employer of the agent.

13

operates under the license held by the corporation.


14

QUESTION:

The


The agent


But isn't it fair to say that -- or


15

isn't it? 
 Maybe you'll take issue with this, that the

16

corporation operates as a broker only because it has the


17

individual's broker license assigned to it.


18

MR. BENEDON:

It has to, Your Honor. 


19

A corporation as a paper person needs human beings to


20

fulfill the function that a corporation must do, as does


21

any corporation.

22

officers --


23

There will always be supervising


QUESTION:

Is -- is there any California law


24

saying that -- that the corporation is the principal in a


25

situation like this and not the holder of the -- not


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- not the named broker?

MR. BENEDON:

2
3

The named broker, again -- to


answer your question, no, not that I'm aware of.


4

QUESTION:

This -- this is a --


5

QUESTION:

Let me ask the opposite.

Is there


6

any California case in which the named broker in the


7

corporation has been held liable as the principal solely


8

because he's the named broker?

MR. BENEDON:

9
10

Honor.

The corporation has been held liable.


11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BENEDON:

13

Not the designated officer, Your


Yes.

That's what I'm talking about.


But not the designated


officer/broker.


14

QUESTION:

So --


15

QUESTION: 
 Is there a difference in the

16

licenses, the individual license that Justice Kennedy was


17

referring to and that's mentioned on page 15 of the red


18

brief, the individual broker license and the statement


19

that the individual broker licensee is vicariously


20

liable and the broker who holds the license under the


21

corporate name?

22

Are those different certificates?


MR. BENEDON:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

There are


23

separate licenses issued by the Department of Real Estate


24

in California:

25

one to individuals who are brokers only in their capacity


one to individuals who act as brokers, and


7
Alderson Reporting Company

as officers of a corporation.

2

licenses.


Those are separate


The only license in this cases was held by


3
4

Mr. Meyer as an officer of the corporation.

5

step outside the corporation and act as a broker.

His


6

existence as a broker depended on the corporation.

He


7

could not transact --

QUESTION:

8
9

He could not


May I ask you this question?

You


explained to Justice Scalia that there is no California


10

case holding a corporate broker liable in this situation,


11

as I understand.

12

other way?

13

presented to the California courts?


Are there any California cases going the


Has it ever -- has the issue ever been


MR. BENEDON:

14

Yes, it has, Your Honor.

In two


15

cases, there have been, one -- one State case and one

16

district court case cited in our -- in our briefs, in


17

the -- re Grabau case.

18

statutory scheme imposes only a disciplinary remedy for


19

any violations of the scheme such that a broker -- a


20

designated officer/broker who violates any of the


21

provisions of the statute may be subject to discipline,


22

but is not the basis of a civil action. 

QUESTION:

23

They've held that the California


So in this case the individual could


24

be subject to discipline, but not to liability.

25

that --


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Is


Correct. 


1

MR. BENEDON:

2

QUESTION:

Yes. 


3

QUESTION:

What were your other reasons.

You


4

said you -- you had a multi-faceted answer, or something


5

like that.

What -- what are the other --


6

MR. BENEDON:

7

QUESTION:

8

The --


-- prongs or the other facets of your


answer? 

MR. BENEDON:

9

The other facets is that liability


10

under the FHA cannot be premised on California agency law. 


11

There, the -- the agency under the FHA is determined on


12

Federal rules of agency.

13

this Court held in General Contractors, you look to the


14

Restatement which has a two-prong test.

15

of control, but the other is that the person controlled

16

has to be acting on behalf of the principal.


To determine Federal agency,


One is the right


Here, the agent works -- is working on behalf of


17
18

the corporation.

19

did real estate transactions, he was acting on behalf of


20

Triad.

21

In this case when Mr. Crank went out and


He was not acting on behalf of Meyer.

The problem with looking at each State's


22

structure is we're going to end up with a patchwork


23

construction of a Federal statute.

24

different in Nevada than from Oregon than from Washington


25

than from West Virginia. 


The law may be

QUESTION:

Is that --


2

QUESTION:

Suppose it were the majority rule


3

that a real estate broker is the principal for the


4

salesman.

Would we follow that rule generally? 


5

MR. BENEDON:

6

QUESTION:

Again, Your Honor, the --


And again, I'm -- I'm referring to


7

the red brief at pages 14 and 15 which sets this -- this


8

out.

9

corporate broker and -- and an individual broker.


You say there's a distinction because there's a


10

MR. BENEDON:

11

QUESTION:

Correct. 


Now, we -- I -- we can explore that a


12

little bit.

But suppose it were the -- the general rule


13

in most of the States that had addressed the subject that


14

the broker is the principal.

MR. BENEDON: 
 To answer that question, I think

15
16

you still need to make a distinction between individual


17

brokers and corporate licensed brokers.

18

that --


19

QUESTION:

We do not dispute


Well, I -- I was simply addressing


20

the point of whether or not State law as opposed to


21

Federal law controls.

22

States that the broker is the principal, then that would


23

certainly be sufficient for the imposition of liability


24

under this Federal scheme.

25

MR. BENEDON:

And if it's the general law in most


Would it not? 


Again, I -- I disagree, Your


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Honor.

2

still look at the Federal law of agency rather than how


3

the State defines the relationship between the broker and


4

the agent.

5

agency to determine agency under the FHA. 


6

I would say that the rules still -- you need to


You -- again, you look to the Federal rules of


QUESTION:

I thought you said those were general


7

common law principles that are -- presumably the States


8

would share.


9

MR. BENEDON:

The general law principles applied


10

in the broker/agent context would establish that the


11

agent -- the sales agent -- is the agent of the principal


12

broker when the broker is acting in his individual


13

capacity when the agent is acting on behalf of the


14

principal, of the individual broker, and subject to that


15

broker's control. 
 The situation is different when it's a

16

officer/broker who is not -- the agent in that situation


17

is not acting on behalf of the officer.

18

behalf of the corporation.


19

QUESTION:

He's acting on


Then if I understand your argument


20

correctly, you're saying that the discussion, whether it's


21

California law or Federal common law, is in this case at


22

least academic because under California law, if you were


23

to apply it, there is no relief for these plaintiffs, that


24

the only remedy where it's -- the license is held in the


25

corporate name is a disciplinary sanction?


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BENEDON:

To date, that is how California


2

has treated violations of the California statutory scheme. 


3

Correct, Your Honor. 


4
5
6
7

QUESTION:

Only -- only by these corporate


brokers or -- or by -- by individual brokers?

MR. BENEDON:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Individual


brokers as well.

Okay. 


8

QUESTION:

9

MR. BENEDON:

It's a statutory scheme that


10

applies to brokers in general and salespersons in general


11

who -- who allegedly violate the act.


12

QUESTION:

But I thought you said that if -- if


13

this were a license to an individual broker, if this were


14

held -- the license were held by Meyer as an individual --


15

that he would then have a principal agent relationship

16

with Crank.

17
18
19

Is that not so?


MR. BENEDON:

That is correct, Your Honor, if


it's an individual broker's license. 

I think I may have caused some confusion.

Under


20

general principles of agency law, common law principles of


21

agency law, the sales agent is in an agent principal


22

relationship with an individual broker.

23

violation of the act by the broker under California law,


24

then he would be subject to disciplinary action.

25

separate and apart from vicarious liability under the FHA,


If there is a


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

That is


1

which would adhere based on the principal agent


2

relationship. 

QUESTION:

3

Is there an issue in this case about


4

piercing the corporate veil as a means of holding Meyer


5

liable?

MR. BENEDON:

6

Not in this case, Your Honor.

We


7

hold that the theory and doctrine of corporate veil-


8

piercing is -- is available in the appropriate case as it


9

would be under any case under the general common law,


10

although here it's been -- it wasn't raised and it's been


11

waived, and it's never been proven.


12

QUESTION:

But they came --


13

QUESTION:

Was there some reference to


14

veil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth


15

Circuit? 

MR. BENEDON:

16

On the last page of argument in a


17

footnote, Your Honor, there's a reference arguing that


18

based on sole ownership, that they could establish an


19

alter ego, but as a matter of law, that's insufficient to


20

establish alter ego.

QUESTION:

21

23

summary judgment? 


Doesn't this come up on a motion for

Now, so if it came up on a

judgment on another ground.

In other words, the Ninth


2

Circuit ruled in their favor and now they're saying, well,


3

here's another theory on which we could prevail.

4

know -- certainly they can't get an immediate victory, but


5

if they attempt to defend the judgment on that basis,


6

aren't they then entitled to go back and make the case


7

rather than taking from them their victory and saying you

lose?

I didn't


They say, but we have another theory that would be

Up till now, we won with this one.

chance to air that other theory in support of the

MR. BENEDON:

They -- the theory was never

raised below.

15

driven inquiry. 
 Where it's -- and so the fact that it

16

wasn't raised below, it's -- it's now been waived.

raised, my understanding is in -- in order to have it sent


20

back on the -- on the basis that although the court below


21

relied on one theory, it could have relied on the other,


22

the motion for summary judgment put the plaintiff to his


23

proof to -- to at least come up with facts, the assertion


24

of facts, not the demonstration of them, but the assertion


25

of facts that would support the other theory.

And the

only fact contained here is control.

does not suffice to pierce veils, that's the end of the

case, it seems to me.

corporate veil would be meritorious.

we should send it back and let the Ninth Circuit decide.

I guess that's basically their argument, and I

You -- I would like to


amplify on that, Your Honor. 

The issue of -- of alter ego that's been now

raised for the first time in this -- in this Court by the

Solicitor General is based on speculation beyond the

showing that there was sole ownership and that there is no

insurance coverage.

to adhere to corporate formalities, that there was under-


Everything else is unsupported by the

QUESTION:

And did you deny it?


2

MR. BENEDON:

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

But


3

again, it was not raised as a disputed material fact on

the summary judgment, so there's no formal denial in the

record because it was never raised.

I'm denying it now.


And you said there was no genuine

that there were no facts?

MR. BENEDON:

That there was no issue regarding


payment of taxes under Mr. Meyer's personal ID number.

Which seems to me as though their

issue of whether they could pierce the corporate veil was


21

at least raised, and the question is whether their claim


22

of sole ownership was sufficient to establish that point. 


23

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. 


24

MR. BENEDON:

Right.

Well, that -- that's the


argument that's made in their footnote on the last page of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT G. SCHWEMM


17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. SCHWEMM:

18
19

Justice Stevens, and may it please


the Court:

I'd like to begin by addressing the


20
21

veil-piercing and the preserving issue, particularly with


22

respect to Justice Scalia's question because I disagree


23

with my learned friend on the procedural posture of this


24

case. 


25

There was a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

In the


1

complaint at that time, there were essentially two


2

theories.

3

liable as an individual because he owned the corporation,


4

and the complaint also said that Mr. Meyer should be


5

liable because he was the officer/broker.


6

The complaint said that Mr. Meyer should be


The district court granted in part, even with


7

respect to the Fair Housing Act claim, the 12(b)(6) motion


8

and, in particular, held that the allegations of the


9

complaint with respect to ownership under no circumstances


10

could lead to liability.

11

district court did not grant 12(b)(6) on was the issue


12

with respect to liability based on officer/broker. 


13

And the only thing that the


That led to discovery.

The district court then


14

granted summary judgment because it was the district


15

court's theory on that issue that there could not be

16

liability unless Mr. Meyer held an individual broker's


17

license as opposed to what he holds in this case, which is


18

a license through Triad, or more properly, according to


19

the California law, Triad holds the license through him.


20

So with all respect, what the district court


21

held in the 12(b)(6) motion was that no set of facts that


22

the plaintiffs could prove could justify veil-piercing. 


23

We never got --


24
25

QUESTION:

Well, could prove or -- or claimed


they could prove in response to the motion.

I mean,


25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you -- you don't have to sit back and say, I wonder what


2

they might be able to prove.

3

an offer of proof, and -- and what the court held was that


4

none of the facts that you claimed you could prove would


5

suffice.

6

what -- what the holding of the court was?


7

You -- you have to have made


Isn't that an accurate description of -- of


MR. SCHWEMM:

And the facts that we alleged were


8

that Mr. Meyer was the sole owner of the corporation,


9

which they denied, and that that was sufficient to impose


10

individual liability.

And when the district court granted


11

12(b)(6) motion, my understanding of that is that he is


12

saying, under no set of facts will you ever win. 


13

Now, what would --


14

QUESTION:

-- isn't that true that -- that you


15

have to have something more than simply a person being a

16

sole owner of a corporation?

17

create a corporation with himself as a 100 percent owner.


18

MR. SCHWEMM:

19

QUESTION:

Otherwise a person couldn't


Absolutely. 


All right.

So they're -- what


20

they're saying is you didn't allege anything than that,

No, no.

MR. SCHWEMM:

Yes.

I'm not saying 12(b)(6). 


If my learned friend was


11

right that this was a summary judgment dismissal of that


12

claim, I might agree.

13

But that's not right.


We were stopped at the very pleadings stage.

himself did all these things, or through his agent.

that's -- that's what it says.

MR. SCHWEMM:

8

Now,


The allegation, if I could refer


9

Your Honor to page 4 of the joint appendix in paragraph 6


10

of the complaint, says that he owned the corporation and


11

on that basis he's individually liable.

12

on and says he also was the officer/broker of the


13

corporation, which is the other theory --

QUESTION:

14

And then it goes


Yes, I see where it says he owned the


15

corporation. 
 What I don't see is something that says, and

16

therefore he is liable because he owned it.

parties.

14

The district court understood it.

QUESTION:

The


Well, he didn't seem to, in his


15

opinion, understand it because the only reference he has

16

to veil-piercing seems in a footnote in a paragraph.

17

what he seems to be saying there is referring to a


18

different argument, the argument that there could be no


19

veil-piercing because he didn't even own this corporation.


20

And he says, that -- that's really wrong.

21

Or maybe he said it was right, but he was wrong if he said


22

it was right.


23

MR. SCHWEMM:

And


It's not true. 


And that's at the 12(b)(6) stage.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. SCHWEMM:

Our position --

-- is that the Ninth Circuit's


24

judgment was correct, but it went too far when it reached


25

out and said under the Fair Housing Act we have to go


32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

beyond traditional principles of agency.

We think the


2

standard should be, just as it is under Title VII, the


3

employment discrimination law, in Kolstad, Burlington


4

Industries, and Faragher, that the standard for vicarious


5

liability under the Federal statute should be a Federal


6

standard.

7

principles as informed by the policies of the Fair Housing


8

Act. 


And that standard should be traditional agency


Now, the Ninth Circuit apparently felt that they


9
10

had to go beyond traditional agency principles.

11

we've tried to do in the brief in Roman numerals I, II,


12

and III is point out three separate and independent


13

alternative theories under traditional agency principles. 


14

And in that sense, we -- we think the Ninth Circuit just


15

reached out and tried to do something that wasn't

16

necessary. 

QUESTION:

17

What


Well, then is your piercing-of-


18

corporate-veil theory a Federal theory or a State law


19

theory? 


20

MR. SCHWEMM:

Our position on that is that it's


21

probably Federal law, but as I read Bestfoods, the Court


22

hasn't specifically determined, and if I may say that


23

this -- this is something that I don't have a position on. 


24

But either way, we are entitled to a remand whether it's


25

Federal or California law.

3

and we certainly don't disagree with the Government --


4

that it is a Federal question. 


5

And if I may, I want to get into those parts I,


6

II, and III of our brief, and particularly the first part


7

and vicarious liability. 


8

The problem we have with petitioner's argument


9

is that I believe it's based on two faulty assumptions. 


10

One is that petitioner wants to take certain parts of the


11

California corporation and real estate law that are


12

advantageous to him, but he doesn't want to take the other


13

part, which is the responsibility part.

14

true that in California, a corporation can be a broker,


15

but it cannot be a broker unless there is an individual

16

appointed who is an officer of the corporation and has


17

qualified under the broker requirements, and that


18

individual is required by California law to take


19

responsibility for the supervision and control of the


20

agency. 

QUESTION:

21

It is literally


Yes, but your opponent says that


22

the -- the results under California law is he can be


23

disciplined if he fails to do so, but there are no


24

California cases holding him personally liable if he fails


25

to do so.

MR. SCHWEMM:

Our position is that that may be

We believe this is a Federal


Do you think it's right or wrong?

If we got a remand, Your Honor, we


6

would very much like the opportunity on this basis to


7

argue that it's wrong.

8

that holds that, but a year later, California amends its


9

licensing statute to add the very key provision in this


There is a California case in 1978


10

case which is 10159.2 which says that the individual who's


11

appointed by the corporation as the officer/broker has


12

personal responsibility.

13

remand that that change. 

But I want to -- I want to make the point


14
15

So our argument would be on


that --

QUESTION:

16

Well, can -- can I go back to an


17

earlier point you made.

18

that the corporate broker, the -- the one who's designated


19

for the corporation, has to exercise control over the --


20

over the brokers in the corporation.

21

true.


22

You said that California law says


That may well be


The -- the issue is not whether he -- he has to


23

exercise control.

It's whether he exercises control in


24

his personal status or rather exercises control as an


25

officer of the corporation.

If it's in the latter

capacity that he exercises control, he -- he should not


2

have personal liability.

MR. SCHWEMM:

5

QUESTION:

It's the corporation that has


Well --


Now, as I understand the California


6

law, this broker could not operate under that license on


7

his own.

8

officer of the corporation.

The only way he could use that license was as an


MR. SCHWEMM:

9

Isn't that correct?


I would put it actually a little


10

differently.

If you divide the corporation from


11

Mr. Meyer, Mr. Meyer can then apply, because he's


12

qualified, to become a broker.

13

file a paper, but he would clearly get the status.

14

Triad, Inc. would cease at that moment being able to be a


15

broker. 
 And none of the acts in this case, none of the

16

salesman's acts, could have been performed under the


17

rubric of Triad.


Currently he would have to

But


And the other point that I was going to make


18
19

about the petitioner's argument that I think is faulty is


20

it's the assumption that if Triad, Inc. is the principal


21

of these agents, nobody else can be the principal of these


22

agents.

23

agency principles as reflected in the Restatement,


24

section 20, comment f, which says there can be joint


25

principals.


And that's clearly inconsistent with longstanding

Do you think the Gipson case that you


cited in your brief is on all fours with your case?

MR. SCHWEMM:

11

No, Your Honor, it's not on all


12

fours.

I believe what it says is if the broker is


13

operating as a sole proprietorship, as an individual, he


14

clearly is vicariously liable.

15

86 percent of the brokers in California do.

There are many uses, Your Honor,

39 States, including California, said we will allow

is responsible. 

And in this particular case, there came a point

5

when Mr. Meyer was trying to get the Triad license


6

extended.

7

because you personally, Meyer, haven't engaged in the


8

continuing education requirements that an officer/broker


9

is required --

That's even tougher than -- than what


11

most States provide for lawyers.


12

MR. SCHWEMM:

It's very analogous to lawyers,


Your Honor. 

QUESTION:

It isn't analogous at all. 


No.

Lawyers -- lawyers can -- can avoid personal liability.
QUESTION:

California doesn't give personal


17

liability there, does it?

MR. STEWART:
