         ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

7

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

            MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

9

it please the Court:

10

            The joint sentencing proceeding in these

11

cases did not violate the Eighth Amendment because each

12

defendant received the individualized sentencing

13

determination to which he was entitled.

14

            Each presented all of the mitigating

15

evidence he chose to produce.  The jury instructions

16

explicitly told the jury to consider each defendant

17

individually.  In fact, there were several separate

18

instructions, some that related only to one defendant or

19

only to another defendant.

20

            Each  the jury for each defendant then had

21

to complete a specific verdict form, and this jury had

22

already proven its ability to distinguish between these

23

two defendants when it convicted one of some counts in

24

the original guilt phase, of which it acquitted the

25

other.

Alderson Reporting Company

5
1

            The only way the Kansas Supreme Court gets

2

to an Eighth Amendment error in this case  well,

3

really, there are two points.  One, it relied upon

4

possible, and one instance not even, violations or

5

errors of State law to find a prejudice that  that

6

rose to an Eighth Amendment level.  And two, it

7

disregarded altogether, with really no explanation, the

8

longstanding foundational principle that juries are

9

presumed to follow their instructions.

10

            The two State law errors, arguably, that 

11

the Kansas Supreme Court found, one was the admission of

12

evidence of the sister who made the comment about

13

Reginald may have told me he shot those people.

14

            Well, that's not even an error of State law.

15

They said basically that's prejudicial.  It might not

16

have come in if they had been tried separately, but in

17

fact, that evidence would be relevant to aggravator

18

number 1, that the defendant killed multiple people.

19

That would have been admissible evidence and that 

20

that just can't be an Eighth Amendment violation.

21

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the Kansas  the

22

Kansas Court found independent of the severance question

23

that there was constitutional error in the admission of

24

hearsay.

25

            MR. McALLISTER:  That's the third question

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

presented in the cert position on which the Court has

2

not taken any action yet, Your Honor.

3

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Yes.  But when it goes

4

back to Kansas, they can still say thank you for telling

5

us about severance, but we have this other ground that

6

leads to the same bottom line.

7

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, and we are certainly

8

hopeful that the Court will take another look at that

9

second question depending on its resolution of the two

10

questions that are in front of it today.

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But would 

12

            MR. McALLISTER:  But if it goes back in that

13

posture, yes, they would have another ground.

14

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was  was any evidence

15

introduced with respect to one of the defendants that

16

could not have been introduced against the other had

17

there been severance?

18

            MR. McALLISTER:  The only arguable evidence

19

really, Justice Kennedy, is what  what Reginald refers

20

to as the corrupting influence.  But even that,

21

arguably, would be relevant to the mercy consideration

22

to show his character, the nature of this person that is

23

being sentenced.

24

            And that was the notion that his mother

25

testified that sometimes  of course, Jonathan looked

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

up to his big brother, and maybe sometimes Reginald was

2

a bad influence on him.  But that's  that was really

3

the extent of that evidence.  And that might have come

4

in as a rebuttal to a mercy argument.

5

            The Kansas Supreme Court did not really

6

definitively say that was even State law error, but even

7

if you assumed it was 

8

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me 

9

            MR. McALLISTER:   it would only be State

10

law.

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   what the

12

constitutional standard you're asking us to apply?  I 

13

this argument goes to harmless error; a serious position

14

to take, that even if there was error, no foul  a foul

15

but no penalty.  Okay?

16

            But what standard are we applying?  We are

17

not applying the rule  or are we or should we apply

18

the Rule 14 standard?

19

            MR. McALLISTER:  No, not  not for Eighth

20

Amendment purposes, Your Honor.  Kansas would propose 

21

and I suspect the United States can propose something as

22

well, but it's a very high standard as an Eighth

23

Amendment matter.  And we would say  we would be

24

content to accept something like it's a serious risk

25

that a defendant will not be able to receive

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

individualized sentencing.  It is sort of molding the

2

traditional notions of joinder with the Eighth Amendment

3

consideration, because that seems to be the only Eighth

4

Amendment consideration here, is the individualized

5

sentencing.

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it the Eighth Amendment

7

or is it due process?

8

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, you could use a due

9

process standard, Justice Scalia, which we would also be

10

fine with.  The question would really be, did joinder so

11

infect the process with unfairness that the proceedings

12

are fundamentally unfair.

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That seems like a  a

14

language that is relevant rather than the cruel and

15

unusual punishments language.

16

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, and that's exactly

17

what this Court said in Romano v. Oklahoma, a case in

18

which the defendant's other death sentence in a separate

19

case was admitted against the defendant in the

20

sentencing proceeding.  That sentence later got

21

reversed, and the Oklahoma court said the jury should

22

not have heard about his other sentence as a matter of

23

State law.  That defendant Romano said it is an Eighth

24

Amendment violation, and it's a due process violation.

25

The Court said the Eighth Amendment doesn't have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

anything to say about what's admissible really.  That is

2

State evidentiary rules, that's not an Eighth Amendment

3

issue.

4

            And the Court went on to address the due

5

process claim in Romano, applying that very standard.

6

And as we suggest the Court should do here, one of the

7

things it pointed to specifically was jury instructions

8

that said these are the aggravating circumstances you

9

may consider, you may not consider any others.  The

10

court said we presume the jury follows its instructions,

11

and nothing in the instructions gave the jury here any

12

way to give effect to that improperly admitted evidence.

13

            And that's true here to the extent Reginald

14

Carr argues some of this evidence was really used as a

15

nonstatutory aggravating circumstance.  By statute,

16

Kansas does not allow anything other than statutory

17

aggravating circumstances.  In the instructions  No. 5

18

I think for Reginald, No. 7 for Jonathan  very

19

explicitly and clearly say, here are the four

20

aggravating circumstances the State has alleged.  And

21

then the next paragraph, you may not consider anything

22

else as an aggravating circumstance.

23

            So in our view, the most the Kansas Supreme

24

Court could come up with is potential violation of State

25

law if, in fact, the evidence which is minimal in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

greater scheme of this proceeding that Reginald was a

2

corrupting influence on Jonathan, if that would not have

3

been admitted, that's really all the Kansas Supreme

4

Court is left with to hang its hat on in finding  in

5

saying there is an Eighth Amendment violation here.

6

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Can you tell me if you're

7

aware, in other States or perhaps even in Kansas in

8

other trials, is it a common practice to sever when

9

there  for the penalty phase when there are multiple

10

defendants?

11

            MR. McALLISTER:  Justice Kennedy, I think in

12

the briefs  I do not remember the exact page  there

13

are two States that mandate severance  one, Ohio 

14

and that's, I think, Georgia and Mississippi.

15

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  This is just for penalty

16

phase?

17

            MR. McALLISTER:  I think it's for the entire

18

proceeding.  And then Ohio, there is a presumption in

19

the favor of severance, but all the other States, there

20

is nothing that mandates or even, I think, creates a

21

presumption of 

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems it would be very

23

difficult for the trial judge to decide which should go

24

first.

25

            MR. McALLISTER:  It would, and that's one of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

the reasons  I mean, not just judicial economy but, in

2

a sense, overall fairness 

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

4

            MR. McALLISTER:   having them tried

5

together and you don't have one defendant having an

6

opportunity to preview the evidence that the State may

7

present and the arguments that may be made.  This Court

8

has recognized that potential tactical advantage in

9

other joinder cases.  Of course, it has not had a

10

joinder capital case like this, but in other

11

circumstances that's a factor.

12

            The Court has also emphasized the

13

consistency of determinations with respect to facts.  We

14

are not saying the outcomes have to be the same, but

15

when the evidence, the mitigation evidence is 99 percent

16

overlapping  they were using the same witnesses, even

17

their experts were coauthors.  They were testifying to

18

the exact same things essentially about each brother.

19

            All that overlapping evidence, what this

20

allows is a consistent determination by the jury and

21

evaluation of all that mitigating evidence that leads to

22

whatever outcome the jury decides.  But the jury was

23

very clearly told to consider each defendant

24

individually.  And that's what they got, was individual

25

consideration.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

            I would say also, remember, even if this

2

Court were to think there were some kind of error which

3

Kansas simply does not see here  again, at most,

4

possibly an error of Kansas law, not an Eighth Amendment

5

violation  it would have to be harmless under any

6

standard, and Kansas would accept any standard that is

7

beyond a reasonable doubt certainly here.  Given the

8

four uncontested aggravating circumstances 

9

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you'd also have to

10

look  you have it at the top of your head, maybe

11

forget if you don't, but what I thought I would do is I

12

wanted to look to the aggravating circumstances, what

13

were they.

14

            MR. McALLISTER:  What were they.

15

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Let's call it "he was the

16

monster" approach.  Reginald was the monster and

17

Jonathan was the puppet or whatever.  I want to look at

18

the aggravators.  I also want to look at the mitigators

19

that Reginald said existed, and then see if this

20

comparative monster, let's call it, fits into any of

21

them.

22

            Do you know?  Do you know the pages where

23

they are, just by chance?

24

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I think the  in

25

terms of the  yes, the aggravating circumstances are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

set forth in the instructions, Justice Breyer, so 

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I know where they

3

are.

4

            MR. McALLISTER:  Yeah, Instruction No. 5 for

5

Reginald and Instruction No. 7 for Jonathan, and then

6

following each one, so I believe Instruction No. 6 and

7

Instruction No. 8.

8

            But the mitigating  those are the

9

statutory mitigating circumstances.  So what happens in

10

these cases is the jury is told, here are the statutory.

11

And we list all of them that are listed in the Kansas

12

statute.  And then you can 

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:  On what page do you list

14

them?

15

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, so those are listed

16

in Instruction No. 6 and Instruction No. 8.  It's all in

17

the petition 

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:  If, in fact, this gets in,

19

then I guess what I have to do is go through this huge

20

record on the sentencing anyway and see do I really

21

think that this evidence that came in that the younger

22

one thought the older one was the monster, et cetera,

23

did it really have an effect?

24

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that what I would have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

to do?  I don't see how I could avoid that if they are

2

at all relevant.

3

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, I would say, first of

4

all, if were you to do that, it would be quite clear.

5

The evidence is overwhelming.

6

            But furthermore, the premise is not

7

supported really by the record.  They say Jonathan's

8

whole strategy was to paint Reginald as the bad actor

9

here.  That's not really what happened.  What they both

10

presented was lots of witnesses and testimony about

11

their  their childhood and their experiences growing

12

up, and they presented psychological experts to talk

13

about their mental condition.  No expert said Reginald

14

had some kind of psychological control over Jonathan.

15

That  that testimony, to the extent it's there at all,

16

comes from their mother.

17

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But what do you think about

18

a case, whether or not this is that case, in which it is

19

quite clear to a judge that each of two defendants is

20

just going to be pointing to the other person and

21

saying, that was the bad actor.  He is why these

22

terrible crimes committed.  And you know that  you

23

know, each of them is going to be doing that.

24

            Should a judge separate the penalty

25

proceeding in that context?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

            MR. McALLISTER:  Well, not necessarily.  If

2

the high standard is met that it will not be possible,

3

perhaps, to give individualized consideration to each in

4

an Eighth Amendment or a due process standard is going

5

to be so fundamentally unfair, if you can meet that very

6

high standard, then  but that's always been the

7

Court's approach.  It is a casebycase determination.

8

Even Zafiro, which is a joinder case 

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, I guess I am asking

10

you in what kind of factual circumstances you would find

11

that standard met?

12

            MR. McALLISTER:  Rarely, but I think it

13

would be  certainly the Court has recognized in

14

Bruton, you have some sort of codefendant confession 

15

I mean, confession situations, if there was something

16

that had not been used in the guilt phase, might be

17

relevant in the sentencing.  That might be so

18

prejudicial.

19

            We have tried to think of other examples.  I

20

might suggest something like one is claiming at that

21

point in time some kind of insanity, even though they

22

didn't succeed on that at trial.  If there was something

23

really starkly contradictory in their presentations and

24

you were going to get a lot of evidence about one that

25

really had nothing to do at all with the other.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

            But we do believe it's a high standard that

2

would rarely be satisfied, especially given the Court's

3

longstanding presumption that the jury follows its

4

instructions.  And that's one thing I would point out

5

here, the complaints that each makes in this Court.

6

First of all, at least one of those complaints really

7

wasn't even made in the Kansas Supreme Court, much less

8

the trial court, and that's the shackling of Reginald

9

and whether that might have prejudiced Jonathan.

10

            But they  there was no complaints during

11

the sentencing proceeding.  This corrupting influence

12

evidence is relevant only for Jonathan's mitigation

13

case, not with respect to Reginald; can we have a

14

limiting instruction?  Reginald has antisocial

15

personality disorder; there was no request for any sort

16

of limiting that that  that's not applicable to

17

Jonathan.  Although, of course, the irony there is that

18

Jonathan's own expert all but diagnosed him as

19

antisocial personality.  He said out of 26 risk factors

20

that the Department of Justice has recognized for

21

violence and sexual violence, Jonathan has 24 of them.

22

            And both brothers talked about family

23

history of mental illness.  Both brothers and their

24

experts talked about whether some of these things were

25

hereditary or genetic.  This was really a case in which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

it made very good sense to proceed with a joint

2

proceeding, because the evidence, 99 percent was

3

overlapping, essentially.  I mean, they were calling the

4

same witnesses, taking turns with those witnesses.

5

Judicial economy nor fairness, neither one would have

6

been served any better by separating this into two

7

proceedings.

8

            And, in fact, I will conclude for now,

9

unless there are further questions, with this

10

observation, that prior to trial, to the guilt phase,

11

the prosecution actually offered to have two juries sit

12

through this proceeding.  Jonathan's attorney said he

13

would consider it, and Reginald's attorney rejected it.

14

            So the State even tried to  to agree to

15

some workable system and  and it was declined.

16

            So unless there are further questions, I

17

will reserve the remainder of my time.

            MS. KOVNER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24

please the Court:

25

            The Kansas Supreme Court erred when it found

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

that the State violated the Eighth Amendment by

2

conducting joint sentencing proceedings for the crimes

3

the Respondents committed together.  Joint proceedings

4

can enhance accuracy and fairness, as a long line of

5

this Court's cases hold.  They provide a fuller

6

evidentiary record to juries that are assessing relative

7

culpability, and they prevent arbitrary disparities that

8

may arise when two juries reach inconsistent conclusions

9

about the common facts of a single crime.

10

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Ms. Kovner, is there

11

any difference between the Federal government's position

12

and the position of the State of Kansas on this

13

question?

14

            MS. KOVNER:  As to the standard, I think

15

there's a small difference.  I think our proposal is

16

that the constitutional standard is whether evidence or

17

argument resulted in a denial of due process or the

18

deprivation of an individualized sentencing proceeding.

19

            And that's slightly different from Kansas's

20

standard, because Kansas is proposing a rule that

21

involves analysis of risk, and we think that is part of

22

the statutory rule under Rule 14, as Justice Sotomayor

23

alluded to.  It's also part of the statutory standard

24

that states "by and large are applying," but we think

25

the constitutional question is just, was this person

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

deprived of a fair trial by the evidence that came in?

2

And that's the constitutional question.

3

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  When you said it the first

4

time, you had "deprived of a fair trial" and then

5

something about individualized sentencing; is that

6

right?  Is that supposed to indicate that this is

7

deriving both from the Due Process Clause and from the

8

Eighth Amendment?

9

            MS. KOVNER:  Well, the Eighth Amendment does

10

speak to this need for an individualized sentencing

11

determination.  We would think that the Due Process

12

Clause also requires that proceedings be individualized.

13

But we would agree that if there were a situation where

14

there was a joint trial and because of the evidence

15

introduced by one, for instance, a jury simply could not

16

give individualized consideration to a second  second

17

defendant, that would be a constitutional problem.

18

            And to give an example of that  I mean, I

19

think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that

20

is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains

21

only to one defendant, but that that aggravating

22

evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that

23

the jury couldn't really separate the two and would be

24

inclined to sort of judge the second one by association.

25

            So I think that's the example the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

gives in Zafiro.  But it's not 

2

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you think

3

individualized consideration is required even in the

4

noncapital cases?

5

            MS. KOVNER:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  So I

6

think 

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's really a due process

8

consideration, isn't it?

9

            MS. KOVNER:  I think due process encompasses

10

that requirement of individualized consideration.

11

            Just to address several of the points that

12

came up during Petitioner's argument, I think  as to

13

the question that Justice Kagan asked about whether,

14

when defendants are simply pointing the finger at each

15

other, that would necessitate severance.  I think that's

16

the question that the Court addressed in Zafiro, where

17

that was essentially the claim the defendants were

18

making, that we're both going to point the finger at

19

each other at trial.  And the Court said that doesn't

20

necessitate severance; that that may, in fact, increase

21

the jury's ability to reach an accurate verdict, to

22

reach an accurate assessment of relative culpability,

23

and enhance fairness.  So we don't think that that's a

24

situation that would require severance.

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I  I guess the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

strongest evidence for Reginald is Temica's testimony.

2

It's  it's pretty prejudicial.  She said he's  he's

3

the one who  he said he's the one who shot.

4

            MS. KOVNER:  I don't think that that's

5

prejudicial evidence, certainly not any constitutional

6

problem with the admission of that evidence.  I don't

7

think that even Reginald Carr is asserting that that

8

evidence couldn't have come in against him.  Rather he

9

is asserting or the State below suggested  the State

10

court below suggested maybe that  maybe the State

11

didn't know about that evidence, and maybe just as a

12

factual matter it wouldn't have come in.

13

            But there's no constitutional unfairness

14

with evidence coming in on a codefendant's case that's

15

harmful but accurate as to you.  That's something the

16

Court said in  in Zafiro.  If it's accurate and

17

relevant evidence that comes in on a codefendant's

18

case, there's no constitutional unfairness as to you.

19

            I think Reginald's primary claim before this

20

Court is that there was a violation of State evidentiary

21

law because some of the other evidence, the evidence of

22

bad influence, might not have come in under the State

23

rules.  I think this Court's cases are clear that a

24

violation of State evidentiary law is simply a matter of

25

State law.  The State could decide that necessitates

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

reversal, but it's not a constitutional error.  That's

2

what this Court said in Romano.

3

            JUSTICE BREYER:  It would depend on what is

4

was, wouldn't it?  I mean, so I'm still asking the same

5

question.  If the  I take it that Reginald could not

6

have introduced evidence refuting these brothers' state

7

of mind that he was the monster.  That's what you're

8

referring to by the bad influence.

9

            So the jury might have taken that evidence

10

into account in trying to decide whether Reginald, for

11

other reasons than in the statute, was a sympathetic

12

enough character not to provide the death penalty.

13

That's conceivable.

14

            But severance is very, very rare, and joint

15

trials are very common.  And very common is the claim on

16

an appeal in any kind of a case that it shouldn't  it

17

should have been severed.

18

            So do you have cases that you can think of

19

that would be good precedent for you where a court,

20

including particularly this Court, said, of course there

21

might be a little prejudice here, some, but it's not

22

enough to warrant severance?  Because I think what I

23

have to do is read the record on this point, and then I

24

need something to compare it with.

25

            MS. KOVNER:  Well, I want to go back  I'd

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

like to answer the question and then go back to the

2

premise 

3

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.

4

            MS. KOVNER:   because I am not sure I

5

agree with the premise.

6

            But as to whether any prejudice is a

7

problem, I think the best case for us is Zafiro.  Zafiro

8

talks about the idea that what you need  that joinder

9

is presumably going to enhance fairness and accuracy.

10

And what you need is substantial prejudice, even to have

11

a statutory problem, and then  even then we are going

12

to presume that a limiting instruction would be

13

sufficient to cure it.

14

            So that would be our best case on that

15

point.

16

            But, Your Honor, I think the inquiry under

17

the Eighth Amendment has to be would the Constitution

18

have prohibited this evidence from coming in as to

19

Reginald Carr.  And we think the answer is no.  Any

20

evidence that's relevant to an individual defendant 

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, normally in severance

22

cases, forgetting the death cases, seems to me the

23

argument has been, look, they never would have gotten

24

this piece of evidence in against my client.  They

25

brought it in against the other client.  Now, go look at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

that evidence and you'll see how much my prejudice 

2

that my client was prejudiced by that.

3

            I do not know whether you call that due

4

process.  Maybe you do.  But that's the kind of argument

5

which seems for a quantitative weighing.  That's why I

6

asked the question.

7

            MS. KOVNER:  I think I would go back to

8

Zafiro again on that one, Your Honor, because I think

9

Zafiro establishes that when accurate evidence comes in

10

through a codefendant that is relative  that's

11

relevant to the jury's determination, that's not

12

prejudice.  That's information that may enhance the

13

accuracy of what the jury 

14

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Can you tell me why we

15

should apply the Zafiro standard, which was joint

16

trials, but this is joint sentencing where there is a

17

different  why there should be exactly the same

18

standard applied?

19

            MS. KOVNER:  So we think Zafiro 

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you need

21

individualized sentencing?  So can't you say, or aren't

22

you required to say that something a little bit more

23

than  than the efficiency of a joint trial has to

24

compel 

25

            MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   has to be considered?

2

            MS. KOVNER:  Yes, Your Honor.  We agree that

3

sentencings may involve special considerations.  What we

4

think Zafiro establishes is that generally when more

5

relevant information is placed before a jury, that's not

6

prejudice to a defendant, that's not unfair, and that

7

juries with more information are likely to make more

8

accurate decisions, and we think that's equally true at

9

sentencing.

10

            And, similarly, that juries with more  who

11

are confronted with two defendants together can avoid

12

the unwarranted disparities that may occur when juries

13

reach different results  two different juries

14

considering the same facts reach different results on

15

those facts.  And that's equally true at sentencing.

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry, but I'm not 

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you would need

18

two  two separate juries, wouldn't you?  I mean 

19

            MS. KOVNER:  That's  that's what the

20

Kansas Supreme Court said here.  And the result of that

21

is  is going to be that two different juries

22

confronted with the very same aggravating circumstances

23

in largely parallel mitigation cases may simply weigh

24

factors like mercy differently.

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But wouldn't  wouldn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

the second jury have to know the facts relevant to

2

mitigation, as well as aggravation, I suppose, that came

3

out in the main trial?

4

            MS. KOVNER:  It's  it's certainly

5

possible, Your Honor, that if there was a second jury,

6

the government could simply introduce, for instance, the

7

evidence of Reginald Carr's statement to his sister at

8

the second trial.  So you're introducing this disparity

9

that Justice Kennedy alluded to between the defendant

10

who goes first and the defendant who goes second.

11

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, would this second jury

12

have been present for the  for the guilt phase?

13

            MS. KOVNER:  Well, in  in the Federal

14

system, there are a number of ways you could do it.

15

Could you have two juries that hear both the guilt phase

16

and  and the penalty phase.  You could have a second

17

jury impanelled only for the  the penalty phase.  But

18

then in a case like this, you would need to essentially

19

repeat all the trial evidence, including calling victims

20

again, because that  because the State was relying on

21

its evidence from the trial phase, and that is

22

generally, we submit, going to be the case.

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I think I missed something

24

you said, but  forgive me.  But the constitutional

25

standard that you're proposing, is that a constitutional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

standard for both the guilt phase and the sentencing

2

phase?  And is it also for both noncapital and capital?

3

Are you drawing no distinctions among those four things?

4

            MS. KOVNER:  I think that's right, Your

5

Honor.  I mean, that  because we think that the due

6

process standard essentially subsumes the requirement of

7

individualized consideration, and, of course, due

8

process is applicable at the trial phase and at the

9

sentencing phase in capital and noncapital trials.

10

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So it seems a little bit

11

counterintuitive to me, the idea that, you know, the

12

guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact

13

same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a

14

capital crime and then as the sentencing phase of a

15

capital crime.

16

            MS. KOVNER:  If I may answer really briefly?

17

Your Honor, we think the reason that's the case is that

18

joint trials often enhance accuracy and fairness.  So we

19

agree that accuracy and fairness considerations are at

20

their paramount in capital cases, but we do not think

21

that militates for a different standard in capital cases

22

because we think that the standard that the courts are

23

applying is one that's going to generally enhance those

24

values.

             ORAL ARGUMENT OF FREDERICK LIU

3

       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 14450

4

            MR. LIU:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may please

5

the Court:

6

            I want to begin by emphasizing how narrow

7

our rule is.  Justice Kagan asked the question involving

8

a  a case where the two defendants pointed their

9

fingers at each other.  We are not advocating a rule

10

that would require severance in any case where two

11

defendants point their fingers at  at each other.

12

            We are advocating a rule that this Court has

13

recognized in Zant, Stringer, in Sanders, that  that

14

an Eighth Amendment violation occurs when the weighing

15

process itself is skewed.  And the weighing 

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But are you saying the

17

severance rule is the same in noncapital as in capital

18

cases?

19

            MR. LIU:  The general severance rule, Your

20

Honor, is the same.

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And you just look for

22

prejudice?

23

            MR. LIU:  Exactly.  The general rule is you

24

can't have severance when it would compromise someone's

25

constitutional rights.  The right at issue here just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

happens to be an Eighth Amendment right, but we are not

2

advocating an Eighth Amendment rule that would apply

3

beyond the capital context or even beyond the penalty

4

phase.  That's 

5

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You know, if you

6

violated an individualized sentence, why would we apply

7

harmless error review?  Meaning, it seems

8

counterintuitive.  We are now becoming the sentencing 

9

the sentencing body.  No?

10

            MR. LIU:  Absolutely.  And I think 

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Oh, so then we have to

12

do the  in harmless error, we have to decide whether

13

the aggravators outweighed the mitigators, et cetera, so

14

much that none of the error could have affected that

15

choice?

16

            MR. LIU:  Well, this Court, Your Honor,

17

recognized in Satterwhite precisely how difficult it

18

would be to conduct a harmless error analysis in a

19

penalty phase, and that's precisely because there are so

20

many factors involved.

21

            Sure, the crimes in the case were horrific,

22

but that's just one side of the scale in a harmless

23

error inquiry.  There is an entire other side of the

24

balance, the mitigation side.  And so it is quite

25

difficult for this Court, on a cold record, to go

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

through the harmless error analysis.

2

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  We have to do it, though,

4

right?  I mean, that's  that's part of  part of our

5

jurisprudence.

6

            So what  what do you think are the 

7

are  are the factors that would suggest the jury would

8

have come out a different way had the rule that you urge

9

been adopted?  What  what specifically?  One is the

10

shackling of the  of the codefendant?

11

            MR. LIU:  Well, we are not representing

12

Reginald Carr.  We're not basing our claim around the

13

shackling.  Our  our claim revolves around the

14

evidence that Jonathan presented that Reginald had a

15

corrupting influence on him while they were growing up.

16

And that evidence, as the Kansas Supreme Court itself

17

held at Petition Appendix 411, falls beyond the rubric

18

of any valid sentencing factor.

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But, Mr. Liu, I mean, given

20

the kind of evidence that was presented in this case,

21

the idea that somebody was a lousy big brother seems

22

pretty small on  in the  in the scale of things.

23

            MR. LIU:  Well, a few responses to that.  To

24

begin with, I think Your  Your Honor is understating

25

the evidence here.  This wasn't just that Reginald was a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

lousy big brother.  It was that he did things to

2

Jonathan that turned Jonathan into the person who was

3

capable of committing and even leading these crimes.  So

4

this wasn't just "lousy big brother" evidence, this was

5

evidence that Reginald himself was the source of what

6

caused Jonathan to do the things he did.

7

            But, Your Honor, I think it's also important

8

to keep in mind two separate parts of the inquiry; there

9

is the violation and the harmless error analysis.  And

10

this Court said in Stringer that even a thumb on the

11

scales is enough to skew the weighing process in

12

violation of the Eighth Amendment.

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But what  what

14

evidence that shouldn't have been admitted wouldn't have

15

been admitted in the  in the separate trial?

16

            MR. LIU:  Well, all this evidence, Mr. Chief

17

Justice, that says Reginald was a corrupting influence

18

on his brother, that wouldn't have come in in a separate

19

trial for two reasons:  Number one, as the Kansas

20

Supreme Court held at Petition Appendix 411, that

21

evidence was improper, nonstatutory, aggravating

22

evidence, which is to say, all the aggravating factors

23

before the prosecution pursuit in this case all had to

24

do with the circumstances of the crime.

25

            But this evidence had nothing to do with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

circumstances of what happened on December 15th, it had

2

to do with the defendant's character concerning

3

circumstances that occurred years, even decades, before

4

the crimes at issue.

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Now, wait a minute.

6

You're  you're representing the brother who was

7

the alleged corrupting influence, right?

8

            MR. LIU:  That's right, the corruptor.

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The corruptor was

10

sentenced, by the same jury, to death.  So how could it

11

possibly be that without the corrupting action of your

12

client, the jury would have sentenced your client to

13

life even though the corruptee was sentenced to death?

14

That doesn't seem to me at all likely.

15

            MR. LIU:  Well, to begin  begin with, I

16

don't think Jonathan Carr's sentence is a proper

17

baseline to use.  As my friend will argue in a few

18

minute, his own sentence was prejudiced by severance.

19

            But even moving beyond that, there is every

20

reason to believe that the jury viewed Jonathan as

21

overall more culpable than Reginald.  After all, the

22

State never established who the shooter was here.  If

23

the jury believed that Jonathan was the shooter, the

24

jury could have believed that Jonathan was so culpable

25

that even with his evidence that he had been corrupted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

by Reginald, it would have given a life sentence.  I

2

think 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Let me  let me put the

4

crime to you.  You tell me which of these descriptions

5

of the  of the crime are  are incorrect.  These two

6

men broke into a house in which there were three men and

7

two women.  They ordered the five to remove their

8

clothes, forced them into a closet.  Over the course of

9

three hours, they demanded that the two women perform

10

various sexual acts on one another.  They demanded at

11

gunpoint that each of the three men have sexual

12

intercourse with both women.

13

            Then Reginald drove the victims one by one

14

to various ATMs to withdraw cash.  Jonathan raped or

15

attempted to rape both women twice, and Reginald raped

16

Holly G., who later testified, once.  Placing the three

17

men, still naked, in the trunk of one of their cars, the

18

cars drove all five to a soccer field, forced them to

19

kneel in the snow, and shot them executionstyle in the

20

back of the head.

21

            One of them, fortuitously, was not killed

22

because  I think it was a hair clip that she was

23

wearing deflected the bullet.  And she is the one who

24

testified to all of this activity.

25

            And you truly think  oh, and they ran over

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

her too.  After shooting her in the head, the car ran

2

over her.

3

            You truly think that this jury, but for the

4

fact that your client was a corruptor, would not have

5

imposed the death penalty?

6

            MR. LIU:  We do, Justice Scalia.  In your

7

own opinion in last term in Glossip, you noted that the

8

egregiousness of an offense is just one factor in

9

determining whether a sentence is appropriate at the

10

penalty phase.  And Reginald Carr submitted a week and a

11

half full of mitigation evidence that extenuated this

12

offense.

13

            So I don't  I think when you  when you

14

take all that all into account and consider the fact

15

that this wasn't an easy case for the jury  the jury,

16

after all, deliberated a full day on what the  what

17

Kansas thinks is quite an easy case.

18

            I think the  the scales of the weighing

19

process were much more evenly balanced than that.

20

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Do you think that the desire

21

to spare Holly from having to testify more than once is

22

a relevant factor here?  And if so, how could that be 

23

how do you  how would you propose to accommodate them?

24

            MR. LIU:  It's not a relevant factor and

25

that's not my saying it, it's this Court saying it.

Alderson Reporting Company

This Court in Zafiro and Bruton has said that the

2

benefits of joinder, while they may exist, cannot come

3

at the price of constitutional rights.

4

            So while I  I completely appreciate that

5

severance would require some duplication of resources,

6

that's precisely the sort of benefit that this Court has

7

said cannot trump the Eighth Amendment.

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So if you're right, joinder

9

being among the most common kind of thing that gangs and

10

drugs and so forth, why won't the same argument be made

11

over and over preventing  requiring severance in

12

dozens and dozens, perhaps hundreds of cases where the

13

government tries people together?  Because they will say

14

there are different relationships among members of the

15

gang.  Those relationships  some evidence would come

16

in that would negative the relationship that would tend

17

to show that this particular individual wasn't actually

18

involved in this aspect of it, et cetera.

19

            That's why my experience on the Courts,

20

lower courts particularly, leads me to think it's a very

21

rarely accepted argument, severance.

22

            MR. LIU:  Well, you're right, Justice

23

Breyer 

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's why I'm

25

interested in  I mean, because if it were, you'd find

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

it very unusual to try people together, which, in fact,

2

is very usual.  And so when you told me there is no

3

separate thing for the death cases, then I imagine it

4

would affect every criminal trial of gangs throughout

5

the country.

6

            MR. LIU:  Well, I think 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And that is something

8

that's concerning me and I am looking for an answer.

9

            MR. LIU:  You're absolutely right, Justice

10

Breyer, that under our rule, the circumstances of each

11

case are relevant.  But I think what's also important

12

is  is that some  the circumstances of some cases

13

might not get rise for severance.

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's what I'm looking

15

for.  Why is it you believe that if I were to decide in

16

your favor on this case and find the sufficient

17

prejudice to warrant severance here, I wouldn't at the

18

same time be throwing a huge monkey wrench 

19

            MR. LIU:  Right.

20

            JUSTICE BREYER:   into the ordinary cases

21

of gangs, drugs, et cetera, where joinder is very common

22

and reversal is very rare.

23

            MR. LIU:  Because the evidence here is

24

special in the sense that it fell beyond any existing

25

sentencing factor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Are you proposing just

2

separate sentencing hearings, or are you proposing

3

separate juries for each of the brothers?

4

            MR. LIU:  Well, the Kansas Supreme Court in

5

this case ordered as its remedy a new trial with two

6

juries, but I don't think that is necessarily going to

7

be the required remedy in every case.  There are

8

different ways, Justice Ginsburg, to solve the problems

9

of sentencing.

10

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Let's take this case.  If

11

you had only one jury and Jonathan goes first, that

12

jury, when it gets to Reginald's case, is not going to

13

forget everything it heard in Jonathan's case.

14

            MR. LIU:  You're absolutely right, Justice

15

Ginsburg.  I don't think a sequential solution with

16

Jonathan going first is going to work in this case

17

precisely because the jury won't  you won't be able to

18

unring the bell of the  precisely the evidence we

19

think is prejudicial in this case.  But that's not to

20

say that a sequential solution isn't going to work in

21

the mine run of cases.

22

            This case is special just because there 

23

there is some allegation that the prejudice ran both

24

ways.

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the minute  but the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

minute you defend the idea of two different juries, then

2

you sacrifice the desirability and the possibility of

3

consistency.

4

            MR. LIU:  Well, Justice Kennedy, there are

5

many ways that States have developed to resolve the

6

problem of inconsistent verdicts among different juries.

7

One way is what the Georgia State has done, which is had

8

proportionality review.  They ask the appellate courts

9

to look across many sentences to see if they are

10

inconsistent.

11

            Another way the Federal government has a

12

solution to this, is that let one jury know how the

13

other jury sentenced the other defendant.  That's

14

18 U.S.C. 3592(a)(4).  And so there are ways to solve

15

the problem of inconsistent verdicts across juries.  But

16

what's 

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  That sounds  that

18

sounds pretty prejudicial to me.  If the second case,

19

you say, oh, the jury considered this and individual

20

circumstances, you know, these people act together, and

21

by the way, a jury of your peers unanimously found

22

beyond a reasonable doubt that this guy should be

23

sentenced to death; now do whatever you want with this

24

guy.  That sounds pretty prejudicial to me.

25

            MR. LIU:  Well, it's  it's  if you think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

that is prejudicial, Mr. Chief Justice, then this

2

proceeding was quite prejudicial too because the jury

3

was asked to make that same exact comparison.

4

            But the specific prejudice we are alleging

5

here is  is unique to these or at least quite  quite

6

restricted to the circumstances of this case.

7

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Liu, could you, for me,

8

just tell me what is the specific prejudice you're

9

alleging here?  In other words, tell me more than just,

10

oh, he was a corrupting influence.  What evidence

11

particularly came in 

12

            MR. LIU:  Sure.

13

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   and why do you think it

14

might have mattered to the jury?  Just give me your,

15

like, best shot.

16

            MR. LIU:  Sure.  Well, Kansas said there was

17

no expert testimony on this, but that's wrong.

18

Dr. Cunningham, at Joint Appendix pages 324 to 329,

19

explained how Jonathan looked up to Reggie, and every

20

time they would get together they would do drugs heavily

21

together, that when  that when they were ages 6 or 7,

22

Reginald prompted someone to have sex with Jonathan.

23

These are precisely the sort of evidence that shows that

24

however bad you think Jonathan is, Reginald is worse

25

because Reginald is the one who created the person

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

Jonathan is.

2

            It's in a sense making Reginald doubly

3

culpable for these offenses; that, well, whatever you

4

think Jonathan did  and yes, as Justice Scalia read,

5

there were some horrific things done  well, Reginald

6

should be punished for not only everything Reginald did,

7

but also everything Jonathan did.

8

            So this is precisely the sort of evidence

9

that basically transfers all of Jonathan's actions to

10

Reginald.  And that's why it's so prejudicial when you

11

get in the jury room, it's because it  it skews the

12

weighing process.

13

            And a skewing of the weighing process is an

14

error this Court has recognized for 30 years.  This

15

isn't something that we  we came up special for this

16

case.  This Court has recognized time and again that

17

when a jury is told to consider an improper element in

18

the weighing process, the weighing process is therefore

19

skewed.  And the only thing that can cure that error is

20

either harmless error review or 

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it 

22

            MR. LIU:   reweighing by the State court.

23

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But it has to have been

24

harmless inasmuch as the person who was influenced by

25

your client also got the death penalty.  How can you say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

that what made the difference was the fact that your

2

client was a corrupting influence upon his younger

3

brother?

4

            MR. LIU:  Well, Justice Scalia, the State

5

never established the identity of the shooter, and that

6

is the key horrific act in this case.  If the jury

7

believed Jonathan was the shooter, then the jury might

8

have given him the death penalty anyway regardless of

9

what Reginald did to him.

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I doubt whether that is the

11

key.  You really think that that's the only thing the

12

jury is going to be focused on, is who pulled the

13

trigger?  My Lord.

14

            MR. LIU:  I don't think it's the only  I

15

don't think it's the only thing, but it's certainly the

16

main thing given that we are here on a capital murder

17

charge.

18

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Do you think that on a

19

retrial they cannot use the sister to prove that

20

Reginald claimed he was the shooter?

21

            MR. LIU:  No.  And I think that just

22

highlights exactly how narrow our rule is.  That the

23

evidence that Temica said that Reginald told her that

24

Reginald was the shooter goes to the circumstances of

25

the crime.  And that sort of finger pointing, who shot

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

who on the day of the crime, is going to fall

2

comfortably within an existing sentencing factor, and as

3

a result, is not going to skew the weighing process.

4

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So the only issue you

5

think was prejudicial was that he was a corruptor?

6

            MR. LIU:  Absolutely.

7

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The evidence.

8

            MR. LIU:  And for reasons I  I gave to

9

Justice Kagan, that evidence was extremely prejudicial.

10

It skewed the weighing process because it transferred

11

Jonathan's culpability back onto Reginald's shoulders.

12

            If I may, I'd just like to address a few

13

points raised by my friend from Kansas.  He said the

14

instructions solve the problem.  Well, none of the

15

instructions told the jury to consider this evidence

16

about the corrupting influence only as to Jonathan.

17

            Now, on the contrary, the instructions 

18

Instruction No. 2 told the jury consider the evidence

19

applicable to each defendant.  Well, this evidence was

20

equally applicable to Reginald as it was to Jonathan.

21

After all, it was Reginald  Reginald's actions that

22

were at issue.

23

            My friends also point to the instruction on

24

statutory aggravators.  But that disregards an entire

25

swath of evidence that the jury heard that it could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

consider against Reginald.  This was evidence,

2

antimitigation evidence that the jury considered, could

3

have caused them to remove weight from the mitigation

4

side of the scale.  And the instructions left the jury

5

completely free to consider this evidence in

6

antimitigation.

7

            My friends also suggest that I'm here only

8

arguing an error of State law.  Well, no less than the

9

Petitioners were in Zant, Stringer, and  and Sanders.

10

Each of those cases recognizes that a skewing of the

11

weighing process has to be based on State law premises.

12

That's why this Court in Zant went so far as to certify

13

a question to the Georgia Supreme Court.

14

            Yes, it's true that to understand the effect

15

on the weighing process, you have to look at the State

16

law.  But the mere admission of evidence isn't what

17

causes the violation here.  It's the admission of the

18

evidence, followed by the fact the jury was required to

19

consider it.  And it was required to consider it because

20

it was part and parcel of Jonathan's mitigating

21

evidence.

22

            And this Court has said time and again that

23

a defendant has a constitutional right for the jury, not

24

only to consider but to listen to a defendant's

25

mitigating evidence.  So by considering this evidence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

for Jonathan, the jury necessarily considered it against

2

Reginald.  After all, if you're told that Reginald had a

3

corrupting influence on Jonathan, you can't separate

4

that as something for Jonathan and something for

5

Reginald.  It's equally applicable to both.

6

            My friend also suggested that we  we

7

rejected a twojury solution before trial.  Well, we

8

rejected that, not because of it wouldn't work to solve

9

any prejudice in the penalty phase, but because it

10

wouldn't work to solve any prejudice in the guilt phase.

11

            And remember, the Kansas Supreme Court found

12

that it was actually error to keep the guilt phase

13

joined, so we were perfectly appropriate in objecting to

14

a twojury solution at that phase of the trial.

15

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you explain that

16

again?  I thought you  you sought only a severance at

17

the sentencing phase.

18

            MR. LIU:  No.  That's not  that's not 

19

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You sought severance

20

totally?

21

            MR. LIU:  Exactly.  Prior to trial, on pages

22

25 and 26 of the Joint Appendix, we moved for severance

23

of the entire thing.

24

            And if you look at those pages, you'll see

25

Jonathan's attorney, Jonathan's own attorney, saying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

that if the penalty phase is joined, he is going to have

2

to present evidence that, quote, "there's no way the

3

State would be able to introduce if Reginald was sitting

4

here alone."

5

            Well, his attorney was exactly right.

6

That's exactly what happened many months later.

7

            I see that my time is up.

8

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

            Mr. Green.

10

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

11

       ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN NO. 14449

12

            MR. GREEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13

please the Court:

14

            I'd like to first try and change the

15

narrative here with some illustrations about the

16

difference between the mitigation cases of both

17

defendants.  That's easily seen in the testimony of the

18

experts.

19

            Reginald Carr presented evidence from a

20

neuroscientist by the name of Dr. Woltersdorf that said

21

his client had been diagnosed a  an incurable

22

sociopath.

23

            Jonathan Carr's forensic psychologist,

24

clinical and forensic psychologist, got up and testified

25

that  that Jonathan was sensitive, he was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

affectionate, he had attempted suicide, and what he

2

really was, contrary to what Mr. McAllister represented

3

to you, was  was depressed and schizophrenic.

4

            That is  that is a unique illustration of

5

exactly how different these two defendants were in their

6

presentation, and why, again, a sequential penalty

7

phase, even if they had been separate, wouldn't work.

8

            Reginald says he didn't want to hear or he

9

thought it would be prejudicial if the jury heard

10

evidence from the  from the  from Jonathan's

11

witnesses about Reginald being a  a corrupting

12

influence.  On the other side, Jonathan doesn't want the

13

jury to hear from Reginald's expert.

14

            And to answer your question, Justice Kagan,

15

that's the evidence that would not have been introduced.

16

            Justice Woltersdorf's  or excuse me 

17

Dr. Woltersdorf's testimony about incurable sociopathy

18

would not have been relevant or admissible 

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe I'm missing something,

20

but if  if your client's strategy was to make Reginald

21

as bad  the bad actor in the case, why didn't that

22

evidence actually go hand in hand with your client's

23

strategy, which was to say it's all on Reginald?

24

            MR. GREEN:  One  one would think that it

25

would in  in a typical case, and it may be that some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

jurors had inferred that way.

2

            The problem was that  that the fact that

3

the two brothers were sitting together allowed the

4

prosecutors to repeatedly paint them with the same

5

brush.

6

            And  and if we take a look, for example,

7

at JA 402, the prosecutor says to the jury in her

8

opening argument at the beginning of the penalty  or

9

at the conclusion of the penalty phase, ladies and

10

gentlemen, they have the same eye color.  They are now

11

wearing glasses, although their mother said Reginald

12

doesn't need them, they share some DNA.

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So this  maybe you can,

14

in your experience, cure what's bothering me about the

15

case.  It's nothing to do with the facts, or for this 

16

this concern.  It has to do with  with Zafiro.

17

            MR. GREEN:  Right.

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And that's the ordinary

19

case of joint trials, right?

20

            And what the Court says is you can have the

21

joinder as long as there isn't a serious risk that the

22

joint trial would compromise  it doesn't say harmless

23

error, it says compromise  a specific trial right, or

24

prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment.  That

25

doesn't talk about harmless error.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

            Now, that's the standard that's used in

2

dozens and dozens and dozens of cases.

3

            Or if, in this case, we start talking about

4

harmless error, and that you can't have the joint

5

proceeding if there is error that is not harmless.

6

Well, what have we done to that sentence?  And what have

7

we done to the trials that are joint in hundreds of

8

cases that don't involve murder or death?

9

            That is the legal problem that is worrying

10

me.  And you will either cure that worry or say I've

11

made some elementary mistake.  It has nothing to do with

12

your case.  Say what you want, but I want to hear what

13

you think about it.

14

            MR. GREEN:  I don't  I don't think you've

15

made any mistake at all, Justice Breyer.  Indeed, I

16

think that  that the State of Kansas and the Solicitor

17

General are offering nothing more than  than the

18

Zafiro test and using slightly different language.

19

            On page 15 of our 

20

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So we should not use the

21

words "harmless error."  We should quote from Zafiro and

22

say could they make a reliable judgment?  Now, that

23

sounds harder on you, because if all you have to show is

24

the error was harmful, it sounds like an easier task you

25

have than to show that the juror  jury wasn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

reliable.  Or are they the same thing in your opinion?

2

            MR. GREEN:  Well, let me  I think they're

3

the same thing and I think that's a generalization, but

4

we've  we've offered a test that actually specifies it

5

a little bit more, Justice Breyer.

6

            In terms of saying that  that the test

7

should be whether there is a reasonable risk  and I

8

will explain the difference between reasonable and

9

serious in a minute  but whether there was a

10

reasonable risk that there would be evidence introduced,

11

material, prejudicial evidence introduced that would 

12

that would, in fact, not have been introduced in a

13

severed penaltyphase proceeding.

14

            And to go back to Justice Kagan's question

15

about the intuitive difference between these two things,

16

they're between  excuse me  trials and  and

17

penaltyphase proceedings, the answer is that's because

18

in a  in a trial, the  the relative culpability of

19

the defendants makes a big difference with respect to

20

who's a conspirator, who's not a conspirator, who's a

21

principal, who's an aider and abettor.

22

            But when we turn to the penalty phase, the

23

inquiry changes, as Mr. Liu indicated  it changes from

24

exactly what happened to who this person is and whether

25

or not the jury wants to put this person to death.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Who  who  if you

2

have separate proceedings, who  who gets to go second?

3

Because obviously that person will have a significant

4

advantage since they'll see all of the evidence

5

presented in the  in the other proceeding.

6

            MR. GREEN:  Well, in 

7

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And most of the

8

evidence here was overlapping, so that at least you'll

9

have  you'll be able to see what the State thought

10

about that evidence.  You have sort of a dry run if

11

you're the second person.

12

            MR. GREEN:  Well, in this case,

13

respectfully, no, Mr. Chief Justice, because what the 

14

what the State basically said was we're relying on our

15

evidence from the  from the trial phase  or from the

16

guilt phase of this capital trial.

17

            That's exactly what the prosecutor told the

18

jurors when they turned in to the penalty phase, and all

19

that the prosecution did in the penalty phase was

20

crossexamine the defense witnesses.

21

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, but that

22

crossexamination is important.

23

            Were there any common defense witnesses?

24

            MR. GREEN:  There were family members.

25

So  so it is true 

Alderson Reporting Company

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So at least it would

2

be  it would be helpful for the second  the person

3

who goes second to know, well, what did the prosecutor

4

talk  how did the prosecutor attempt to crossexamine

5

that witness, because I am going to call the same

6

witness, and her testimony is going to be a lot better

7

the second time around because you will know exactly

8

what the crossexamination questions are going to be.

9

            MR. GREEN:  That might happen.  I  it 

10

it could well be that that would be  I would consider

11

that a  a minor advantage, Your Honor.  But that could

12

be handled by the judge in  with protective orders,

13

with orders about  rules against witnesses and  and

14

folks in the courtroom who will have another proceeding.

15

            But I would submit  and then with respect

16

to witnesses who might have been traumatized by these

17

events, that  the  you know, a trial court could

18

easily have a simultaneous penalty proceedings so that

19

that witness would only have to testify once.  The

20

defense team on one side wouldn't get an advantage over

21

the other.  There would be two juries in two different

22

courtrooms, same week, same days, the  the witness can

23

go back and forth between courtrooms, and there is none

24

of the advantage 

25

            JUSTICE ALITO:  You would have  the State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

would have to put on, basically, its guilt phase case

2

again at the penalty phase, right?

3

            MR. GREEN:  Yes, it would have to do that,

4

but I would imagine that  that with respect to cases

5

like this, the defense attorneys are going to move right

6

into what counts as stipulations; we will read

7

testimony 

8

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I am sure you'd like

9

to stipulate to all the facts that were proven at the

10

guilt phase, but I doubt that the State is going to want

11

to stipulate to those.

12

            MR. GREEN:  And the State might do that.

13

            And again, I think a trial judge could

14

easily handle that by expediting matters.  And this is

15

what happens in a lot of the Federal trials.  I would

16

refer the Court to the  to the brief of the Promise of

17

Justice Initiative which shows that when we have joint

18

trials, we get joint results.  When we have severed

19

trials, we get severed results.  25 for 25, joint

20

trials, same result for the defendants.

21

            Woodson says we must have individualized

22

sentencing at the penalty phase, so I do not see why the

23

Zafiro test would not  would  would work for penalty

24

phase proceedings without some sort of change.  There

25

has to be some recognition that  that penalty phase

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

proceedings are different than  than all the other

2

armed robbery, drug cases.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So how is that different

4

from what the government said?

5

            MR. GREEN:  I  so I think we ought to

6

lower the risk standard.  We ought to lower the risk

7

standard to a reasonable risk standard, not  and

8

that's what we propose in our brief at page 15.  We

9

should lower the standard because that would recognize

10

the acute need for reliability and accuracy when it

11

comes to penalty phase proceedings and the decision

12

whether somebody is going to live or die.

13

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You said you were going

14

to make a distinction between serious and reasonable

15

earlier.

16

            MR. GREEN:  Right.  So a serious risk may be

17

treated as a  as a preponderance or a   or above.

18

With respect to reasonable, we're at a  we're at a 

19

a  maybe a likelihood.  Maybe that's  maybe that's

20

perceived as 30 percent versus 55 percent or 60 percent,

21

something like that.

22

            And indeed, this Court said in Boyde, with

23

respect to reasonable likelihood, that is not a

24

preponderance standard.

25

            If the Court has no further questions, we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54

would urge 

2

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

3

            Mr. McAllister, five minutes.

4

       REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

5

                ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

            MR. McALLISTER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

7

it please the Court:

8

            I will try to be brief.  The only Eighth

9

Amendment implication that this Court has recognized

10

that really applies to this case is I go back to the

11

Romano case where the Court said the admission of

12

evidence that might or might not be in violation of

13

State law is not an Eighth Amendment concern.  The only

14

time the Eighth  Eighth Amendment comes into play is

15

when the evidence is  involves constitutionally

16

protected conduct.

17

            An example would be Dawson v. Delaware,

18

where they sought a capital sentence.  He was a member

19

of the Aryan Brotherhood in prison.  It had nothing to

20

do with an aggregating factor.  That was First

21

Amendmentprotected activity.  The Court said that kind

22

of thing could be an Eighth Amendment problem if you use

23

it against the defendant.

24

            Their cases  I could be wrong, but I think

25

all of their cases, Zant, Stringer, the others that they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

refer to skewing the weighing process, are not about

2

admission of evidence, they are about invalid

3

aggravating factors.  So you've basically told the jury

4

there is something else, literally, on the scale, an

5

aggravating factor that later the State says, no, that

6

was  that was not correct, that should not have been

7

there.  That's distinguishable from this case.

8

            I  I agree completely with

9

Justice Scalia's point, and the dissenting justice made

10

it in the Kansas Supreme Court:  If the evidence  the

11

corrupting influence evidence was so prejudicial to

12

Reginald, why did Jonathan also get a death sentence?

13

            And I would close by saying that we all

14

agree, I think, that the Constitution values accuracy

15

and fairness.  But it also values finality.  And each of

16

these individuals received an individualized sentence,

17

presented all the evidence they wanted to.  The jury was

18

instructed to consider them individually.  And if we

19

were to undo this now, it would be very difficult for

20

Kansas to go back.  We'd be talking about having to redo

21

all of the guilt phase evidence.  And, again, you get

22

into questions, separate proceedings, traumatizing

23

victims yet again.  None of that is necessary, because

24

at the end of the day they got a fundamentally fair

25

proceeding that gave each of them the sentence they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

deserved and the jury found warranted, both under the

2

facts of this case and the law of Kansas.

3

            We would ask that you reverse the Kansas

4

Supreme Court on this point.

5

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. McAllister, I am

6

sorry, but even if we do this and say that the

7

sentencings didn't need to be severed, didn't the Kansas

8

court hold on another ground that they were entitled to

9

a new trial?

10

            MR. McALLISTER:  Yes.  So that's the third

11

question presented in the Petition, which my

12

understanding is that is something the Court could

13

reconsider.  It's not denied.  The Court granted

14

Questions 1 and 3.

15

            The other question that we presented was the

16

only other ground that the Kansas Supreme Court gave for

17

reversal, that's a Confrontation Clause violation in

18

terms of some of the hearsay evidence presented in the

19

sentencing proceedings.

20

            So if the Court were to reverse on these,

21

deny on that question, then the Kansas Supreme Court

22

could, in fact, rely on that ground.  But our hope would

23

be that the Court would do something different than that

24

if you reverse on these two questions.

25
