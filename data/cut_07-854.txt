CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next this morning in Case 07-854, Van De Kamp v.

5

Goldstein.

6

Mr. Coates.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. COATES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case arises from a Ninth Circuit

12

opinion that essentially creates an exception to

13

absolute prosecutorial immunity for chief advocates and

14

supervising advocates.

15

Ninth Circuit essentially held that prosecutorial

16

policies that apply to an entire body of cases in a

17

trial office do not qualify for absolute immunity.

18

The court's decision in the

We submit that this is inconsistent with

19

this Court's decision in Imbler v. Pachtman and its

20

progeny, applying the functional approach to absolute

21

immunity.

22

chief advocate or supervising prosecutor implementing a

23

policy directing that cases be handled in a particular

24

manner and that particular chief advocate or supervising

25

advocate actually participating in the courtroom.

There is essentially no distinction between a

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Because of the size of the prosecutorial

2

agencies, it's not feasible that a chief advocate or

3

supervisor can be in a courtroom in every single case.

4

But they can put their prosecutorial stamp on each case

5

through the implementation of policy, through training,

6

or through other means.

7

Here the policy at issue concerns compliance

8

with the obligation to disclose exculpatory information

9

under Brady v. Maryland and also Giglio v. United

10
11

States.
In Imbler versus Pachtman, the Court

12

recognized that those obligations are core prosecutorial

13

obligations that are part of the prosecution's intimate

14

relationship to the fairness of the trial proceedings.

15

And we submit that that duty, that function, is the same

16

whether it's performed in the courtroom or whether it's

17

performed by a chief advocate or supervising advocate in

18

terms of formulating policy or when making particular

19

policy decisions.

20

Imbler recognized that these core decisions

21

had to be insulated.

Otherwise, it would spawn

22

litigation that would burden the judicial process.

23

it might cause them to hesitate to produce particular

24

exculpatory information.

25

having them involved in more lawsuits than actually

And

It might create a burden of

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

performing their function and prosecuting the criminal

2

law.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was -- was there an

4

element in Imbler of the fact that you have to

5

make tactical and strategic decisions at -- at the

6

moment that are difficult, that call for judgment that

7

has to be exercised on the spur of the moment?

8
9

This is somewhat different.

This is -- this

is a long-term commitment or a long-term policy that the

10

Respondents are arguing for.

11

different than the dynamics that inform the Imbler

12

decision.

13

MR. COATES:

It seems to me somewhat

Well, the court in Imbler did

14

mention a time frame in which decisions have to be made

15

-- quickly made by individual prosecutors.

16

noted the sheer number of decisions that are often made

17

in the context of a criminal prosecution.

18

It also

I would say, with respect to chief advocates

19

and -- and supervisors, the number of those types of

20

decisions is the same.

21

determining what is going to come up in every single

22

case as an individual prosecutor does in a -- in a

23

single case.

24
25

They have the same complexity in

Moreover, there is a multitude more that
they have to consider because they are considering the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possibility of its impact on thousands of cases within

2

the office.

3

where the Court extended absolute immunity to

4

individuals prosecuting agency actions, that same point

5

was raised.

6

more drawn-out in terms of the investigative manner -

7

not the investigative manner, but the -- the

8

prosecutorial process used by the administrative agency.

9

And the court didn't find that -- that longer time frame

10

I will note, though, in Butz v. Economou,

But some of the conduct there was a bit

to be dispositive.

11

Going back to Imbler, it again looked at

12

what the basic function was in the administrative agency

13

proceeding and found, yes, it is akin to prosecutorial

14

conduct.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you kind of

16

perhaps a farfetched hypothetical question just so I get

17

the case law in mind?

18

develop a policy which would keep -- which would create

19

a bifurcated regime within the office where the people

20

who interrogate prisoners are entirely separate from the

21

people who prosecute trials, so that they don't have the

22

malicious purpose that your adversary says is involved

23

in this case.

24

some expert layman who had no trial experience at all to

25

develop such a program, and the program, itself, is

Supposing a prosecutor wanted to

And supposing the prosecutor then hired

2

but presumably unconstitutional.

developed that program be entitled to immunity -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. COATES:

9

Would the person who

The -- in my example?

The lay person Yes.

The layperson, as a private

actor, I think would not be.

I think the prosecutor

10

that developed the policy would be.

11

delegating it to a staff member.

12

on how close the relationship is.

13

in some of the judicial immunity cases that sometimes

14

court clerks can perform functions that are essentially

15

judicial functions.

16

It would be like

It might depend also
The Court has noted

In that case, though, under the Court's

17

jurisprudence with private actors, they might have only

18

qualified immunity, the private actors.

19

decision to use them would be prosecutorial.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the

Well, why -- why is it

21

qualified immunity if a separate person does it, but not

22

qualified immunity if precisely the same task is

23

performed by somebody who happens also to be a

24

prosecutor?

25

MR. COATES:

Because it's not so much the
7

physical task of doing it.

2

obligation of performing that particular function.

3

function is compliance with Giglio and Brady.

4

5

6

agency, the buck stops with the prosecutor.

7

It's carrying out the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The

That is

Whether the data is

And in my hypothetical is

8

it or is it not a prosecutorial -- does the layperson

9

perform or not perform a prosecutorial function?

10

MR. COATES:

If he is just collating data,

11

then that is -- that's -- that's a task.

That is

You can't divorce the -

No, but I'm trying to

18

divorce the information in the particular case from

19

developing the program.

20

MR. COATES:

Well, I --perhaps I

21

misunderstood the question.

It sounds to me that the

22

prosecutor has made a decision that he is going to put

23

this thing in place, this process in place.

24

their way that they satisfy or don't satisfy Giglio or

25

Brady.

Even if it's made by a

But the -- I think the buck stops with the prosecutor as

8

to whether that's a valid process or not.

9

person may adequately perform their function, or they

I mean, the

10

may not.

11

responsible for it ends up being the prosecutor.

12

But the person at the end of the day who is

And he may inevitably -- the person may

13

inevitably perform something, but at the end of the day

14

the prosecutor is the one that -- that has the task

15

under Giglio and Brady of ensuring the accuracy of the

16

information.

17

I think that kind of underscores here the

18

approach the Respondent has taken is to kind of say,

19

well, this is just a collection of data here, this is

20

just bookkeeping.

21

constitutional claim here is that there is an obligation

22

under Brady and Giglio somehow to collect this

23

information, to disseminate this information.

But it's not.

The core of the

24

And that's the obligation that we are being

25

sued for, and that's the sort of thing that prosecutors

do.

is the gatekeeper.

3

goes in or what doesn't go in and whether it's

4

sufficient or insufficient at the end of the day to

5

comply with -- with Brady and Giglio.

6

be distinguished from the -- the prosecutorial role,

7

whether it's conducted by a -- a chief advocate or by a

8

supervising advocate.

9

And you can you hire someone to do it, but somebody
Someone has to basically decide what

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so that can't

Well, I -- I suppose that

10

is why the Petitioners seemed to change their theory.

11

They -- they -- they were -- they were concerned about

12

prosecutorial immunity, so they take it to the higher

13

level of policy.

14

When -- when they do that, I suppose they

15

might have the stronger argument if they could show

16

deliberate indifference.

17

on the "deliberate indifference"?

18

best case for them on deliberate indifference?

19

MR. COATES:

Are there cases that help them
What's -- what's the

I couldn't say what the best

20

case is for them.

21

for them on -- on "deliberate indifference."

22

not pushed on the merits part of this case.

23

briefed down below, and it is not -

24
25

I could not say what the best case is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We have
It was not

That is why the case is

hard, and I -- I almost have to see what the violation
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be before I could determine the qualified immunity

2

aspect of the case.

3

MR. COATES:

Well, indeed.

I mean, several

4

amici has raise the question of whether there is the

5

constitutional violation at all, but it has not been

6

raised below.

7

decision in Buckley we have to assume the existence of a

8

constitutional violation.

9

And of course, under this Court's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's what we are

10

deciding in sort of in a vacuum.

11

difficult.

12

MR. COATES:

It's a little

Precisely.

But I think our

13

point is that -- that if you buy their theory of a

14

constitutional claim, whatever constitutional claim that

15

is is a -- a prosecutorial function-related claim,

16

because that's the nature of the Giglio and Brady

17

obligation.

18

have any meaning outside the context of an actual

19

prosecution.

20

They are trial obligations.

They don't

And so, again we submit that there is really

21

no difference to the chief advocate or supervising

22

advocate formulating this particular policy for all the

23

cases in the office -- this is what we do -- then there

24

is the individual actions of a particular trial attorney

25

in a given case or even if it were possible for a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

supervising attorney or chief advocate to participate in

2

everything.

3

suppose, by every time a case is filed sending out an

4

e-mail saying:

5

They could accomplish the same thing, I

Comply with our policies.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The Monell case -- does

6

the Monell case rest on the assumption that there can be

7

instances where a policy makes the policy of those who

8

adopted the policy liable?

9

MR. COATES:

I think that's right.

Reading

10

the Monell allegations of the complaint against the

11

County of Los Angeles, I think that that is what it is,

12

that the deputy -- that the district attorney rather,

13

acts as a county officer and would be the policymaker

14

for those policies and customs and practices.

15

That obviously is not at issue here.

16

Petitioners are being sued as individuals for their acts

17

as supervisors and as the chief advocate in formulating

18

a particular policy concerning compliance with Brady and

19

Giglio.

20

These sort of cases, opening this door

21

particularly for the broad claim that plaintiffs are now

22

trying to assert, which is this kind of notion of

23

information management, can spawn all sorts of claims.

24

Virtually any time that you can't reach the individual

25

trial attorney, all you need do is attribute whatever
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you think that person did to the failure to develop a

2

policy or provide training or to have adequate data

3

management to allow them to do the job.

4

This kind of end-run under Imbler will

5

create the multitude of litigation and drag chief

6

advocates in, as well as supervising advocates, that

7

Imbler was designed to avoid.

8

collateral effect that it's also going to end up pulling

9

in the individual attorneys, the individual trial

And it has the worse

10

attorneys in a given case, because maybe they don't have

11

individual liability, but they are certainly going to

12

come in; they are going to testify as witnesses.

13

So, it's the worst of both worlds, which is

14

you are burdening the chief advocate with this sort of

15

litigation which may impact the way they formulate

16

policy, and you are burdening the individual line deputy

17

attorney, and that's the attorney that Imbler sought to

18

protect as well.

19

Those adverse consequences on the judicial

20

process are what led this Court in Imbler to recognize

21

the importance of absolute immunity for prosecutors.

22

submit that it's even more important that that immunity

23

be logically applied to chief advocates and to

24

supervisors.

25

eviscerated and we will have the very evils that Imbler

We

Otherwise, I think Imbler will be

13

was designed to avoid.

If the Court has no further questions, I

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This Court recognized absolute prosecutorial

15

immunity for line prosecutors who are charged with

16

violating an obligation that falls uniquely on

17

prosecutors, namely the obligation to disclose

18

exculpatory evidence.

19

seeking to circumvent that absolute prosecutorial

20

immunity by reformulating the claim as one against

21

supervisors who allegedly failed to fulfill duties under

24

under Giglio and Brady.

The Respondents in this case are

words, the further it is removed from the constitutional

violation or an allegation of a constitutional

22

violation, the less need there is for immunity.

23

closer it is or the closer we must assume it is to a

constitutional violation, then the immunity argument is

25

stronger.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

I think you have the
In other

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, it certainly is true

2

that if there were a constitutional obligation under

3

Giglio and Brady, it would be one that is intimately

4

tied to the judicial process, and it should receive

5

absolute prosecutorial immunity.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In the broad ethical

7

scheme of things, apart from liability under this

8

statute, it seems to me that a newly elected district

9

attorney would take seriously the obligation to make

10

sure that everybody was following Brady.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Absolutely, Justice Kennedy,

12

and I think that a formulation of policies to achieve

13

that, whether or not required by the Constitution, is

14

something that relates directly and intimately to the

15

prosecutor's duties to assure -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's the next

17

point.

18

constitutional duty to say it, in the broad sense of -

19

of my ethical obligations of my duties to the public.

20

If I were a prosecutor, I would say:

MR. DREEBEN:

This is my

Only in the sense, I think,

21

that -- that a supervisor who has the power to cause or

22

prevent constitutional violations may be under some

23

obligation not to cause constitutional violations.

24

the claim here is -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

Well, I think it's more

than that.

He can't be indifferent to sloppy practices

in the office -

MR. DREEBEN:

6

MR. DREEBEN:

You certainly should not.
-- consistent with his or

But I think that the

7

deliberated indifference question that you raise,

8

Justice Kennedy, is really a direct counterpart of the

9

absolute immunity argument that we are making here.

We

10

are making here the argument that supervisory

11

prosecutors should not be subject to suit based on broad

12

policies that they have adopted that will directly have

13

impact on individual cases in the way that Brady and

14

Giglio obligations are fulfilled.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

do with my hypothetical?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Dreeben, what do you

Do you remember it?
I remember it,

18

Justice Stevens, and I think that the -- I agree with

19

Mr. Coates on this one.

formulates the policy is the only one who has the unique

The supervisory prosecutor who

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that will keep separate from prosecutors information

2

about the way witnesses are developed.

3

think is highly unprobable, I agree with you, but the

4

policy is designed to avoid the obligation imposed by

5

Giglio and Brady.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

And the policy I

That's the allegation, of

7

course.

And the first thing that I want to say is that

8

if you allow suits based on allegations that you think

9

are really bad, you open the door to allegations that

10

will have to be sorted out throughout the judicial

11

system.

12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But that's true even

without -- without an immunity.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

But I think that the point is

15

that the immunity prevents the prosecutors from having

16

to fear that they will be subject to those kind of

17

suits.

18

But to answer your question directly, the

19

layperson, if he causes a constitutional violation,

20

isn't shielded by the constitutional -- excuse me -- by

21

the prosecutorial immunity that attaches only to

22

prosecutors.

23

roots in Imbler, what you see is that prosecutorial

24

immunity is really -

25

And that's because if you go back to the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, the next

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question is, if that's true, and if there is -- you can

2

compartmentalize the prosecutor's work in the office and

3

he develops a separate chapter of his own duty to just

4

do that performance, why is that trial-related?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

I think the flaw in

6

Respondent's theory is the attempt to bifurcate what the

7

prosecutor is doing into an administrative function and

8

a prosecutorial function.

9

maneuver in your hypothetical, to say that the

And that's the same, I think,

10

prosecutor is really doing something administrative and

11

Imbler said administrative things are non-prosecutorial;

12

therefore, we can sue him.

13

I think the problem with that is illustrated

14

by a hypothetical about judicial immunity.

Suppose -

15

judges of course have immunity from sitting on cases,

16

and if a judge sat on a case that involved a conflict of

17

interest he could not be sued or she could not be sued

18

for having done so, even if it violated the

19

Constitution.

That was purely

2

3

judge for that.

4

It would end-run all of the policy reasons for being

5

able to assert absolute judicial immunity; and I think

6

that that is identical in form to what the Respondents

7

are trying to do here.

8

9

The

And I think that obviously should fail.

They are trying to divorce the

10

to disclose under Giglio from the obligation under

11

Giglio to ensure the fairness of the judicial process,

12

which is an obligation that falls uniquely on the

13

prosecutor and which Imbler makes clear is subject to

14

absolute immunity.

15

And you just can't do that.

If you do that,

16

you end up exposing the supervisory prosecutors to evils

17

that cannot occur to the line prosecutor himself.

18

it produces anomalies.

19

intentionally violates Giglio, cannot be sued, but under

20

Respondent's theory the supervisory prosecutor, even if

21

what he did is no more than deliberately indifferent or

22

perhaps even negligent, could be sued.

23

And

The line prosecutor, even if he

The line prosecutor who handles a certain

24

number of cases cannot be sued, in part because it would

25

ensure a distraction of the duties of the prosecutor and

would divert him from performing his role of enforcing

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

This case is not about whether a chief D.A.

11

can set policies about trial strategy.

12

stipulate that this chief D.A. would be immune from

13

those sorts of suits and it would not affect our case at

14

all.

15

We could

This case is about the function of deciding

16

on an officewide basis whether to track important

17

historical facts and disseminate them internally within

18

an office to employees who need to know those facts.

19

This case is about gathering and preserving information,

20

certain categories of raw data, that may or may not ever

21

get into the courtroom, not about how to use those

22

specific pieces of data once you actually have a

23

prosecution materializing.

24
25

This claim is no different from a claim
against a chief of police, for example, for
22

systematically destroying 911 tapes, thereby depriving

2

defendants of exculpatory information.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

is creating a database.

7

This is creating -- this

And what was the year of this

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The prosecution, Your

8

Honor, was in 1979, it began.

9

prosecution was in '80.

10

Why isn't -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was the crime; the

And back in 1979 we did

11

not have the information-gathering electronic capability

12

that we now have.

So what are we talking about?

13

kind of database?

How would it operate?

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

What

Would you -

Well, Your Honor, so that's

15

getting to the merits of the actual claim.

16

as simple as a file cabinet or 3 by 5 cards on which you

17

list the name of the informant and his prior record of

18

collaboration.

19

It could be

In the U.S. Attorney's offices that do this,

20

completely apart from this enormous FBI database, they

21

do it very simply, the ones that I know about.

22

appoint a Giglio czar in each bureau and they say that

23

when there is contact with the prosecutor's office and

24

an informant, you make sure you tell this person, "send

25

an e-mail," and he keeps it all in a file.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that goes

2

to the merits, doesn't it?

3

develop and make the same point, saying U.S. attorneys

4

are instructed in complying with Giglio and Brady in

5

this way.

6

immunity is only necessary when you assume some -- there

7

has been some violation.

8

else avoids a violation, it seems to me, is not a good

9

argument to deprive other people of immunity.

10

I mean, if -- I -- you could

But if there is a decision not to -- I mean,

And so the fact that somebody

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, this

11

Court has said as clearly as it can possibly say that

12

the location of the injury is irrelevant.

13

now from Buckley.

14

the challenged certification probably the morning before

15

the morning she walked into court, and it was held to be

16

not immune because that was not the function of a

17

prosecutor.

I am quoting

In Kalina, the prosecutor executed

She - with the charging document.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You drew a

19

distinction earlier on between a determination by a

20

prosecutor not to turn over certain material, which is

21

absolutely immune, and said this was different.

22

what if the purpose of the policy is to not provide

23

prosecutors with material so they can't turn it over?

24

Why doesn't that go into the same prosecutorial core

25

function?
24
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, the

2

answer is quite simple.

3

this case, in fact.

4

deliberate indifference, so the allegation is, the

5

intention was to cut the flow of information to the line

6

prosecutor.

7

while Petitioners say compliance with Brady, our answer

8

is compliance with Brady comprises at least two

9

functions.

10

That is the alleged motive in

It was intentional or with

And the reason that's different is because

There is the front line function of the

11

prosecutor, the advocate, making the decision, "Do I

12

turn this information over to the defense?"

13

has nothing to do with that front line function.

14

case has to do with the back room function.

15

function of -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This case
This

The

Why isn't that the

17

same as the determination by the supervisor that, don't

18

turn this information over.

19

going to share informant information because we don't

20

think that should be turned over to comply with Giglio.

21

The individual prosecutor they have says I'm not going

22

to turn it over.

23

Here's all -- we are not

Why isn't it exactly the same?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, if the

24

decree comes from on high, "we don't turn over Giglio

25

information here," which has actually happened in some
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases, that would be a different case, because that is

2

the chief administrator directing trial tactics.

3

Here it's the chief administrator looking

4

entirely inward and saying, like any administrator in

5

any major agency or business does, how do we get

6

information from the people who know it to the people

7

who need it at the front line?

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is certainly -- you

know, that's an interesting theory, but it's certainly

10

not the theory on which the decision below was based.

11

The decision below says "Neither" -- speaking of Imbler

12

and prior cases -- "Neither the Supreme Court nor this

13

Court has considered whether claims regarding failure to

14

train, failure to supervise or failure to develop an

15

officewide policy regarding a Constitutional obligation

16

like the one set forth in Giglio are subject to absolute

17

immunity."

18
19

And I could quote portions of the opinion
they are.

20

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That's what -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are talking about

22

supervising prosecutors.

23

training prosecutors and having an officewide policy

24

regarding what you do with -- with Giglio information.

25

They are talking about

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the passage you

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

read from was the broad passage that the court was

2

referring to when it said this sets up a bunch of hard

3

questions.

4

said, because we were not dealing with the prosecutor,

5

the chief D.A. setting trial tactics for the line

6

prosecutors; we are dealing -- the court says this on

7

page 5 of the petition -- excuse me, the petition

8

appendix.

This case becomes an easy case, the court

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Page 5?

10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Page 5 of the petition

11

appendix at the top.

12

one theory is exactly the theory we are presenting here.

13

At the very top line, "They violated his constitutional

14

rights by purposely or with deliberate indifference

15

failing to create a system that would satisfy the Giglio

16

obligation."

17
18

It lays out the theories.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are not talking about

just collecting information.

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are talking about, as

21

they clarify later on, a -- a system in which they train

22

and supervise and develop an officewide policy regarding

23

the Giglio obligations.

24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, no, they -- the

court was very clear that it was talking about
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

supervising and training, about the internal function of

2

circulation of information within the D.A.'s office.

3

Not -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let's assume that's -

5

that's what they did mean.

6

broadly as Justice Scalia did, but let's -- let's narrow

7

down the -- the Court's opinion to -- to -- to the claim

8

that you are making right now.

9
10

I have to say I read it as

Let me go back to the Chief Justice's
hypothetical and add one minor detail.

11

Let's assume that in a given department they

12

put into effect exactly the policy that you want.

They

13

have a fine system of -- of data collection, far more

14

sophisticated than three by five cards, and the -- the

15

boss D.A. says everybody in this office ought to know

16

what kind of deals are being made and offered at all

17

times.

And they have such a system.

18

And the boss D.A. also says and don't you

19

disclose one word of it ever in any case.

20

to defy Giglio.

21

We are going

If he made that or gave that order so that

22

in every case there would be a defiance of Giglio, even

23

though the facts were known, would he have absolute

24

immunity?

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And he's directing that

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

order to trial lawyers?

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right.

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

answer is I don't know.

5

very strong one -

6

The

I could imagine a theory, a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you know if in a

7

given case, if they had this system, and the lawyer

8

comes to him and says, okay, I've consulted our system

9

and I realize we that have got a Giglio obligation.

10

the boss D.A. says:

11
12

Forget it.

And

Don't tell him a word.

There would be absolute immunity, wouldn't
there?

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

There absolutely would,

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And my point is -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why would the -- why would

14

Your Honor.

18

the answer be any different if he says don't bother me

19

with particular cases?

20

the answer is going to be in every case in which we have

21

a Giglio obligation and that is, bury it.

22
23

I am telling you right now what

Presumably there would be absolute immunity,
wouldn't there?

24

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

25

an argument on either side.

Your Honor, I can imagine
I can imagine the Plaintiff

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

making the argument -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What's your answer?

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I don't have an answer to

4

that hypothetical because it's so different from our

5

case.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The trouble is if you don't

7

have an answer to that hypothetical, then we got to

8

leave open the possibilities as far as your case is

9

concerned that he would have absolute immunity in that

10

case.

And if he would have absolute immunity in that

11

case, then the -- the -- the reason for allowing

12

anything less than absolute immunity with respect to

13

this data collection obligation reduces down to

14

something like an almost a silly point.

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

If -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you can get everything

17

you want, and all the prosecutor has got to say is:

18

Keep it under your hat and there is going to be absolute

19

immunity and nobody gets anything.

20

to be gained by that?

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

What is -- what is

Well, Your Honor, that may

22

well be a consequence of Imbler.

But when Imbler talks

23

about the function, Imbler is very clear that there is a

24

distinction between trial tactics and strategy on the

25

one hand in the cases under Imbler, and the sort of
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

backroom functions about the flow of information on the

2

other -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if the backroom

4

function is reduced to an absolute nullity by an

5

immunized decision to -- to bury the Giglio information

6

in every case, then I don't see the point of saying

7

there's no immunity for the supposed backroom function,

8

because nothing will be accomplished even if there is no

9

absolute immunity.

10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Sure, Your Honor.

We

11

can -- if we imagine a corrupt district attorney who

12

wants to make sure that constitutional rights are

13

violated and evades the edict of this Court, sure, that

14

is the consequence of Imbler.

15

But my point in -- in not answering the

16

question about the theory under that case, is that the

17

argument of the plaintiff in that case is so different

18

from the argument that we are making here.

19

plaintiff in that case would be arguing, well, it is

20

removed in time from the -- the actual prosecution which

21

is an argument that we, too, can make.

22

before the initiation of criminal proceedings.

23

not -- you know, you could not say it's not unique to

24

prosecutors.

25

The

The conduct was
It's

Here, our argument is that there is nothing

Official - Subject to Final Review

unique to prosecutors or to lawyers about the

2

information management function, about the function of

3

tracking information.

4

exotic theory.

5

has been following in distinguishing between -

6

And by the way, this is not an

This is exactly the line that this Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can't you say anything about

7

training subordinates in any office.

There is nothing

8

unique about training or not training subordinates in a

9

prosecutor's office as opposed to any other government

10

office or, I would suppose, an office in the private

11

sector.

12

provided adequate training or any instance where there

13

is a deliberate indifference as to the training that is

14

provided?

15

So does your argument extend to any failure to

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I can see the plaintiff in

16

a case using our argument to advance that point.

17

point here is we don't even need to get to that argument

18

because -

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

But my

So a plaintiff could say

20

that it could sue a -- a district attorney for failing

21

to have adequate training as to subordinates before

22

you -- they are sent in to deliver a summation so that

23

they know they are not supposed to comment on the

24

failure of a defendant to take the stand -

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

As I said -

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

They are not supposed to

2

vouch for witnesses, that would be a viable theory in

3

your opinion?

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I -- I believe that there

5

is an argument.

It's not the argument that I am making.

6

The argument that I am making it matters what the D.A.

But here the D.A. is

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rosenkranz, you have,

12

it seems to me, a theory of this case that is not the

13

theory that the Ninth Circuit went on.

14

Ninth Circuit talks about training and supervising

15

deputy district attorneys.

16

Because we want to ensure that they share information.

17

I mean, the

And why do we train them?

Now you are cutting out the training and

18

supervision, and you are saying the obligation of the

19

supervising attorney is to have this information bank,

20

which the deputy attorneys can then -- then consult,

21

which, may be a very sound policy.

22

of due process that the supervising attorney has to

23

devise a system to share information?

24

anything -- anything that the Court has held that

25

suggests that there is a data collection function
33
Alderson Reporting Company

But is it an element

Where is there

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

required by due process?

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So, Your Honor, let me

3

ask -- let me answer the first half first, which is

4

about what the Ninth Circuit held.

5

say what it is that we argued to the Ninth Circuit.

6

And first, I should

It's on -- it's in our brief, very clearly

7

we've presented on page -- excuse me -- on page 17 of

8

our brief, that big paragraph, the only full paragraph,

9

we present both what we argued to the Ninth Circuit,

10

which was about the creation of a database, and what

11

Petitioners argued to the Ninth Circuit, which reflected

12

exactly what we were saying.

13

confused.

14

quote, failed to set up a system to disseminate to

15

deputy district attorneys information about plea deals

16

and other assistance being offered to informants.

17

So petitioners were not

They attributed to us the argument that they,

That was -- and that was directly out of our

18

brief.

19

first line of our brief also referred to that.

20

That was the first line of their brief, and the

I agree, the Ninth Circuit spoke more about

21

training than about this information database.

22

Ninth Circuit was also speaking only about -

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the

And there is nothing in

24

the Ninth Circuit -- there was nothing that was

25

presented to the Ninth Circuit by Mr. Goldstein that had
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to do with this talk about training?

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

There was, Your Honor.

3

our complaint we had two what might be called

4

information management theories.

In

5

One -- and you can see it on page 45 of our

6

complaint of the joint appendix, and so while the Court

7

is orienting itself -- there were -- there's a theory of

8

information management that is the most prominent theory

9

in the complaint.

If you look at the bottom of page 45,

10

about seven lines up from the bottom, you see two

11

distinct kind of subtheories.

12

The first is -- so it starts -- the line

13

starts purposely or with a deliberate indifference -

14

theory 1-A, that petitioners failed to create any system

15

for the deputy district attorneys handling criminal

16

cases to access information, about informants, of

17

course.

18

Theory B, two lines from the bottom, "that

19

they failed to train deputy district attorneys to

20

disseminate information pertaining to the benefits

21

provided to jailhouse informants."

22

disseminating it internally.

23

the specific allegations against Petitioners, you see

24

paragraph 154, repeatedly talking about this information

25

system, this information sharing system, both as a

That's also about

If one turns to page 69,

system to create and as a failure to train.

the system, to inform the other guy that you've just

4

made a deal with the informant.

5

But, again,

Train on the need, when you don't have

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I would like to follow

6

that up a bit by saying, one, I'm not sure what this

7

difference between what you are arguing now and what you

8

are arguing then matters.

9

frankly.

I don't understand it,

I don't actually understand it, because I

10

agree, when you were in the Ninth Circuit, with what you

11

said:

12

then you said:

13

supervise.

14

don't know, because the problem that -- maybe it does

15

matter, maybe it doesn't.

16

understand it.

17

It's a failure to disseminate information.

And

And it's a failure to train and

You did say that.

Or maybe he should be.

There we are.

So, here I know I can't bring this suit, but

6

here's what I claim:

You failed to have a system that

7

did... and now we fill in the blank.

8

blank is, it's going to be something that would have

9

stopped him from doing this bad thing.

And whatever that

In your case, it

10

happens to be an information dissemination system.

11

other case, it would be some other kind of system that

12

would have the effect of stopping this bad thing.

13

their point is that, if you can go ahead with yours, so

can anybody else go ahead with theirs, and that is the

end of immunity.

assessment of that data for trial.

is just very different from trying to hold the district

If the prosecutor has the

policy of failing to distribute to the line attorneys

the latest Ninth Circuit decision or the latest

decisions of this Court on important issues of criminal

constitutional procedure, because they just don't like

19

the way the law is developing in these areas.

20

like the law the way it existed at sometime in the past,

21

and they are just not going to distribute any of that.

Would that be a theory?

than the question that you present on the merits.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it's actually

not, and I will tell you why.

Our -- we do not have to

allege, for a 1983 case, that the conduct complained of

was unconstitutional.

19

the conduct caused a constitutional violation.

prominently our theory would be that this case is a case

22

in which the district attorney was aware of this market

district attorneys on notice as to what they ought to be

you were aware of strong warnings of this bizarre

atmosphere in which jailhouse confessions are being used

in this way, and you are aware that lawyers on one side

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

It's just shuffling

Well, Your Honor, that's

5

exactly right.

It is because the functional approach -

6

for purposes of a functional approach, you never look at

7

the case through the lens of a constitutional violation.

8

You look at it through the lens of the conduct that's

9

being challenged.

So that's what, for example, this

10

Court did in Kalina.

11

occurred in the courtroom, but the lens that the Court

12

looked at it through was the specific conduct where this

13

Court said -

The constitutional violation

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But your client's standing

to challenge this whole policy is the fact that he was

the victim of the -- of the use of the policy in a

absolute immunity.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, and that

20

is always true in an immunity case.

It is always true

that the -- that the injury materializes in the

23

it is utterly irrelevant where the injury materializes.

What is relevant is whether you have a -

I think some of the Court's comments have

underscored the tension in this case that the nature of

the constitutional claim here:

But the function we are talking about is the function of

That the rights that

You can do it in various fashions.
Maybe it's something else.

Maybe

20

it's a data base.

21

some cases it's even foreclosing particular witnesses

22

from testifying because you don't trust them.

23

essentially what the district attorney's policy is now.

24

It -- it forecloses deputy district attorneys from just,

25

willy-nilly, using jailhouse informants.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Maybe in

That is

They have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

severe restrictions on what they can do.

2

It's hard to imagine a -- a policy that is

3

more directed to courtroom behavior than something

4

that's caveating the discretion of a particular line

5

prosecutor as to which witnesses they can use.

6

I think what we have here is a

7

constitutional claim that the tighter they try and draw

8

not just the causation, but the nature of the obligation

9

itself is tied to the prosecutorial function.

Because

10

it's part of the prosecutorial function to assure the

11

disclosure of exculpatory information under Brady and -

12

and Giglio.

13

And so I would submit that under Imbler this

14

Court has already held that that conduct by an

15

individual prosecutor falls squarely within immunity.

16

And I submit that there is -- there is simply no

17

distinction for that kind of conduct when it's done in

18

the courtroom and that kind of conduct when it's done in

19

advance in all cases by a supervising prosecutor or by a

20

chief advocate.

21

--

22

If the Court has no further questions

JUSTICE BREYER:

I suppose the distinction

23

he's trying to make maybe -- I'm not sure I've got it

24

right, but you see there are certain kinds of systems

25

that maybe administratively an office ought to have.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And where it turns out that this is really an

2

administrative system, a lot of offices do have it, some

3

don't, but where it was negligent not to have it and the

4

very presence of it would have prevented the -- the

5

individual in the courtroom from behaving the way he

6

did, well, that's a separate kind of a claim.

7

administrative claim.

8
9

That's an

Just as if, for example, suppose you had no
secretary or assistants.

He says, look, everybody

10

should have secretarial assistance.

11

secretarial assistance, these people would not have

12

misread everything the way they did or would have gotten

13

the phone calls or would have done something like that.

14

That's the kind of line -- so he's trying to draw a line

15

there between something that is pretty purely

16

administrative and -- and something that is really

17

supervisory and training.

And he is not saying

18

supervisory and training.

He is saying that was a

19

separate claim.

20

MR. COATES:

And if only you had

Well, I think it's hard for him

21

to get away from the manner in which he is trying to

22

characterize it as being just administrative because

23

it's not information just sitting there in a vacuum.

24

The key thing is the policy that -

of the -- the meaning for which you are collecting the

data.

13

information gets out there.

that distinction.
