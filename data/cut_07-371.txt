Ms. Rosenbaum.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA ROSENBAUM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
It is the basic principle of American law

10
11

that a lawsuit does not decide the rights of

12

non-parties.

13

exceptions, none of which applies here.

14

That basic principle has a few narrow

Taylor had no involvement in the prior case.

15

He had no legal relationship with any parties to that

16

case.

17

to represent him.

18

And no party to that case had the legal authority

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you have a

19

situation where it is an associational standing case,

20

and an individual is the one that's relied upon give the

21

association standing, in that case is the individual,

22

even though he's not bringing the suit, is he barred by

23

the association's case?

24
25

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I think that would depend on

whether the association in that case had the authority
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to bring that case on behalf of that individual.

2

In order for a person to be bound on the

3

basis of representation in the prior case, the party to

4

the prior case had to have the authority to bring the

5

case on behalf of that other person.

6

representational relationship where the party for the

7

first case is exercising the authority to represent the

8

later case.

9

exists at the time of the first litigation.

10
11
12

It had to be a

And there has to be a relationship that

Someone can't retroactively be represented
during the first litigation.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if you had a case and

13

there's a suspicion of something like that that's here,

14

although the courts below did not so find?

15

had a case in -- like this in which the first litigant

16

said to the second, I brought my case and I lost.

17

18

win, I will give you a job making use of the fruits of

19

the litigation?

What if you

I

And if you do and you

20

Would there be an estoppel in that case?

21

MS. ROSENBAUM:

22

And I do want to emphasize --

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

MS. ROSENBAUM:

25

No, not just on those facts.

Why.
-- first that is a big shift

from what was decided blow.

What the court held below

was that Herrick represented Taylor in the previous


2

case.

3

representing Herrick in this case.


4

It did not hold that Taylor was somehow


JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

been found -- and I was giving you an example of

8

something that I would call collusion at least -- that

9

the result might have been different.

And the suggestion was that if collusion had

10

MS. ROSENBAUM:

11

pejorative way of saying an agreement.

12

be -- can lead to preclusion under a certain

13

circumstances instances, but for --

14

Collusion is sort of a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

An agreement can

Why wouldn't my example

15

have done so?

16

please try again for me.

17

give you a job making use of the fruits of the lawsuit.

18
19
20

In my example the agreement was I lost;
And if you win, I'm going to

Would that agreement not have been enough
to -- to sustain a collusion here?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

No, not without the party to

21

the first case controlling the second case.

22

Court does not --

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But this

Why should that -- why

should that matter?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

Because what's being
5

1

protected here is the person's right to the opportunity

2

to be heard on their claim.

And in that case --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MS. ROSENBAUM:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But --

-- second claim.
The claim that

6

Justice Souter has posited is not one that the second

7

person would have been -- he was soliciting.

8

solicited to be a plaintiff in that second case.

9

is not the case that is involved here.

10

He was
That

As far as we

know --

11

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Exactly.

16

17

has to be controlled, but why are we getting into the

18

details of such a situation when we have no

19

solicitation?

20

He brings the

There is no indication that it was
So I don't know why you're even

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Exactly.

This Court does

21

not need to decide what sort of solicitation or

22

recruitment or agreement would reasonably --

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

But if we adopted

24

-- as I understand it, if we adopted your theory across

25

the board, it would preclude -- it would preclude a
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

preclusion in the case of my hypothetical, and that's

2

what I want to get at.

3

Should we, by adopting your theory,

4

eliminate the possibility of preclusion in the case that

5

I put to you?

6

And you're saying, I guess:

7

even there, there should be no preclusion unless the

8

first party controlled the case in the -- controlled the

9

second case.

10

And my question is:

11

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, if --

Why?

Well, again, that's a

12

question of whether that second party is acting as an

13

agent for the first party and really just trying to

14

relitigate that first party's opportunity to be heard.

15

And if the second party is an agent, then the second

16

party can be precluded.

17

But, again, exactly what would constitute

18

that agency is not something that this Court needs to

19

decide, because the facts here do not demonstrate that

20

Taylor was representing Herrick in this case.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, do you think that the

22

collusion point was perhaps just ill-phrased here?

23

There was no collusion, certainly, in the sense that

24

there was any kind of secret dealing going on.

25

The second lawsuit, the people involved in
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it, couldn't Taylor -- couldn't have been more candid, I

2

guess, about what was going on.

3

collusion in the sense of concealment or

4

underhandedness.

5

And so there was no

Do you think that is perhaps the reason that

6

the court of appeals found that there was no collusion;

7

and that, therefore, we ought to discount that finding?

8
9

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, I think the court of

appeals found that there was no collusion because the

10

facts that are in the record about the relationship

11

between Taylor and Herrick do not demonstrate that there

12

was any collusion.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, didn't the court of

14

appeals actually say there was no collusion, or did it

15

say, we don't need to reach that question?

16

MS. ROSENBAUM:

It said that the facts were

17

ambiguous, and it did not need to decide it.

18

also specifically said that on the facts before it, that

19

Taylor could have brought an entirely separate,

20

independent case, separate from Herrick.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it

So --

So these facts do not

22

necessarily show collusion to avoid the preclusive

23

effects of Herrick?

24

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

We do not need to determine
8


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether they count as tactical maneuvering.

2

find -- they did say there was a close working

3

relationship relative to the successive cases.

4

they say that?

5

MS. ROSENBAUM:

They did

They did say that.

Didn't

But,

6

again, that just brings up the question of what sort of

7

relationship is necessary for the -- there to be

8

preclusion.

9

And many people have close relationships but

10

that does not necessarily mean that those people are

11

bound, or expect to be bound, by decisions in each

12

others' cases, particularly --

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But here the close

14

relationship seems to boil down to this, and you correct

15

me if I'm wrong here because I may be missing some fact.

16

But it is inconceivable to me that any

17

reason for Taylor's participation or Taylor's bringing

18

this lawsuit could be found except the reason of trying

19

to relitigate Herrick's lawsuit so that Taylor would

20

then either get the job or have an easier time

21

fulfilling the job of fixing up the airplane.

22
23
24
25

I can't think of any other reason on the
facts as I understand them from the briefs.
Is there a -- on the facts of case, any
other possible reason?
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Yes.

First, I just want to

2

point out that there was no agreement, or the record

3

does not show and there was no agreement between them to

4

actually work on the plane.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But why else would

6

he be doing -- why else would he have been doing this?

7

What does the record show as another possible

8

explanation?

9

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Taylor is the executive

10

director of the Antique Aircraft Association, and he is

11

someone who is interested in antique aircraft and in

12

aviation generally.

13

decision -- his explanation in the motion for discovery

14

for filing his FOIA request is that he read the decision

15

in Herrick, and that he understood it to mean that he

16

was legally entitled to the records.

17

And after reading Herrick's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so --

You don't need a reason to

18

file a FOIA request anyway, right?

19

curiosity justifies your obtaining the documents, right?

20

I mean this is a lawsuit that does not require a reason

21

except I want the documents.

22

entitled to them.

23

MS. ROSENBAUM:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Just the naked

You've got them.

Yes.

I'm

It requires the --

I mean somebody could have

walked in off the street and filed this same lawsuit,
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2
3
4

right?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

Anyone who was interested in

the record could file a FOIA request for them.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if somebody walked in

5

off the street and began this lawsuit and had absolutely

6

no connection with Herrick, and so on, the issue of

7

preclusion wouldn't come up, or at least it wouldn't

8

come up in the context that it comes up here.

9

But this isn't somebody who walked in off

10

the street, and the claim is there is a preclusion

11

doctrine because of the relationship between party one

12

and party two.

13

off the street could have asked -- could have made the

14

same request, in effect, is not an answer to the

15

collusion claim; is it?

16

And the fact that anybody who comes in

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, it shows that the

17

problem, if it exists, of there being repeated

18

litigation over the same records is not one that would

19

be solved through preclusion.

20

shown there actually is a problem with repeated

21

litigation over the same records.

22

Justice represents the defendants in all FOIA cases, so

23

they would be able to know if that was a problem that

24

came up again and again.

25

And Respondents have not

And the Department of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
11

Alderson Reporting Company

What about if it is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the executive director of the association, and the suit

2

is brought in the name the association, and they lose.

3

Can he bring suit as, you know, I'm just Joe Blow, but I

4

happen to be the executive director, but I'm bringing

5

this in my own name?

6

MS. ROSENBAUM:

The question -- that would

7

then come down to whether or not he controlled the first

8

case, because one of the categories in which people are

9

bound by prior litigation in which they were not

10

themselves parties, is if they had control over the

11

first case and had the full and fair opportunity to

12

litigate in that case.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, let's say that

14

it is somebody above him, you know, the president of the

15

association, who decides what lawsuits are brought, and

16

he's just the executive director?

17

MS. ROSENBAUM:

But he was not in control of

18

the first case and did not get his opportunity to be

19

heard in that case -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

But he recommended

21

to the president, said we ought to file this lawsuit.

22

The president said okay, and they did, and then they

23

lost.

24
25

Can he go ahead as an individual?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

If he was not in control of

that first case, yes, he could go ahead as an individual
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if he was not -- if he is not representing the


2

association in the second case, but is, instead,


3

representing himself.


4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And could he continue to


5

solicit other members of the association to file FOIA

6

suits all over the country until they finally got a

7

favorable decision?

8
9

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, that would come down

to what the definition of "solicit" was and whether

10

those people were acting as agents of that person who is

11

doing the soliciting.

12

But, again, this Court does not need to

13

decide exactly what sort of solicitation would create

14

that agency relationship, because the facts in the

15

record here do not show that that is what happened here.

16

And also FOIA is set up to allow there to be

17

repeated litigation over the same records.

18

every requester has -- every person has the right to

19

request records.

20

21

concrete and particular injury; and they have the right

22

to seek judicial review of that injury.

So that makes this case different from the

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, that means

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your statement implicates very serious questions of

2

standing under Article III, whether Congress can say

3

4

5

wouldn't go ahead assuming that that was correct.

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Although it is not really

just your argument; it is also FOIA; isn't it?

8
9

I think that's -- I

MS. ROSENBAUM:

That is the way Congress set

up FOIA is to -- to give people that statutory
entitlement to the records.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it does cover idle

12

curiosity.

13

were to file a request for the same information, there

14

could be no argument that there would be any kind of

15

preclusion just because it's been heard before.

16

I mean, I suppose if anyone in the courtroom

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Exactly.

And if there were

17

some problem with people -- with there being multiple

18

requests for the same records, that would be a problem

19

for Congress to solve.

20

creative ways of solving problems when it thinks that

21

they are, in fact, problems.

22

And Congress has all sorts of

It can channel all litigation into one court

23

or into one court of appeals like it does for patent

24

cases to more easily create precedent, or it didn't have

25

to create FOIA to create this statutory, individual
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

entitlement to begin with.
It could have sent up FOIA more like a qui

3

tam case in which one person did represent the whole

4

public or the government in requesting records.

5

But that's not what Congress did.

Congress

6

did give every person the right to records and the right

7

to seek judicial review when they were denied records.

8

And we can disagree about whether that was something

9

Congress should have done, but that is what Congress did

10

and Congress's chosen scheme should not be altered

11

through the back door of preclusion doctrine.

12

The amorphous factors used by the lower courts to hold

13

Taylor bound also have their problems in terms of

14

judicial efficiency and people coming into court.

15

factors do not give guidance either to lower courts or

16

to litigants themselves about who can be bound.

17

Those

I mean, a -- in a threshold area like res

18

judicata, it is particularly important to have clear

19

rules about who can be bound, to move on quickly to the

20

merits of the case, without having to go through a lot

21

of collateral litigation; but the factors used by the

22

court of appeals do not provide those clear rules.

23

they also don't provide clear rules to litigants about

24

when they will, in fact, be bound by -- when, in fact,

25

they will be bound by a case.

People can also be bound

Well, a class action is a

24

very good example of that representational relationship,

25

and the court of appeals in this case used language that
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

actions, talking about identity of interests and

bound by the prior case.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MS. ROSENBAUM:

9

Right.
What is generally meant by

the privity, or often -- the way the word is often used

10

to mean that a substantive legal relationship, but lower

11

courts have sometimes put the control cases in the

12

category of privity.

13

adequate representation cases in the category of

14

privity.

15

really give the bounds of who would be bound by --

They have sometimes put the

So just talking about privity, it -- doesn't

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We can use it accurately,

17

bring it back to what it really means --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can we?
What if you have a

21

situation where a client has retained a law firm to do

22

something and the law firm as part of its normal

23

activity files a FOIA request?

24

useful is going to come up there, and it's denied, and

25

the law firm on its own, and not as the -- not as

They think something

2

retained by the company files a FOIA suit?
In that case, is the company bound by the

3

determination in the case?

4

another action?

5
6
7

Or can they then file

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Who would -- if the company

filed its own FOIA case, we request on behalf -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, the law firm --

8

the law firm files its own FOIA request, and it is

9

denied, and they litigate that, and then they lose, and

10
11
12

the company brings a FOIA action.
MS. ROSENBAUM:

And the law firm brought it

on behalf of the law firm --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MS. ROSENBAUM:

15

Right.

But the company is bringing

it on behalf of the company?

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Yes.

Then they are separate

18

requestors who each have -- who have their own

19

opportunity to be heard on their own FOIA claim.

20
21
22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even if company is

represented by the same law firm?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

Yes.

Even if they're

represented by the same law firm.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which is the case here.

It is the statement lawyer that's involved?
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But --

But in the case of the

3

Chief's hypothetical, of course, it would never come up,

4

if the client sends another lawyer to bring this.

5

there's no automatic preclusion in that relationship as

6

there is in the traditional relationship.

7

MS. ROSENBAUM:

But

Well, people are not

8

generally precluded because of their lawyers' actions in

9

prior cases.

And this Court -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

But -- I guess to be

11

fair to my hypothetical, it was the company that was

12

paying for what the law firm was doing.

13

the -- the filing of the suit.

14

it own.

15

case, they think this might be helpful and they are

16

filing a FOIA request.

17

It just wasn't

The law firm went off on

Maybe it does it all the time when they have a

MS. ROSENBAUM:

The question there would

18

come down to whether the company was representing the --

19

whether the law firm in that instance was representing

20

the company with the authority to be representing the

21

company.

22

In that -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it purely a

23

formal inquiry?

In other words, let's say the company

24

is paying the law firm to represent, but the law firm

25

just filed in its own name?

Does that make a

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difference?

2

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I think it would go to the

3

underlying agreement between the law firm and the

4

company and whether the company had somehow given the

5

law firm authority to be filing this FOIA request and

6

then filing the lawsuit.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't that not like

8

Montana, where the government was not a party to the

9

case but it was in control of what the contractor was

10
11

doing?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

Right.

Again, if the

12

company was in control, and I think there would have to

13

be that sort of agreement that it was represented --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think you'd also say that

15

if the company paid for the suit.

16

"I don't want to be in control of it.

17

to sue in my name, but I think this is a good thing for

18

you to do, so I'll pay for it."

19

MS. ROSENBAUM:

The company just -I don't want you

I think that could be an

20

indicator that the company was -- that the law firm was

21

representing the company.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

No.

The company says,

23

"absolutely I do not want you to represent me."

24

in -- in a letter.

25

That is

Okay?

So it's clear that the law firm is not
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

representing the company, but the company thinks that

2

it's a good idea to have this lawsuit and yeah, I'll

3

bankroll it.

4

MS. ROSENBAUM:

If the law firm does not

5

have the authority to represent the company, then it's

6

hard to see how the company could be bound by a

7

decision --

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You don't think that

somebody who finances -- who solicits a litigation,

10

recruits someone to bring the case, pays for it, and

11

then says, "I recruited a very good law firm, so I can

12

stay out of it.

13

anything about the law, I'm not going to try to manage

14

this case."

15

for it wouldn't be bound.

16
17

I'm not going to try to -- I don't know

But someone who recruits the firm and pays

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that one away.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MS. ROSENBAUM:

20

instance.

21

to --

22
23

I think you've got to give

I think that that's a harder

And that really goes back to why it means

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's a company

--

24

MS. ROSENBAUM:

-- control a case.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Let's say some

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

group, say, Public Citizen Litigation Group sends a

2

fundraising thing around saying we think all our members

3

ought to contribute to a special fund so that we can

4

bring a lawsuit under FOIA.

5

contributors then bound by the result?

6

MS. ROSENBAUM:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

Are all of those individual

No.
So it make as

difference if it's one company as opposed to 40 donors?

9

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, again it comes back to

10

whether those people have given the person bringing the

11

case the authority to represent them in that lawsuit.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

previous hypothetical there was no authority to

14

represent.

15

idea, here's the money.

16
17

Well, then in the

They just said, "I think this is a good
Here."

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Yes, and I still think in

that situation there also would not be preclusion.

18

But the questions of when someone controls a

19

prior case are very different from what happened here

20

where there was no notice of that prior litigation, but

21

--

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, controls.

So

23

there are three companies, and they each have -- you

24

know, they can vote.

25

Are they each bound, or because they didn't control it

They each have 33-percent control.

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

none of them are bound?
MS. ROSENBAUM:

If they had not given the

3

law firm the authority to represent them in that

4

particular case, then they are not bound.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they said,

6

yes, you can represent us, and we're three different

7

companies, and, you know, it's a majority vote as to

8

what you can do.

9

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Well, then that is sort of

10

standard representation by a law firm of a company, and

11

those people would be legally represented in that

12

lawsuit, have had their day in court and would be bound

13

by that decision.

14
15

Unless there are further questions, I would
like to reserve the rest of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

24

Although the precise formulation adopted by

25

the court of appeals may be somewhat novel, its holding
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of a finding of privity here is consistent with

2

well-established principles of res judicata.

3

multiple persons engage in coordinated successive

4

litigation to vindicate a joint interest with respect to

5

which a judgment in favor of any of them will benefit

6

all, then a judgment in the first litigation in which

7

that interest is adequately represented finds the others

8

as well.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

how that could possibly work?

11

Where

Would you explain to me

I can understand that you're making an

12

argument that the second case, there was a recruitment,

13

there was collusion or whatever.

14

from this record, how could Taylor possibly be bound

15

when Herrick's suit is over?

16

Taylor never heard of that first case.

17

be bound by a litigation in which they had no notice, no

18

opportunity to be heard?

19
20
21

But for all we know

Because as far as we know,
How can somebody

So if we freeze the situation at the of case
one, how could Taylor possibly be bound?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I think it's

22

important to start by recognizing that even Petitioner

23

acknowledges that there can be circumstances in which

24

Taylor would be bound, even though at the time, at the

25

end of Herrick's litigation, he had no notice, he had
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not participated.

2

as well, that if Herrick had thereafter created an

3

agency relationship with Taylor, and Taylor then as

4

agent went and brought the second FOIA suit --

5
6

And that is, on their view and ours

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because he's asking for

Herrick who is bound by the first case.

7

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right.

8

And -- but all of that can exist or be created after the

9

first litigation is over.

10

And so the absence of notice

in the first case --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because what you're

12

saying is the person who is really in the second case is

13

the same person who was in the first case, and Taylor is

14

simply acting as an agent to give Herrick another

15

chance?

16
17

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:
right.

18
19

That's -- that's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we're talking about

binding Taylor.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

20

Well -- but Taylor

21

in the second suit that he brings as agent to advance

22

the interests of Herrick would be bound.

23

His suit would be -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

that.

different case.


3

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That would be a


Well, I don't --

4

the court certainly did not find that there was no


5

collusion.

6

I agree that the court didn't reach --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It said it wasn't

reaching that question.

8
9

No.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It didn't reach the

question of what they called "tactical maneuvering."
I think that there is a -- a strong argument

10
11

could be made that Taylor was Herrick's agent; but I

12

don't think that it's critical to find that he was his

13

agent in the very technical sense of the Restatement of

14

Agency.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

If he -- if he was his

16

agent -- and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's line of

17

inquiry -- suppose in the second case Herrick tells him

18

I want you to bring a suit on my behalf.

19

I'll do that.

20

says, you know, I also want to bring a suit on my own.

21

And he brings another suit, not as agent for Herrick.

He brings that suit.

He says fine,

And then Taylor

22

I suppose he could do that, couldn't he?

23

The first would be thrown out because it's Herrick's

24

second suit.

25

Taylor's own suit, wouldn't it?

But the -- Taylor's own suit would remain

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

No, Taylor --

So long as there's no more

3

collusion or anything else, he's --

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

If Taylor brought

5

the second suit in his own name and it was found to be

6

barred by res judicata, a third suit in Taylor's own

7

name would likewise be barred.

8

And there's a case that I think illustrates

9

this point perhaps better than any of those we cited on

10

our brief, unfortunately.

But I think it's helpful --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I hope so.

12

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

-- because --

Well, Your Honor, I

15

think that it proves the point that has been the sort of

16

underlying concern of many of the questions:

The Schendel case is 270 U.S. 611.

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor is reacting to is the reality of the situation

2

seems to be that there's a sufficient relationship

3

between these two that they ought to be barred.

there is no section of the Restatement (Second) that

5

specifically governs this case.

6

which is that somehow the Restatement (Second) has

it.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

And Petitioner's view,

There is in the -- in the

10

Restatement of Judgment, as far as I know, all of the

11

examples involve a representational relationship that

12

existed at the time of the first litigation.

13

nothing in the Restatement that suggests that preclusion

14

would be proper here.

15

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

There's

Well, Your Honor, I

16

agree that the Restatement (Second) does not, for

17

example, state the law which we all know and which

18

Petitioner concedes is the case, and that is that the

19

agent who brings the second lawsuit is bound, even if

the agency relationship arose --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you agree with me

about the facts that we're dealing with here?
34

Alderson Reporting Company

As far as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the first case is concerned, no evidence that Taylor

2

even knew that Herrick was -- Herrick was bringing that

3

suit?

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

What the evidence

5

shows is that Herrick made Taylor aware of the -- of the

6

outcome of the litigation, but we don't have --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- and while the

8

litigation is ongoing, Taylor doesn't know about it,

right?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

10
11

There's no evidence

of that.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And is there any

evidence that Herrick asked Taylor to file a FOIA

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

Well, the --

-- after Herrick lost his

case?

18

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

The evidence is

19

that Herrick asked Taylor to help him fix the plane, the

20

plane and its restoration being the object of Herrick's

21

own FOIA case.

22

which were essential --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any evidence

that Herrick called any of the shots in that litigation?

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, counsel on

17

the other side filed an affidavit that said -- it was

18

very carefully crafted, I think -- that there was no

19

attorney-client relationship with Herrick with respect

20

to this --

21
22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In any case, the decision

that we're reviewing didn't find any of those things.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No, that's right.

24

What the court of appeals relied on was the fact that

25

Taylor had made Herrick's interest his own and brought
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the suit in order to vindicate the exact same interests

2

that Herrick, himself, had already litigated and lost.

3

And that was to get the documents to restore Herrick's

plane.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if another member of

6

the club, let's say another member of the aviation

7

association who's interested in antique planes, just

8

files a FOIA request, would that person be precluded who

individual that brought the case with club standing,

associational standing?

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

I think in -- Your

18

Honor's first question to opposing counsel was such

19

that, yes, I think that if that was the individual whose

20

interest was relied upon to give an association

21

standing, that it would bind the individual whose name

22

and interest was relied on.

the reverse situation where --

a member of the association, whether -37

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No, the court of

request.

11

Going back to a question I think

You don't have to have any reason for a FOIA

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That -- that's

12

true.

We think that that, in fact, makes FOIA even more

13

susceptible to this kind of vexatious litigation that

14

Petitioner seems to think is entirely permissible.

15

the courts have held that the --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, you have described

6

for us a thousand-headed monster of litigation, and your

7

proposal for a solution is to cut off one eyebrow.

8
9

You're going to solve just the case of, you
know, two people building an airplane.

You agree,

10

anybody else in the association can file a lawsuit.

11

Anybody else in the United States can file a lawsuit,

12

even if they're not in the association.

13

It seems to me that, you know, in order to

14

cut off an eyebrow, I'm not willing to make a whole lot

15

of incursion upon our traditional rules of who's bound

16

by a lawsuit.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Why should we stretch for

We are not

We, in fact --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

23

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

-- think that's one

24

of the virtues of our argument:

That where there is a

25

document that is of true public interest such that
41

Alderson Reporting Company

1

multiple individuals on entirely independent grounds


2

might well seek it, they would not be barred.


3

But where a document has commercial value


4

like this one does to Mr. Herrick, so that he can


5

restore his plane without going to the incredible

6

expense of developing another manner to prove to the FAA

7

the airworthiness of that plane, there is that

8

commercial value that gives him the incentive to try to

9

relitigate over and over again.

And on Petitioner's

10

view, as long as he stops just shy of an agency

11

relationship, he can do that throughout the country.

12

And this is --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That sounds like --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this an approach

15

that only applies in FOIA cases?

16

every other case you have the normal Article III

17

requirements of injury, which limits exactly who can

18

sue.

19

I would assume in

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, the rule is a

20

broader rule.

And we've pointed out that it has in

21

common with the rule with respect to co-beneficiaries

22

that existed since the 1800s at the very latest, the

23

rule as stated in section 48 of the Restatement, which

24

is an example, a counter-example, Justice Ginsburg, to

25

your question about whether it always had to be a
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pre-existing legal relationship, because section 48

2

deals with a particular situation where there are

3

multiple individuals who can claim for personal injury

4

of one of them.

5

another person, not a family member.

6

to this section makes clear that although most

7

situations where it would apply would be family members,

8

it also applies to -- and I want to quote it:

9

10

And the section is stated in terms of

11

So the law of --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not sure what the

13

hypothetical is.

14

that -- let's say you have a whole busload of people who

15

get injured in the same accident.

16

and loses.

17

Four is not precluded.

18

I mean it is certainly not the case

Two sues and loses.

Plaintiff one sues
Three is not precluded.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

But it recognizes

19

there could be a close-enough relationship between the

20

two such that the purposes of the rule would be

21

satisfied, but there is no legal, familial relationship.

22

And --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if all that has been

24

proved, the problem is that the D.C. Circuit said:

25

We're not going to look into what they call strategic
43

Alderson Reporting Company

whatever.

3

We're going to take it just as it is, with
none of -- no showing that these two are in cahoots.

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

They didn't need to

5

because of the fact that Taylor had voluntarily taken up

6

Herrick's interests to get a second bite at the

7

litigatory apple, as the First Circuit put it.

8
9

And it is not the fact, as Petitioner would
argue, that every time another person has an individual,

10

standing right to sue under a statute, that it means

11

that that person necessarily gets to relitigate where a

12

person with whom they have a close relationship such as

13

this has already litigated and lost.

14
15
16
17

And so, getting back to Your Honor's
question -JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is sort of a

totality-of-the-circumstances test in every case, right.

18

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

We look at the whole thing,

and we say, you know, close enough relationship.

issue in a case.

MS. STETSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice Scalia, I'd like to begin with the

22

question that you posed earlier regarding privity and

23

what it really means, because that's what has given

24

rise, I think, to all of these vexing hypotheticals and

25

to your concern about this being nothing more than a
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

completely freewheeling, totality-of-the circumstances

test.

The problem, I think, that you're

This is a Federal common-law issue; and, as
this Court unanimously acknowledged in 1996, what our

10

notions are of privity are changing, and they continue

11

to change.

12

In 1942, when the first restatement was

13

issued, "privity" was defined as control, or successor

14

in interest, or representation.

15

In 1982, when the second restatement was

16

issued, "privity" was defined generally as

17

representation, legal relationships, or that section 62

18

category that Mr. Hallward-Driemeier just mentioned,

19

which we can call "shenanigans."

20

The notion of privity is underpinned in

21

every single one of those contexts by a couple of basic

22

inquiries, and this is what makes it something much more

23

confined than a freewheeling,

24

totality-of-the-circumstances test.

25

The inquiries are:

What are the

46

relationships between these two litigants, these two

2

serial litigants, and how have they conducted themselves

The first is that conclusion was precisely the

9

conclusion that was drawn by the D.C. Circuit on the

10

close-relationship point.

11

If you look at joint appendix 17-A, the

12

conclusion on close relationship was predicated on,

13

among other things, the critical fact of the request

14

from Mr. Herrick to Mr. Taylor to repair the plane.

15

That is what made --

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But at no point did

17

the D.C. Circuit or the district court, as I understand

18

it, say that request, in effect, was a request to

19

relitigate this matter so that we both, the owner of the

20

plane and the repairer of the plane, would have what I

21

was seeking in my first lawsuit.

22
23

They never actually crossed the line and
drew that conclusion; did they?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADINA H. ROSENBAUM,


4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


5

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Thank you.

6

First, I want to address the two cases

7

brought up by the government.

In Des Moines Valley

Railroad that was someone who had the right to the land

9

because of a grant from the government.

In that case,

10

specifically, the Court pointed out that the

11

government -- that Congress had passed a law that had

12

the government give up all interest, that showed that

13

the government had given up all interests in the land.

14

And in the Rock Island Railroad case, that had to do

15

with a beneficiary and the administrator of an estate.

16

These are legal relationships that give rise

17

to privity, and that's exactly the point.

18

relationships that do give rise to privity, but the

19

relationship between Taylor and Herrick is not one of

20

them.

MS. ROSENBAUM:

I think what would have to

again, the facts here do not show that there is any

agreement between Taylor and Herrick to -- there's no

agreement either to repair the plane; but more

So this Court does not need to reach the

2

question of exactly what sort of agreement would lead to

preclusion, and the problem with the lower court's

decision here is that they did just look at a grab bag

5

of amorphous factors to hold Taylor bound.

about a close relationship without it being the sort of

7

relationship under which one party is representing the

8

other or under which they have a legal relationship.

The district court did think

14

that there was tactical maneuvering happening here.

agreement between them.

was an agreement, if we conclude that what we see from

21

the court of appeals opinion isn't enough?

22

As I understand, the court of appeals didn't

23

think an agreement was necessary.

So regardless of what

24

the district court said, al thought that was an issue

25

that was litigated, it was not passed on by the court of

appeals.

2

MS. ROSENBAUM:

Yes.

The court could remand

3

it and then the district court would have the discretion

4

to allow the case to go forward as it saw fit.

5

And the problem - the problem with the

6

factors looked at by the lower courts, with -- basing

7

privity on just amorphous facts and basically just

8

having courts check their gut about whether or not that

9

relationship is sufficient, is that it ends up with

10

people being found in privity when they did not actually

11

have their right to be heard, the way Taylor did not

12

here.

13

rationales that protect the litigant's right to be heard

14

and ensure that they do have their day in court.

Instead, privity should be based on underlaying

15

Unless there are any further questions.
