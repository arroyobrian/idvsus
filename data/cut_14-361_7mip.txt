            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Case 14361, Ocasio v.

5

United States.

6

            Mr. Davis.

7

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF ETHAN P. DAVIS

8

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

            MR. DAVIS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court:

11

            The Hobbs Act requires that a defendant

12

obtain property from another.  In this case, Mr. Ocasio

13

was charged with conspiring with the owners of a repair

14

shop not to obtain property from another, but from the

15

owners themselves.

16

            The plain language of the Hobbs Act resolves

17

this case.  When two people agree that one will pay the

18

other a bribe, they have merely agreed to exchange

19

property between themselves, not to obtain property from

20

another.  The historical background, the statutory

21

structure, and basic criminal  principles of criminal

22

law all point in the same direction.  There are no old

23

English or State cases involving conspiracies to extort

24

property from a coconspirator.

25

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Does that mean that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

would have to  in order to get at this  this

2

venture, you would have to bring two separate

3

prosecutions, one against your client for the extortion,

4

and then a separate crime  a separate prosecution in

5

State court against the body shop owners?

6

            MR. DAVIS:  Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I think

7

that is correct.  Maryland has a bribery statute that

8

might apply in a situation like this.  And Congress has

9

passed a bribery statute targeted to bribery of State

10

and local officials, 18 U.S.C. 666, that may or may not

11

apply to the repair shop owners.  But we don't think

12

they could be convicted of 

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is it  is it well

14

established, or even not well established, that you are

15

obtaining property under color of law when you give

16

somebody a bribe?

17

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor 

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It seems to me  what that

19

means to me under color of law is you  you pretend to

20

have a legal right to it, which in fact you don't have.

21

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Scalia, until 1992, I

22

think that was an open question, but this Court decided

23

in Evans v. United States in '92 that Hobbs Act

24

extortion encompasses the paying of  of bribes.

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I dissented, I assume.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

            (Laughter.)

2

            MR. DAVIS:  You did.  But, Your Honor, I

3

think that that  the decision in Evans was really the

4

highwater mark of this Court's Hobbs Act jurisprudence.

5

And since then the Court has been careful not to expand

6

the Hobbs Act 

7

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, we have stated that

8

a person may be liable for conspiracy even though he was

9

incapable of committing the substantive offense.  Does

10

that carry the day for the government's argument here,

11

or is that distinguishable at principle?

12

            MR. DAVIS:  I think that's distinguishable

13

in principle, Justice Kennedy.

14

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And why?

15

            MR. DAVIS:  Well, certainly not every

16

conspirator must personally commit every element of the

17

substantive offense.

18

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But he might not even be

19

capable of it, must not even be capable of it, as I

20

understand what we've said.

21

            MR. DAVIS:  That's correct, Your Honor.

22

Must  need not even be capable of committing every

23

element of the substantive offense, but each conspirator

24

must specifically intend that someone commit every

25

element of the substantive offense.  And 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, why isn't that test

2

satisfied here, because the shop owners agreed that

3

Mr. Ocasio would commit every element of the substantive

4

offense?

5

            MR. DAVIS:  The shop owners, Your Honor,

6

agree that Mr. Ocasio would obtain property from

7

another, not from themselves.  So I think that 

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, the  the 

9

Mr. Ocasio is committing every element of the

10

substantive offense.  He is obtaining property from

11

another; that is, he's obtaining property from the body

12

shop owners.  And the body shop owners agreed that he

13

would do so.

14

            So it seems to me that in the normal way

15

that conspiracy law works, there is a conspiracy here.

16

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, I don't think

17

that's quite right.  I think that there must be a unity

18

of purpose in conspiracy law.  And the  Mr. Ocasio may

19

have agreed to obtain property from another, but the

20

body shop owners agreed to obtain property from

21

themselves; so there's no unity of purpose.

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  They only need to agree that

23

he should obtain property from another, and that is

24

exactly what they agreed to.

25

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, I think the best

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

way to approach your question is through imagining how

2

this would happen in ordinary English.  The government

3

has a John and Susan  has its response to our John and

4

Susan hypothetical in its brief.  It says, John would go

5

to Susan and say, let us agree that I will obtain

6

property from another, namely, you.  And you notice how

7

much work the words "namely you" are doing in the

8

government's hypothetical.  They're redefining the word

9

"another" to mean the opposite of its ordinary meaning,

10

not 

11

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Is that any stranger than

12

the Mann Act situation, where the woman who is being

13

transported across State lines for immoral purposes,

14

conspires with the person who is transporting her across

15

State lines?  That's permissible, isn't it?

16

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Alito, I think yes, it

17

is.  And two distinctions from the Mann Act cases:  The

18

first is that the Mann Act used the phrase "any woman,"

19

not "another woman."  I think that case would have been

20

different if it had used the phrase "another woman."

21

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, "any woman" is broader

22

than "another woman."  "Any woman" means any of

23

3.5 billionplus women in the world, and that subsumes

24

"another woman," doesn't it?

25

            MR. DAVIS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

mean, I think that if a woman agreed to transport any

2

woman, it makes sense to think that she could transport

3

herself across State lines, but if the statute had said

4

"another woman," it doesn't make sense to say that she

5

could have transported another woman when she was merely

6

transporting herself.

7

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, they're two different

8

words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be

9

identical, which is that it's just not natural to say

10

that the transported woman is herself transporting any

11

woman, right?  I mean, the transported woman is not

12

transporting any woman.

13

            But the reason the Court said that a

14

conspiracy was possible there was because the

15

transported woman could agree with another person, let's

16

say, the man, that the man would transport any woman,

17

namely, herself.  It's  it's an almost identical

18

syntactical issue.

19

            MR. DAVIS:  I don't think so, Your Honor.  I

20

think that transporting another woman would create a

21

much bigger textual issue than transporting any woman.

22

            If the woman goes to the man who is

23

transporting her and says, I'd like to help you

24

transport another woman, he would think that she is

25

talking about someone else, not about herself.  It's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

much more natural in the context of "any woman."

2

            The other reason those cases are

3

distinguishable, Your Honor, is because they use the

4

verb "transport" instead of "obtain."  It's  it's

5

conceivable to transport yourself; it's not really  it

6

doesn't really make sense to obtain property from

7

yourself.

8

            So I think those are distinguishable on

9

those grounds.

10

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What difference did it

11

make in this  you're  you're not contesting the

12

extortion convictions, right?  You  it's only the

13

conspiracy; is that right?

14

            MR. DAVIS:  That's correct, Your Honor, with

15

an asterisk, and that is if we were to prevail here, we

16

would go back to the Fourth Circuit and ask to vacate

17

the substantive convictions also on the basis of

18

spillover prejudice.

19

            But for purposes of this appeal, you're

20

correct.

21

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And did the addition of

22

the conspiracy conviction affect the sentence?

23

            Would it have been different if there had

24

been no conspiracy charge.

25

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, the sentences ran

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

concurrently.  The difference it made was $600 in

2

restitution payments that were attributable to two acts

3

of extortion that were not charged as substantive counts

4

in the indictment.

5

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I have a small question,

6

but not unimportant, which is:  Who paid the bribe,

7

Majestic or the brothers?

8

            MR. DAVIS:  The brothers paid the bribes,

9

Your Honor, out of 

10

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Out of their own

11

pockets, or did they 

12

            MR. DAVIS:  Out of the 

13

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   Majestic, issue a

14

check?

15

            MR. DAVIS:  Out of the Majestic bank

16

account, Your Honor.

17

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why isn't Majestic

18

the other person here?

19

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, the government

20

forfeited any argument that Majestic is the "another" by

21

not raising it at any  at any stage in this Court,

22

in  either in its cert stage briefing or in the 

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was Majestic a separate

24

corporation or was it just the proprietorshipowned?

25

            MR. DAVIS:  The record is a little unclear

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

on that point.  The testimony, to the extent it shows

2

anything, shows that Majestic was an LLC and then it

3

became a corporation at some point later.  It's not

4

clear when.

5

            But I think the government didn't raise that

6

argument for a good reason, and that's because the

7

testimony also showed that Moreno and Mejia were the

8

sole owners of Majestic, and that there was no

9

difference between them in practical effect.

10

            So in  in practice, the money really came

11

from the  from Moreno and Mejia, not from 

12

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, Moreno and Mejia are

13

two  are two people; they're not the same person,

14

right?  So I assume even if it was  let's say it was a

15

partnership, they each would be entitled to half of the

16

money, right?

17

            MR. DAVIS:  I think that's  that's

18

correct.

19

            JUSTICE ALITO:  So Moreno could conspire

20

with Ocasio to obtain money from Mejia and Mejia

21

could conspire with Ocasio to obtain money from Moreno.

22

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I don't think that

23

that theory works in this case because the bribes came

24

from them jointly.  The payments came from them

25

together.  They  they were both aware of what each

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

other were doing and I think that they're

2

indistinguishable for purposes of this.

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Did this government argue

4

this proposition as its theory of the case in the trial

5

court or here?

6

            MR. DAVIS:  No, not that theory of the case,

7

Your Honor.

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you acknowledge that

9

the  that the police officer is  is guilty of a

10

violation of the Hobbs Act, never mind the conspiracy,

11

but just the Hobbs Act violation.

12

            MR. DAVIS:  We're not directly challenging

13

that here, Your Honor.

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, if you don't  if

15

you don't challenge that here, I  as I recall, your

16

briefs say that to disagree with you in this case is to

17

establish a Federal law of bribery for the whole

18

country.  But it seems to me you  you have that once

19

you  once you acknowledge that, never mind the

20

conspiracy charge, but just the substantive Hobbs Act

21

charge.  That's a national bribery law, isn't it?

22

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Scalia, on one side of

23

the transaction, yes, on the public official side of the

24

transaction.  But this Court in Evans did not 

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, that's all you need

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

to have a national law against bribery, it seems to me.

2

You just get one of the two, I don't think you have to

3

get both.

4

            MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, if  if this

5

Court were to extend Evans in this case to cover not

6

only the public official side of the transaction but

7

also the private citizen side of the transaction, that

8

would be a dramatic expansion of the law of bribery.  I

9

mean, Evans may or may not have been  have been

10

correct, but I think it was the highwater mark, and the

11

Court has been careful not to  not to extend it even

12

further in the years since.

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about  what

14

do you do with the government's argument that Ocasio was

15

conspiring with other police officers to get the money

16

from another?  In other words, that conspiracy got money

17

from another, the  the two individuals.

18

            MR. DAVIS:  Two responses to that, Your

19

Honor.  The first is that under the jury instructions,

20

the jury could have convicted Ocasio based on a

21

conspiracy solely between him and the repair shop

22

owners, and under this Court's decision in Skilling, if

23

a  if the jury could have returned a legallyinvalid

24

verdict, the conviction has to be reversed.

25

            And I think that's a sufficient answer to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

the question, but my second answer is that we disagree

2

with the government that there was sufficient evidence

3

in the record linking Ocasio with other police officers.

4

The evidence showed only that these police officers were

5

generally aware of what each other were doing.  It

6

didn't show that they formed an agreement to work

7

together.  And under this Court's decision in Kotteakos,

8

it was a hubandspokes conspiracy without the rim

9

enclosing the spokes.

10

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think if I'm

11

remembering the government's response to your first

12

point, is that it certainly would have been harmless

13

error in this case.

14

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I find that response

15

a little difficult to understand.  The  the trial

16

overwhelmingly focused on linking Ocasio with Moreno and

17

Mejia, not with other police officers.  The vast

18

majority of the testimony was about Moreno and Mejia

19

forming an agreement with Ocasio.

20

            The government's whole case went through

21

Moreno and Mejia.  And the government would have had a

22

much more difficult case if it had to prove an agreement

23

between police officers to obtain property from Moreno

24

and Mejia.  There just wasn't that much evidence of such

25

an agreement.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

            Everything, again, went through that, hub of

2

Moreno and Mejia.  So it's hard for me to imagine that

3

it would have been harmless error, let alone that the

4

jury would even have convicted if it had been instructed

5

that it had to find an agreement between multiple police

6

officers.

7

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Is there any difference

8

to your argument based on the government's position that

9

your client was charged under the general conspiracy

10

statute and not the Hobbs Act statute?

11

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Sotomayor, no, I don't

12

think it makes a difference.  The general conspiracy

13

statute just leads  just leads the government straight

14

back to the Hobbs Act.  It punishes each person who

15

conspires to commit an offense against the

16

United States.  The offense gets against the

17

United States here is Hobbs Act extortion.  One of its

18

elements is obtaining the property from another, so I

19

think the general conspiracy statute it leads right back

20

to the Hobbs Act in just maybe an extra step.

21

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  That's my problem, which

22

is it's not an extra step.  You can conspire, if not

23

every  you started by saying that not every

24

conspirator has to be  commit the  of every element

25

of the crime.  So why can't the general conspiracy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

statute do the work?

2

            MR. DAVIS:  Well, under the general

3

conspiracy statute, just like under the Hobbs Act, Your

4

Honor, every conspirator has to specifically intend that

5

someone commit every element of the crime.  I think

6

that's been 

7

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, is that  that

8

begs Justice Kagan's question, which is they wanted

9

Ocasio  they wanted the police officer to act under

10

color of right and to take the bribe.

11

            MR. DAVIS:  And I think the key problem with

12

that, Your Honor, is that the repair shop owners did not

13

intend to help Ocasio obtain property from another.

14

They intended to help Ocasio obtain property from

15

themselves.  And I think that's why there's not a unity

16

of purpose here.

17

            I mean, all  everyone may have agreed on

18

the same course of conduct, like the government says.

19

And I think the only way the government can make its

20

interpretation sound plausible is by obscuring the words

21

"from another."

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, I don't think that's

23

right.  The "from another" is clearly an element of the

24

substantive offense.  But you're saying it should also

25

be a freestanding limit on the conspiracy offense, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

there's no reason for that to be true.  It is, of

2

course, right that somebody has to obtain property from

3

another, but the conspiracy offense is made out if two

4

people agree that somebody should obtain property from

5

another.  And that's exactly the situation here.

6

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I think that, again,

7

the repair shop owners did not intend to obtain property

8

from another.  And  and I think the way that 

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  They intended and they

10

agreed that Mr. Ocasio should obtain property from

11

another.  And that's all they have to do.

12

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I think going back

13

to how that kind of conversation would happen in

14

ordinary English is a way to see why it's not plausible

15

to read the statute like that.

16

            If the repair shop owners go to Ocasio and

17

say, I want to help you obtain property from another,

18

Ocasio would think that they're talking about someone

19

else.  I think the government's interpretation is much

20

more formalistic.

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  It's a statute, and the

22

statute just says the other has to be somebody different

23

from Ocasio himself.  So in this particular case, the

24

somebody other is the people who are in the agreement.

25

In another case, the somebody other might be somebody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

who is outside the agreement.  The statute just 

2

the  the substantive law says it has to be from

3

another.

4

            The conspiracy  and this is just  it's

5

consistent with Salinas, it's consistent with Holt, it's

6

consistent with everything we've ever said about

7

conspiracy law  is that it just has to be an agreement

8

for somebody to do that substantive offense even if the

9

people agree and can't do it themselves.

10

            And it's true, the people agreeing can't do

11

it themselves.  They can't obtain property from another.

12

But Mr. Ocasio can, and they're agreeing that he should.

13

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, even if that's a

14

plausible interpretation of the statute, which we don't

15

think it is, it's definitely not the most natural way to

16

read it.  If you talk to any  any nonlawyer about the

17

statute, they would  they would say that if you agree

18

to form  if you agree to obtain property from another,

19

you'd be talking about someone outside the conspiracy.

20

            And, you know, the government's

21

interpretation also requires you to figure out how

22

someone can conspire to obtain their own consent.  It

23

requires shifting perspectives as you navigate your way

24

through the statute.  And I think that our

25

interpretation is  is much more consistent with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

way people would actually talk about this offense.

2

            I mean, in some form 

3

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about aiding and

4

abetting?  Could the brothers who own the body shop,

5

could they  could they be charged with aiding and

6

abetting 

7

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Ginsburg 

8

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:   the extortion?

9

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

10

that they could.  I think the same textual problem would

11

exist for aiding and abetting liability.  18 U.S.C. 2 is

12

the general aiding and abetting statute, and it leads

13

you straight back to the Hobbs Act in the same way that

14

the general conspiracy statute does.  So I don't  I

15

don't think so.

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is it  is it extortion or

17

attempted extortion?  If two brothers, as here, try to

18

get money from a third party and the third party really

19

wants to give them the money  say, for example, he

20

wants to give them the money because he's going to

21

illustrate how awful the police are in that town.  Or he

22

gives them the money because he thinks it's funny.  Or

23

he gives them the money  is that extortion?

24

            Because I'm having trouble distinguishing

25

between why it should be extortion but not conspiracy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

for extortion, because that's what you're aiming at.

2

You're prepared to say, okay, it's extortion.  Well, if

3

it's extortion, you've heard all the arguments and why

4

can't these other people commit it and you're simply

5

helping them.  But is it extortion?

6

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, this Court has

7

defined extortion in Evans to mean  to basically mean

8

when a public official takes a bribe, and, you know, we

9

take that holding as a given.

10

            JUSTICE BREYER:  He takes a bribe, all

11

right?  Is it  is it a bribe when the person just

12

showers him with money, hoping for nothing illegal?

13

            MR. DAVIS:  No.

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  He might think it's a

15

bribe, but  but is it?

16

            MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, there has 

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  He voluntarily gives him

18

the money expecting joy and happiness.  I mean, you see,

19

that's where it seems to me the odd part of the case

20

lies.

21

            MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, I think if he

22

just gave him  showered him with gifts not expecting

23

anything, it would not be extortion because there has to

24

be a quid pro quo.  The money has to be paid in return

25

for specific official acts.  So that would not be an act

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

of 

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So if bribe,

3

then we're back  if bribery is extortion, then why

4

isn't conspiracy to commit bribery conspiracy to commit

5

extortion?  We're back where we began.  The odd thing is

6

in calling bribery extortion.  Once you cross that

7

bridge  that's where we started.  But we're back  in

8

my mind, it sort of got back where we started.  And

9

you're trying to drive a wedge there, and all your

10

arguments seem to be me, really, to be aimed at why are

11

we calling bribery extortion?

12

            MR. DAVIS:  I don't 

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Because they are showering

14

with money.  They love it.

15

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, we're not taking

16

direct aim at Evans.  And I don't 

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that, but, I mean,

18

how you're asking me to make that distinction, how do I

19

do it?

20

            MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, I think Evans

21

dealt with a substantive offense, and this case deals

22

with conspiracy.  And when you overlay a conspiratorial

23

agreement on top of a substantive offense, it just stops

24

making sense grammatically to talk about the offense the

25

way the government does.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

            Again, when two people reach an agreement

2

that one will pay the other one a bribe, it just  it

3

doesn't make sense of ordinary English to say that

4

they're agreeing to obtain property from someone else,

5

from another.

6

            I also think  you know, I don't want the

7

phrase "with his consent" to get lost here also.  The

8

Hobbs Act punishes the obtaining of property with his 

9

from another with his consent.  And as Judge Sutton

10

explained in  in the Brock decision, how can someone

11

conspire  how would or why  how could or why would

12

someone conspire to obtain their own consent?  So even

13

if you don't agree with us on the  on the "from

14

another" language, I think the "with his consent"

15

language does it as well.

16

            And then the other textual point 

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, before  I

18

mean, the government says, of course, is there's 

19

there's consent and there's consent, and they suggest

20

that there's a difference between consent and

21

conspiracy.  Right?

22

            MR. DAVIS:  Right.

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, what's your

24

answer to that?

25

            MR. DAVIS:  Well, we agree with that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

Your Honor.  We think that there are plenty of instances

2

of consent under the Hobbs Act that would not be a

3

conspiratorial agreement.  But it's hard to see what

4

payment of a bribe would not be a conspiratorial

5

agreement under the government's theory.  Maybe there's

6

some narrow category of cases where the bribe pair is

7

just acquiescing to an official demand as it 

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And what payment of a bribe

9

is not extortion?

10

            MR. DAVIS:  I  I agree, Your Honor.  I

11

think 

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  So the only

13

ground, then, we could say is say, well, they went just

14

up to the limit of the logic in the other case, and

15

we're just not going to be logical to extend it further.

16

            MR. DAVIS:  I think 

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is that 

18

            MR. DAVIS:  I don't think that's quite

19

right, Your Honor.

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Works for me.

21

            (Laughter.)

22

            MR. DAVIS:  I  I think that is a ground,

23

Your Honor.  I don't think it's the only ground.

24

            I think the other ground would be the plain

25

text of the statute.  I mean, Evans  in Evans, the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

the government didn't have the same textual problem that

2

it has in this case.  The government didn't have to

3

grapple with the "from another" language.  And in this

4

case, "from another" most naturally means someone

5

outside the  the conspiracy.

6

            The other point  textual point I'd like

7

to 

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Davis, if you could go

9

back to what you just said about the consent.  I mean,

10

look, I mean, Evans makes perfectly clear that bribes

11

and kickbacks are included in this statute.  And  and

12

there is a difference between  there  there are

13

cases in which somebody participates in a kickback

14

scheme and does not consent.

15

            I mean, suppose some public official comes

16

in and says, in order for me to give you a license to do

17

something, to be, you know, a member of some profession,

18

let's say a cosmetologist, you need to pay me $20 as a

19

kickback.  And the person, you know, pays him $20

20

because you've got to get your license.  But there's no

21

way in the world in which that would count as a

22

conspiratorial agreement.  It would count as consent

23

under the Hobbs Act.

24

            So there's a big gap between consent and a

25

conspiratorial agreement, even in the context of bribes.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, I don't disagree

2

with you, but with an asterisk.  I think there is a gray

3

area there where someone just acquiesces to an official

4

demand like you're saying.  Those may not be

5

conspiratorial agreements.  But I think still, there is

6

a large category of bribery cases that would  would

7

still be conspiratorial agreements under the

8

government's theory, anytime someone, like in Salinas,

9

pays a bribe in exchange for official action and wasn't

10

required to do so.

11

            So I think still the government's theory

12

would render some of the language in 666 unnecessary.

13

You know, 18 U.S.C. 666 has specific monetary thresholds

14

put on when a bribe is a Federal crime.  And the  and

15

none of  the bribe has to be over $5,000.  The State

16

official has to work for an agency that receives $10,000

17

or more in Federal funds.  And I think in a lot of those

18

cases, the government could just avoid those limitations

19

by charging the case as a conspiracy to commit extortion

20

under the Hobbs Act.

21

            And that's even though there may be a

22

category of cases that would not be a conspiratorial

23

agreement, but that would be consent under the Hobbs

24

Act.

25

            On one more textual point, Your Honors, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

statute also punishes whoever conspires to obtain

2

property from another, which, I think, reinforces our

3

reading that the "whoever" who obtains the property has

4

to be a different person from the "another" from whom

5

property is obtained.

6

            And I think the general conspiracy statute

7

gets to the same place by just a slightly more

8

circuitous route.  It punishes each person who conspires

9

to commit any offense against the United States.

10

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Is it fair to say that you

11

are advancing an argument that is limited to the precise

12

language of the Hobbs Act?  You  you are not taking

13

issue with the proposition that a person can conspire to

14

commit offense that the person could not personally

15

commit.  And you distinguish the Hobbs Act from the

16

Mann Act because one refers to "any" and another refers

17

to "another."

18

            So is it fair to say that what you want is a

19

special conspiracy rule that applies only in cases of

20

Hobbs Act conspiracies?

21

            MR. DAVIS:  No, Your Honor.  I think that

22

what we're asking for is just to apply the language of

23

the general conspiracy statute in light of the words

24

from another in the Hobbs Act.  And when you put the two

25

together 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

            JUSTICE ALITO:  And if another substantive

2

offense doesn't have the word "obtain property from" 

3

the phrase "obtain property from another," then your 

4

your rule doesn't apply?

5

            MR. DAVIS:  I think that's generally right,

6

Your Honor.  Our textual arguments would not apply.  I

7

think there would still be an issue of, you know,

8

there's a  there's a principle that when the

9

substantive offense requires the  necessarily requires

10

agreement, you're not supposed to add a conspiracy

11

charge on that, but that's just a presumption.  I think

12

you're right that our  our textual argument would

13

not  would not apply in the absence of the words

14

"another," "with his consent," and "whoever."

15

            I'd like  if there are no further

16

questions, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

18

            Mr. Kedem.

19

              ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM

20

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

            MR. KEDEM:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

22

please the Court:

23

            A conspiracy is an agreement to commit an

24

offense against the United States, that is, a joint

25

commitment to a plan that, if completed, would satisfy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

all elements of the substantive offense.  And while all

2

conspirators must agree on that goal, no particular

3

member of the conspiracy must agree that he, himself,

4

will commit all or even any of the substantive elements

5

of the offense.

6

            And so you don't ask whether all

7

conspirators or the conspiracy as a whole agreed to

8

obtain property from another any more than you would ask

9

whether the conspiracy as a whole acted under color of

10

official right.

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do  do you agree that

12

under your approach, every private individual who seeks

13

to bribe a State official is liable for conspiracy to

14

commit Hobbs Act extortion?

15

            MR. KEDEM:  We don't.  And that's because of

16

active participation.

17

            Let me explain where that comes from and

18

then how it applies to this case.

19

            Holte and Gebardi concerned the Mann Act,

20

which prohibited the transportation of a woman across

21

State lines for immoral purposes.  And the question was

22

whether a woman who was transported could conspire to

23

violate the Act.

24

            In answering that question, the Court

25

focused on two things.  First of all, although the Act

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

contemplates the involvement of the woman, it doesn't

2

impose substantive criminal liability on her.  And,

3

second, some minimal form of agreement is an inherent

4

feature of most instances of the offense.

5

            Based on those two factors, the Court said,

6

if that's all there is, if the only thing that the woman

7

agrees to is to the transportation itself, that is, the

8

bare outlines of the crime, that by itself would be

9

insufficient to make her a conspirator.  But if she were

10

to agree to do more  if, for instance, she were to

11

purchase the tickets or to arrange the transportation in

12

some other way  then she could be a conspirator.

13

            And so in this case, with respect to a bribe

14

pair, if all the bribe pair agrees to do is turn over

15

money in return for official acts, that by itself would

16

be insufficient to make the bribe pair a conspirator.

17

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, suppose he arranges

18

to meet on the park bench at 2:00 o'clock, and has a

19

followup call to the official to please be there.  Is

20

that  does that suffice?

21

            MR. KEDEM:  I think that would be incidental

22

to the one thing that they're really agreeing to do,

23

which is to turn over the money.

24

            But contrast that with what happened in this

25

case.  Because Moreno and Mejia didn't just hand over an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

envelope with $100 bills in it.  They worked closely in

2

conjunction with police officers, including Petitioner.

3

            For instance, when Petitioner went to the

4

scene of an accident, he would call Moreno, and they

5

would talk about what cars were involved:  The make,

6

model, the year, what extent of damage was involved.

7

And then Moreno would consult with Petitioner about

8

which cars would be most lucrative to have in the shop.

9

            And so it wasn't simply a case of agreeing

10

to the bare outlines of the crime.  He agreed to

11

facilitate it in additional ways.

12

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you charge that

13

to a jury?

14

            MR. KEDEM:  Pardon?

15

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  How do you charge it to

16

a jury?

17

            MR. KEDEM:  I think you would tell the jury

18

two things.

19

            First, in order for a bribe pair to be a

20

conspirator, they have to agree to actively participate

21

in the plan.

22

            And second 

23

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, I mean, I'm a

24

juror and I say, I  police officer came to me, asked

25

me for 20 bucks, and he'll let me go for my ticket.  I'm

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

active participation.  That's what I'm thinking.

2

            MR. KEDEM:  The second one is that you would

3

have to tell the jury that if all you've agreed to do is

4

to turn over money in return for official acts, then

5

that by itself is insufficient.

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Okay.  That's lovely.  And

7

that  you know, that prevents this law from  Federal

8

law from hitting anybody who pays a bribe, which is

9

certainly a desirable result.

10

            But I don't see how it comports with your

11

theory of the case.  I mean, there is just as much of an

12

agreement between the two people to obtain money from

13

another, whether that other actively participates or

14

not.

15

            Where  where do you get this active

16

participation requirement from?

17

            MR. KEDEM:  Well 

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Except to make it up to

19

sweeten the deal, so that  so that we  we don't

20

extend this  this law too far.

21

            MR. KEDEM:  Active participation comes from

22

Holte and Gebardi, and it's also notable that the

23

government didn't make up the requirement for purposes

24

of this case.  The First, Second, Fourth, and Fifth

25

Circuits have used active participation in the context

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

of Hobbs Act extortion 

2

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And where did they get it

3

from?

4

            MR. KEDEM:  They get it from 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And where did Holte and

6

Gebardi get it from?

7

            MR. KEDEM:  I think Holte and Gebardi see it

8

as a gloss on the type of agreement that's necessary to

9

make a particular person a conspirator.

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that's not what

11

conspiracy law says.  It's any agreement.  If  if you

12

agree, you're  you're liable to conspiracy.  Where 

13

where do  can  can you hang on this active  is

14

there an active participation requirement for other

15

conspiracies?

16

            MR. KEDEM:  In this  in this Court's case

17

in Abuelhawa, which is cited at footnote 8 in our brief,

18

the Court also relied on Gebardi to raise the level of

19

facilitation that would be required for a drug purchaser

20

to be held liable for facilitating the sale of a drug.

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But I  I 

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is the  the

23

active participation point in the jury instructions?

24

            MR. KEDEM:  It's not in the jury

25

instructions because Petitioner never requested it,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

despite the fact that active participation was already

2

the law in the Fourth Circuit.

3

            I would also point out that it was

4

Petitioner's argument that it simply doesn't matter how

5

actively a bribe pair facilitates the extortion.

6

Moreover, there was no dispute in this case that Moreno

7

and Mejia made an active role.  In fact, it was

8

Petitioner's contention at trial that they were, in

9

fact, the masterminds of this scheme.

10

            Justice Scalia, if you don't like active

11

participation, then you would simply revert to the

12

common law standard in which agreeing to the outlines of

13

the crime would be sufficient, even if you were a bribe

14

pair.

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So if 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That makes sense to me.

17

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  If  if I could just

18

understand what you're saying, you think active

19

participation is more than an agreement along the

20

typical conspiracy lines.

21

            MR. KEDEM:  I think normally agreeing to the

22

bare outlines of the crime would be sufficient for most

23

conspirators.  I think 

24

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Would  would?

25

            MR. KEDEM:  Would, that's correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

            But I think active participation is a way to

2

raise the threshold 

3

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Right.  But 

4

            MR. KEDEM:   certain types of crimes.

5

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   this does sound more like

6

an aiding and abetting standard than it does a

7

conspiracy standard, because typically in conspiracy we

8

say it doesn't really matter if you actively

9

participate, as long as you reach an agreement.

10

            MR. KEDEM:  I 

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now that agreement is more

12

than acquiescence, right?  It's more than I reluctantly

13

give you the bribe that you're demanding of me.

14

            MR. KEDEM:  That's right.

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But  but I guess I'm with

16

Justice Scalia that I don't really quite understand how

17

to get from the typical real agreement that we require

18

in conspiracy cases to some higher standard with respect

19

to this crime of active participation.

20

            MR. KEDEM:  I think it's a gloss on what you

21

have to agree to do in order to be considered a

22

conspirator.  So it's true that the agreement itself is

23

what's criminal when it comes to a conspiracy, whereas

24

with aiding and abetting, it's acts.  And I think it's a

25

similar inquiry.  With aiding and abetting, you act 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

you ask:  Did you actively participate in the crime?

2

And with conspiracy, you ask:  Did you agree to actively

3

participate in the crime?

4

            If I could attack  if I could refer to my

5

friend's argument about unity of purpose, he's correct

6

that there does need to be a unity of purpose, but he's

7

incorrect as to what that purpose needs to be.

8

            Under Salinas, all members of the conspiracy

9

must agree on a plan that is an offense against the

10

United States; that is, an offense, a plan that, if

11

completed, would satisfy all elements of the substantive

12

offense.

13

            And Petitioner says Evans was the highwater

14

mark in interpreting the Hobbs Act.  But the 

15

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The  the answer, as I

16

understand this now, the purpose of this active

17

participation doctrine is let's look at the substantive

18

offense.  And all of a sudden we're saying every

19

policeman, every State official, everyone in the country

20

who goes to any person and says, give me some money for

21

my position, they're already guilty.  That already is

22

extortion on this case that we've been talking about

23

before, right?

24

            MR. KEDEM:  That's right.

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

            MR. KEDEM:  But 

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So now what you're going to

3

do is you're going to make not only them guilty of the

4

Federal crime, you're going to make anybody who pays

5

them guilty of the Federal crime.  That's the purpose of

6

this case.

7

            Now you say don't worry about it, because

8

there's situation A and situation B.

9

            In situation A, the policeman is the heavy,

10

and all the victim's done is stop at the traffic light.

11

He says, give me the money, and that's a bribe, all

12

right?  He's a bad guy, the policeman; the victim is not

13

so bad.

14

            But in the other case, the victim says, I

15

love it, like these people, because we're really getting

16

money from the public.  That's what they're trying to

17

do  who are the real victims here, but they're not 

18

that's not charged that way.

19

            And that's what the active participation

20

thing is designed to do, separate the  the sort of

21

innocent victims who aren't policemen from the

22

cooperating victims who love the policemen to take the

23

money because they want the result; is that right?

24

            MR. KEDEM:  I think that's correct.  I

25

think 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  I've got it right so

2

far.

3

            MR. KEDEM:  That's 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The argument on his side is

5

don't make a bad situation worse.

6

            MR. KEDEM:  Well 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  We already are federalizing

8

vast numbers of State crimes, which really are the

9

States' business.  And now you're not necessarily

10

doubling the number, but you're increasing it by about

11

80 percent.  Now that  that's what I've got as a

12

practical argument that he's making.  And  and your

13

answer to that is, don't worry it's not your business.

14

It's just follow the logic.

15

            MR. KEDEM:  I think under active

16

participation, you wouldn't be doing that.

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I understand.

18

            MR. KEDEM:  I would also point 

19

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What I'm interested in is

20

if I understand it correctly.

21

            MR. KEDEM:  I think you do, Your Honor.

22

            I would also point out that the argument he

23

makes with regard to "from another" has nothing in

24

particular to do with the Hobbs Act.  It would apply any

25

time a statute uses phrases like "from another" or "to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

another."  And let me give you an example.

2

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, before you do,

3

I'm still stuck on the jury instructions.  You cite in

4

your brief language on Joint Appendix page 195 where the

5

judge says  I think these are the instructions.  Maybe

6

I'm wrong, but you cite them, where the judge says mere

7

knowledge or acquiescence without participation in the

8

unlawful plan is not sufficient.

9

            Is that  that's the language, I take it,

10

you're talking about with 

11

            MR. KEDEM:  That's 

12

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   "the jury was

13

instructed."

14

            MR. KEDEM:  That was given  given the

15

jury, but I think that's the standard conspiracy

16

instruction.

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, on page 194,

18

it says, "The extent of a defendant's participation has

19

no bearing on the issue of his guilt."  And I just

20

wondered whether your  it's active participation.

21

That suggests to me something that goes to the extent of

22

the defendant's participation.

23

            MR. KEDEM:  That's right.  A different

24

instruction would be given, but it's important to

25

emphasize that Petitioner did not appeal the failure to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

give a specific jury instruction.  He didn't request

2

one, and that was not the basis for appeal.  He had a

3

sufficiency of the evidence challenge on appeal, and

4

that's what's before this Court.

5

            Moreover, there is overwhelming evidence

6

that Moreno and Mejia did, in fact, actively

7

participate.  In fact, that was Petitioner's very theory

8

at trial.

9

            But let me give you an example of how

10

Petitioner's argument with regard to "from another" does

11

not necessarily only focus on the Hobbs Act.  Imagine

12

the for instance, there was a statute that said if you

13

steal from a bank while pointing a gun at another, it's

14

aggravated bank robbery.  And imagine a robber says to

15

his friend, you go into the bank ahead of me.  I'll run

16

in, point a gun at your head, and say, cashier give me

17

all of your money.

18

            According to Petitioner, that would not be

19

conspiracy, because judged  from the perspective of

20

the conspiracy as a whole, no gun was pointed at

21

another.  And at base, Petitioner's argument is that

22

every element of the substantive offense has to be

23

judged in a conspiracy from the perspective of the

24

conspiracy as a single, undifferentiated whole.

25

            A couple responses to that.  First of all,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

it's not even clear what that means; for instance, how

2

it could be that a conspiracy as a whole obtains

3

property under color of official right.

4

            Second of all, it contradicts the very

5

premise behind conspiracy liability, which is that

6

different members of the conspiracy agree to play

7

different roles, and it's only when you add those

8

various roles together that you get the completed

9

offense.

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I'm afraid you haven't

11

scared me.  I don't  I don't think that in the

12

situation you posit where  where the  the two gunmen

13

say you come into the bank with me and I'll point the

14

gun at your head and say, what, unless you cough up the

15

money, I'm going to shoot my friend.  I don't see why

16

that would be a conspiracy 

17

            MR. KEDEM:  I don't 

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   to point a gun at

19

another.

20

            MR. KEDEM:  I don't think, Justice Scalia,

21

you would say, give me the money or I'll kill my friend.

22

I think the friend would pretend to be a customer in the

23

bank.

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Sure.  But  well 

25

            MR. KEDEM:  And I think the two of them

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

would have formed the plan in order to accomplish the

2

aggravated robbery.

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And I would not think that

4

that's a conspiracy to point a gun at another.

5

            MR. KEDEM:  Well, Justice 

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's a conspiracy to point

7

a gun between themselves.

8

            MR. KEDEM:  Justice Scalia, I think that

9

only is true if you judge each element of the offense 

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  No, I understand 

11

            MR. KEDEM:   with regard to the

12

conspiracy.

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   but you were trying to

14

present a clear example.

15

            MR. KEDEM:  Sure.

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And it doesn't seem to me

17

very clear at all.

18

            MR. KEDEM:  Justice Scalia, we cite about a

19

half dozen other Federal statutes that also similarly

20

use phrases like "from another" and "to another" that

21

would be similarly affected by Petitioner's argument.

22

            I would also like to 

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But the other reason your

24

hypothetical doesn't work too well is we know that he's

25

not going to pull the gun because he's his friend, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

in this case the money is going to be given.  So it

2

doesn't work.

3

            MR. KEDEM:  Well, Justice Kennedy, I would

4

point you then to the statute that we cite that talks

5

about someone who is a government official who receives

6

coded, secret information from another and provides it

7

to another.  Petitioner's only response is there may be

8

some other statute that you could prosecute under in the

9

case in which the "from another" and "to another" are

10

both officials of other governments.  But what if there

11

are not?  What if they're officials  what if they're

12

members of a terrorist organization, for instance?

13

            I'd like to also address my friend's

14

argument with respect to the word "whoever" in

15

Subsection A.  I don't think it works for a couple

16

reasons.

17

            First of all, the word "whoever" in

18

Subsection A  and this is best addressed if looking

19

directly at the words of the statute at page 2a to the

20

appendix to our brief.  "Whoever," in Subsection (a), is

21

not the subject of the phrase "obtaining of property

22

from another" in Subsection (b)(2).  If it were, then no

23

private citizen could ever be member of a conspiracy

24

because no private citizen can obtain property from

25

another under color of official right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

            Instead, the word "whoever" is the subject

2

of the phrase "obstructs, delays, or affects commerce"

3

by extortion or agrees or conspires so to do.  And to

4

give you an example of how that can be affected, even if

5

you yourself are not the person who commits the

6

extortion, imagine a case of robbery in which there is a

7

central organizer who brings together robbers who have

8

various skills and gives them a plan but doesn't himself

9

intend to participate in the robbery.  In that case, he

10

would have conspired to obstruct, delay, or affect

11

commerce by robbery, even though he himself would not be

12

committing robbery.

13

            And the same is true with respect to

14

extortion.  Moreno and Mejia were part of a plan which

15

they actively facilitated that obstructed, delayed, and

16

affected commerce by extortion.

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, is it  if 

18

what  I'm still  a crime requires that the victim

19

give consent.  Now, what kind of  it could be

20

obtaining consent to do something.  Smith obtains

21

consent to do something.  The victim agrees with Smith

22

to participate in that crime.  But in agreeing to do it,

23

he is giving consent.  So from that point on, there is

24

no further consent to be given.  So it's like robbing

25

the pocket of a stone idol or some  what used to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

called in law school  once the consent is given.

2

            So maybe he is agreeing to participate in a

3

conspiracy to attempt to get the consent.  But he's

4

agreeing to the  he gives the consent at the moment he

5

agrees.

6

            MR. KEDEM:  Justice Breyer 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So how can you be

8

conspiring to  to do something to get a consent that

9

was already given?

10

            MR. KEDEM:  Justice Breyer 

11

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You could conspire to

12

attempt to get it, but not to get it, if you're being

13

really picky on these words.

14

            MR. KEDEM:  The issue of consent is really a

15

red herring in this case, because as my friend just

16

stated, consent from the common law for extortion falls

17

well below the meeting of the minds that you would need

18

for conspiratorial agreement.  And that much is made

19

clear by the fact that even in cases of coercive

20

extortion, that is extortion induced by wrongful use of

21

actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, you would

22

still need consent.

23

            And so the type of agreement that we're

24

talking about, with or without the active participation

25

requirement, is well above the threshold for consent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

under the common law.

2

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You haven't talked

3

about Majestic yet, and your friend said that's maybe

4

because you had never raised that below.  Is that  is

5

that true?  In other words, the Majestic is the other

6

from which the funds are going to be obtained?

7

            MR. KEDEM:  That's not accurate.  It was

8

raised in the trial court.  The trial court made a

9

ruling that Majestic was also another, and the court of

10

appeals decided not to adopt that argument.  We haven't

11

pursued it in this Court.

12

            I would also point out 

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Was that just  was

14

that in your brief in opposition to certiorari?

15

            MR. KEDEM:  We talked about the fact that in

16

this case you could look at Majestic as another, and we

17

talked about that in the context of the Brock case out

18

of the Sixth Circuit, but we're not 

19

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is Majestic a sole

20

proprietorship?

21

            MR. KEDEM:  It started out as an LLC, but

22

became a corporation, as cited in footnote 1 of our

23

brief.

24

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Was it indicted as part

25

of this crime?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

            MR. KEDEM:  It wasn't indicted, but it was

2

in the indictment stated that money came from Majestic.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  You do say in your brief

4

that if we adopt the Petitioner's argument, that

5

basically you would never have any cases.  But I'm not

6

sure that's right.  For example, the most common

7

situation is the New York City permitting official.

8

Generally, they agree with developers to have

9

contractors pay them a bribe to expedite their work.

10

That, you could prosecute because two people are

11

agreeing to get money from another, the contractors.

12

Those situations are not so unusual.

13

            MR. KEDEM:  I don't 

14

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I think, as one of my

15

colleagues said, there was a conspiracy here to get

16

money from the victims.

17

            MR. KEDEM:  I don't think, Justice

18

Sotomayor, that our argument is you would never have

19

instances in which the conspiracy provision would apply.

20

I think what we're saying is, this is precisely the type

21

of scenario in which conspiracy liability should attach.

22

And I think there may be a sense by some that clever

23

prosecutors, maybe in some cases, are pushing the bounds

24

of conspiracy law beyond where they're  traditionally

25

have gone, and using it in ways that perhaps are not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

warranted.

2

            Whatever the merits of that criticism as a

3

general matter, this is not that case.  The criminal

4

conspiracy in this case was a durable, multifaceted,

5

criminal enterprise that had a division of labor and

6

succeeded over the course of several years in committing

7

not only numerous acts of extortion, but other forms of

8

illegality as well.

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You had no other substantive

10

crime to charge against the brothers?

11

            MR. KEDEM:  The brothers also pled guilty to

12

aiding and abetting extortion which, under Petitioner's

13

theory, would not have been possible.

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why didn't you just charge

15

them with getting money from the customers?  I mean,

16

that's who  they're conspiring  after all, they're

17

giving $150 to the policeman.  They aren't

18

philanthropists.  They think they're going to get that

19

money back from the people whose cars are wrecked.

20

            MR. KEDEM:  That's correct.  They could

21

also 

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So those are the other

23

people.  I mean, this is really a conspiracy on behalf

24

of the policeman and the  and the owner of the repair

25

shop to get money from a customer, a person whose car

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

was wrecked.  That's why they do it; isn't it?

2

            MR. KEDEM:  That is true, Justice Breyer,

3

but they didn't necessarily commit a crime against the

4

customer if all they did is repair the customer's car.

5

Now, they did also commit various forms of insurance

6

fraud, but put that to the side.

7

            In this scheme, if all they did was get

8

money from a customer and fix the car as promised, then

9

they would not have committed a crime necessarily

10

against the customer.

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, indeed, isn't it right

12

that what Justice Breyer is saying was the very theory

13

behind Evans, why this was extortion, is because the

14

real crime was to the public at large, not to any

15

particular customer.  But yes, there was a crime to

16

the  the general public.

17

            MR. KEDEM:  That's correct.  The victim in

18

cases of extortion is not necessarily the person who

19

pays the bribe, who might do so willingly and might do

20

so in order to get something from the public official.

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And the Federal

22

government's interest in this case, right, the

23

reason is  is, what?

24

            MR. KEDEM:  Well, Justice Scalia 

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That automobiles are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

instruments of interstate commerce?

2

            MR. KEDEM:  Justice Scalia, I think Evans

3

settled that the mere receipt of a bribe in return for

4

performing officials acts is, in fact, extortion.  And I

5

don't think that's at issue here.

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, oh, it doesn't have to

7

be any  any Federal constitutional authority, just 

8

            MR. KEDEM:  There does have the to be

9

constitutional authority.

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Well, what is it?  I mean,

11

here, it is  I assume that it's automobiles.

12

            MR. KEDEM:  That's  well, Justice Scalia,

13

it's affecting commerce and there was evidence at trial

14

that, for instance, insurance payments came from out of

15

State.  And that was specifically used to  to show the

16

affecting commerce element.

17

            I would also point out that if you were

18

simply to charge Petitioner with three isolated

19

instances of extortion, of the substantive act of

20

extortion, it would not reflect the full range of his

21

misconduct because, again, he didn't simply receive

22

money and then refer cars for it.  He worked closely in

23

conjunction with Moreno and Mejia.

24

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You  you agree

25

with your friend's point, though, that charging the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

conspiracy gives the prosecutor considerably broader

2

range in the evidence that he wants to admit at trial?

3

            MR. KEDEM:  I think that that does sometimes

4

happen, but that's a general principle that has no

5

specific relation to the argument that Petitioner is

6

making in this case.

7

            JUSTICE ALITO:  What is the relationship

8

between that argument and the question of whether

9

there's a conspiracy between Ocasio and Moreno and

10

Mejia?  It might apply to the conspiracy between  the

11

alleged conspiracy between Ocasio and the other police

12

officers because it  although it could allow the 

13

make it easier to admit evidence of what the other

14

police officers did.

15

            MR. KEDEM:  That's right.

16

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But what  it has no 

17

whether or not there was a conspiracy between Ocasio and

18

Moreno and Mejia doesn't seem to me to have anything 

19

anything to do with what evidence would be admissible at

20

trial.

21

            MR. KEDEM:  That's right, Justice Alito.

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you

23

told me that was wrong.  I thought you told me you

24

agreed with your friend that it gives broader scope to

25

the range of evidence that could be admitted beyond

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

charging simply the substantive offense.

2

            MR. KEDEM:  It does  it does,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, but that would still have been true

4

even if Moreno and Mejia were not charged as

5

coconspirators because there was voluminous evidence 

6

and we cited in the last portion of our brief  that

7

Petitioner conspired with other police officers as well.

8

For instance, he was recruited into the scheme by

9

another police officer, probably Officer Rodriguez, who

10

was indicted along with him.

11

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Do you  do you

12

agree that the most that that gets you is a remand to

13

address the Skilling question?

14

            MR. KEDEM:  We don't.  We don't.  Skilling

15

was an issue about jury instructions.  And, again,

16

Petitioner's challenge in the court of appeals as it 

17

and as it comes to this Court is not about the jury

18

instructions.

19

            I would point you instead to Griffin v.

20

United States, 502 U.S. 46, which talks about

21

sufficiency challenges, which is what this is.

22

            And if you look at that evidence, not only

23

was Petitioner recruited by other officers, he himself

24

tried to recruit other officers into this scene.  For

25

instance, trying to set up his own referral network.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

            Moreover, there was evidence that he and

2

Officer Rodriguez worked together on at least one

3

occasion to bring a car into Majestic.

4

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And  and is it a

5

sufficiency  I would have thought it's a statutory

6

interpretation challenge and not simply a sufficiency of

7

the evidence challenge.

8

            MR. KEDEM:  Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

9

think there was a specific instruction to the jury one

10

way or another about whether they either could or

11

couldn't find it just based on Moreno and Mejia.  And as

12

a result, because there was a general verdict, you don't

13

know specifically whether the jury relied on Moreno and

14

Mejia alone or whether they also relied on other

15

officers.

16

            And under that circumstance, I think Griffin

17

says it's a  just a general sufficiency challenge.

18

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, on that I

19

guess your  your friend says that the whole thrust of

20

the case you presented was based on the conspiracy

21

between the two brothers and the officer rather than the

22

spokes, I guess is the jargon, involving the different

23

officers with Ocasio.  Is that true?

24

            MR. KEDEM:  We don't think that's true.  I

25

would refer you to all of the evidence we cite in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

last section of our brief.  This was the way it was

2

indicted.  The indictment itself said that Petitioner

3

conspired with other officers.

4

            It was also specifically cited in the

5

closing argument to the jury, that they were able to

6

find that he had conspired with other officers.  And

7

there was a great deal of evidence that he did so.

8

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Isn't that just harmless

9

error, assuming we agree with your  your  with the

10

Petitioner and say the other has to be somebody else?

11

            MR. KEDEM:  We don't think that it's

12

harmless error, but I do take your point that it's an

13

alternative grounds for holding for the government.

14

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So you think it's

15

sufficiency?

16

            MR. KEDEM:  I do.  I think that's what

17

Griffin v. United States says.

18

            If there are no further questions.

19

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

20

            Mr. Davis, you have four minutes remaining.

21

           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ETHAN P. DAVIS

22

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

23

            MR. DAVIS:  Thank you.  I'll start with my

24

friend's Griffin point.  We directly challenged the jury

25

instructions in our brief in this Court and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

government did not raise any sort of argument that this

2

was just a sufficiency case there, so I think that is

3

water under the bridge.  But 

4

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But did you challenge the

5

instructions in the district court as well?

6

            MR. DAVIS:  We challenged the jury

7

instructions in the district court, yes, Your Honor.

8

There was an objection raised to the government's

9

proposed instructions there.

10

            I'd like to turn to the active participant

11

standard.  We agree with Justice Scalia that the active

12

participant standard doesn't come from anything in the

13

statute or anything in basic principles of conspiracy

14

law.  Conspiracy just requires an agreement and

15

sometimes an overt act, and this active participant

16

standard doesn't map on well to that at all.

17

            The government  the cases that the

18

government cites that supposedly apply, Holte and

19

Gebardi to  to Hobbs Act prosecutions really dealt

20

with aiding and abetting, not with conspiracy.  And it's

21

much easier to see how the active participant standard

22

applies in the context of aiding and abetting, which

23

requires acts beyond mere agreement.

24

            But in the context of conspiracy, the only

25

court really to have applied the active participant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

standard to conspiracy in any, in any significant way

2

was the Fourth Circuit in the Spitler decision.

3

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Will you, in your answer,

4

get to what I think is the main point; the main point

5

being, look, two policemen and a shop owner.  The

6

policemen say, give us money and we'll help you out

7

later.  That's extortion.  All right.

8

            If that's extortion, then why isn't it

9

conspiracy when, three weeks before they meet and bit by

10

bit say, we will do that very thing which is

11

extortion 

12

            MR. DAVIS:  I think 

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:   the shopkeeper is

14

helping the policemen do what is the thing that counts

15

as extortion and, therefore, he's conspired with them.

16

That's their very simple argument.  A simple answer is?

17

            MR. DAVIS:  The simple answer is that's not

18

consistent with how  with ordinary English, Your

19

Honor.  When two people  when the repair shop owners

20

go to the public official and say, I'd like to help you

21

obtain property from another 

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes.  The "other" 

23

"another" means another other than the two policemen.

24

            MR. DAVIS:  Only if 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's  that's what this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

other case says.  And the law says that it's another 

2

another other than them.

3

            MR. DAVIS:  I think the only way the

4

government can make that sound plausible is by adding

5

words to the statute 

6

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no, no words.  Another.

7

Another.  Joe and Bill are the policemen; Sam is the

8

shopkeeper.  In the substantive crime, the other,

9

another, means not the two policemen; it means Sam.  And

10

Sam, two weeks earlier, helped and conspired with the

11

two policemen to get money from another; namely, Sam.

12

            MR. DAVIS:  And 

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Odd, but English.

14

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Breyer, I think the

15

words "namely Sam" are doing all the work there.  If you

16

cut out the words "namely Sam," all of a sudden it

17

doesn't make sense anymore.  If he goes to the police

18

officers and says, let me help you obtain property from

19

another, you need to add words to the statute in order

20

for that to make sense.

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Davis, I don't think you

22

need to add words.  What you need is to shift

23

perspective.  There is a difference here, but that's the

24

difference, that the government is insisting that you

25

look at it from the perspective of the person who, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

this case, is doing the acts of obtaining property from

2

another.  And you are insisting that it be looked at

3

from the perspective of the person who has agreed to

4

help him do that.

5

            But there's no reason under standard

6

conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the

7

agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator.

8

            MR. DAVIS:  Justice Kagan, with respect, I

9

don't agree with that.  I think that under standard

10

conspiracy law, you look at the perspective of both.

11

You have to have a unity of purpose with each

12

conspirator to do the same thing.

13

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  There absolutely is a unity

14

of purpose, that one person should do the crime.

15

            MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor 

16

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Go ahead.

17

            MR. DAVIS:  With the unity of  there

18

may  that obscures the words "from another" from the

19

statute.  There may be a unity of purpose that they all

20

do something, but it begs the question about whether the

21

something that they're doing violates every element of

22

the offense.

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

24

            The case is submitted.

25
