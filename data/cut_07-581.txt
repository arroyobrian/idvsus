CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 07-581, 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett.
Mr. Salvatore.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL SALVATORE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. SALVATORE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

9

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

There are three reasons why this Court

11

should reverse the Second Circuit's blanket ban on

12

collectively bargained, arbitral forum -- forum

13

selection clauses.

14

First, the Second Circuit ignored section

15

(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, by which

16

Congress empowered unions to bargain on behalf of their

17

employees over anything germane to the working

18

environment, including methods of workplace dispute

19

resolution.

20

The forum in which an ADEA claim is heard

21

falls squarely in that authority.

Indeed, forbidding

22

unions from bargaining about the procedural right to an

23

arbitral forum will carve a judicial exception into the

24

labor law permitting employers to bypass the union and

25

deal directly with their employees, defeating Congress's
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

national labor policy.

2

Second, the Second Circuit failed to

3

consider Congress's strong endorsement of workplace

4

arbitration contained in both the FAA and section 301.

5

Third, the Second Circuit erroneously and

6

exclusively relied on Alexander versus Gardner-Denver.

7

Gardner-Denver is a case about claim preclusion, not

8

about enforcing an agreement to arbitrate a statutory

9

claim.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Salvatore, you take the

11

position that the only thing that is at stake here is

12

simply, in effect, a selection of the arbitral forum.

13

What do you -- what do you say to the

14

argument that, in fact, the -- under -- under the

15

collective bargaining agreement the employee is subject

16

not merely to the right of the union to choose the

17

arbitral forum, but, in fact, to -- to assert any claim

18

at all?

19

What -- what is your answer to that?
MR. SALVATORE:

Your Honor, in -- in our

20

collective bargaining agreement, the collective

21

bargaining agreement here, the -- the union -- the

22

employee tenders the claim to the union.

23

majority of cases the -- the employee and the union's

24

interests will be aligned, and the -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in the

But here it wasn't.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what -

Here we are dealing with

3

claims that the union said:

4

process these claims because we have some tension since

5

the younger workers that replaced you, we also represent

6

them.

7

Sorry, we are not going to

So you are proposing, as far as I understand

8

it, a situation where these workers would have no

9

individual right at all if the union says:

10

We -- we

won't represent you.

11

MR. SALVATORE:

No, Your Honor.

The -- the

12

clause requires all claims to be arbitrated, and "all

13

claims" means that the individuals then have to go to

14

arbitration with their private counsel in this case and

15

-- and have their claims heard in the arbitral forum.

16

So that no one is denying -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where does -- where does

18

the contract say anything about the -- the individual

19

succeeding to whatever arrangement there is between the

20

union and the employer?

21
22

MR. SALVATORE:

Your Honor, I'm looking at

the petition appendix.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that only -

24

only the union can invoke the arbitration clause, not an

25

individual.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SALVATORE:

No, Your Honor.

That's -

2

that's not the -- the way the contract reads.

3

looking at the petition appendix page 48a, which is the

4

"no discrimination" clause.

5

I'm

And just -- just as a quick prelude to -

6

before I -- I go through that language, I just want to

7

-- to note that this argument that these employees were

8

not bound to go individually to arbitration was never

9

raised below.

10

The Second Circuit did not consider it.

11

Indeed, the Second Circuit found that the clause covered

12

these employees, and -- and this only came up in the

13

Respondents' brief in this Court after cert was granted,

14

the red brief.

15

So that this -- this argument is one that

16

the factual premises for were never considered below in

17

the district court or in -- in the court of appeals.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just so I'm clear -

I don't -- I don't wish to

20

delay your reading, but -- but as -- as part of the

21

decision we have to make, don't we have to have in the

22

background the consideration of the -- that the -- the

23

potentiality that the union might do just what it did

24

here, and that would help, it seems to me, inform our

25

decision on the question that you are presenting.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, whether or not it's properly raised

2

here, I do agree with you it comes rather late.

3

isn't it a factor that we must necessarily consider?

4

MR. SALVATORE:

Yes, Your Honor.

But

And -

5

and, indeed, the collective bargaining agreements --and

6

we'll look at the language in one second -- are -- are,

7

as this Court has recognized, a little more complicated

8

to understand than -- than average contracts.

20

MR. SALVATORE:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It does not, Your Honor.
The Second Circuit simply

22

said you could not deprive an individual of the right to

23

a court trial.

24

MR. SALVATORE:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.
And the issue is whether 7


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

now, if -- if we held that you can require the

2

individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we

3

could confront the question of whether, if the union is

4

in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the

5

individual will -- will not get a fair arbitrated deal,

6

that would invalidate it.

7

But it has nothing to do with the question

11

MR. SALVATORE:

12

That is my argument with respect to why this does not

need to be taken up now.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I hate to get into

15

this, you know, 9 years history of dealings between the

16

union and -- and the employees.

18

MR. SALVATORE:

There is no factual record,

Your Honor, for it in the record at all.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -

Well, there is at least

20

some.

21

And if we are deciding anything at all, we are going to

22

decide whether in this case the -- the Second Circuit

23

was correct.

And in this case we've got the

insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?
MR. SALVATORE:

What this means, Justice

3

Scalia, is that these individuals cannot go to court.

4

They have to go either through the union, as has been

5

the practice here, or the union will turn the claim over

6

to them and let them go by themselves.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Where did we get this

8

phrase -- where do we get the language "or the union

9

will turn over to them"?

The only thing that I can see

10

in here that addresses that is on page 46a.

11

the clause there reads:

12

by the union alone, and no individual shall have the

13

right to compromise or settle any claim without the

14

written permission of the union."

15

And the -

"All union claims are brought

There is -- there is a lot of gray area in

16

that, but the one thing that seems clear is that the

17

union has total control over any claim, including an

18

arbitration claim.

19

And that seems to lend some substance to the

20

-- to the point made by the other side that if we accept

21

your position here, we are accepting a position not

22

nearly as far -- that the designation -- a procedural

23

designation of a forum should be enforced but that, in

24

fact, total control over the assertion of a statutory

25

Federal right is also being ceded.

That's an undisputed fact.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

16

MR. SALVATORE:

That's correct.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if the statutory right

18

is the appropriate section of an arbitration agreement

19

and the union has ultimate control of the arbitration

20

agreement, then it follows that the union has got

21

ultimate control over the assertion of the statutory

right.

MR. SALVATORE:

No court has decided this

19

over the last nine years, that they compel the

individual union member to go to arbitration when they

have brought claims in court in violation of this

clause.

Alderson Reporting Company

particular contract, which is not an issue of national

2

importance.

3

Why -- why must we decide the case here?
Could we not simply decide that the Second

4

Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would

5

be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you

6

cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining

7

agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of

8

Title VII claims?

9

Why couldn't we just decide that?

And then if there is any issue of whether

10

such concession to the union deprives an individual of

11

even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be

12

decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?

13

MR. SALVATORE:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the Second Circuit

15

could look into all of these details.

MR. SALVATORE:

14
Alderson Reporting Company

days, but -- but it also provides multiple, as this

2

court recognized in Gilmer, multiple avenues that

3

Congress wants to use:

4

conference -

5

Conciliation, persuasion,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Exactly.

That's my point,

6

is that the statute as a whole reflects a considerable

7

effort not to let this employee get cut off at the pass

8

and an employee who is reasonably determined to get to

9

court probably can do it.

It's not definite.

The EEOC

10

doesn't have to give them a letter giving them a right

11

to sue, but probably can do it.

12

And if that's a situation where you have

13

this whole expert thing cut in, it seems to me there is

14

a parallel here that Congress then wouldn't want the

15

union and the employer together to be able to cut that

16

right to sue off, at least not very easily.

17

MR. SALVATORE:

Justice Breyer, you have

18

competing policies here because you have the policies of

would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that

says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union

arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate

6

it the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on

7

his own?

8
9

MR. SALVATORE:

That's -- that's the

practice under this agreement, Your Honor.

We would -

10

we would wholeheartedly endorse that -- that rule

11

because, that's the practice here.

12

you're talking about statutory rights, why would the

What is the alternative here?

The

7

alternative is that employers can bypass the union.

8

They can just go around the union and -- and have

9

individual Gilmer agreements signed up.

D.C. Circuit said en banc in -- in -- in the ALPA Pilots

was arguing the position that we are arguing here, that

14

this is a mandatory subject of bargaining, and this is

15

right in the union's portfolio of -- of what they should

16

be using to -- to bargain with the employer because it's

17

a procedural right and there are no substantive outcomes

18

that are diminished in any way whatsoever.

19

Unions are deemed trustworthy enough to

20

bring lawsuits in the federal courts on behalf of their

members.

23

their -- their union's actions.

4

But what happens when the union drops out and you

MR. SALVATORE:

In -- in this situation the

employer pays.

That's the only -- the Office of the

6

Contract Arbitrator is an -- essentially a mini-

7

American Arbitration Association that these parties have

8

set up, and the -- the RAB, which is the multi- employer

9

organization that represents all the real estate

10

employers in -- in New York, they pay for the

11

arbitration, because the union in this case has said we

12

are not going to pay.

13

As you point out rightly, if the union is

14

not involved, they -- they shouldn't pay.

15

no cost to the employee for that arbitration and -- and

16

as Justice Edwards said in the D.C. Circuit Kohl case,

17

that -- that that procedure is -- is a fair one, to have

the employer pick up the -- the costs given -- given the

this Court said in Gilmer, of whether a contract-based

But factually these cases are very different as -- as

well.

Mr. Alexander in Alexander v.

from those statutes.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. FREDERICK:

11

Justice, and may it please the Court:

12

Thank you, Mr. Chief

The Second Circuit's judgment should be

13

affirmed for three reasons.

14

bargaining agreement gives the union exclusive control

15

over workers' grievances.

16

conflicts of interest with respect to individual

17

statutory anti-discrimination rights; and third, unions

18

lack authority to serve as gatekeepers of individual

19

workers' substantive ADEA rights.

20

First, a collective

Second, unions have inherent

With respect to the first point, a

21

collective bargaining agreement generally gives the

22

union exclusive control over whether to bring grievances

23

on behalf of workers and how such grievances are

24

pursued.

25

the workers have not advanced the requisite agreement to

In such circumstances -- which is this case,

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitrate, and control over the arbitral forum to

2

satisfy this Court's standards in Gilmer for effectively

3

vindicating the workers' statutory anti-discrimination

4

rights.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Under your first point, are

6

you saying it's impossible for there to be a collective

7

bargaining agreement that reads the way Mr. Salvatore

8

reads this collective bargaining agreement; a collective

9

bargaining agreement which says that the union's -- that

10

the grievance must be arbitrated, and it will be done

11

either by the union, or if the union declines to pursue

12

it, by the individual employee?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Alito, I've looked

14

comprehensively through the cases.

We've never found a

15

collective bargaining agreement that gives the kind of

16

interpretation that Mr. Salvatore offered in this case.

17

Now, is it theoretically possible that a collective

18

bargaining agreement would confer on individuals the

19

rights this Court said in Gilmer are necessary to

20

vindicate that?

21

possible, but it has to be done within the confines of

22

whether there is actual consent by the individual to the

23

arbitration, whether the individual has control over the

24

mechanisms of arbitration, and whether or not the

25

structure of the arbitral forum effectively vindicates

I would acknowledge it's theoretically

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

the individual's substantive rights.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But there is nothing in

3

Federal labor law that would preclude the negotiation of

4

a collective bargaining agreement like that.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Nothing except this Court's

6

case in Magnavox where the Court said that the union may

7

not bargain away an individual's rights where there

8

would be a conflict between the union's interests and

9

the individual's.

Here, because this is a

10

discrimination claim, unions are often brought as

11

defendants in such claims, particularly in circumstances

12

as here, where the union agreed to the conditions that

13

gave rise to the discrimination on the basis of age by

14

these workers.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Even in a case in which you

16

don't have -- assume -- just assume for the sake of

17

argument that we don't have the discrimination issue or

18

the conflict issue.

19

arguing that there had to be the kind of knowing,

20

intelligent and individual waiver, which I would suppose

21

a collective bargaining agreement will never include.

22

So I thought it was the -- ultimately the implication of

23

your argument that in any -- in any case in which

24

arbitration is claimed, there would have to be -- or a

25

right to go to arbitration is claimed by the employer -

I understood you elsewhere to be

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there would have to be, not merely the collective

2

bargaining agreement, but a specific waiver by the

3

employee to -- to go ahead and do that.

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Is that right?

That -- that's correct.

And

5

that's why I think the Gilmer point is -- is essential

6

here, Justice Souter and Justice Alito.

7

Gilmer there was individual consent; there needs to be

8

such individual consent under the ADEA waiver itself,

9

and knowing and individual waiver is necessary before

Because in

10

the person can waive the substantive ADEA rights.

11

would need to be part of the hypothetical collective

12

bargaining agreement that I was positing with Justice

13

Alito.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

That

Right.
Would that mean Go ahead.
Would that mean that the

18

employer could not unilaterally impose an arbitration

19

requirement on employees?

20

MR. FREDERICK:

I think that would follow,

21

as that would be a condition of employment that could

22

not be imposed.

23

The airline -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It wouldn't be

24

unilaterally imposing, right?

He would say if you're

25

going to work for me, you've got to arbitrate, and that
27
Alderson Reporting Company

could be negotiated theoretically, and with individual

2

employee.

3

benefit of collective bargaining is that that doesn't

4

happen.

5

leverage if he wants to insist upon that, but it would

6

not -- it would be a matter for negotiation between the

7

individual and the company.

8
9

And -- I mean, the whole point, the whole

You say, well, the employer has a lot of

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, but there are two different points at which the

10

condition of employment arose.

11

questions on this side to be after the agreement had

12

taken place and the worker was already on the work site.

13

Under your hypothetical, if an employee gains entrance

14

to the work force and is asked, "will you sign this,"

15

there is individual consent in that circumstance.

16

is the fact situation in the Air Line Pilots case.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I understood the

That

But the one thing that's

18

uniform throughout in your answer is that the collective

19

bargaining agreement alone can never subject the

20

employee to -- to mandatory arbitration?

MR. FREDERICK:

and as we cite on page 27 of our brief, there are

provisions in the anti-discrimination laws that are

because unions are not the persons against whom such

18

tort suits are brought.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Nor am I

Well, but those -- I'm

sorry.
Those examples are examples.

You're getting

22

down to individual cases.

I thought you drew the global

23

line in answer -- which would answer Justice Breyer's

24

question by saying the -- in the cases that we're

25

talking about here, Congress has passed a statute giving
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a specific individual right and that individual right

2

cannot in effect be compromised except in -- except in

3

violation of that statute, and that's where we draw the

4

global line so that when you got to torts, you'd look at

5

the individual situation rather than draw a categorical

6

line.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, you would, but the

8

principles this Court has applied in looking at that

9

broad line, I'm trying to suggest that there might be

10

situations in which those principles, where the union is

11

serving as the gatekeeper, thereby not allowing a person

12

to vindicate his individual rights in the tort context,

13

to be not -

Very helpful of you.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I thought what he was

19

getting at is, if I hold for you here, am I going to

have to hold for you in every case in which somebody has

21

in effect a tort claim which is subject to an

22

arbitration clause?

And the answer is no.

are thousands, maybe tens of thousands, kinds of claims

wondering here is if you win here, what is the set of

such claims that I have now said that a union, through a

controls the arbitration, and there is no opportunity

for individual arbitration under this collective

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You did raise that issue,

but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue

14

was that you win.

15

that that issue was involved in this case was a good

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Certainly, the

23

interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is

24

fairly included within the question presented.

25

this Court found in Wright in a situation where it

And as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

granted certiorari on the very same question here but

2

then looked at the specific provisions of the collective

3

bargaining agreement to determine that, in fact, under

4

the facts there a different rule applied for a clear and

5

unambiguous waiver.

6

All we are saying here is that under this

7

provision there is no opportunity for the individual to

8

arbitrate, and that raises a -- a problem analogous to

9

the one that is in Wright.

We think that is fairly

10

included within the question presented, and that the

11

Court can affirm on that basis, certainly where the

12

Second Circuit had relied on precedent that said that

where the individual doesn't have a right, that it is

is one of these fuzzy areas where we are not making

our argument is fairly included within the question

argument.

4

If the court has no further questions -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the argument

6

that you are -- if you win this case, you are subjecting

7

the employee to a worse situation because the employer

8

will simply say:

9

with the union.

Fine, I don't have to bargain anything
If you want to work in this workplace,

10

you sign an arbitration agreement that says you have no

11

access to the court, and you have to -- just like in

12

Gilmer, just like in Circuit City.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

14

guess I would answer that question by saying we will pay

15

our money and take our chances in the sense that the

16

unions here are supporting the workers where the unions

17

are acknowledging that there is this kind of conflict of

18

interest, and the question of whether or not imposing

19

arbitration on the individual workers would be a

20

condition of employment.

MR. FREDERICK:

those claims, that's certainly the province of lawyers

taking these cases and clients deciding whether or not

there are benefits to employees from arbitration as

MR. FREDERICK:

The employer may not

If he doesn't have any protection, if it

doesn't buy him anything, if employees can still go to

I -- I -- the -- the issue in front of us,

as I see it, is just what you said:

require the worker to accept arbitration rather than a

That's the question, right?

18

for here is:

or no to you they can't, what's the principle?

20

If we say yes to you they can force them,

Now, the easiest kind of case where you tend

21

to think they can force the worker into arbitration is

22

where the right grows out of the collective bargaining

That's why I am asking you

for the principle.
MR. GANNON:

I think that the -- the best

line that we have is -- is stated in both Gardner-Denver

and Barrentine as contrasting statutory rights that are

20

related to collective activity, and especially economic

activity, are the kinds of things that are normally

union -- because both are the types -- the types of

3

entities that can be charged with discrimination under

4

Title VII or the ADA or these other statutes -- the

5

reason that they gave you a lower salary was on the

basis of something for which you had a Federal statutory

protection, then -- then you have an independent

statutory right that the union's majoritarian

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is not taking away the

It's just saying to vindicate it, you have to go to

14

arbitration instead of to the courts.

15

The -- the union is not taking away the right.

MR. GANNON:

Yes.

And the difference is

16

that the union is making the decision about where the

claim will be vindicated.

claim will actually be able to be officially vindicated.

question that your interpretation of Gardner-Denver is

correct.

MR. GANNON:

Well, it -- it is the

11

prevailing interpretation in every circuit that has

12

considered the question since Gilmer except the Fourth

13

Circuit.

14

mentioned in some of amicus briefs, including the

15

particular amicus brief of the National Academy of

16

Arbitrators, it is true that even when there is just a

17

labor arbitration machinery that was invalid under the

18

terms of Gardner-Denver and would not be binding on the

19

employee if the employee happens to lose in that

20

arbitration, in most of those cases when the employee

21

loses that arbitration, he does not go on to file an

22

independent case in federal court.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if you look at the empirical data that's

Your position -- so

their position is going to hurt most employees, because

Suppose the employer did

25

The National Labor Relations Board which

come out in at least three different ways.

7

One of them is the arrangement outlined in

8

the Abbott D.C. Circuit decision that -- that

9

Petitioners rely upon.

But, of course, that's an

instance where there were two completely separate

bargaining but it's not effective unless the employee

Alderson Reporting Company

is hired an individual waiver, then, in fact, the only

3

case in which it's going to make any difference as to

4

whether you win or he wins is the case in which the

5

agreement has got a clause in there that gives the union

6

plenary authority to dispose of the claim.

7

Isn't that correct?

8

MR. GANNON:

9

Well, not necessarily, Justice

Souter, because there are all sorts of other attributes

of the arbitral forum that might -- might well be

11

relevant to the question of whether it's sufficient to

In Gilmer itself, the Court

16

In this instance, even under Petitioner's

17

view of the CBA, which we don't think is supported by

18

the text of the CBA, this -- these employees are still

stuck with an arbitrator who has been chosen by the

20

employer and by the union.

21

entities that have already decided that their claim is

meritless.

We think that there needs to be
