ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

In Flast against Cohen, this Court

12

recognized narrow circumstances in which a taxpayer

13

could satisfy the requirements of Article III in

14

challenging a congressional exercise of its spending and

15

taxing authority.

16

suggestion of Justice Douglas that it allow all

17

taxpayers to sue in all manner of claims, as well as the

18

slightly more modest suggestion of Justices Stewart and

19

Fortas that the Court allow taxpayer standing for all

20

establishment clause challenges.

21

This court in doing so rejected the

This Court's subsequent cases such as Valley

22

Forge have made clear just how narrow the rule of Flast

23

is.

24

of Article III, the taxpayer must challenge a

25

congressional exercise of the taxing and spending

In order for a taxpayer to satisfy the requirements

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority, and assert that the act of spending itself is

2

what gives rise to the establishment clause violation.

3

The court of appeals in the decision below substantially

4

expanded the scope of taxpayer standing and in doing so,

5

the court adopted a doctrine that I think can fairly be

6

only understood as an exception to, not an application

7

of normal principles of Article III standing.

8

The court did so on the rationale that there

9

is much that the executive branch can do to violate

10

the establishment cause, but there is much that all

11

three branches of Government could conceivably do to

12

violate the establishment clause, and that has never

13

been thought a sufficient reason to extend taxpayer

14

standing to all Government action, nor has it been

15

thought a sufficient reason to relax the irreducible

16

minimum requirements of Article III.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If I understand your

18

position correctly, if Congress enacts a program that

19

favors religion over non-religion, which is supposedly

20

what the establishment clause prohibits, that's bad; but

21

if Congress enacts a perfectly valid general program and

22

the President implements it in a fashion that favors

23

religion over non-religion, that's okay, insofar as the

24

ability of anybody to challenge it is concerned.

25

that an accurate description?

GENERAL CLEMENT:
Justice Scalia.

I mean, first of all -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

5

Well, I don't think so,

Why not?
I mean, I think that may

be sort of over inclusive and under inclusive.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Which is to say, it's not

8

a congressional program, it's a congressional spending

9

statute that is the key predicate.

And then once

10

there's a congressional spending program, whether it's

11

facial challenge or an as-apply challenge that relies on

12

an intervening ministerial act of the executive branch,

13

taxpayer standing will lie under this Court's precedent.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If this -- if Congress

15

had enacted this executive order that's in question

16

here, if it had been congressional legislation, would

17

there be standing?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think so,

19

Justice Ginsburg, but let me just be clear.

I don't

20

think it's just a matter of this executive order that's

21

challenged in this case and Congress could have enacted

22

that into statute.

23

really at issue here is not the executive order.

24

the way that certain conferences were conducted by

25

executive branch officials.

As I understand it, the -- what is
It is

That's what the dispute 5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I had the same question as

2

Justice Ginsburg, and I think was also suggested by

3

Justice Scalia's question.

4

a statute that said we hereby appropriate a million

5

dollars to the President to use to call religious

6

conferences, and then it spelled out these conferences.

7

Is there standing there?

8
9

Suppose that Congress passed

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I don't think so,

Justice Kennedy, because I look at this Court's -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But --and I of course want

11

the answer, but then, why is that consistent with what

12

you told us at the beginning that there had to be a

13

statute?

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Because there has to be

15

two things.

There has to be a statute.

And then there

16

has to be an allegation that the statute creates a

17

unique injury in the context of spending that affects

18

taxpayers differently than anybody -- than any other

19

citizen.

20

hypothetical statue, where you don't have any spending

21

that goes outside of the Government, then you might have

22

an establishment clause problem, but it wouldn't be an

23

establishment clause problem where the nub of the

24

problem is the fact that money is spent.

25

there's a problem with what's going -

And if you have a situation like your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're saying if the

2

Government, the executive, or the Congress, if the

3

congressional statute authorizes the giving of money for

4

the billing of a church, that's bad; but if it

5

authorizes -- it makes a general authorization to the

6

President -- no.

7

Government will build a church, that's okay, because

8

then the money doesn't go outside the Government?

9

If the congressional statute says the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, importantly,

10

Justice Scalia, it's not a matter of it being okay.

11

It's a question of whether it logically -

concerned.

Yeah, it logically gives

What is your answer to

that?

What I would say is in

21

either case it's bad.

22

taxpayer standing to challenge the disbursement of funds

23

outside the Government but not your horrible

24

hypothetical about an internal Government church.

25

I would say that there is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is no standing for
7


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the internal Government church?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Not taxpayer standing.

3

Anybody who's subjected to the mass at the church

4

probably has standing as a matter of direct -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

anybody in at gunpoint.

7

Government church.

8

No, we're not forcing

We're just building a

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect,

9

Justice Scalia, nobody forced Van Orden to walk by the

10

Ten Commandments display in Texas at gunpoint, and yet

11

this Court said that he could bring an establishment

12

clause challenge.

13

injured people who could challenge your sort of end of

14

the slippery slope -

15

So I think there would be directly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we're talking taxpayer

16

standing.

17

insofar as whether the taxpayer is harmed between the

18

Congress saying we're going to give the money to a

19

religious organization to build a church and Congress

20

saying we're going to build a church.

21

there's a difference?

22

And you think there is a real difference

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You really think

I think there's a

23

difference in the extent to which there is a

24

conceptually direct injury for the taxpayer as taxpayer.

25

The citizens are clearly injured when the Government
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sets up the church.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In both cases money is

3

being used for a purpose that is contrary to the

4

establishment clause, according to the taxpayer.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But with respect, in the

6

context of the internal Government church, the fact that

7

money is being spent to establish that church is the -

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Taxpayer money.
-- least of your concerns.

10

It's the fact that the Government is establishing it

11

that's the principal concern.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't care whether it's

13

the least of the concerns, it's a concern.

14

same establishment clause concern in both cases.

15

you may well be correct that there's a freedom of

16

religion clause violation in one case and not in the

17

other, but as far as the establishment clause violation,

18

I find it difficult to understand the difference between

19

the two.

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's the
Now

Well, Justice Scalia, I

21

think it's a difference suggested by this Court's cases,

22

and they do make an important distinction between the

23

distribution of money outside the Government where the

24

spending itself is the injury and what this Court has

25

termed the incidental expenditure of money in the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

context of an executive branch activity that itself is

2

alleged to violate the establishment clause.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And why should that make

4

any difference if the entire theory behind it is sort of

5

a Madisonian theory, if not threepence from the pocket

6

for a religious purpose?

7

Madisonian view, there should be no distinction of the

8

two cases that Justice Scalia puts.

9

If you start with the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I'm not quite sure that's

10

right, Justice Souter, because I think that there's

11

really two ways the Government can establish religion.

12

One is they can do it themselves directly.

13

do that, I think that the primary problem is the primary

14

executive branch conduct in doing so.

15

they can establish -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if they

The other way

No, but let's talk about

17

establishing -- maybe this is what you're going to do,

18

establishing religion by spending the threepence.

19
20
21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Exactly.

And that is

precisely what JUSTICE SOUTER:

And in this case, when you

22

build the church, you're spending the threepence whether

23

-- whether a -- a Government employee is laying the

24

bricks or a contract -- an outside contractor is laying

25

the bricks or a third party institution to which a grant
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

has been made is laying the bricks.

2

threepence.

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's the same

With respect in the one

4

respect it is the three pence itself that is the

5

establishment violation.

6

Government money into the coffers -

7

It is the act of handing

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Taking the money out of the

8

pocket and using it for a particular purpose, and the

9

money comes out of the pocket in each case.

10
11

The purpose

is the same in each case.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Again, I would take issue

12

with that and say the primary concern that Madison was

13

focused on was the taking of the money and then giving

14

it to the outside religious entity.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would -- you've covered

16

the case where the Government itself, the executive is

17

the actor and said that's not covered by Flast.

18

is covered -- what is covered is if the give the money

19

directly to the religious organization.

20

But it

If the money goes instead of to the

21

Government -- take this case, if the conferences are run

22

by a private contractor -- contractor with the

23

executive, where would that fall?

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think it might depend on

the nature of the claim actually.

If the nature of the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

claim JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This claim, these

3

conferences are run now instead of within the executive

4

branch by various agencies, they are run by contractors,

5

specialists in conferences that have been engaged by the

6

executive to help people make grant applications.

7
8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But I think the better

view, is the challenge is exactly this one, which is not

10

that there's something wrong with the recipient, but

11

that there's something wrong with what goes on at these

12

conferences.

13

would be -- standing -

14

Then in that context, I don't think there

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's --that's a

15

question on the merits.

16

allegations of the complaint on the merits as -- the

17

allegation is, I take it, that religious organizations

18

are being favored over secular organizations; but that's

19

a merits question.

20

Right now we have to take the

You've -- you've -- you have been clear that

21

if the Government itself spends the money, then there's

22

no standing.

23

the money to the religious group, there is standing.

24
25

You've, you've been clear that if it gives

Now money is going outside the Government.
Going outside the Government.

But is not going to the

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

religious organization.

Where do you fit that?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Again, I think if I

3

understand the question, I would say that there's no

4

taxpayer standing there.

5

apologize for sort of bleeding over into the merits.

6

But with all due respect, I don't think you can really

7

meaningfully talk about the Flast nexus test without

8

bleeding over a little bit into the merits, because the

9

Court did it itself in Flast.

And I think -- but, but and I

And what I would say is

10

if you have a challenge where the problem is that it's

11

the very act of money going to the third party

12

conference organizers that's the problem, then it really

13

is a spending case, and I think the taxpayer standing

14

would logically lie.

15

But if it's really, what the concern here is

16

the primary conduct of what was done at the conferences,

17

and not the fact that there's spending on the

18

conferences at all, then I think it's more -- it is a

19

case there would not be taxpayer standing.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There wouldn't be

21

tax -- taxpayer standing, but of course there would be

22

regular Article III standing in the sense that in a

23

party claiming to be injured because they didn't get a

24

grant, and a religious organization did, and the reason

25

was religion, can bring any kind of claim they want
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

under Article III.

It's just they wouldn't qualify for

2

the special exception to the general rule that there is

3

no taxpayer standing for establishment clause cases.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

5

it's a very important point.

6

this Court recognized that the Bible reading in Doremus

7

did not give rise to taxpayer standing, that didn't stop

8

the parents who were directly injured by the same

9

practice in Shemp from bringing an establishment

10
11

That's exactly right.

And

Because for example, when

clause JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- just one, one more

12

question on this, on this line.

And I won't belabor the

13

hypothetical.

14

conference, and the moneys go for air tickets to various

15

religious ministers and priests.

16

outside the Government test for standing?

Again there's a Federal statute for this

Does that meet your

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think there would be

18

taxpayer standing if I understand that.

19

that, you know, one could say well, that's is a fairly

20

artificial distinction.

21

suggested by this Court's precedents and the reason that

22

it makes sense is that when you have injury -- where the

23

real injury is the spending, the fact that you're not

24

supposed to pay for plane tickets for ministers, that's

25

an establishment clause injury, then it makes sense to

And I realize

But I do think that it is

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say that people that provided that money in the in the

2

first place have a distinct injury.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But not -- but not if the

4

President just gives the money out of a general

5

appropriation, authorizing him to give money to people

6

who are helping in the programs that the Faith-Based

7

Initiative was -- was designed to help?

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Well If the President hands over

the money, that's okay?

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Not necessarily,

12

Justice Scalia, but it's important to focus on what this

13

case is about.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why, why not necessarily?

15

I thought that was your -- you proposition, that it has

16

to be a congressional violation not an executive.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Right.

And it would

18

depend a little bit on about where the President is

19

getting the money.

20

at it -

21

I think the way that we would look

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He's getting the money from

22

Congress under a general, under a general appropriation.

23

If he takes this money and he says here, use it for a

24

religious purpose, that's okay?

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

He -

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

concerned, he can't be sued?

3

GENERAL CLEMENT:

As far as standing is

If he, if he's taking it

4

from a general appropriation that makes no indication

5

it's to go outside the Government so one could not in

6

any way articulate that as an as-applied challenge to

7

the appropriations, then I suppose that there would not

8

be standing.

9

But I think -

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't understand.

I'm

10

back -- I really -- I'm surprised.

And it's probably my

11

fault.

12

Justice Scalia was with his first question.

13

this had something to do with whether Congress passed a

14

statute or the President acted on his own.

15

listening to you now I think, I can't decide -- I think

16

you have a different argument.

But that I thought -- I started where
I thought

But

17

Suppose -- I'm just trying to understand.

18

Suppose that Congress passes a law and it says it's a

19

very nice thing to commemorate the Pilgrims by building

20

a Government church at Plymouth Rock, where we will have

21

the regular worship in the Puritan religion.

22

taxpayer from California in your view challenge that?

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

24

much harder case than this -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now can a

I would say that that's a

Yes, but -

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I would

say no, no.

3
4

-- but I say no.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not?

Because I thought

Flast made clear that they could.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

What Flast makes

6

clear is that you can challenge a congressional statute

7

that is a taxing and spending statute.

8

understand the circumstances in which you should give

9

rise to taxpayer standing, you need two things:

And I think to

You

10

need a congressional statute that is an exercise of the

11

taxing and spending authority; but then you need the

12

money to go outside the Government.

13

And that's precisely what -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

group?

16
17

Then you go to a private

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Right.

Because there's,

again, there's two ways -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you're saying that if

19

the Government has the most amazing, let's -- I'm trying

20

to think of something more amazing that what I just

21

thought of.

22

(Laughter.)

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

All over America, they

24

build churches dedicated to one religion; and Congress

25

passes a statute and says in every city, town, and
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hamlet, we are going to have a minister, a Government

2

minister, a Government church, and dedicated to the

3

proposition that this particular sect is the true sect;

4

and they pass a statute like that, nobody could

5

challenge it?

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Horrible hypothetical.
Is that what you're saying,

then?

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I mean, I think the bottom

10

line is that there would not be taxpayer standing.

11

Plenty of people could probably challenge that.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know, I mean Probably -- everybody else who

15

doesn't want to go just avoids it.

16

have to do anything.

17

So that they don't

They just have to -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Any, presumably any

18

other denomination that is not of the established church

19

could bring a challenge that they're being discriminated

20

against, because they're favoring a particular church

21

over them.

22

somebody in Oregon can't challenge the fact that they're

23

building a church in Florida simply because the person

24

in Florida pays taxes, right?

25

Your proposition is simply that somebody -

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Exactly, and not just the

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

person in Oregon.

But everybody in between Oregon and

2

Florida all have the same amount of standing.

3

we're saying is plenty of people would be able to

4

challenge that.

No, what

But not -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Who?

Who?

As -- as the Chief Justice

7

suggested I think anybody from a different denomination

8

that said that this was discriminatory probably could

9

bring a claim.

I also think that anybody who walked

10

into one of those churches could bring a claim.

11

again, this Court -- this Court -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe they don't walk into

13

it because it is not "our church."

14

into it.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

So they don't walk

Well, we And moreover, they don't -

17

they don't feel it's discriminatory.

18

doing this to commemorate the Pilgrims, and we'll give

19

the money to any group that's a Pilgrim.

20

(Laughter.)

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's just we're

With respect -- with

22

respect, Justice Breyer, I think you're underestimating

23

the ingenuity of plaintiffs to think that somebody that

Well, Justice We are talking about

aspect of the decision in Valley Forge.

Now I think

2

that's wrong.

3

as follows:

4

you can challenge congressional spending, not Executive

5

Branch action.

6

about an as-applied challenge to a spending statute?

7

Surely, I mean, because spending is something only the

8

Congress does, and disbursement is a ministerial act

9

that only the Executive does, what do you do when

I think the way to understand Kendrick is
You have a decision that says you can -

That naturally poses the question what

10

there's an intervening ministerial act of disbursement?

11

Does that mean that it's still an as-applied challenge

12

to the spending statute?

Or does -

Was it just That mean that it's

Executive Branch action?

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was it just a ministerial

17

act or did the Executive have discretion involved, about

18

who would receive the grant?

19

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

20

two things.

One, in Bowen, there was -- there is

21

certainly always a degree of discretion.

22

worth noting that in Bowen as in Flast, the statute

23

itself on its face made clear that money was to go to

24

outside entities that were religious.

25

so in express terms by four times referring to religious

5

that 93 percent of the private schools were religious.

6

The both of those, the gravamen of what's the complaint,

7

that money is being spent by Congress on religious

8

entities, was not within the discretion of the Executive

9

Branch.

10

In Flast it did so by saying money was

And that was at a time when this

And again, the way I would understand

11

Kendrick is simply reconciling Valley Forge and Flast

12

and Cohen to preserve, not broad challenges to Executive

13

Branch action, which would have overruled Valley Forge,

14

but rather to simply preserve the notion that you can

15

bring an as-applied challenge to a spending statute.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you can reconcile

17

Valley Forge simply by saying when it's money from the

18

Federal Treasury, whether it is a general appropriation

19

or a specific appropriation, it is money from the

20

Treasury, and that's what Flast is about.

21

whether it is spent by the Executive under an Executive

22

program, which you have said can violate the

23

establishment clause as well as a congressional program.

Because

24

So why isn't that the line to draw based on

25

Flast, that it's money from the Treasury that makes the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difference?

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it

3

is certainly not the line I would draw from reading

4

these cases side by side and together.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or to, or to put it another

6

way, to put Justice Ginsburg's point another way, every

7

Executive action that involves the expenditure of

8

congressionally authorized funds is an as-applied

9

challenge to an expenditure statute.

Because the only

10

way the statute is applied is through executive action.

11

And whenever the executive spends the funds improperly,

12

you have an as-applied challenge to the congressional

13

statute authorizing the funds, whether it's a general

14

statute or a -- or a single shot statute.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Scalia, I would

16

have said that no one would have conceptualized that as

an as-applied challenge to a general appropriation

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

that approach, when a U.S. Marshal executes a search and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Government spends money in violation of the

2

establishment clause, a taxpayer -- after all, the money

3

comes from the taxpayer -- can bring a lawsuit?

4

reason that they do that is because the establishment

5

clause is an important joint part of the religion

6

clauses; and there'd be no other way to bring such a

7

challenge.

and when we depart from that principle, say by giving

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I just add this

15

thought before you answer.

16

Justice Stewart said in his concurring opinion?

17

And isn't that exactly what

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

I mean, if

18

this Court wants to go the route of Justice Stewart,

19

which it pointedly rejected, the majority of the Court

20

pointed rejected in Flast, and say, establishment clause

21

challenges, we're going to relax the normal Article III

22

standard -- now, I'm not quite sure where the Court gets

23

the authority to relax the normal Article III standards.

24

But assuming that, that would at least be -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because there is a real

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case or controversy, because people become terribly

2

upset when they see some other religion getting the

3

money from the State for the -- for building a church,

4

for example, and that's why:

5

controversy.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's a real

Getting upset is a

7

constitutionally adequate reason to bring a lawsuit?

8

people get upset about spending money for purposes that

9

the Federal Government is not allowed to spend money for

10

because of States' rights, that also would justify

11

Article III standing, wouldn't it?

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

If

I suppose under that

13

theory, and obviously the plaintiffs in Richardson and

14

Schlesinger were very upset as well, and the Court said

15

that -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is the kind of upset

17

that is a genuine injury if you look to the objectives

18

of the establishment clause and possibly that kind of

19

genuine injury is not the case when you look to

20

objectives of various other clauses of the Constitution.

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, let me try

22

to answer in two ways if I can.

One is to say that that

23

way of looking at it takes you even beyond where Justice

24

Brennan was in Valley Forge.

25

have drawn the line at what he called bestowals of

Even Justice Brennan would

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

Government largesse to third parties.
JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what I was saying.

3

I said that Flast then encapsulates that principle drawn

4

out of the objectives of the establishment clause in a

5

rule; and the rule is what I suggested.

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

Well, again, but he Based on money.
But again, he didn't say

just spending of money to do the Executive Branch's

10

everyday operations and maybe -- and one day they go a

11

little too far in praising religion.

12

of Government largesse outside the Government.

13

second point I would make is I still don't understand

14

where in just being upset you satisfy the irreducible

15

minimum requirements of Article III, and even though

16

Flast is probably the outer limit of what's an Article

17

III injury under normal principles, there is at least

18

what Judge Leventhal in Public Citizen against Simon

19

called conceptual directness between the injury to the

20

taxpayer and the injury that comes when tax money is

21

spent outside the Government to a religious entity.

22

differentiated that from what happens when you have

general Executive Branch activity that's unlawful, where

does -- that is a particular amount of money that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Pincus, I would like

you to go back to an answer you gave because it sounds
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to me like it wasn't right.

The President needs

2

protection at all times no matter where he goes.

3

President may be doing something that violates the

4

establishment clause, but protection is the job, and it

5

doesn't make any difference where the President is.

so your answer to the question, well, suppose he had a

7

special protector who just took care of his religious

8

activities?

The

I would still say that it's, protection is
So I don't think -- I think you didn't -

10

the answer you gave isn't consistent with your theory of

11

this case.

12

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think that's right, and

13

I think that's because there are two steps to our

14

analysis, Justice Ginsburg.

15

and identifiable expenditure that only arises with

16

respect to religious activities.

17

One is, is there a discrete

The second question is, does that particular

expenditure, is that particular expenditure an

in that situation, that expenditure -

Flast said incidental expenditures

MR. PINCUS:

--

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That was her point, that it

8

would have been spent differently.

If the President

hadn't gone to this religious event, he would have gone

somewhere else and the money would have been spent

differently.

12

Bowen.

But that didn't make the difference in

Why should it make the difference here?

13

MR. BOWEN:

Well, I think -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The fact is it was spent

15

for a bad purpose, and that's the essential grievance of

16

the plaintiff, it seems to me.

17

MR. PINCUS:

We agree completely.

But we

18

also agree that there are some limits that -- the Court

19

has said that every single dollar that's expended for a

20

bad purpose doesn't give rise to a challenge.

21

example, if there's a prayer breakfast and all -- the

22

only money that's spent is on the bagels, we don't

23

believe the bagels are the basis for a taxpayer

24

challenge to the prayer breakfast.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

My

So in fact, you have -

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just help me with one point here.

2

I mean, I see that deciding what's

3

incidental and what isn't incidental will be difficult.

4

I guess many of these cases would end up being decided

5

on the merits, there is no violation on the merits, or

6

maybe sometimes there is.

7

But I'd started thinking of the question of

8

standing by thinking that there are strong feelings when

9

the Government spends money in favor of one religion and

10

not another.

11

We see that in other places in the world today.

12

feel strongly.

13

strong feeling and can't make any challenge because the

14

feelings are shared by many, then there are no cases in

15

the courts at all, and the Government can do what it

16

wants without challenge.

17

After all, they led to the 30 Years War.
People

And if, in fact, they have that terribly

So in Flast, they carved out an exception,

18

and the exception was where the taxing and spending

19

clauses were involved, because Madison and others said

20

this is aimed at "Government shall not tax and spend".

21

So that was my theory.

22

there's a big taxing and spending and it isn't

23

incidental, there's standing.

24
25

And all we're saying is where

Now we're worried about the merits.
and clear.

Simple

To which the response was, which has me a
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

little worried frankly, was that, well, that was Justice

2

Stewart's position, or roughly speaking.

3

rejected that quite clearly, and if you look at later

4

cases, they reject it too.

5

might think of it, it isn't the law.

6

to think whatever, I have to think exactly in accordance

7

with what the cases say.

8

like you to focus on that.

9

MR. PINCUS:

But the Court

And therefore, whatever you
And I'm not free

So what is your response?

I'd

Well, respectfully, I think

10

that's exactly what Justice Stewart said.

11

Stewart in his concurrence did not espouse a broader

12

theory than the one that the Court adopted in Flast.

13

And he said he joined the judgment, the opinion of the

14

Court, and he said, I understand that to hold only that

15

a Federal taxpayer has standing to assert that a

16

specific expenditure of federal funds violates the

17

establishment clause of the First Amendment.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Justice

So you're saying that what

19

Justice Stewart's view, insofar as it was rejected, that

20

Flast suggested even broader standing, but it suggested

21

at least what Justice Stewart said?

22

MR. PINCUS:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. PINCUS:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

I think it's Is that right or not?

Yes.

44
Alderson Reporting Company

If Justice Stewart

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agreed completely with what the Court said, why did he

2

write a separate opinion?

3

MR. PINCUS:

Well, in the -- sometimes

4

despite the Court's desire sometimes to have a less

5

separate opinion, sometimes justices do.

6

said here is he was just explaining his reason why he

7

believed that Flast was distinguishable from

8

Frothingham, and notes specifically that taxpayers have

9

a clear stake because of the threepence comment.

And what he

10

Justice Fortas did say, did have a broader

11

theory, although he -- in addition, that the court did

12

not adopt -- but he also said, recognizing very similar

13

language to Justice Stewart, what the Court's opinion

14

held.

15

because he doesn't talk about Congress, he talks about

16

expenditures.

17

So I think Justice Stewart's opinion is useful

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me unduly

18

intrusive for the courts to tell the President that it

19

cannot talk to specific groups to see if they have

20

certain talents that the Government may use to make sure

21

that all of their energies are used properly by the

22

Federal Government.

23

It's almost like a speech rationale.

24

And perhaps you would say that's just a

25

judgment on the merits, but it seems to me that there's
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a standing concern here, too, that we would be

2

supervising the White House and what it can say, what

3

it can -- who it can talk to.

4

quite intrusive from the standpoint of standing

5

purposes.

And it seems to me that's

6

I'm not sure that this makes a standard

7

that distinguishes the case from Flast or brings it

8

within those -- within those cases.

9

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, we believe

10

that the incidental test, and what I've been talking

11

about in terms of what the limits are, that it has to be

12

a non-incidental expenditure protects against that.

13

Because if the argument is that some Government

14

official, for part of his day met with three ministers,

15

and therefore we want to challenge because Government

16

shouldn't be meeting with ministers, I think it's both

17

for the reason, both because of the fact this is not an

18

argument that the expenditure on the hours of the day it

19

took to have those meetings is clearly not central to

20

anything.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You really want to condemn

22

the Federal courts to deciding case by case at the

23

instance of all these people who feel passionately about

24

this, case by case whether the expenditure was

25

incidental or not.

It doesn't seem to me an intelligent
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

expenditure of any sensible person's time.

2

MR. PINCUS:

Well -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And just to add to

4

the question, before you answer, at the jurisdictional

5

stage.

6

whether the individual taxpayer has standing.

7

would first have to determine whether the activity

8

you're challenging is incidental or not.

9

In other words, this would be litigation over

MR. PINCUS:

The Court

Well, Your Honor, I think the

10

fact that there hasn't been a lot of these challenges

11

that the Government has been able to point to, indicates

12

that this may not be a big problem.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe they're

14

reading Flast different than you read it.

15

a lot of these challenges because you don't have

16

standing under Flast.

17

MR. PINCUS:

There are not

But the Court also said in

18

Allen against Wright, you know, the absence of precise

19

standards does not leave the courts at sea in applying

20

the law of standing.

21

that is susceptible to precise definitions.

22

me that both because of the incidental test and the

23

concerns that Justice Kennedy articulated, if someone's

24

claim is that people in the White House have five meets

25

in the course of a year that they're upset about, it

Well, what would

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We'll litigate it.

We'll

figure out a number eventually, I'm sure.

15

MR. PINCUS:

Well, you know, in Allen

16

against Wright, and Linda R.F., there are a whole series

17

of cases where this Court has set up guidance, and the

18

lower courts have evaluated whether the connection

19

between the challenged conduct and the claimed injury -

20

here the expenditure -- is close enough for there to be

21

standing.

22

really isn't that different.

23

And this -- the inquiry that we're suggesting

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would happen if when

24

this program was set up, nothing said about faith

25

whatsoever?

This was just going to be a general program
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of outreach to community service organizations, but

2

plaintiffs claimed that as the program was being

3

administered it was heavily favoring religious

4

organizations. Would that come out the same way in your

5

judgment?

6

MR. PINCUS:

If their challenge was that the

7

entire -- the whole program essentially, as the court of

8

appeals characterized the complaint here, the whole

9

program essentially is facially neutral, but in reality

10

is a preference, yes.

11

way and the question would be -

12
13
14

Then it would come out the same

JUSTICE ALITO:
they characterize?
MR. PINCUS:

15

standing questions.

16

characterize the claim?

17

It depends totally on how

Well, that's true in many

The question is, how do you

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the problem here is the

18

claim, the gravamen here is the Government is doing

19

stuff with money that's been taxed from me that it

20

shouldn't do.

21

to the people who care so passionately about this, as

22

Justice Breyer suggests, whether it's just an incidental

23

expenditure or whether it's part of a targeted program.

24
25

I fail to see how it makes any difference

We don't do that in any other area of

badly about it, but this was just an incidental search

It doesn't make any sense, given the

gravamen that you're directing this law against, to

7

establish such a standard.

8

MR. PINCUS:

standard that the Court established in Flast.

10

It is -

And you also acknowledge

we're not here to try to make sense.

And I guess that if

So you want

a way to keep them out.

2

MR. PINCUS:

out -

4
5

You want a way to keep them

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's Justice Kennedy's

concern.

6

MR. PINCUS:

Exactly.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -

But what they're worried

8

about is will this word "incidental" and -- be

9

sufficient to keep out the people who might somehow

10

decide they want to claim, which sounds like a frivolous

11

claim, that the President can't go to a prayer

12

breakfast.

13

That's what I think -

14
15

Now does the word "incidental" do that?

MR. PINCUS:

Well, our submission is that it

does, Your Honor, because we think -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Again -- I asked

17

this before, and I think you were cut off before you had

18

a chance.

19

money for a particular meeting, a particular breakfast,

20

a particular whatever, is it incidental to that, or is

21

it incidental to however many times the President has

22

breakfast if he goes to a prayer breakfast?

23

Incidental with respect to what?

MR. PINCUS:

All of the

It's incidental to what -

24

what's the focus of the claim?

The focus of the claim

25

isn't that bagels were served.

The focus of the claim

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is there was prayer and that it was a religious meeting.

2

If there was -- just to think of what such a claim might

3

be.

4

identified is the bagels, it really is pretty tangential

5

compared to the focus of what someone's complaining

6

about.

7

what Justice Kennedy was talking about.

And so the expenditure that -- that's been

8
9

And so we think that's a rational test for doing

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So even if the

expenditure is very small, but to take a particular

10

religious symbol that might be offensive to some other

11

people, is that incidental because the meeting went on

12

longer and cost more than the particular religious

13

symbol?

14

MR. PINCUS:

No.

I think there probably

15

there would be two challenges, because there would be a

16

challenge to the government's purchase of the religious

17

symbol to have at the meeting in addition to the

18

meeting, and I think then -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if it was 2

20

dollars, you would say it's not incidental because it

21

covered the whole cost of purchasing the religious

22

symbol?

23

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, but I don't think this -

24

and I think the Government agrees with this.

25

think this is a test about how much.
52
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

I think this is a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

test about the relationship between the expenditure

2

that's challenged and the claim, what's alleged to be

3

unlawful this complex of Government activity.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So there's no standing to

5

challenge a presidential directive which says we are

6

going to buy bagels for all evangelistic Christian

7

breakfasts.

8

(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

MR. PINCUS:

But not for any -

No, I think there would be

standing.

12
13

Okay?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would there be

standing?

14

MR. PINCUS:

Because there the challenge is

15

to the discriminatory purchase.

16

prayer breakfast, it's about the idea that the

17

Government is purchasing bagels in a religiously

18

discriminatory way.

19

23

Of course.

But the

point is that makes -

It's not about the

frivolous or insignificant claims in any way.

6

MR. PINCUS:

Your Honor, I think it does,

7

because there would have to be an allegation in that

situation that bagels were being purchased on a

religious basis, and that's going to be awfully hard for

a lawyer to sign in good faith.

enough, we don't care how passionately you feel about

it -

6

MR. PINCUS:

I don't think general passion

7

is enough.

I think what the Court said is there has to

8

be a tie-in, and let me say that I think what's critical

9

here is any test obviously is susceptible to

10

hypotheticals, but the Government -- our test at least

11

keeps in taxpayer standing the core of what the framers

were worried about, which is Government expenditure of

funds -

in Valley Forge, first of all, as Justice Ginsburg said,

19

the Court relied on the fact that it was a property

20

clause claim.

21

refers to executive action, but the Court in Kendrick

22

when it talked about Valley Forge said, in

23

characterizing that case, said executive action pursuant

24

to the property clause.

25

tied together and there's a reason why.

There is a passage in Valley Forge that

And we think those things are

appropriations context, there always is congressional

2

action with respect to the very money that's at issue

3

because there has to be a congressional appropriation.

4

That's not true in the property context.

doesn't have to say, pass a statute to say, here are the

6

58 property sites that we want the executive to get rid

of.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Congress

Do you think the distinction

between taxing, between taxing and spending and the

10

property clause, makes any sense?

Do you think James

11

Madison would not be upset if the Commonwealth of

12

Virginia transferred 10,000 acres to the Anglican

13

Church?

14

taxation would not?

That would be okay, but the threepence in

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think that the core of

16

what was the concern was -- was the taking of the money

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It goes into some pot of

difference?

So instead of

Does that make a

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think that the Court

2

decided that it made a difference, and I think in terms

3

of cabining, in terms of the worry that perhaps Flast is

4

going to be overbroad and the need to have Congress

5

involved, which I think is key -- there was no

6

congressional involvement at all in designating those

7

properties and there is in the appropriations context,

8

and I think that's a key difference.

9

important here, and the Court's colloquy in the first

But I think what's

10

part of the argument showed me this -- but the

11

Government's position, the idea that it's only grants to

12

third parties -- - the Government could hire a corps of

13

chaplains and send them out to civilians and to the

14

populace at large and that couldn't be challenged,

15

because all it is is executive pay; and the Idea that

16

there's some difference between a Bowen v. Kendrick

17

situation, where the executive had tremendous discretion

18

in terms of where it was going to give the money, and

19

the situation here, which is the exercise of Precisely

20

the same executive discretion, makes no sense.

21

The injury is the same.

The conduct

22

that's -- that's the core of the violation is the same.

23

It's an Executive Branch decision to use funds in a way

24

that's impermissible under the establishment clause, and

25

we've been drawing the lines that the Government has
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been trying to draw just makes no sense, and to leave

2

out, to insulate from any taxpayer challenge really huge

3

swaths of conduct that is really at the very core of

4

what Madison was concerned about.

5

So our submission is that that really makes

6

no sense.

There's no basis in history, for example, for

7

the Government's claim that Executive Branch decisions

8

are somehow different and insulated with respect to

9

spending.

It's the spending of the same threepence, and

10

if history indicates anything it's that concerns about

11

establishment were focused just as much on the King as

12

on the Parliament in terms of the history that the

13

framers understood.

14

And for the idea that the executive would be

15

given free rein to exercise discretion with respect to

16

spending and there would be no concern about the types

17

of injuries that gave rise to Flast we think is just not

18

right.

you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

2
3

GENERAL CLEMENT:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Just a few points in rebuttal.

4

First of all, I think it's important to

5

emphasize that if this Court recognizes that there is

6

not taxpayer standing, that does not mean that there

7

won't be lawsuits, that there won't be directly injured

8

plaintiffs that can bring claims.

9

prove that point.

Doremus and Schemp

But even more broadly, any time the

10

establishment clause injury takes the form of alleged

11

coercive conduct the individuals who are coerced Are

12

going to have standing to bring the suit.

13

The second point to make clear is it's just

14

not an accurate description of this Court's cases to say

15

that the spending of appropriated funds by the executive

16

is enough to give rise to taxpayer standing.

17

property distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took

18

a tremendous amount of appropriated funds to run.

19

Nobody thought that was a basis for taxpayer standing.

20

The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the

21

teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a

22

threepence.

23

The

But that was not found enough.
Now, I think in trying to understand the

24

Court's cases you really have to focus on this word

25

"incidental."

And I think that the colloquy in the
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

second half of the argument shows that you can't look at

2

incidental as being minimal.

3

doesn't mean minimal.

4

is trying to distinguish an incidental expenditure of

5

funds when -- as to something where the expenditure of

6

funds is central or vital to the establishment clause

7

violation.

8

religious entities, nobody would say that the spending

9

is incidental.

It doesn't mean that.

It

It doesn't mean incremental.

It

In the context of money going to third party

It's the whole violation.

In the

10

context of Bible reading or anything else the Executive

11

Branch does, the fact that money went to fund the

12

Executive Branch to violate the establishment clause is

13

the least of the problems.

14

conduct of the Executive Branch in violating the

15

establishment clause, but that's not a spending injury.

16

The funding that goes into that is incidental.

17

that's the way to make sense of this Court's cases.

18

The problem is the primary

I think

It's important to emphasize what's at issue

19

here.

It's not a general challenge to the Faith-Based

20

Office.

21

It is a challenge to the particular offices and the

22

assertion that the Executive Branch officials at the

23

conferences spent too much time talking about

24

faith-based groups and not enough talking about

25

community-based groups.

It's not a challenge to the name of the office.

If that isn't intrusive on the
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Executive Branch, I don't know what is.

2

The last point I would leave you with is

3

that if something has to go in this area, if you have to

4

choose between the logic of Flast and the irreducible

5

minimum requirements of Article III, I think it's an

6

easy choice.

7

of Article III that distinguish the Judiciary from the

8

political branches of Government.
