MR. CANE:

would it not?

MR. CANE:

In my Court,
That can't be

Yeah, if the district court had

5

held that under no circumstances could a pattern or

6

practice of discrimination be shown, I think that would

7

have been error.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there anything in the

other parts of the record colloquy, comments by the

10

district judge, that you think Respondents have called

11

to our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping

12

view?

13

MR. CANE:

No.

I don't think that's what

14

the court was focusing on.

15

on the nexus of the disputed witnesses to the plaintiff.

16

The district court did not hand out a cookie cutter

17

ruling at the courthouse door.

18

not say oh, this is a discrimination case, hear are the

19

rules of evidence I apply in a discrimination case.

20

What the district court here did was consider Sprint's

21

motion in limine, which was grounded in the evidence

22

that had emerged in discovery in this case.

23

The district court focused

The district court did

Plaintiff then responded to that motion in

24

limine by trying to explain why the evidence was

25

The plaintiff then filed a witness list,

2

which explained what each of the disputed witnesses

3

would say in this case; and the plaintiff finally made

4

an offer of proof which again collaborated on what

5

plaintiff contended the disputed witnesses would say in

6

this case.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We don't really know, do

8

Whether it was based on 401 or 403?

MR. CANE:

Did the district

It didn't, did it?

The district court did not

12

specifically invoke rule 403.

13

reading of it that it is grounded in both 401 and 403.

14

I think it's -- my

The motion in limine relied on both 401 and

15

403, the district court told counsel that she wanted the

16

jury to be focusing on the claims of this plaintiff and

17

not be distracted by claims of others.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19
20
21
22

Well, to the extent it was

grounded on 401, it was error, wasn't it?
MR. CANE:

I don't think so, because I don't

think there's JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if you have three

23

supervisors, and one is discriminating and another is

24

The answer to the question is no,

As this Court taught in Teamsters JUSTICE SOUTER:
MR. CANE:

And what we have here are

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What about my question?

We

have evidence that there are three supervisors, two of

15

them are discriminating.

16

that have some tendency to indicate that in an equivocal

17

situation, that one was -- it may not be strong

18

evidence, it may not win the case, it may not be

19

powerful, but it has the tendency that gets you over the

line on 401, doesn't it?

Tell us what you think a proper foundation

MR. CANE:

No.

more than a common zip code.

Is a nexus there?

I think, in a company that was

not small, where a nexus could be inferred, that there

5

was consultation or that there were directions from more

6

senior management, then I think that would be an

7

appropriate foundation.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

So, if we've

got 19 and there's a question of 1, we've got a nexus.

If we've got three and there's a question, two are

accounted for as discriminatory, and the question is the

There's no

absolute rule either way?

11

MR. CANE:

I think there -- there should be

a guiding principle.

13

other-supervisor evidence should be presumptively

14

irrelevant, and that would be the rule in the normal run

15

of cases, at least in dealing with entities of this

magnitude.

17

And the guiding principle was that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I assume it would

18

be addressed as it was here, in a motion in limine, the

19

plaintiff would say here are the witnesses we intend to

20

call; the company would say we don't think they're

21

relevant because, as you say, there's no connection

between them, and then the judge would decide.

MR. CANE:

case.

Excuse me.

7-0-0-0-0.

Yes.

If that's the way to do it,

you didn't do it that way, did you?

I mean, as I read

10

it -- they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you

11

made to the district court said that you have to be

12

"similarly situated" -- "Plaintiff has to have been

13

'similarly situated' with other employees" -- and you

14

put that in quotes -- "similarly situated."

15

you say "employees may be 'similarly situated' only if

16

they have the same supervisor."

17

wasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence

18

isn't important.

where the Tenth Circuit said that.

3

argument you made, and this was the argument the

4

district judge adopted.

5

MR. CANE:

Is that not so or is it so?
That is so, but what the district

6

judge adopted was grounded in the offer of proof that

7

had been made here and the evidence that was proffered

8

here.

ruling that would have governed any potential -

The district court was not issuing a blanket

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How do we know?

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah.

13

that's what the district court adopted?

14

15

MR. CANE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
It doesn't mention -- it

Circuit read it to be an absolute prohibition?

and that is the court of appeals assumed that the

district court relied on 401.

16

MR. CANE:

No.

Is it customary to assume

I think it would be

17

customary to assume that, particularly on an issue of

evidence, that the district court was presumptively

correct, and that -

I'm quoting the

And then you say, "Employees may

10

be similarly situated only if they have the same

11

12

Then the district court says that plaintiff

13

may offer evidence who are "similarly situated" to her

14

and then -- quote -- "similarly situated employees" -

15

quote -- "for the purpose of this ruling requires proof

16

that Paul Reddick, his supervisor, was the

decisionmaker."

18

clear, since he used the same words and substituted the

19

word "Paul Reddick" for the same supervisor, that he was

20

taking that right from your brief where you made that

21

general argument and said nothing about the particular

22

case in those sentences.

23

That's why I thought it was fairly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you want to defend

2

the harder ground, I understand.

But what Justice

3

Breyer has just said is not necessarily so.

4

"similarly situated" argument applies under 403 as well.

5

If they're similarly situated, the -- the time it would

6

take to let in these other things and rebuttal of them,

7

plus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be

8

outweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated,

9

and, therefore, that it is stronger proof.

The

I don't see

10

that one can tell from the district court's order

11

whether the district court was relying on 401 or 403.

12
13

And certainly, you just don't want to defend
403.  I think you're digging a hole for yourself.

14

MR. CANE:

No, I absolutely want to defend

15

403.

16

Justice Scalia, all the countervailing 403 factors are

14

MR. CANE:

I mean, do you

I think it can happen both ways.

15

And really here it happened both ways, too, because

16

although it was teed up as a motion in limine, as the

17

trial evolved, the district court actually relaxed her

18

ruling and expanded it to permit attacks both on

19

Reddick, who was the direct supervisor, but also

20

decisions made by Blessing, who was Reddick's boss.

21

the district court explained that, as she thought about

it further, that additional bit of latitude should be

two people, as I understand it, were in the direct chain

MR. CANE:

That's correct.

But these

And that to me

is the proper test.

If the decisionmaker's supervisor

some relevance because it raises a question as to

whether that bias -

plaintiff had no connection.

And, more importantly, the other

20

supervisors were persons that were not shown to have any

"other supervisor" not to include the chain of command,

and a Rule 403 JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you say -- I thought

3

you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor

4

evidence could be relevant.

5

MR. CANE:

It could be relevant if there

6

were a showing that the bias on the part of the other

7

supervisors somehow tainted the decision making of the

8

instant decisionmaker.

9

And in the cases that Ms. Mendelsohn cites

10

in her brief, those are all cases in which a directive

11

was given from a more senior official to the

12

decisionmaker.

13

What we have here are decisionmakers in

14

far-flung areas elsewhere within the company with no

15

showing whatsoever that there is any relationship

16

between them.

17

Each of the five disputed witnesses here

18

testified in deposition that they had no information

19

whatsoever to shed about the decisionmakers with respect

20

to Ms. Mendelsohn.

21

And so in those circumstances there's no

22

foundational showing of relationship, no foundational

23

showing of nexus.

held that.

I think the individual has a character, and

there is no character-evidence problem with showing that

a particular decisionmaker engaged in other

discriminatory conduct, because I think that falls

25

within the exception to 404.

But where the

Evidence of discrimination by other

That's under -

under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need

19

403 to reach that conclusion?

MR. GARRE:

I think you need to look at the

21

evidence under both rules, the first question being

22

whether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401.

similar explanations under similar circumstances,

20

engaged in discrimination.

21

We think that the district dissenting judge

22

in the court of appeals was right to say that evidence

23

of that kind is at least marginally relevant, which

24

would then put the focus on whether this evidence could

be excluded under 403.

How do you articulate the

Well, I would point to several

22

criteria, Justice Scalia, in determining relevance.

23

First, whether you're dealing with same alleged -- same

24

kind of alleged discrimination and a common catalyst;

25

second, whether the proffered witnesses are working in
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the same corporate vicinity; third, whether they are

2

alleging discrimination in the same time frame; four,

3

whether they are alleging a pattern or practice of

4

discrimination.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's the relevant

6

factors, but what do you look at the factors to

7

determine -- what's the test for determining whether

8

they are sufficient?

9

MR. GARRE:

Well, you would look at the

10

proffered evidence.

For example, in this case you have

11

evidence that all of the proffered witnesses were

12

terminated under the same companywide reduction in

13

force.

You've got a common catalyst.

14

In this case, you've got employees who

15

worked in the same geographic vicinity, the headquarters

16

of Sprint, the same office complex or at least the same

17

vicinity.

16

17

a matter of law that's not a -- going to prove a pattern

18

of practice, and the employer can make that argument to

19

the district judge, to the jury, and that evidence could

20

be limited or excluded.

21

-- a proffered witness who's complaining that

22

supervisors in the same complex used the same

23

distinctive explanation that my supervisor gave me -

24

going to testify that their supervisors told them they

context of the motion in limine, it came up in the

context of the motion for a new trial.

at what the district court said in denying a motion for

a new trial, she said again -- and this is on page 436

of the JA -- she says, "none of the proffered evidence

makes it more likely that the decisionmakers in this

That's relevance language, and you're quite
right -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The determination of

the relevance of the "me, too" evidence -- and I assume

Well, the district court serves

or not evidence is relevant, and whether or not it

So that determination is

In some cases, as happened in the

21

Huddlestone case -- that was a 404(d) case -- the court

22

acknowledged in some cases the evidence may go in and

23

then the jury may instruct that that evidence is

24

allowed.

MR. GARRE:

Or is that

Well, if you're pointing to

5

other acts of discrimination by other supervisors that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We say if

I don't think that has any

14

bearing on the ruling that the trial judge made that's

15

under review in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth

16

Circuit and that we're looking at here.

17

MR. EGAN:

Well, Your Honor, it goes to

18

whether or not saying that there's going to be a lengthy

19

trial it is some evidence as you look at what the actual

20

experience is -- look at the cases cited by the

21

defendant.

22

We cited them in our brief.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

They may have just thought

23

the game isn't worth the candle.

Just thought we've

24

sunk so much money into this case by now and it's just

not worth the risk.

But

they should be not take out the legs from the plaintiffs

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's the problem that

5

concerns me.

It is not the question of whether the

6

trial is going to last for three weeks.

7

question at the prospect that the trial will last for

8

three weeks and they will have to go out and find other

you rule on 403 it seems to me.

All of these things are relevant to how

MR. EGAN:

Your Honor, we're simply asking

for balance, because other supervisors JUSTICE SOUTER:

Doesn't that get to the

17

point, though, hasn't the last hour of questioning from

18

the court shown that what we really ought to take place

19

here is a remand to the trial court for a 403 balance?

20

MR. EGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MR. EGAN:

Okay.

If I might offer some concluding

23

thoughts because my time is running down.

The district

24

court erred in categorically barring all other

25

supervisor evidence.

It was a categorical bar.

When

you get into the chronology of what happened, you will

2

see no indication otherwise.

4

under rule 401 -

5

Neither Rule 401 nor Rule

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As I mentioned

So you think the

6

court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the

7

evidence was admissible?

8

answer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a

9

403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the

Because as I understand your

10

district court to undertake that.

11

MR. EGAN:

Your Honor, I think that what the

12

-- my reading of the Tenth Circuit, for what it's worth,

13

is that they were looking at the exclusionary order

14

based on the wrong legal rule and said, we are going to

15

reverse that.

16

that the evidence is overly prejudicial, since that's

17

basically all that they were looking at.

18

And that we see nothing that indicates

There could be, and we assume there would

19

be, new motions filed upon remand, in which case we'll

20

answer anything going to the merits because we've never

21

been allowed to talk about the content of the testimony

22

itself.

23

prejudicial?

24
25

Will it be cumulative?

Is it overly

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if on the remand

that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the context of a motion in limine and not in the context

2

of a new trial?

3

MR. EGAN:

It should be in the context of

4

going back and being remanded, for the court maybe to

5

make determination, but our position is in the context

6

of a new trial the court can address any new motion that

7

hasn't been made.

8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think a new

trial is required for the district court to make the 403
determination?

11

MR. EGAN:

I think that you have to get back

12

before the district court procedurally.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

Has this Court said that

403 determinations must always be made on the record?

15

MR. EGAN:

No, Your Honor, you haven't said

16

that they should be on the record, but we're not asking

17

for that.

18

We're asking for some indication of what JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I thought that's

19

precisely what you are saying, that that there is no

20

balancing shown, that he didn't do the balance.

21

MR. EGAN:

Well, Your Honor, there should -

22

we believe, if -- as you write the opinion, there should

23

be -- the court should show there work.

24

-- as I was taught in grade school, you your work so

25

that we know what you did rule on.

That doesn't seem proper.

MR. EGAN:

Now if the -- if the trial court

No, Your Honor, if may I answer

that question.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. EGAN:

Yes.

The only thing that can't happen

13

on remand --

I want to make sure this is clear -- is

14

that the judge can't exclude on the same basis that

15

caused the problem the first time; that is, well, it is

not Reddick; it's excluded.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. CANE, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CANE:

Let me begin by addressing

Justice Kennedy's question about the Rule 403 issue.
58
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think there are two reasons why no remand is necessary.

2

The first, as Justice Scalia said, is that you assume

3

that the order is correct.

4

incorrect.

5

You don't assume that it's

The second JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- how can we

6

make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know

7

why this district judge ruled as he or she did?

8

a precedent.

9

We said, categorically, it's got to be the same

It -- it dealt with employee discipline.

supervisor; otherwise it's not relevant.

11
12

The district judge was simply applying that
case to this case.

13

MR. CANE:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15
16

We had

question.

Neither So it wasn't any 403

It was this doesn't some in.
MR. CANE:

Neither that case nor this case

17

involved any attempt to show that foundation, the

18

linkage between these other persons, these other alleged

19

bad actors, and the decision here.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's not -- the

21

point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an

22

absolute rule:

23

an absolute rule; that was our precedent.

24
25

It doesn't come in.

MR. CANE:

We know why he made

Well, I think the Tenth Circuit

-- it -- it applied the incorrect presumption.
59
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should have applied the presumption that an evidentiary

2

ruling is correct rather than incorrect.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

How could ut have been?

4

What about the date problem he just mentioned?

5

-- your opponent said that when you filed this motion in

6

limine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't

7

been any fact-specific things at all brought up in the

8

trial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly

9

none in the notion that I could see.

10

MR. CANE:

You said

Well, that always will be true in

11

the case of a motion in limine.

12

limine anticipated the specific evidence that had

13

emerged in discovery -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the motion in

But where does it say?

I

15

can't find in the motion, although there is something on

16

disparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I

17

don't know about the general mine run of cases, but in

18

this particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it

19

is a waste -- it's not -- it is a waste of time.

20

just can't find that.

21

MR. CANE:

Now, I

I don't think district judges can

22

be expected to, you know, write opinions that are -- to

23

be affirmed to be worthy of publication in F. Supp.2d. I

24

think the district court considers the evidence thrown

25

at him or her, and in this case all 60

before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The court was not setting

You said there were two

points about 403.
MR. CANE:

Yes, the second is I agree with

17

Justice Alito's observation, or I think it was his

18

observation, that it would have been abuse -- an of

19

discretion to admit this evidence anyway; and so that

20

gets you easily by the 403 issue.

21

need -- there's a lot of court of appeals cases that say

22

that where 403 factors are obvious, where they're

23

implicit, there's not any obligation on the court of

24

appeals' part -- or on the district court's part -- to

25

-- to set them forth and explicitly engage in

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you not think that

3

there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit

4

recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute

5

bar?

6

when we don't know that the district court didn't take

7

it as an absolute rule, that -- this is a point of law

8

that should be clarified for the benefit of district

9

courts.

10

If we just assume in favor of the district court,

Either there's a categorical bar or there's

not.

11

MR. CANE:

I think that, absent some showing

12

of relationship of nexus, then the presumptive rule in

13

the run of cases should be that this evidence should not

14

be admitted.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you don't want that

16

clarification to be done at the expense your client, I

17

take it?
