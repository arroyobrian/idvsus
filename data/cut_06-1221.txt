5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there anything in the

other parts of the record colloquy, comments by the

10

district judge, that you think Respondents have called

11

to our attention to indicate that he had this sweeping

12

view?

13

MR. CANE:

No.

I don't think that's what

14

the court was focusing on.

15

on the nexus of the disputed witnesses to the plaintiff.

16

The district court did not hand out a cookie cutter

17

ruling at the courthouse door.

18

not say oh, this is a discrimination case, hear are the

19

rules of evidence I apply in a discrimination case.

20

What the district court here did was consider Sprint's

21

motion in limine, which was grounded in the evidence

22

that had emerged in discovery in this case.

The plaintiff then filed a witness list,

2

which explained what each of the disputed witnesses

3

would say in this case; and the plaintiff finally made

4

an offer of proof which again collaborated on what

5

plaintiff contended the disputed witnesses would say in

6

this case.

MR. CANE:

Did the district

It didn't, did it?

The district court did not

12

specifically invoke rule 403.

The motion in limine relied on both 401 and

15

403, the district court told counsel that she wanted the

16

17

not be distracted by claims of others.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

grounded on 401, it was error, wasn't it?

situation, that one was -- it may not be strong

senior management, then I think that would be an

7

appropriate foundation.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

So, if we've

got 19 and there's a question of 1, we've got a nexus.

irrelevant, and that would be the rule in the normal run

of cases, at least in dealing with entities of this

And the guiding principle was that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I assume it would

call; the company would say we don't think they're

Yes.

If that's the way to do it,

you didn't do it that way, did you?

I mean, as I read

10

it -- they put in here, on 163a, the motion that you

11

made to the district court said that you have to be

12

"similarly situated" -- "Plaintiff has to have been

13

'similarly situated' with other employees" -- and you

14

put that in quotes -- "similarly situated."

15

you say "employees may be 'similarly situated' only if

16

they have the same supervisor."

17

wasn't a period actually, but the rest of the sentence

isn't important.

argument you made, and this was the argument the

4

district judge adopted.

5

MR. CANE:

Is that not so or is it so?
That is so, but what the district

6

judge adopted was grounded in the offer of proof that

7

had been made here and the evidence that was proffered

8

here.

The district court was not issuing a blanket

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah.

13

I'm quoting the

And then you say, "Employees may

clear, since he used the same words and substituted the

19

word "Paul Reddick" for the same supervisor, that he was

20

taking that right from your brief where you made that

general argument and said nothing about the particular

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you want to defend

2

the harder ground, I understand.

But what Justice

3

Breyer has just said is not necessarily so.

4

"similarly situated" argument applies under 403 as well.

5

If they're similarly situated, the -- the time it would

6

take to let in these other things and rebuttal of them,

7

plus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be

8

outweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated,

9

and, therefore, that it is stronger proof.

that one can tell from the district court's order

11

whether the district court was relying on 401 or 403.

403. 	 I think you're digging a hole for yourself.

14

MR. CANE:

No, I absolutely want to defend

I think it can happen both ways.

15

And really here it happened both ways, too, because

16

although it was teed up as a motion in limine, as the

17

trial evolved, the district court actually relaxed her

18

ruling and expanded it to permit attacks both on

19

Reddick, who was the direct supervisor, but also

20

decisions made by Blessing, who was Reddick's boss.

That's correct.

But these

plaintiff had no connection.

And, more importantly, the other

and a Rule 403 JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you say -- I thought

3

you said in your reply brief that other-supervisor

4

evidence could be relevant.

5

MR. CANE:

It could be relevant if there

6

were a showing that the bias on the part of the other

7

supervisors somehow tainted the decision making of the

8

instant decisionmaker.

9

And in the cases that Ms. Mendelsohn cites

10

in her brief, those are all cases in which a directive

11

was given from a more senior official to the

12

decisionmaker.

13

What we have here are decisionmakers in

14

far-flung areas elsewhere within the company with no

15

showing whatsoever that there is any relationship

16

between them.

17

Each of the five disputed witnesses here

18

testified in deposition that they had no information

19

whatsoever to shed about the decisionmakers with respect

20

to Ms. Mendelsohn.

21

And so in those circumstances there's no

showing of nexus.

actors had a motivating part in the whole situation?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

supervisor outside the chain of command who commits

another "me, too" act, but that is communicated to the

I think the individual has a character, and

there is no character-evidence problem with showing that

a particular decisionmaker engaged in other

discriminatory conduct, because I think that falls

25

within the exception to 404.

But where the

13

Evidence of discrimination by other

14

supervisors within the company is sometimes but not

always admissible in a disparate-treatment case to help

16

prove discrimination by the plaintiff's own supervisor.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's under -

18

under 401, it's not always admissible, or do you need

19

403 to reach that conclusion?

20

MR. GARRE:

I think you need to look at the

21

evidence under both rules, the first question being

22

whether it meets the minimum-evidence threshold in 401.

And that is a very low threshold set by the Federal

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GARRE:

You have a company of 70,000

same division, implementing the same company-wide

18

19

similar explanations under similar circumstances,

20

engaged in discrimination.

21

We think that the district dissenting judge

22

in the court of appeals was right to say that evidence

23

of that kind is at least marginally relevant, which

24

would then put the focus on whether this evidence could

25

be excluded under 403.

a broad threshold that allows evidence in.

And then we

How do you articulate the

Well, I would point to several

22

criteria, Justice Scalia, in determining relevance.

23

First, whether you're dealing with same alleged -- same

24

kind of alleged discrimination and a common catalyst;

25

second, whether the proffered witnesses are working in
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the same corporate vicinity; third, whether they are

2

alleging discrimination in the same time frame; four,

3

whether they are alleging a pattern or practice of

4

discrimination.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's the relevant

6

factors, but what do you look at the factors to

7

determine -- what's the test for determining whether

8

they are sufficient?

9

MR. GARRE:

Well, you would look at the

10

proffered evidence.

For example, in this case you have

11

evidence that all of the proffered witnesses were

12

terminated under the same companywide reduction in

13

force.

You've got a common catalyst.

14

In this case, you've got employees who

15

worked in the same geographic vicinity, the headquarters

16

of Sprint, the same office complex or at least the same

17

vicinity.

18

16

17

a matter of law that's not a -- going to prove a pattern

18

of practice, and the employer can make that argument to

19

the district judge, to the jury, and that evidence could

20

be limited or excluded.

21

-- a proffered witness who's complaining that

22

supervisors in the same complex used the same

23

distinctive explanation that my supervisor gave me -

trial, the critical issue.

It came up not only in the

context of the motion in limine, it came up in the

context of the motion for a new trial.

3

at what the district court said in denying a motion for

4

a new trial, she said again -- and this is on page 436

5

of the JA -- she says, "none of the proffered evidence

makes it more likely that the decisionmakers in this

case discriminated against the plaintiff."

That's relevance language, and you're quite
right -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The determination of

the relevance of the "me, too" evidence -- and I assume

also the 403 status -- needs to be made at the motion in

MR. GARRE:

Well, the district court serves

as a gateway.

17

or not evidence is relevant, and whether or not it

18

should be excluded under 403.

District courts have tremendous

So that determination is

In some cases, as happened in the

21

Huddlestone case -- that was a 404(d) case -- the court

22

acknowledged in some cases the evidence may go in and

23

then the jury may instruct that that evidence is

24

allowed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

case, does that get admitted to the jury?

3

4

MR. GARRE:

Or is that

Well, if you're pointing to

5

other acts of discrimination by other supervisors that

are relevant, then that would be allowed in, and the

I asked you as a trial lawyer -- is that if you take 401

21

and 402 and read them literally, we'll have trials that

last a thousand years.

And, really, the way a trial judge keeps the

this court of appeals is trying to second-guess that

If I might offer some concluding

23

thoughts because my time is running down.

The district

24

court erred in categorically barring all other

25

supervisor evidence.

It was a categorical bar.
55

Alderson Reporting Company

When

you get into the chronology of what happened, you will

2

see no indication otherwise.

3

403 support such a blanket prohibition.

4

under rule 401 -

5

Neither Rule 401 nor Rule

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

As I mentioned

So you think the

6

court of appeals erred as well in ruling that the

7

evidence was admissible?

8

answer to Justice Souter, it is that there should be a

9

403 evaluation and the court of appeals didn't allow the

Because as I understand your

10

district court to undertake that.

11

MR. EGAN:

Your Honor, I think that what the

12

-- my reading of the Tenth Circuit, for what it's worth,

13

is that they were looking at the exclusionary order

14

based on the wrong legal rule and said, we are going to

15

reverse that.

16

that the evidence is overly prejudicial, since that's

17

basically all that they were looking at.

18

And that we see nothing that indicates

There could be, and we assume there would

19

be, new motions filed upon remand, in which case we'll

20

answer anything going to the merits because we've never

21

been allowed to talk about the content of the testimony

22

itself.

23

prejudicial?

24
25

Will it be cumulative?

Is it overly

We've got -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And if on the remand

that you conceded is necessary, that will take place in
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the context of a motion in limine and not in the context

2

of a new trial?

3

MR. EGAN:

It should be in the context of

4

going back and being remanded, for the court maybe to

5

make determination, but our position is in the context

6

of a new trial the court can address any new motion that

7

hasn't been made.

8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think a new

trial is required for the district court to make the 403
determination?

11

MR. EGAN:

I think that you have to get back

12

before the district court procedurally.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

Has this Court said that

403 determinations must always be made on the record?

15

MR. EGAN:

No, Your Honor, you haven't said

16

that they should be on the record, but we're not asking

17

for that.

18

We're asking for some indication of what JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I thought that's

19

precisely what you are saying, that that there is no

20

balancing shown, that he didn't do the balance.

21

MR. EGAN:

Well, Your Honor, there should -

22

we believe, if -- as you write the opinion, there should

23

be -- the court should show there work.

24

-- as I was taught in grade school, you your work so

25

that we know what you did rule on.
57
Alderson Reporting Company

You know, it's

They should follow

the rules as well.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems very strange to me

3

that we -- there's been -- the case went to the jury

4

without the evidence you wanted to get in.

5

found for the company.

6

is going to properly exclude the evidence under 403, we

7

should then have the very same trial with a new jury?

8

That doesn't seem proper.

9
10

MR. EGAN:

The jury

Now if the -- if the trial court

No, Your Honor, if may I answer

that question.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. EGAN:

Yes.

The only thing that can't happen

13

on remand --

I want to make sure this is clear -- is

14

that the judge can't exclude on the same basis that

15

caused the problem the first time; that is, well, it is

16

not Reddick; it's excluded.

17

Any other factors would be open.

Not Reddick, it's excluded.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. CANE, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CANE:

Let me begin by addressing

Justice Kennedy's question about the Rule 403 issue.
58
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think there are two reasons why no remand is necessary.

2

The first, as Justice Scalia said, is that you assume

3

that the order is correct.

4

incorrect.

5

You don't assume that it's

The second JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- how can we

6

make that assumption when the Tenth Circuit says we know

7

why this district judge ruled as he or she did?

8

a precedent.

9

We said, categorically, it's got to be the same

10

It -- it dealt with employee discipline.

supervisor; otherwise it's not relevant.

11
12

The district judge was simply applying that
case to this case.

13

MR. CANE:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15
16

We had

question.

Neither So it wasn't any 403

It was this doesn't some in.
MR. CANE:

Neither that case nor this case

17

involved any attempt to show that foundation, the

18

linkage between these other persons, these other alleged

19

bad actors, and the decision here.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's not -- the

21

point is that the Tenth Circuit said this judge made an

22

absolute rule:

23

an absolute rule; that was our precedent.

24
25

It doesn't come in.

MR. CANE:

We know why he made

Well, I think the Tenth Circuit

-- it -- it applied the incorrect presumption.
59
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should have applied the presumption that an evidentiary

2

ruling is correct rather than incorrect.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

How could ut have been?

4

What about the date problem he just mentioned?

5

-- your opponent said that when you filed this motion in

6

limine on December 15, 2004, by that time, there hadn't

7

been any fact-specific things at all brought up in the

8

trial that were relevant to this, and there's certainly

9

none in the notion that I could see.

10

MR. CANE:

You said

Well, that always will be true in

11

the case of a motion in limine.

12

limine anticipated the specific evidence that had

13

emerged in discovery -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the motion in

But where does it say?

I

15

can't find in the motion, although there is something on

16

disparate impact, anything that says well, you see, I

17

don't know about the general mine run of cases, but in

18

this particular case, it's not sufficiently material, it

19

is a waste -- it's not -- it is a waste of time.

20

just can't find that.

21

MR. CANE:

Now, I

I don't think district judges can

22

be expected to, you know, write opinions that are -- to

23

be affirmed to be worthy of publication in F. Supp.2d. I

24

think the district court considers the evidence thrown

25

at him or her, and in this case all 60

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did anyone argue that

2

before December 15, 2004, that we don't know about the

3

mine run of cases, but this case, in fact it's a waste

4

of time?

MR. CANE:

they or didn't they?
MR. CANE:

No.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. CANE:

Okay.

Because that's when the court

12

considered notions in limine.

13

standards in anticipation of a trial until the trial.

14
15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The court was not setting

You said there were two

points about 403.
MR. CANE:

Yes, the second is I agree with

17

Justice Alito's observation, or I think it was his

18

observation, that it would have been abuse -- an of

19

discretion to admit this evidence anyway; and so that

20

gets you easily by the 403 issue.

21

need -- there's a lot of court of appeals cases that say

22

that where 403 factors are obvious, where they're

23

implicit, there's not any obligation on the court of

24

appeals' part -- or on the district court's part -- to

25

-- to set them forth and explicitly engage in

I don't think you

Alderson Reporting Company

rebalancing.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you not think that

3

there is an important value that the Tenth Circuit

4

recognized in making it clear that there is no absolute

5

bar?

6

when we don't know that the district court didn't take

7

it as an absolute rule, that -- this is a point of law

8

that should be clarified for the benefit of district

9

courts.

10

If we just assume in favor of the district court,

Either there's a categorical bar or there's

not.

11

MR. CANE:

I think that, absent some showing

12

of relationship of nexus, then the presumptive rule in

13

the run of cases should be that this evidence should not

14

be admitted.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you don't want that

16

clarification to be done at the expense your client, I

17

take it?

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. CANE:

20

Let me respond to a couple of the Solicitor

Of course not.
