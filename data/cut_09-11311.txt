categories.

a continuum of behavior ranging from merely failing to

21

stop, on the low end, which is the crime Mr. Sykes was

22

convicted of violating, all the way to fleeing which

23

results in the death of a police officer, on the high

end, which in Indiana is a class A felony.

the Indiana Court of Appeals was in response to a

13

position taken by the defendant, sort of along the lines

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think the problem with

your argument is that the prosecution is not under any

obligation to charge any offense greater than the

which there is a very grave risk created by a flight.

The prosecutor -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

So you -- the fact that

5

someone is convicted of this offense does not show that

6

a broad category of offenses within this crime lack the

7

risk that's necessary under the Armed Career Criminal

8

Act.

9

MR. MARSH:

Well, I suggest that it does,

10

Your Honor, because the -- the James case makes clear

11

that the court will determine whether the crime creates

12

a serious potential risk of physical injury to another

by looking at the conduct encompassed by the elements of

the offense.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I -- I don't know how

we could proceed by looking at, you know, whether in

fact a majority of the cases that come into this first

10

situations that involved physical risk because, as

2

everybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's

3

probably very often the case that the defendant is

4

charged only under -- under category 1, where, you know,

5

if he went to trial, they'd charge him under 3; isn't

6

that so?

MR. MARSH:

But, of course, Your Honor -­
Yes, yes.

You want to say

MR. MARSH:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you.

Yes.

Well, I still -- look, what

13

I'm thinking of -- and I need a little explanation -- we

14

look to see in (b), and it says it's a class D felony if

15

a vehicle is used.

That's (A) under (1).

16

MR. MARSH:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Am I right?

Yes.
Okay.

Then we look to (B)

18

under (1), and it's also a class D felony -- in other

words, the same -- if a vehicle is operated in a manner

20

that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can deal with it more

12

easily then, at least I have -- but what's worrying me

now is what we're supposed to do is:

to another?

So we're here trying to

decide whether the (A) one does.

MR. MARSH:

Yes.

know, and the reason I don't know is I don't know how

that offense language of (A) is applied in Indiana.

issue with the Government's definition of "aggressive,"

MR. MARSH:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

Well, Your Honor -­
How would you define it

MR. MARSH:

Your Honor, the best definition

of "aggressive" that I've seen was in the First Circuit

opinion in the Herrick case, which is cited in our

2

brief, which the First Circuit refers to as forceful

3

action, especially where intended to dominate or master.

4

But on general everyday language, it strikes

5

me that when a law enforcement officer wants somebody to

6

stop, whether they're in a vehicle or not, the fight or

7

flee sort of comes into play.

8

responds by going toward the police officer and

9

resisting in that way, which is the first part of this

10

Indiana statute, would be acting in an aggressive way.

11

The person who flees is not acting in an aggressive way.

They're trying to avoid the confrontation.

MR. MARSH:

because the Indiana General Assembly has decided in

22

those crimes are, is all the way from zero to 3 years in

24

in what the person's ultimate sentence will be.

MR. MARSH:

Justice Scalia's answer, which you have adopted, is that

But your -- your other argument is that (A),

MR. MARSH:

breaks down to the two parts of the Begay test.

In

The existence of (B) makes clear that the

10

degree of risk for violating (A) is not the same,

11

because if you accept the continuum of behavior as

created by the Indiana General Assembly, the person

13

who's convicted of (A) has not created a substantial

risk of bodily injury.

20

doesn't have to be physical injury to others.

MR. MARSH:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The general

Right.
Yet, ACCA defines

burglary as a qualifying crime of violence.

measuring risk, not by the elements of that crime, but

25

by something else, by some measure of incidents in which
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

violence might occur.

2

So how is that different than the

3

Government's argument here and the question that Justice

4

Breyer asked you, which was:

5

there's some forms of fleeing that might not pose a risk

6

of injury, but statistically there's a large number of

7

incidents in which violence follows.

8
9

It is true, potentially

So, how is that different than burglary?
That's really my question.

What -- it can't be that the

10

elements have to pose a risk of injury, because burglary

11

doesn't do that.

12

So, what -- how do we measure it?

MR. MARSH:

Your Honor, the inquiry, as the

13

Court said in James, is whether the conduct encompassed

14

by the elements of the offense presents the risk.

15

that's the -- the determination that the court has to

16

consider.

17

And

It's not -- it is not necessary, and I'm not

contending, that this crime is a violent felony only if

19

every conceivable violation of the statute constitutes a

20

risk of danger.

data is one way to do it.

13

of all the empirical data presented by the Government.

14

It relates to vehicular fleeing as if there was one

15

crime of vehicular fleeing, and most of it is -- is

16

calculated based on death or injury, and that, of

17

course, is not the category that we have here.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There isn't any here because

If -­

I suppose that if we agreed

19

with you that whether it is a violent crime depends upon

20

what other prosecutions for fleeing could have been

21

brought.

22

because there are other bigger ones for which he wasn't

23

charged, we could leave open the question of what -­

24

what happens in a State that has only one crime for

25

fleeing, and we would -- then we would have to confront

So, what's the enlightenment?

Your Honor, it's not a weird

situation, because the Indiana definition of the crime

12

of vehicular fleeing is not one all-encompassing crime.

13

It's -- they took the all-encompassing generic vehicular

14

fleeing and divided it into five subparts, which I

15

suggest makes it much easier to resolve the (b)(1)(A)

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

17
18
19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

Just a very quick moment of history, I

21

think, provides some useful background, and I'm on

22

page 3a of the appendix to the Government's brief.

23

Until 1998, subsection (B), which we've been talking

24

about, was the only class D felony that involved

25

vehicular flight in Indiana law.

In 1998, the Indiana

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

General Assembly broke out and enacted subsection (A) so

2

that in cases of vehicular flight prosecutors would not

3

have to prove risk; they would just have to prove that

4

defendant used a vehicle.

5

Since 1998, I have found 14 cases in the

6

Indiana Court of Appeals, one of which is the Hape case

7

that Justice Alito cited earlier.

8

as I can tell, proceeded under (A) and not under (B).

9

Of those 14 cases, 13 have enough facts to tell what the

All of them, so far

10

flight was -- of what kind; 10 involved speeding,

11

disregarding traffic laws, or striking an officer with a

12

vehicle.

13

non-risky behavior, and even that was not a defendant

14

who drove a short distance and then pulled over.

15

Of the other three, only one involved

cases?

18

MR. WALL:

Yes, Justice Scalia, these were

19

all litigated to conviction and taken up on appeal, and

20

the Indiana Court of Appeals addressed various legal

21

issues -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

-- 14 isn't very many.

24

of these cases aren't litigated.

MR. WALL:

Well, but that's not

2

extensive data, both empirical and otherwise, that

3

indicates that flight as a basic offense is very

4

dangerous.

5

The Government's point is that here we have

In -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I read your

6

brief, and I was -- I read your brief and was surprised

7

that when you're -- the list -- one of the things you

8

talk about to show that is media reports.

9

have a more concrete basis for -- for speculation than

10

You usually

media reports.

11

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, if that is all

12

we had put forward, I might agree with you, but we also

13

put forward extensive statistical data.

14

My point is just that Indiana is typical.

15

It's dangerous everywhere else.

16

dangerous as arson.

burglary.

18

one looks through these cases, these flights in Indiana

19

are typically quite dangerous.

qualify as a -- as a violent felony.

2

-- that doesn't seem to me right.

3

MR. WALL:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That doesn't seem

Justice Scalia, I thought -­
Just because prosecutors

5

make that choice, that doesn't establish that the

6

elements of the crime, which is what we focus on in

7

deciding whether it's a violent felony, fill the bill.

8
9

MR. WALL:

That's right.

This Court looks

at the conduct encompassed by the elements in a typical

10

case.

And in a typical case of vehicular flight, what

11

we have, according to the data, is someone fleeing

12

police at an average of 25 miles an hour over the speed

13

limit; someone who is, in a typical case, young, male,

14

unlicensed, under the influence of alcohol; and who

15

places the lives of other motorists, pedestrians, and

16

police in harm's way.

17

Your approach to ACCA, Justice Scalia, has

18

been to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements

19

and ask whether the risk from that conduct is at least

20

as great as the -- the least risky enumerated offense.

21

And here -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That ignores the in-kind

23

requirement of Begay, because you seem to be confusing

24

the risk of violence with the in-kind inquiry, and

25

that's where I'm trying -- I'd like you to concentrate a

little bit on, which is in burglary the defendant is

2

breaking into, generally, a place and going without

3

permission, and -- with an intent to commit a crime.

4

How is that comparable to merely not

stopping when a police officer tells you not to stop?

6

How is that an in-kind -­

7

MR. WALL:

Justice Sotomayor, it's

8

absolutely true, there are two parts to the test, and

9

we've been talking about the first risk.

On the second

10

prong, the purposeful, violent, or aggressive character

11

of the conduct -- here I think there are three distinct

12

things that make it purposeful, violent, and aggressive.

13

First, you have the defiance of the

14

officer's order, which can cause injury at the scene.

15

It has in some Indiana cases, but at least called the

16

officer to give chase.

17

Second, you have the very real prospect -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What you're doing is

19

saying I'm not -- you're not even saying I'm not

stopping; you're just driving away.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, yes, but you are driving -­
Now, how is that

MR. WALL:

You're driving away in response

to an officer's command to stop.

You're calling the

2

likely.

3

offenders drive typically very recklessly, and then

4

you've got the confrontation when the officers have

5

to -­

And even when there isn't pursuit, these

You're -- you're -- pursuit is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's the risk

MR. WALL:

-- terminate.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That -- that is all the

10

risk question, and you're confusing the police actions

11

with the defendant's, because you're talking about the

12

defendant responding to a police pursuit.

13

what is in the act of the crime that makes it in-kind to

14

burglary?

15

MR. WALL:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

So what -­

So, let me analogize -­
I concentrate on

burglary because the others don't fit.

18

MR. WALL:

No, let me concentrate on

19

burglary, then, and analogize it to what this Court said

20

in James.

22
23

It said the risk of attempted burglary -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Begay.

James -- James predated

So you've got -­
MR. WALL:

That's right, but I -- the Court

24

has talked about -- even in Chambers, about the risk of

25

a violent confrontation with law enforcement officials,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

and it's done that under the Begay part of the test.

2

And whereas that confrontation is only possible with

3

burglary, it's necessary with this crime.

4

that an officer order you to stop and that you flee.

5

It requires

So that -- that confrontation, which is only

6

a possibility with burglary or attempted burglary, is

7

elevated to a certainty with this offense.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Wall, wouldn't

that suggest that if I just ran from a police officer,
it would be a violent felony under ACCA?

11

MR. WALL:

I think it -- it would suggest

12

that, Justice Kagan, but I think flight on foot is

13

unlikely to satisfy the risk part of the test.

14

certainly this case is much easier on the -- the James

15

part of this test.

16

vehicle poses risks, very real risks, to other motorists

17

and pedestrians and police that flight on foot doesn't

18

pose, although you'd still have the confrontation when

19

the flight on foot was terminated.

20

the arguments would translate.

21

there would be more difficult questions, though, on the

22

risk prong.

23

I think

I think the -- the flight in a

So I think some of

You're right.

I think

This is a much easier case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do -- do words mean

And -- and you

want us to hold that failing to stop when a police

officer tells you to stop is a violent felony.

that seems to me a -- a big leap.

I think this is as dangerous, maybe even more dangerous

than escape from custody.

And this Court clearly indicated in -- in

If the Court were going to say that all

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. WALL:

Is that a violent felony?

Justice Scalia, I think then we'd

have a serious question about the first part of the

analysis and the -- the risk test.

15

over -- I mean, speeding as a generic offense is likely

16

to -- I mean, it encompasses categorically all speeding

offenses, many of which are, you know, not that -- not

likely to pose a serious risk to others.

19

we'd have to look at the -- the data.

20

here is data that says this offense is four times as

risky as the enumerated offense of arson.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I -- again,

Am I right about -- when

you replied to Justice Scalia, I thought that he had

said that we were dealing with a statute, and you seemed

to agree, that said it is a crime to flee a policeman

9

after being ordered to stop.

But I thought we were

10

dealing with a statute that says it is a crime to flee a

11

policeman after being ordered to stop, in a vehicle.

12

MR. WALL:

That's right.

That's right.

That's the offense here.

It's the vehicular flight

side has said, which is (A) and (B) are not tiered.

They're not greater and lesser offenses under State law.

But, Mr. Wall, suppose they

let's even say that the simple flight -- no, let's -­

2

let's call them all felonies but different classes of

3

felonies.

4

What would happen in that case?

5

still be here saying that the simple flight felony is a

6

violent crime?

7

MR. WALL:

Yes.

Would you

It's a tougher case, but we

8

would be here saying that, because when you're looking

9

at an offense categorically -- for instance, arson -­

10

you've got to look at all fires, all intentionally set

11

fires, the ones that don't hurt anybody, the ones that

12

do, and the ones that kill people, even though the fires

13

that kill people will be prosecutable in most

14

jurisdictions as a greater offense, like felony murder.

15

And so when you're looking at it categorically, you've

16

got to look at all of the conduct in that category, even

17

conduct that may be prosecutable under some greater

18

offense.

19

I think, you know, the other side sort of

20

relies on this assumption that all conduct which might

21

satisfy the greater will necessarily be prosecuted under

22

the greater.

23

within the lesser, and as a factual matter, it's just

24

not true that it always gets prosecuted under that

greater offense.

And as a legal matter, it's included

would make our case more difficult, but I think legally

those aggravators far outstrip the level of potential

risk that ACCA requires.

I've got 37 States

to prove risk.

the State that the conduct is risky on a typical basis:

We just want the State to prove you used a vehicle.

you should not thumb your nose at the police when they

aggressing against anyone, in the same way that if I

to get this in under the residual clause.

That's right, Justice Scalia, a

residual clause that, as you yourself have recognized,

20

is extremely broadly worded.

21

the quality of the enumerated offenses that they create

22

a serious potential risk of physical injury to others.

23

And I can't find any metric along which flight doesn't

do that, whether one looks through the cases, media

reports, the statistical data, whatever one -- Indiana,

It -- it abstracts out as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

44

nationally -- whatever standard or metric one uses, this

2

is an extremely risky offense to others.

3

And I, you know -- so it's very difficult to

4

figure out what test, what interpretation of that

5

language would exclude this from -- from ACCA.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you have one of 36

7

States which treat this -- treat the general offense as

8

a misdemeanor and then make it a felony if you put

9

somebody at risk.

Just reading that statute, you'd

10

think those 36 States, when they have the general

11

offense, do something where the guy acted pretty

12

trivially; and where it's a felony, he actually put

13

somebody at risk, sped off -- wouldn't that be your

14

normal instinct in just guessing from the -- from the

language?

23

25

MR. WALL:

The States treat it differently.

Some, as Indiana -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Alderson Reporting Company

Then that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

45

actually my question.

2

Federal statute, try to track whether it's a

3

misdemeanor, what the language is?

4

a nightmare of a Federal law for States to -- for judges

5

to figure this out.

6

thousands and thousands of possible variations could

7

make a difference as to whether it's violent or not,

8

depending on data which no one will have.

9

MR. WALL:

Are we supposed to, in this

We're going to have

I mean, every little variation in

Justice Breyer, I don't think so.

10

If the Court were to affirm here, what that would mean

11

is that the offense of flight is a violent felony

12

insofar as you have a predicate conviction under a State

13

statute where it's been punishable by up to a year, and

14

so it could qualify for ACCA coverage.

15

Now, some State convictions will have been

16

treated as misdemeanors and won't be eligible for ACCA,

17

but to the extent a State treats it as a felony, it's

18

risky enough to satisfy the residual clause.

19

the Court treats (A) and (B) as what they are not, which

20

is greater or lesser, then, yes, I think there will be

21

problems with various State statutes, as Justice Kagan

22

pointed out, and this Court may have to clear it up down

23

the road.

24
25

Now, if

But if it treats this basic offense as what
it is, not a greater or lesser, but alternative means of

proving a single offense that is risky, that would, I

2

think, take care of all flight cases going forward.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, on this question of

4

whether this statute is greater or lesser, it's greater

5

or lesser if you just understand (b)(1)(A) as confined

6

to vehicular flight.

7

at vehicular flight, then (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) are

8

indeed greater or lesser offenses.

9

In other words, if one looks only

MR. WALL:

Yes, Justice Kagan, if you're

10

looking only -- I take it you're looking only at the

11

vehicle prong of (B), but the test in Schmuck is whether

12

it's impossible to -- to commit the greater without

committing the lesser.

Is that -­

no, that (A) is a lesser included of (B)?

part of the elements of (B).

MR. WALL:

and there are cases in Indiana like that.
Alderson Reporting Company

So you can be

And you have

Official - Subject to Final Review

48

not -- you have not been fleeing in a vehicle from an

officer at any point, so you haven't violated (A).

3

So the existence of the other prong there -­

that's what I was trying to get into with Justice

Kagan -- means that this is not a greater or lesser

under Schmuck.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MR. WALL:

If you divided up the prongs

under Schmuck, but I think the Schmuck -- what follows

could -- you could run afoul of (B) by committing an

3

offense under subsection little (a) in some other ways,

4

but if you run afoul of (B) by committing the offense

5

of -- of flight from a law enforcement officer, it seems

6

to me that that automatically includes (A).

7

I mean, it -- it seems to me that, yes, you

MR. WALL:

Well, except that there are two

8

alternative means of proving the same offense under

State law.

They have the same State law penalties, so

10

the prosecutors can go under (A) or they can go under

(B).

12

years, they've been going under -- they've been going

13

under (A).

And as far as I can tell, for the last, say, 13

recognize about this offense is that, you know, in

the -- 50 percent of these offenders are ultimately

charged with a violation that's unrelated to their

2

And the reason I think that's important is

because what you will look -- the reason that they're

traveling at such high speeds, the reason they're

evading officers, the reason the typical case is not

2

answer to why this is just not identical to escape,

3

which is a fleeing-from situation just as this is.

4

MR. MARSH:

What's your best

Justice Sotomayor, the basic

5

distinction is that the person who's charged with

6

escape, assuming that escape means escape from a secure

7

institution or from a person, is that the person is in

8

custody, and it takes, in the ordinary case, aggression

9

and violence to get out of the custody of that person.

10

The person who is fleeing is trying to avoid being

11

taken.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, here an officer

13

has told you to stop.

Alito, but as the Court held in James, finding an

18

I'll -- I'm not sure the

I assume the ordinary prison escape

MR. MARSH:

The typical

Of course, the ordinary case or

19

the typical case, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the court

20

needs to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements

21

of the statute, and so we would have to look at exactly

22

what the statute requires.

23

The circuit courts have been very divided on

24

escape.

In my circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Federal

25

statute, 751, has been held not to be -- which is a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

general escape statute -- not to be a violent felony.

2

But, again, the Court talks about the ordinary case in

3

the James case for the purpose of disabusing the idea

4

that one can't get out from under the violent felony

5

designation just by coming up with a hypothetical case

6

or an example where it can be done without -- without

7

violence.

8
9

Here, I would suggest that counsel has just
created for the Court some kind of a hypothetical case

10

to define the typical or ordinary case.

11

never done that, and this Court said in James that it's

12

important to stick to the conduct encompassed by the

13

elements of the offense, because if we start factoring

14

in other kinds of conduct, as several of the things

15

which have been mentioned by counsel for the Government,

16

that begins to raise Apprendi problems, which is another

17

whole issue.

acknowledge is the law -- that so long as the

19

determination as to whether there's a serious potential

risk of physical injury is made by focusing on the

conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, then

there's not an Apprendi problem.
