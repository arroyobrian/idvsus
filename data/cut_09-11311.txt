ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM E. MARSH

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12
13

MR. MARSH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

The Armed Career Criminal Act enhances the

15

punishment for possession of a firearm or ammunition for

16

a person who has three previous convictions for a

17

violent felony.

18

vehicular fleeing, which Indiana has divided into five

19

categories.

20

a continuum of behavior ranging from merely failing to

21

stop, on the low end, which is the crime Mr. Sykes was

22

convicted of violating, all the way to fleeing which

23

results in the death of a police officer, on the high

24

end, which in Indiana is a class A felony.

25

This case involves, as you know,

Indiana statute treats vehicular fleeing as

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's in between?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MARSH:

The second tier up is what we

2

refer to as (b)(1)(B), which is fleeing which either

3

causes bodily injury or creates a substantial risk of

4

bodily injury.

5

causes serious bodily injury.

6

fleeing which causes a death.

The next category up is fleeing which
The fourth category is

7

This Court recognizes -

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10
11

So we can assume that the

conviction here did not involve any risk of bodily
injury to anybody?
MR. MARSH:

That's our position, Your Honor.

12

When the court considers the conduct encompassed by the

13

elements of the offense -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. MARSH:

16

Right.

-- then that conduct does not

involve conduct which creates a risk of bodily injury.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why is that -
I'm sure you'll do so in

19

the course of your argument, but at some point give us

20

some examples of violations of -- of this -- this

21

statute which from a commonsense standpoint don't

22

involve a serious risk.

24

find a safe place to pull over.

25

that because it's an intent crime.

There was something in the

I -- I didn't follow

I just don't see how

Official - Subject to Final Review

that would be a violation.

2

argument you could address those points.

3

MR. MARSH:

But if at some point in your

Well, I'd be happy to respond

4

now, Justice Kennedy.

5

referred to is the Indiana case of Woodward, from the

6

Indiana Court of Appeals, in which the court held that

7

exactly that conduct did violate this statute because

8

the -- knowingly or intentionally, the mens rea element,

9

goes only to fleeing and using a vehicle.

10

The court -- the case that you

So that was

one example -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. MARSH:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Looking -

-- of merely failing to stop.
I'm sorry.

Looking

14

-- looking -- I don't mean to interrupt your answer, but

15

looking for a safe place to stop violates the statute?

16
17
18

MR. MARSH:

That was the holding of the

Indiana Court of Appeals, yes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You're supposed to stop

19

dead in your tracks and not pull off on the shoulder?

20

mean, I don't -- I just don't understand this.

21

read the case, but -

22

MR. MARSH:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

I'll go

Well, the court didn't -
I don't drive in Indiana.

I think that's pretty tough.
MR. MARSH:

The court did not elaborate,

Alderson Reporting Company

I

1

Your Honor, on where the line is, but -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

it's a risk.

4

then everybody -

You stop in the middle of the road and

(Laughter.)

6

MR. MARSH:

7

10
11

That would be more likely to

create a risk, but the whole -

8
9

Maybe that's why -- why

JUSTICE SCALIA:
fleeing?

How can you say somebody is

I mean, doesn't fleeing mean you're trying to

escape the -- the officer?
MR. MARSH:

Justice Scalia, the holding of

12

the Indiana Court of Appeals was in response to a

13

position taken by the defendant, sort of along the lines

14

of the two lines of questioning, which is surely the

15

statute requires something more than merely failing to

16

stop, but the Indiana Court of Appeals used precisely

17

that language.

18

It -

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think the problem with

19

your argument is that the prosecution is not under any

20

obligation to charge any offense greater than the

21

offense for which your client was convicted in a case in

22

which there is a very grave risk created by a flight.

23

Isn't that true?

24
25

MR. MARSH:

The prosecutor is not under any

obligation; was that the question, Justice Alito?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. MARSH:

3

that's correct.

4

Yes.

Yes, I think that's -- I think

The prosecutor -

JUSTICE ALITO:

So you -- the fact that

5

someone is convicted of this offense does not show that

6

a broad category of offenses within this crime lack the

7

risk that's necessary under the Armed Career Criminal

8

Act.

9

MR. MARSH:

Well, I suggest that it does,

10

Your Honor, because the -- the James case makes clear

11

that the court will determine whether the crime creates

12

a serious potential risk of physical injury to another

13

by looking at the conduct encompassed by the elements of

14

the offense.

15

maybe could have been charged or was charged, I suggest,

16

on the categorical approach is not relevant.

17

Now, the fact that some other offense

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you familiar with the

18

case called Hape v. State, Indiana Court of Appeals

19

2009?

20

MR. MARSH:

I believe he was convicted

MR. MARSH:

But, of course, under the

13

categorical approach established by Taylor and followed

14

consistently by this Court since that time, the court

15

doesn't look at the facts of the individual case.

16

court looks at it categorically.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

So if the -

But looking at it

18

categorically, I've always thought, means you look to

19

see not just what the elements are on paper, but whether

20

the elements as -- as used in reality in the State are

21

applied to cases that do present -- in general, you

22

apply it to cases that do present a serious risk of

physical injury.

know because no one's gone and looked.

25

And you'd think the answer is we don't

Alderson Reporting Company

You could do it

just said that's my view of it.

2

The -- the -- so what do we do?

I mean, I

3

can deal with a lot of other States, but Arizona has

4

exactly the same classification of felony when you use a

5

vehicle and when you use a vehicle creating a serious

6

risk of physical harm to others.

7

provision, same statute, same category.

with that, in your opinion?

and 46 other States?

Are you following what I'm

It's in the same

grade it.

Yes.
In the other States, they

But here they don't.

Right.

17

course, does grade it, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. MARSH:

Well, Indiana, of

Indiana -- I'm sorry.

And it is significant that the

20

second most serious category is where the conduct does

21

present a substantial risk of bodily injury.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I -- I don't know how

23

we could proceed by looking at, you know, whether in

24

fact a majority of the cases that come into this first

25

relatively harmless category did indeed involve
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

situations that involved physical risk because, as

2

everybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's

3

probably very often the case that the defendant is

4

charged only under -- under category 1, where, you know,

5

if he went to trial, they'd charge him under 3; isn't

6

that so?

7

MR. MARSH:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

But, of course, Your Honor -
Yes, yes.

You want to say

"yes."

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. MARSH:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you.

Yes.

Well, I still -- look, what

13

I'm thinking of -- and I need a little explanation -- we

14

look to see in (b), and it says it's a class D felony if

15

a vehicle is used.

That's (A) under (1).

16

MR. MARSH:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Am I right?

Yes.
Okay.

Then we look to (B)

18

under (1), and it's also a class D felony -- in other

19

words, the same -- if a vehicle is operated in a manner

20

that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury.

21

MR. MARSH:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

that will say:

24

point of charging (B)?

25

Yes.

is exactly right.

the motivation of prosecutors generally, let alone in

this case.

this case, what it is generally.

significant that in 2006 the Indiana General Assembly

amended that statute so now the (B) violation carries

And it wouldn't really matter what it was in
But I think it's

with it a mandatory jail sentence, 60 days.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can deal with it more

12

easily then, at least I have -- but what's worrying me

13

now is what we're supposed to do is:

14

offense that presents a serious risk of physical injury

15

to another?

16

MR. MARSH:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

Is the offense an

Yes.
So we're here trying to

decide whether the (A) one does.

19

MR. MARSH:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the answer is I don't

21

know, and the reason I don't know is I don't know how

22

that offense language of (A) is applied in Indiana.

23

MR. MARSH:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the -
Counsel, do you know if

Indiana has an enhancement for convictions, sentencing

Official - Subject to Final Review

enhancement of any kind, for convictions that have an

2

element of -- of risk of harm to others?

3

MR. MARSH:

Your Honor, there are a number

4

of habitual sentencing enhancements, one of which

5

specifically relates to driving.

6

based on substantial -

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I can't say that it is

So it's possible that

8

there is a -- there's a use of the difference between

9

the two categories that might not be implicated in this

10

case but may lay the foundation for an enhancement

11

later?

12

MR. MARSH:

Yes.

Now, that's a good point,

Justice Sotomayor.

14

Indiana relate to previous convictions, and so I can't

15

say for sure, but it's entirely possible that (B),

16

(b)(1)(B), would be a predicate crime for a habitual

17

traffic offender, which is what it's called.

18

The -- the enhancements generally in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In your brief, you take

19

issue with the Government's definition of "aggressive,"

20

but would you give us yours?

21

MR. MARSH:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

Well, Your Honor -
How would you define it

and on what basis?
MR. MARSH:

Your Honor, the best definition

of "aggressive" that I've seen was in the First Circuit
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

opinion in the Herrick case, which is cited in our

2

brief, which the First Circuit refers to as forceful

3

action, especially where intended to dominate or master.

4

But on general everyday language, it strikes

5

me that when a law enforcement officer wants somebody to

6

stop, whether they're in a vehicle or not, the fight or

7

flee sort of comes into play.

8

responds by going toward the police officer and

9

resisting in that way, which is the first part of this

10

Indiana statute, would be acting in an aggressive way.

11

The person who flees is not acting in an aggressive way.

12

They're trying to avoid the confrontation.

13

trying to get away from the law enforcement.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the person who

They're

Mr. Marsh, I take it that

15

you would agree that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony

16

under -- under ACCA; is that right?

MR. MARSH:

Your Honor, it may very well be.

18

It certainly would satisfy the risk element, similar in

19

risk to the -- to the Begay case.

20

still have to be decided whether it's violent and

21

aggressive, but it may very well be.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if we think that

23

(b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under ACCA, and we know

punishment, that they're both classed as a class D

14
1

felony, why should we make the distinction between the

2

two under ACCA?

3

MR. MARSH:

Your Honor, I would suggest

4

because the Indiana General Assembly has decided in

5

enacting this legislation that some vehicular fleeing

6

presents a substantial risk of bodily injury to another

7

and some doesn't, and they've drawn this distinction.

14

15

-- that the State thinks of them as equally severe.

16

if one is a violent felony under ACCA, there's an

17

argument that the other should be treated in the exact

18

same way.

19

Each has an element that the other

MR. MARSH:

And

Your Honor, I would suggest that

20

the State doesn't treat them as equally severe.

21

range of punishment for a class D felony, which both of

22

those crimes are, is all the way from zero to 3 years in

23

prison, and the actual conduct undoubtedly is a factor

24

in what the person's ultimate sentence will be.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

And it may well be that in

deciding whether to accept a plea bargain of being

2

guilty of (A) rather than going to trial on (B), if your

3

client has two violent felonies already on the book, you

4

might take -- take the plea bargain under (A) lest you

5

run afoul of the violent felony act.

6

MR. MARSH:

Yes, Your Honor, that's, of

7

course, entirely possible.

But, again, just as with the

8

categorical approach the court cannot take into account

9

the motives of prosecutors, I would suggest the motives

10

of defendants and defense lawyers can't be taken into

11

account, either.

12

that when Indiana enacted this statute, it was not

13

thinking of ACCA and predicate crimes, I -- I assume.

14

don't think the legislature takes those kind of things

into account.

Further, I think it's more important

Your argument -- one of your

main arguments, as I understand it, is that -- what I'll

call the simple offense doesn't qualify under ACCA

because cases involving a serious risk of bodily injury

23

fall under the aggravated category.

24

whether a repeal of the aggravated offense would change

different way.

3

the aggravated offense, State 2 has just the simple

elements are exactly the same?

be different because of the significance of the (B)

right.

13

violent or aggressive.

I -- it still would not be something that's

answering my question by making a totally different

argument.

17

offense, the presence of the aggravated offense, I would

18

appreciate an answer to it.

Insofar as you're relying on the aggravated

19

MR. MARSH:

Justice Alito, the -

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

In other words, you're

21

saying -- maybe I haven't made myself clear.

22

Justice Scalia's answer, which you have adopted, is that

23

if you look at (A) by itself, forget about the

24

aggravated offense completely; it doesn't qualify under

25

ACCA.

And that's -- that's one argument.
Alderson Reporting Company

You're --

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

But your -- your other argument is that (A),

2

the simple offense, doesn't qualify because of the

3

presence of (B).

4

makes sense.

5

And I'm trying to see whether that

MR. MARSH:

Yes, Justice Alito, I think it

6

breaks down to the two parts of the Begay test.

7

order to be a violent felony, it has to be similar in

8

kind and similar in degree of risk.

9

In

The existence of (B) makes clear that the

10

degree of risk for violating (A) is not the same,

11

because if you accept the continuum of behavior as

12

created by the Indiana General Assembly, the person

13

who's convicted of (A) has not created a substantial

14

risk of bodily injury.

15

It's -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, have you done

16

or looked at -- not every burglary has a risk of harm to

17

another or results in harm to another.

18

definition of burglary is entering without permission

19

and intent to commit a crime, and generically the crime

20

doesn't have to be physical injury to others.

21

MR. MARSH:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The general

Right.
Yet, ACCA defines

23

burglary as a qualifying crime of violence.

24

measuring risk, not by the elements of that crime, but

25

by something else, by some measure of incidents in which
Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

violence might occur.

2

So how is that different than the

3

Government's argument here and the question that Justice

4

Breyer asked you, which was:

5

there's some forms of fleeing that might not pose a risk

6

of injury, but statistically there's a large number of

7

It is true, potentially

So, how is that different than burglary?
That's really my question.

What -- it can't be that the

10

elements have to pose a risk of injury, because burglary

11

doesn't do that.

12

So, what -- how do we measure it?

MR. MARSH:

Your Honor, the inquiry, as the

13

Court said in James, is whether the conduct encompassed

14

by the elements of the offense presents the risk.

15

that's the -- the determination that the court has to

16

consider.

17

And

It's not -- it is not necessary, and I'm not

18

contending, that this crime is a violent felony only if

19

every conceivable violation of the statute constitutes a

20

risk of danger.

21
22

That -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that, that's my question:

Where do we draw the line?

I think that was what

Justice Breyer was trying to ask you earlier, which is:

more likely to follow than not in a particular type of

6

crime?

MR. MARSH:

10

Well, the line is defined by the

Serious potential risk of physical injury to

Now, how do you make that determination?

11

Well, the Court made clear in Chambers that empirical

12

data is one way to do it.

13

of all the empirical data presented by the Government.

14

It relates to vehicular fleeing as if there was one

15

crime of vehicular fleeing, and most of it is -- is

16

calculated based on death or injury, and that, of

17

course, is not the category that we have here.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There isn't any here because

If -

I suppose that if we agreed

19

with you that whether it is a violent crime depends upon

20

what other prosecutions for fleeing could have been

21

brought.

22

because there are other bigger ones for which he wasn't

23

charged, we could leave open the question of what -

24

what happens in a State that has only one crime for

25

fleeing, and we would -- then we would have to confront

If we agree with you that (1)(A) is negligible

But if we accept your notion that -- where

So, what's the enlightenment?

Your Honor, it's not a weird

situation, because the Indiana definition of the crime

12

of vehicular fleeing is not one all-encompassing crime.

13

It's -- they took the all-encompassing generic vehicular

fleeing and divided it into five subparts, which I

suggest makes it much easier to resolve the (b)(1)(A)

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

17
18
19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

Just a very quick moment of history, I

21

think, provides some useful background, and I'm on

22

page 3a of the appendix to the Government's brief.

23

Until 1998, subsection (B), which we've been talking

24

about, was the only class D felony that involved

25

vehicular flight in Indiana law.

In 1998, the Indiana

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

25
1

General Assembly broke out and enacted subsection (A) so

2

that in cases of vehicular flight prosecutors would not

3

have to prove risk; they would just have to prove that

4

defendant used a vehicle.

5

Since 1998, I have found 14 cases in the

6

Indiana Court of Appeals, one of which is the Hape case

7

that Justice Alito cited earlier.

8

as I can tell, proceeded under (A) and not under (B).

9

Of those 14 cases, 13 have enough facts to tell what the

All of them, so far

10

flight was -- of what kind; 10 involved speeding,

11

disregarding traffic laws, or striking an officer with a

12

vehicle.

13

non-risky behavior, and even that was not a defendant

14

who drove a short distance and then pulled over.

15

a -

Of the other three, only one involved

cases?

18

MR. WALL:

Yes, Justice Scalia, these were

21

issues -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

-- 14 isn't very many.

24

of these cases aren't litigated.

2

extensive data, both empirical and otherwise, that

3

indicates that flight as a basic offense is very

4

dangerous.

5

The Government's point is that here we have

In -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I read your

6

brief, and I was -- I read your brief and was surprised

7

that when you're -- the list -- one of the things you

8

talk about to show that is media reports.

9

have a more concrete basis for -- for speculation than

10

You usually

media reports.

11

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, if that is all

12

we had put forward, I might agree with you, but we also

13

put forward extensive statistical data.

14

My point is just that Indiana is typical.

15

It's dangerous everywhere else.

16

dangerous as arson.

burglary.

18

one looks through these cases, these flights in Indiana

19

are typically quite dangerous.

And you're saying that if -- if you could

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

qualify as a -- as a violent felony.

2

-- that doesn't seem to me right.

3

MR. WALL:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That doesn't seem

Justice Scalia, I thought -
Just because prosecutors

5

make that choice, that doesn't establish that the

6

elements of the crime, which is what we focus on in

7

deciding whether it's a violent felony, fill the bill.

8
9

MR. WALL:

That's right.

This Court looks

at the conduct encompassed by the elements in a typical

10

case.

And in a typical case of vehicular flight, what

11

we have, according to the data, is someone fleeing

12

police at an average of 25 miles an hour over the speed

13

limit; someone who is, in a typical case, young, male,

14

unlicensed, under the influence of alcohol; and who

15

places the lives of other motorists, pedestrians, and

16

police in harm's way.

17

Your approach to ACCA, Justice Scalia, has

18

been to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements

19

and ask whether the risk from that conduct is at least

20

as great as the -- the least risky enumerated offense.

21

And here -

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That ignores the in-kind

23

requirement of Begay, because you seem to be confusing

24

the risk of violence with the in-kind inquiry, and

25

that's where I'm trying -- I'd like you to concentrate a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

little bit on, which is in burglary the defendant is

2

breaking into, generally, a place and going without

3

permission, and -- with an intent to commit a crime.

4

How is that comparable to merely not

5

stopping when a police officer tells you not to stop?

6

How is that an in-kind -

7

MR. WALL:

Justice Sotomayor, it's

8

absolutely true, there are two parts to the test, and

9

we've been talking about the first risk.

On the second

10

prong, the purposeful, violent, or aggressive character

11

of the conduct -- here I think there are three distinct

12

things that make it purposeful, violent, and aggressive.

13

First, you have the defiance of the

14

officer's order, which can cause injury at the scene.

15

It has in some Indiana cases, but at least called the

16

officer to give chase.

17

Second, you have the very real prospect -

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What you're doing is

19

saying I'm not -- you're not even saying I'm not

20

stopping; you're just driving away.

21

MR. WALL:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

Well, yes, but you are driving -
Now, how is that

aggressive -
MR. WALL:

You're driving away in response

to an officer's command to stop.

You're calling the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

officer to give chase.

2

likely.

3

offenders drive typically very recklessly, and then

4

you've got the confrontation when the officers have

5

to -

And even when there isn't pursuit, these

6
7

You're -- you're -- pursuit is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's the risk

of -

8

MR. WALL:

-- terminate.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That -- that is all the

10

risk question, and you're confusing the police actions

11

with the defendant's, because you're talking about the

12

defendant responding to a police pursuit.

13

what is in the act of the crime that makes it in-kind to

14

burglary?

15

MR. WALL:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

So what -

So, let me analogize -
I concentrate on

burglary because the others don't fit.

18

MR. WALL:

No, let me concentrate on

19

burglary, then, and analogize it to what this Court said

20

in James.

21
22
23

It said the risk of attempted burglary -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Begay.

James -- James predated

So you've got -
MR. WALL:

That's right, but I -- the Court

24

has talked about -- even in Chambers, about the risk of

25

a violent confrontation with law enforcement officials,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

and it's done that under the Begay part of the test.

2

And whereas that confrontation is only possible with

3

burglary, it's necessary with this crime.

4

that an officer order you to stop and that you flee.

5

It requires

So that -- that confrontation, which is only

6

a possibility with burglary or attempted burglary, is

7

elevated to a certainty with this offense.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Wall, wouldn't

that suggest that if I just ran from a police officer,
it would be a violent felony under ACCA?

11

MR. WALL:

I think it -- it would suggest

12

that, Justice Kagan, but I think flight on foot is

13

unlikely to satisfy the risk part of the test.

14

certainly this case is much easier on the -- the James

15

part of this test.

16

vehicle poses risks, very real risks, to other motorists

17

and pedestrians and police that flight on foot doesn't

18

pose, although you'd still have the confrontation when

19

the flight on foot was terminated.

20

the arguments would translate.

21

there would be more difficult questions, though, on the

22

risk prong.

23

I think

I think the -- the flight in a

So I think some of

You're right.

I think

This is a much easier case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do -- do words mean

24

nothing?

25

Alderson Reporting Company

And -- and you

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

want us to hold that failing to stop when a police

officer tells you to stop is a violent felony.

3

that seems to me a -- a big leap.

some meaning, and Congress focused on violent felonies.

MR. WALL:

what the difference would be between this and escape

14

Chambers that escape from custody was different from

failure to report under the statute in front of it.

I think this is as dangerous, maybe even more dangerous

than escape from custody.

18

And this Court clearly indicated in -- in

If the Court were going to say that all

Justice Scalia, I think then we'd

over -- I mean, speeding as a generic offense is likely

16

to -- I mean, it encompasses categorically all speeding

fires, the ones that don't hurt anybody, the ones that

12

do, and the ones that kill people, even though the fires

13

that kill people will be prosecutable in most

14

jurisdictions as a greater offense, like felony murder.

15

And so when you're looking at it categorically, you've

16

got to look at all of the conduct in that category, even

17

conduct that may be prosecutable under some greater

18

offense.

19

I think, you know, the other side sort of

20

relies on this assumption that all conduct which might

21

satisfy the greater will necessarily be prosecuted under

22

the greater.

23

within the lesser, and as a factual matter, it's just

24

not true that it always gets prosecuted under that

25

greater offense.

And as a legal matter, it's included

JUSTICE KAGAN:

which is the not violent crime.

risk that ACCA requires.

Not necessarily risky.

So, you know, there are nested statutes,

MR. WALL:

Justice Scalia, I mean I -

again, I think it is significant that in 1998 the

10

General Assembly broke this out as a separate subsection

11

and said:

to prove risk.

13

the State that the conduct is risky on a typical basis:

14

We just want the State to prove you used a vehicle.

15

We're not even going to require prosecutors
I think that represents a judgment by

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or even if it isn't risky,

16

you should not thumb your nose at the police when they

tell you to stop.

Well, that's right, and the

reason -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The reason you shouldn't, Justice

Scalia, is because that's the kind of purposeful,

violent, and aggressive conduct the State wants to deter

is extremely broadly worded.

the quality of the enumerated offenses that they create

22

a serious potential risk of physical injury to others.

23

And I can't find any metric along which flight doesn't

do that, whether one looks through the cases, media

reports, the statistical data, whatever one -- Indiana,

nationally -- whatever standard or metric one uses, this

2

is an extremely risky offense to others.

3

And I, you know -- so it's very difficult to

4

figure out what test, what interpretation of that

5

language would exclude this from -- from ACCA.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you have one of 36

7

States which treat this -- treat the general offense as

8

a misdemeanor and then make it a felony if you put

9

somebody at risk.

Just reading that statute, you'd

10

think those 36 States, when they have the general

11

offense, do something where the guy acted pretty

12

trivially; and where it's a felony, he actually put

13

somebody at risk, sped off -- wouldn't that be your

14

normal instinct in just guessing from the -- from the

language?

16

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer, the States -
How are we supposed to

treat those, where there's a misdemeanor -

MR. WALL:

The States -

JUSTICE BREYER:

In your opinion, it's just

21

a misdemeanor, we also treat it the same way; say it's a

22

violent felony?

23
24
25

MR. WALL:

The States treat it differently.

Some, as Indiana -
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Alderson Reporting Company

Then that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

45

actually my question.

2

Federal statute, try to track whether it's a

3

misdemeanor, what the language is?

4

a nightmare of a Federal law for States to -- for judges

5

to figure this out.

6

thousands and thousands of possible variations could

7

make a difference as to whether it's violent or not,

8

depending on data which no one will have.

9

MR. WALL:

Are we supposed to, in this

We're going to have

I mean, every little variation in

Justice Breyer, I don't think so.

10

If the Court were to affirm here, what that would mean

11

is that the offense of flight is a violent felony

12

insofar as you have a predicate conviction under a State

13

statute where it's been punishable by up to a year, and

14

so it could qualify for ACCA coverage.

15

Now, some State convictions will have been

16

treated as misdemeanors and won't be eligible for ACCA,

17

but to the extent a State treats it as a felony, it's

18

risky enough to satisfy the residual clause.

19

the Court treats (A) and (B) as what they are not, which

20

is greater or lesser, then, yes, I think there will be

21

problems with various State statutes, as Justice Kagan

22

pointed out, and this Court may have to clear it up down

23

the road.

24
25

Now, if

But if it treats this basic offense as what
it is, not a greater or lesser, but alternative means of

proving a single offense that is risky, that would, I

2

think, take care of all flight cases going forward.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, on this question of

4

whether this statute is greater or lesser, it's greater

5

or lesser if you just understand (b)(1)(A) as confined

6

to vehicular flight.

7

at vehicular flight, then (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) are

8

indeed greater or lesser offenses.

9

In other words, if one looks only

MR. WALL:

Yes, Justice Kagan, if you're

10

looking only -- I take it you're looking only at the

11

vehicle prong of (B), but the test in Schmuck is whether

12

it's impossible to -- to commit the greater without

13

committing the lesser.

14

(B), because it does have the two other prongs, and I

15

think -

16

It's not impossible to commit

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you think that if I

17

flee in a vehicle, I could be prosecuted under both and

18

receive sentences under both?

19

MR. WALL:

No, I don't think so, because I

20

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm a little confused by

You don't

think that (B) is a lesser included of (A)?

Is that -

10
11
12
13

no, that (A) is a lesser included of (B)?
MR. WALL:

Your Honor, the Government does

not think that (A) is a lesser included of (B).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You can't commit (B)

14

without committing (A) first.

15

additional element, but all of the elements of (A) are

16

part of the elements of (B).

18

MR. WALL:

(B) has just one

So, how can it not be a

Well, the element of (B) that's

19

different, Justice Sotomayor, is the "while committing

and there are cases in Indiana like that.
Alderson Reporting Company

So you can be

And you have

Official - Subject to Final Review

48

not -- you have not been fleeing in a vehicle from an

officer at any point, so you haven't violated (A).

3

So the existence of the other prong there -

4

that's what I was trying to get into with Justice

Kagan -- means that this is not a greater or lesser

6

under Schmuck.

7
8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But as a vehicular flight

only, it would be greater or lesser.

9

MR. WALL:

If you divided up the prongs

under Schmuck, but I think the Schmuck -- what follows

2

could -- you could run afoul of (B) by committing an

3

offense under subsection little (a) in some other ways,

4

but if you run afoul of (B) by committing the offense

5

of -- of flight from a law enforcement officer, it seems

6

to me that that automatically includes (A).

7

I mean, it -- it seems to me that, yes, you

MR. WALL:

Well, except that there are two

8

alternative means of proving the same offense under

9

State law.

They have the same State law penalties, so

10

the prosecutors can go under (A) or they can go under

11

(B).

12

years, they've been going under -- they've been going

13

under (A).

And as far as I can tell, for the last, say, 13

So it's not -- Justice Scalia, it's not -

there are aggravators in this statute for injury or

I think

And I think one of the important things to

recognize about this offense is that, you know, in

the -- 50 percent of these offenders are ultimately

25

charged with a violation that's unrelated to their

2

And the reason I think that's important is

3

because what you will look -- the reason that they're

4

traveling at such high speeds, the reason they're

5

evading officers, the reason the typical case is not

2

answer to why this is just not identical to escape,

3

which is a fleeing-from situation just as this is.

4

MR. MARSH:

What's your best

Justice Sotomayor, the basic

5

distinction is that the person who's charged with

6

escape, assuming that escape means escape from a secure

7

institution or from a person, is that the person is in

8

custody, and it takes, in the ordinary case, aggression

9

and violence to get out of the custody of that person.

10

The person who is fleeing is trying to avoid being

11

taken.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, here an officer

13

has told you to stop.

something.

Alito, but as the Court held in James, finding an

solve the ordinary case.

16

17

case doesn't involve aggression.

18

I'll -- I'm not sure the

I assume the ordinary prison escape

MR. MARSH:

The typical

Of course, the ordinary case or

19

the typical case, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the court

20

needs to look at the conduct encompassed by the elements

21

of the statute, and so we would have to look at exactly

22

what the statute requires.

23

The circuit courts have been very divided on

24

escape.

In my circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Federal

25

statute, 751, has been held not to be -- which is a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

53
1

general escape statute -- not to be a violent felony.

2

But, again, the Court talks about the ordinary case in

3

the James case for the purpose of disabusing the idea

4

that one can't get out from under the violent felony

5

designation just by coming up with a hypothetical case

6

or an example where it can be done without -- without

7

violence.

8
9

Here, I would suggest that counsel has just
created for the Court some kind of a hypothetical case

10

to define the typical or ordinary case.

11

never done that, and this Court said in James that it's

12

important to stick to the conduct encompassed by the

13
