We'll hear argument

next in Case 10-704, Messerschmidt v. Millender.
Mr. Coates.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. COATES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Malley v. Briggs and United

12

States v. Leon, this Court set forth a very high

13

standard for denying qualified immunity in the civil

14

context or suppressing evidence in the criminal context

15

under circumstances where a police officer has procured

16

a warrant that is subsequently determined to be invalid.

17

Specifically, the Court held that the

18

initial magistrate's determination is -- is entitled to

19

great deference, and that you'll go behind that only in

20

cases where the officer falsified information or omitted

21

exculpatory information, where the affidavit was

22

bare-bones, or there was some indication that the

23

judicial officer did not perform the function, and then

24

a catch-all provision, where the warrant was so lacking

25

in indicia of probable cause that no reasonable officer

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

could even submit it for a magistrate's determination.

2

And specifically in Malley, the Court said it had to be

3

the actions of an officer that was plainly incompetent

4

or knowingly violating the law.

5

This case arises from a Ninth Circuit

6

decision that we submit does not apply the Court's

7

standards, under circumstances where the officer

8

submitted, far from a bare-bones affidavit, but a highly

9

detailed, factual affidavit that we submit provided

10

probable cause for the search or at least, under the

11

Court's qualified immunity jurisprudence, a reasonable

12

officer could believe that the warrant had probable

13

cause.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There -- I suppose

15

one new feature of the case is the fact that these

16

officers submitted the affidavit to their superiors, who

17

were -- were attorneys.

18

MR. COATES:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

Correct.

There -Have we -- have we

addressed that in a prior case?
MR. COATES:

I don't know that the Court --

22

the Court has -- in, I believe, the exclusion context I

23

think I have seen it.

24

believe it has, and the circuit courts certainly have

25

talked about that as an indicia of good faith, the

to the test we've set forth, if he's so stupid that --

8

that he -- he executes a warrant that no reasonable

9

officer could think was correct, he's -- he's in the

We -- we have a test that goes beyond good

Even if the officer is in good faith, according

pot, right?

11

MR. COATES:

Well, that -- that's the test

12

that the Court has set out.

13

plainly incompetent or knowingly violating the law.

14

I think what these are additional factual circumstances

15

that show at least the officer is trying to be careful,

16

that this isn't something that's been -- been tossed

17

off.

18

But it's a high test,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Counsel, I thought in

19

the Leon case that, in fact, just like the claim in this

20

case, that the affidavit was submitted to supervisors,

21

and the Court created the Leon test in spite of that.

So, to say do we have a case on point, Leon itself is on

I'm just saying that --

because supervisors decide, that it's okay, that that --

4

MR. COATES:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

That -- that simply

No.
-- exculpates someone

from responsibility?

7

MR. COATES:

Certainly not.

And as I say,

this comes up in the qualified immunity context

repeatedly among the circuit courts.

13

They've recognized

But it's not dispositive, not

I agree with -- I agree with that, Your

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Then let's

14

go to the other two ways that I think you're asking us

15

to overrule our precedent.

16

17

hasn't disclosed in the warrant.

pertinent information -- and that's why you would be let

21

off the hook -- how you can excuse a police officer when

22

he doesn't place that information in front of the

23

magistrate.

24
25

MR. COATES:

The first is the using

I'm having a little

The way that has generally come

up has not been in the validity of the warrant for

purposes of the Fourth Amendment, but in terms of

2

qualified immunity for the officer or exclusion of the

3

evidence under -- or not -- or nonsuppression, rather,

4

under the good faith exception.

5

officer, in light of the totality of the circumstances,

6

might not have recognized that the warrant was deficient

7

if the warrant otherwise isn't -- isn't bare-bones.

8
9
10

And it's whether the

And I think we -- Leon itself in footnote 23
incorporates the Harlow standard of totality of
circumstances.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me how, this case,

12

the bare-bone affidavit was sufficient?

13

that this defendant is a member of a gang, but when the

14

police officer is questioned, he's asked whether this

15

crime at issue had any connection to his gang

16

relationship, and the answer was no.

17

request in the warrant to search for all gang-related

18

indicia anything more than the general warrant that our

19

Founding Fathers in part passed the Fourth Amendment

20

against?

21
22

MR. COATES:

So, how is the

Oh, I mean, this is not per se

a gang crime --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. COATES:

25

All it says is

This is almost like --

Without -- without a doubt,

it's not a -- what we consider a gangland crime, one

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

gang member against the other.

It's a domestic assault

2

by a gang member on his girlfriend with a sawed-off

3

shotgun in public, right after police officers that were

4

there to protect her had left.

5

gang-related in that sense.

6

gang membership is irrelevant to the investigation in

7

this case.

8

fairly recognized, gang members have means to procure

9

and use weapons beyond that of ordinary people.

So, it's not

But I don't think that the

10

You know, as we note, and I think it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, if you have a gang

11

member and the crime has absolutely nothing to do with

12

gang membership -- that I think is the case here; it's a

13

domestic assault -- as long as you're a gang member,

14

then every warrant can say search for all gang-related

15

information?

16

it?

17

That's essentially your position, isn't

MR. COATES:

No, it isn't, because it's

18

always a fact-specific inquiry.

19

clear in Illinois v. Gates and for qualified immunity in

20

Anderson v. Creighton.

21

We're --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

in that assault, right?

24

MR. COATES:

25

The Court's made that

But you -- you said this

There is no gang activity involved

Well, the gentleman is using a

sawed-off shotgun, which is a weapon associated with --

Alderson Reporting Company

with gangs.

2

to think that there might be some connection to the

3

manner in which he procured that weapon, might hide that

4

weapon --

5

I don't think it's a stretch for an officer

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, anyone who has a

6

weapon and is a member of a gang then can be -- there

7

can be a search for any and all weapons and material

8

related to weapons?

9

MR. COATES:

Well, it depends on the

10

circumstances of the crime that you are investigating.

11

Here we have an assault, we have a domestic assault with

12

indications that the gentleman intends to continue it.

13

And, indeed, that's why the warrant is for all weapons,

14

because it would make little sense to say you can go and

15

you can find a sawed-off shotgun --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm -- I'm on to the part

17

about all gang-related activity, when the crime has

18

nothing to do with the -- with the gang.

stick to that.

It's identification

What do we do with the

officer's testimony when he said -- "Did you have any

21

reason to believe there were any more weapons in the

22

house?"

23

that, why would then he think that he has complete

24

license to go and ask for a warrant that's looking for

25

more guns, when there's only evidence of him possessing

He said, "No."

one?
MR. COATES:

Because, again, the nature of

gang membership is that gangs -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you're answering --

5

you're answering Justice Ginsburg by saying that any

6

time a gang member commits any crime, the police are

7

entitled to seek a warrant that permits the search for

8

anything they have in their home that relates to their

9

gang membership and to -- to guns?

10

MR. COATES:

No, because I think it depends.

11

Here we have a crime that definitely involves a gun,

12

involves an illegal gun --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That did not involve --

14

by the officer's admission and your own, that wasn't

15

gang-related.

16

MR. COATES:

The assault, correct.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. COATES:

The assault --

But the manner in which he

19

procures the weapon, might dispose of the weapon, and

20

nature of the weapon itself --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But wait a minute.

That

22

has nothing to do with the gang, unless you're saying

23

that you had proof that the gang did something illegally

you have to suggest that?

To what -Mr. Coates -- I'm sorry.

see that.

21

I mean, the one thing

At least I didn't

And then the statement that Justice

22

Sotomayor said, well, that's later on in a deposition.

23

So -- so, if I were the magistrate sitting there and I

24

read the -- the affidavit, I might think I did have

25

cause, at least it's close maybe, but -- to allow them

to search for all the guns in the house.

thought that this could be used to -- other guns could

be used to go after her again.

I might think

And, anyway, I might think he

at all for thinking that -- why isn't that the end of

it, if we're supposed to take that into account?

MR. COATES:

as he sets forth his experience as a gang officer and
the manner in which gangs dispose of, procure weapons --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But he didn't say much

about the gang.

13

MR. COATES:

No.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm asking you a specific

15

question.

I mean, if I were supposed to take into

16

account his statement, I had no reason -- to paraphrase

17

it a little -- for thinking that any of these guns,

18

other guns, were going to be used for any purpose that's

19

illegal -- if he'd said that afterwards, if I take that

20

into account, I say, why isn't that the end of the case?

21

He had no cause to ask for the other guns, period.

22

that was --

23

MR. COATES:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Now,

Well --- the question, I think

roughly, that you were being asked, and I would like to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14

hear the answer.

2

don't have the right to take it into account.

3

or don't I?

4

I thought the answer would be:

MR. COATES:

I

Now, do I

Well, I mean, it's an -- it's

5

an objective standard.

It's what a reasonable officer

6

would do with the facts before him.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. COATES:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait.

Before him?

Yes.
Or before the -- is -- do I

10

look at the affidavits and the warrant, or do I also

11

look at things that are in neither of those documents

12

but were in the officer's head?

13

MR. COATES:

For purposes of determining the

14

Fourth Amendment validity of the warrant, the Court has

15

said you -- you look at the warrant.

16

qualified immunity test and in the criminal suppression

17

context of good faith, you can go outside that and look

18

at the totality of what the officer knew and, if in

19

light of what he knew, whether he could have believed it

20

was so.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Under the

All right.

So, if I look

22

at whether he was in good faith, if he has any training

23

at all, I would guess that if he thought that there is

24

no -- I don't remember the exact words -- no reason, no

25

reason to believe there would be any weapons in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

house, no reason to believe there would be any handguns

2

in the house, and then I say, I want a warrant to search

3

for handguns in the house, it looks like you're asking

4

for a warrant to search for that for which you have no

5

reason to believe it's there.

6

thought was not good faith.

7

Fourth Amendment.

8
9

Now, that I would have
That was contrary to the

Why isn't it?

MR. COATES:

Because you -- you still have,

under 1524(a)(3) of the California Penal Code, the --

10

the ability to search for items that might be used with

11

the intent to commit another crime.

12

was --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think if this

Even though you can search

14

a person's house -- why don't I search the person's

15

house for an atomic bomb?

16

that?

17

But that is a constitutional search?

18

He says:

And I say:

Why are you doing

I have no reason to believe it's there.

MR. COATES:

Well, again, I think -- going

19

back here in terms of -- stepping back from good faith

20

as opposed to probable cause, I don't think it's

21

irrelevant that this guy is a gang member.

22

think it's unusual to think that, while you might know

23

specifically whether there's a handgun or not --

If it's a good faith test,
But the test we've
This -- this police

We don't have a good faith

test for this purpose.
MR. COATES:

Sure.

But a -- but the

12

standard is plainly incompetent or knowingly violating

13

the law, and I think -- again, there's enough detail in

14

there that I don't think it is illogical to say there's

15

some connection between gang membership and the

16

possibility or even the fair probability that there are

17

other weapons in a residence.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course --

So, whenever -- I'm sorry.
I was just going to

21

say, of course you're making the case somewhat harder

22

for yourself because the issue here is whether it was

23

reasonable for him to say let me check and see what my

24

superiors think about this and then, after that review,

25

for him to say let's see what the magistrate thinks

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

about this, right?

2

MR. COATES:

Correct.

It's a -- it's a

3

further step back, because it's whether it's even

4

reasonable for him to ask the magistrate for a

5

determination --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

What cause is there to

7

think -- what cause is there to think that the gang guns

8

will be used to commit a crime?

9

MR. COATES:

This is a gentleman who had

10

just perpetrated an assault with a sawed-off shotgun.

11

He didn't make -- specify, in terms of his threat, that

12

he would confine any further attack to a sawed-off

13

shotgun.

14

an officer to believe that if he found a .45-caliber

15

pistol there wrapped in gang colors that he should be

16

able to seize it to prevent a future attack.

I just don't think it's a stretch of logic for

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the -- the warrant

18

didn't just authorize, you know, firearms wrapped in

19

gang colors.

20

of gang membership, right?

It allowed him to search for any evidence

21

MR. COATES:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23
24
25

Correct.
But what possible purpose

could that serve?
MR. COATES:

Again, because the evidence of

gang -- indicia of gang membership could be used to tie

him to things in the residence that you might find,

2

absolutely.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
yes.

If they were wrapped in it,

But we know he's a gang member.

6

MR. COATES:

Sure.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, all that the finding of

8

gang membership decals or whatever they wear -- all that

9

would show is, indeed, this guy was a gang member.

10

MR. COATES:

And present

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

--

And even then --

Well -- excuse me, Your Honor.

13

And present in that particular premises, it might show

14

ownership or control, might show access to the weapons.

15

It's not irrelevant to that.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they -- they knew he

17

was in that premise.

18

understand how you can possibly search for indicia of

19

gang membership.

20

so what?

21

I mean, that -- I really don't

When you know the man's a gang member,

MR. COATES:

Well, again, Your Honor, it

22

ties him closer -- it shows him there at their property.

23

magistrate that -- what would that prove when there's

5

multiple members in the house?

8

individually with his moniker.

limited to that.

member of several gangs.

And now we're saying that should have jumped out to the

officers separately.

Thank you, counsel.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

3

When an officer follows the favored practice

4

under the Fourth Amendment of obtaining a warrant from a

5

neutral magistrate before conducting a search, the

6

officer in all but the most narrow circumstances can

7

rely on the magistrate's independent determination of

8

probable cause, without fear --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Srinivasan, there are

10

two categories of materials here.

11

other guns.

12

relating to gang membership.

13

categories present different questions, if we think that

14

one is more beyond the bounds than another, that the

15

officer might have qualified immunity for, let's say,

16

the guns but not the evidence of gang membership, what

17

would happen in this case at that point?

18

One is the search for

The other is the search for anything

MR. SRINIVASAN:

If we think that those two

Well, I think one of the

19

questions that would arise is whether the one as to

20

which you thought there was a problem would expand the

21

scope in a meaningful way, because if -- let's take Your

22

Honor's hypothesis that there's less of a reason to be

23

concerned about the firearms-related aspects of the

24

warrant than the gang-related parts of the warrant; then

25

the question would arise whether you would have a Fourth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

Amendment violation in the first place, because if the

2

gang-related parts of the warrant didn't expand the

3

scope of the search in such a way that would implicate

4

independent privacy interests, there wouldn't be a

5

Fourth Amendment problem with that aspect of the

6

warrant.

7

qualified immunity issue for sure.

And, therefore, there -- you wouldn't have a

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what does that depend

on, whether you would look for the indicia of gang

10

memberships in places where you wouldn't look for guns;

11

is that it?

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right.

You look --

13

you look at the two aspects of the warrant, and you ask

14

whether the second one, which is hypothesized to be the

15

problematic one, would allow you to search in places or

16

search with more intensity than the first --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if you're looking for

18

photographs that show gang membership, I guess you could

19

look through photograph albums.

20

look there for guns, would you?

21

That's what sets forth the two paragraphs at

assumption -- it provides not only for searches of all

2

firearms, but it provides, and we think legitimately,

3

for searches of any receipts or paperwork showing the

4

purchase, ownership, or possession of the handguns being

5

sought.

6

photographs, because if you find photographs of an

7

individual carrying a particular firearm, that's good

8

evidence.

9

scope of the first paragraph, not just the second.

And so, if -- and paperwork certainly includes

10

so, it does raise the question of whether the second

11

paragraph increases the scope.

12

And

The other point I'd raise in this respect is

13

that, in the second paragraph itself, the anchor

14

sentence in some respects in the second paragraph is the

15

second sentence, which discusses not gang-related

16

indicia in particular but articles of personal property

17

tending to establish the identity of persons in control

18

of the premise or premises, writ large.

19

that provision has not been seen to have a -- have a

20

problem associated with it thus far.

21

thought it was okay.

of the petition appendix, seemed to assume it was okay.

And that's understandable because there are a legion of

24

cases that support those sorts of provisions --

There's something --

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- including the Ewing case

cited by the majority below.
JUSTICE ALITO:

There's something very

4

strange about the rule that we are applying here.

5

warrant was issued by a judge of the superior court;

6

isn't that right?

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

A

Yes, I believe so.
And we're -- so, that judge,

who is a lawyer and was appointed as a judge and

10

presumably has some familiarity with the Fourth

11

Amendment, found that there was probable cause to search

12

for all of these things.

13

reasonable police officer who is not a lawyer and

14

certainly is not a judge should have been able to see

15

that this call that was made by a judge was not only

16

wrong but so wrong that it -- you couldn't reasonably

17

think that the judge might be correct.

18

way to phrase this -- if this rule is to be retained in

19

any form, is there some way to phrase it so that it is

20

narrowed appropriately?

21

And now we're asking whether a

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Is there some

Well, I -- I think the

22

Court has attempted to do that in Malley and Leon

23

itself, because it has made clear that in the main, in

24

all but the most narrow circumstances, where a

25

magistrate does find the existence of probable cause,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

the court need not engage in any searching inquiry to

2

determine that qualified immunity is appropriate --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the most narrow

4

circumstance is defined as a circumstance in which no

5

reasonable police officer could have thought the warrant

6

was correct.

Why don't we adopt a good --

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- a good faith test for

9

this as we do in other -- in other --

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think in some

11

sense, Justice Scalia, you have two -- in response to

12

the two parts of your question.

13

defining what is objectively unreasonable in this

14

situation, the Court has used some pretty strong

15

language.

16

who's grossly incompetent.

First of all, in

In Malley, it spoke in terms of a magistrate
And in Leon, it spoke of --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A policeman.

Policeman.

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, it was speaking of a

19

magistrate actually, and not the officers.

Because the

20

point is that in order to find that officers are liable

21

in this situation, the officers would have to be so sure

22

that probable cause is lacking that only a grossly

23

incompetent magistrate could sign off on the probable

24

cause assessment.

25

respect to the magistrate, which illustrates the degree

So, it used gross incompetence with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

to which the standard is heightened in this context.

2

And in terms of whether good faith

3

principles come into play in the qualified immunity

4

context, what the Court said in Malley is that the same

5

standard for objective -- of reasonableness that governs

6

in the good faith context for suppression purposes also

7

governs in the qualified immunity context under 1983.

8

And so, I think there is room to import into the

9

qualified immunity context these principles of good

10

faith, like, for example, Mr. Chief Justice, the

11

question of whether the officers in question asked

12

superiors for their assessment of whether there's

13

probable cause.

14

And in Sheppard, which was a suppression

15

case, but in Sheppard, at page 9 -- 8 and 9 of the

16

opinion, the Court specifically made reference to the

17

fact that the officer in that case had asked for a

18

probable cause assessment --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't like this

20

mishmash.

Look, it's either good faith or it's --

21

however good his faith was, however well he showed his

22

good faith by checking with his superiors or what not,

23

if he made -- if he made an incompetent decision, it's

24

incompetent.

25

me.

And we should not mix the two, it seems to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, that -- I mean,

2

certainly I don't want to urge any -- anything upon the

3

Court that would tend to water down the standard in the

4

suppression context, but the only point I'd add to this,

5

Justice Scalia, is that when you're looking at it from

6

the perspective of a reasonable officer who's trying to

7

assess whether he should go forward and ask for

8

assessment of probable cause from the magistrate, one

9

consideration that seems natural to take into account is

10

what actions the officer has taken, not just the quantum

11

of proof that the officer has put in the affidavit but

12

what actions has he taken.

13

asked his supervisor --

14

Has he asked for a -- has he

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be wonderful if

15

the test was, was this -- did this officer know that

16

this was a bad affidavit and was acting in bad faith in

17

executing it?

18

fact that he had checked with his superiors and all of

19

that good stuff would -- would have some relevance.

20

If that was the test, then indeed the

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The test as outlined by the

21

Court in Malley is whether it's objectively reasonable

22

for the officer to rely on the magistrate's assessment

23

of probable cause.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Srinivasan --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I though the test was "so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render

2

official belief in its existence unreasonable."

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It -- the Court did say

4

that, Your Honor, and the Court put the formulation in a

5

number of respects in Malley itself.

6

that the" -- this is at page 344:

7

same standard of objective reasonableness that we

8

applied in the context of a suppression hearing in Leon

9

defines the qualified immunity accorded an officer whose

It said, "We hold

"We hold that the

10

request for a warrant allegedly caused an

11

unconstitutional arrest."

12

And I think that's where the Court then goes

13

on and articulates what Your Honor just quoted.

14

then the Court later says:

15

page -- this is at page 345:

16

'our objective faith' -- 'good faith inquiry is confined

17

to the objectively ascertainable question of whether a

18

reasonably well-trained officer would have known that

19

the search was illegal despite the magistrate's

20

authorization.'

21

and it goes on to speak about the analogous question.

22

But

"In Leon" -- and this is at
"In Leon, we stated that

The analogous question in this case,"

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess the question,

23

Mr. Srinivasan, is, do you think that the current test,

24

that the test as currently formulated, is sufficiently

25

protective of police officers?

Or do you think that we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

need to change the test in order to give police officers

2

the protection they need?

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

We think if the current

4

test is applied properly, it's sufficiently protective.

5

And really the question is how it's applied.

6

this case it was applied in -- in a way that I think is

7

not sufficiently protective of police officers.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And in

Of course, you could say

that about any test, you know?

protectively, it will protect.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R.Q. WOLFSON

MR. WOLFSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

In Malley v. Briggs, this Court ruled that

2

police officers do not have immunity for seeking a

3

search warrant when the warrant application is so

4

lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render

5

official belief in its existence unreasonable.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That --

Well, Malley

7

involved a search warrant based solely on a wiretap in

8

which an unknown individual discussed drug use at a

9

party.

10
11

That was all.

It seems to me there's a lot more

information here.
MR. WOLFSON:

Well, in -- Malley involved a

12

mistake as to who the person under suspicion was who was

13

mentioned in the -- in the wiretap.

14

was made in Malley that is exactly the argument that is

15

made here, which is that the police -- it -- one wants

16

to encourage the police to seek warrants from the

17

magistrates, and it would be -- and it would be -- it

18

would be undesirable if the police were not given

19

effectively absolute immunity when they seek a warrant

20

from a magistrate, except, of course, when they -- when

21

they lie, which is a separate question.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the argument

Here you had a

23

police officer who assembled information he had,

24

truthful information, in the affidavit, submitted it to

25

his superiors, who were lawyers.

Then it was submitted

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

to the magistrate, who was a judge.

2

to say, it seems to me, is that a reasonably competent

3

officer -- not objective good faith or anything like

4

that -- a reasonable -- reasonably competent officer

5

would say:

6

said this was okay and I know the judge said it was

7

okay, but I know more than them; I know not only that

8

it's not okay, but it's so clearly not okay that I

9

shouldn't have qualified immunity.

10

And what you have

You know, I know the lawyers in the office

That seems to me a pretty heavy burden to

11

put on -- put on the cop on the beat.

12

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

13

think -- I don't think there is any question that in the

14

great majority of cases, officers who seek warrants from

15

magistrates will be immune.

16

Malley that it does happen that officers make mistakes,

17

good faith mistakes, as to whether a particular set of

18

facts amounts to probable cause, and in that context

19

when there is a good faith mistake, the officers will

20

have immunity.

21

And the Court made clear in

But the Court also stressed that officers

22

must minimize the risk of Fourth Amendment violations by

23

exercising reasonable professional judgment in applying

24

for search warrants.

25

officer will not be immune if a "reasonably well-trained

And so, the Court ruled that an

officer," which is the term the Court used, would not

2

have believed that the -- that the warrant affidavit

3

established probable cause.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now -Now, is it the case here

5

that a reasonably well-trained officer would not --

6

would understand that this warrant was defective in

7

authorizing a search for guns other than the shotgun in

8

question, when a provision of the California Penal Code

9

says that a search warrant may be issued to seize items

10
11

intended for use in committing a crime?
MR. WOLFSON:

A reasonable -- that a

12

reasonable well-trained officer would not have sought

13

the search warrant.

14

Code provision really adds anything to the rest of the

15

case, because it says that you may seek items that are

16

intended to be used in a crime, but you still have to

know -- you still have to have probable cause to believe

18

that there are such items.

Ninth Circuit decided the case on the assumption that

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, on the assumption that

10

he was living in those premises, then what is wrong with

11

a reasonable officer thinking he's tried to kill her in

12

the past using one gun; he's a member of a gang; he is

13

very likely to have -- to possess or have access to

14

other guns; those other guns may be found in the home

15

where we believe he is living, and he is intending to

16

use them to carry out the threat that he has promised,

17

the threat that he has made?

18

MR. WOLFSON:

19

there are several problems with that.

20

is the police don't have probable cause to believe that

21

he has another gun, and they don't -- and they certainly

22

don't have probable cause to believe that any other such

23

gun would be found at the Millenders' house, and I --

10

example, or in the closet, and he's in the house looking

11

for the sawed-off shotgun, he could seize it.

12

unless he has probable cause to think it might be used

13

for a crime.

How did that change suddenly because he

MR. WOLFSON:

Why now suddenly can he take

I think the assumption, as I

21

understood, behind Justice Kennedy's question was, if

22

the police see something -- happen to see something in

23

the house that is probable cause of a crime --

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but your argument is

there was no probable cause for thinking that the guns

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

in the house, if there were other guns, would be used

2

for a crime.

3

said when I suggested that:

4

is probable cause to think that any guns in the house

5

would be used for a crime.

6

yet, and one gun's as good as another.

7

well take one of those other guns and kill her.

8

there's probable cause to believe that the guns that are

9

in the house, or at least one could reasonably think so,

10
11

Now, your opponent, your brother there,

would be used for a crime.

Oh, no, that's wrong; there

He hasn't killed the girl
And he might
So,

That was his response.

Then, as to whether they're likely to be in

12

the house, well, we know this:

13

sawed-off shotgun, and we know he is a member of a gang,

14

which is defined as a group of people engaged in

15

definable criminal activity, creating an atmosphere of

16

fear and intimidation.

17

We know he has a

So, well, people like that have guns.

And

18

when -- where they live, there may well be other guns.

19

So, it is reasonable for me to think there are other

20

guns in the house and reasonable for me to thin k that

21

other guns in the house would be used for killing this

22

girl if he can get to her.

Okay, that's the argument.

23

Now, what's the response?

24

MR. WOLFSON:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -And you don't have to --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

you have to show more than that there's no probable

2

cause.

3

that there was probable cause.

4

You have to show it wasn't reasonable to think

MR. WOLFSON:

Because the police did not

5

have probable cause to believe there was any other gun,

6

and they certainly --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

He's a member of a gang

8

which often has guns, and this expert knows that members

9

of gangs have guns.

And the definition of "gang"

10

suggests they're likely to have guns, whether it's

11

illegal to have them or not illegal.

12

MR. WOLFSON:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14
15

But it -That's how he knows that.

That's how he knows.
MR. WOLFSON:

But it doesn't -- excuse me.

16

It doesn't necessarily follow that there is probable

17

cause to believe that he has an arsenal of weapons with

18

him at an innocent third-party's house.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the warrant authorized

20

the search for and seizure of all guns, not just the

21

guns belonging to Bowen.

MR. WOLFSON:

some of the Millenders' guns, didn't they?
MR. WOLFSON:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And why is it -- if there's

probable cause to believe that he has other guns, is

4

there also probable cause to believe that any gun found

5

in the house will belong to him?

6
7

MR. WOLFSON:

I would say not, Your Honor,

but I --

8
9

I think not.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We've been

talking -- we've been talking about this for some time

10

as if we're reviewing the adequacy of the warrant.

11

We're not.

12

officers' determination that there was probable cause.

13

We're reviewing the reasonableness of these

Do you think it is at all pertinent in

14

addressing that question that the officers submitted the

15

affidavit to support the warrant to Deputy District

16

Attorney Jane Wilson, who reviewed it and signed off on

17

it?

18

MR. WOLFSON:

19

dispositive, Your Honor.

20
21
22

I -- I think it can't be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
dispositive.

I didn't ask if it's

Is it relevant in any way?
MR. WOLFSON:

It could be -- it could be

23

relevant, but I would say it's -- it doesn't -- it

24

doesn't make the case in this case, for a few reasons.

25

First of all, generally speaking, of course, if you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

can't rely on the magistrate as a -- you know, as a

2

blanket rule that you're not immune, it's hard to

3

understand why the fact that the deputy district

4

attorney signed off on it would have essentially the

5

same effect that the Court rejected in Malley, when it

6

said, you know, there will be a limited set of

7

circumstances where even if -- even if a magistrate

8

issues a warrant, the officer will be liable.

9

So, I don't think that -- I mean, the

10

district attorney and the -- and the superior are on the

11

same crime-fighting team as the -- as the -- as

12

Detective Messerschmidt in this case.

13

Also, we really -- we have no information

14

about what transpired in these conversations with the

15

deputy district attorney.

16

D.A. said to Detective Messerschmidt:

17

you're good; this is totally fine.

18

You know, you're pushing the envelope here, but we might

19

just find a magistrate who will go along with it, so --

20

you know, so, see what you can get.

21

We don't know whether the
Oh, you know,

Or whether she said:

And the other point is, of course, relying

22

on your superiors and on the D.A. is a double-edged

23

sword in many cases, because that -- in fact, that can

24

establish or go a long way towards establishing Monell

25

liability, if you establish that there's a pattern of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43

superiors and of deputy district attorneys --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you want -- do

3

you want to encourage officers, when they're applying

4

for search warrants, to have them reviewed by the deputy

5

district attorney or not?

6

MR. WOLFSON:

Certainly, we want them to --

7

to encourage that, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

in Malley, this Court made clear that, ultimately, a

9

reasonably -- a reasonably well-trained officer must

But the point is,

10

make a judgment himself as to whether the course of

11

conduct that he proposes to undertake could reasonably

12

be thought to be within the law.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ultimately, it's the

14

officer who goes into the Millenders' house, seizes

15

their arms, rifles through their drawers.

16

the officer that does that?

17

MR. WOLFSON:

It's -- it's

Well, the officers who are the

18

Petitioners in this case are the officers who actually

19

applied for the search warrant and who actually drafted

20

the search warrant for the magistrate to -- to sign.

21

Now, they then were present at the search.

22

there is a --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, I didn't understand

that.
MR. WOLFSON:

I think

They entered the residence,

There were other officers who I think it would be

10

fair to say kind of more -- undertook the more concrete

11

search of the -- you know, of the house from top to

12

bottom.

13

when a line officer relies on his lead officer's

14

instructions.

15

Ninth Circuit in -- in the Groh case, which later came

16

up to -- came up to this Court.

17

I think there is a different question about

And that was actually discussed by the

But I think the -- the standard that the

18

Court set forth in Malley, the objective reasonableness

19

standard, is really -- it's consistent with this Court's

20

qualified immunity case law --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that is the -- we're

22

using a purely objective standard, another fact that I

23

just want your reaction on is where he says, "I told you

24

never to call the cops on me."

25

throw her out of the window or something.

Now, he has tried to

Alderson Reporting Company

He -- he's

Official

45

shot at her.

2

ways, and he's shouting:

3

told you never to call the cops on me.

4

He's trying to kill her in five different
I'm going to kill you and I

When I first read that I thought, well,

5

maybe he has some -- maybe this is explained in part not

6

just domestic, but he has something to hide.

7

afraid she's going to tell the police something.

8

now, could a person reasonably read those words and

9

think he has something to hide here?

10

Now --

His -- and there's

something going on, and it's not just domestic?

11

Where does that lead us if we --

12

MR. WOLFSON:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

He's

I don't -Can we read it that way?

And if we do read it that way, where does that lead you?

15

MR. WOLFSON:

16

never suggested that reading before.

17

Petitioners have -- indeed, Detective Messerschmidt

18

testified at his deposition:

19

reason to believe that the crime was gang-related.

20

Well, the Petitioners have
And, indeed, the

No, I didn't have any

I mean, one of the curious things about

21

the -- the argument that the Petitioners are now making,

22

which is that you can go outside the warrant and import

23

into it the fact that he was a felon -- one of the

24

curious things about that is that the -- is that the

25

officers told the magistrate this is a violent crime, no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

question; he is a gang member -- not in support of

2

probable cause, but in support of night service.

3

told the magistrate that they had reviewed all the

4

various government databases, specifically including

5

police databases, but did not tell the magistrate that

6

he had any criminal record at all.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

MR. WOLFSON:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They

Mr. Wolfson --

But that's so -Mr. Wolfson, if --

10

suppose they had had a warrant to search just for the

11

sawed-off shotgun.

the house and they're looking all over, they could look

13

in cabinets and drawers for the -- to find pieces of the

shotgun.

16

are other people in the house, and somebody might use

17

them.

18

You conceded that when they go into

They come across other guns, they can at least
There

So, what's -- what's the difference in the

19

scope of the search if they have a warrant just to look

20

for the sawed-off shotgun or if they have a warrant that

21

covers any guns?

22

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, a couple of responses.

23

First of all, I think this Court's decisions in Groh and

24

other courts made clear that when you're evaluating

25

whether -- whether the Respondents were harmed by this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

violation of their constitutional rights, you have to

2

look at the warrant that was actually applied for and

3

executed, not -- you don't -- you don't compare it to a

4

hypothetical warrant that the police might have gotten

5

if they had applied for a properly limited warrant.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To cite Groh -- in

7

Groh, the warrant did not identify the items to be

8

seized at all.

9

MR. WOLFSON:

That is correct.

But the

10

argument was made in Groh -- was, well, there really was

11

no harm because surely the officers had probable cause,

12

and if they had done their work right, that there was I

13

think no question that they would have gotten a warrant,

14

and the --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your answer -- and,

16

again, it seems to me we keep separating these two

17

inquiries.

18

probable cause; it's whether or not the officers were

19

reasonable in believing that it did.

20

MR. WOLFSON:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not whether the warrant showed adequate

I understand -And to cite Groh,

22

a -- no reasonable officer could think that a warrant

23

that doesn't say anything at all about what's to be

24

seized complied with the Fourth Amendment.

25

MR. WOLFSON:

But the argument was made in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

Groh that essentially this was sort of no harm, no foul,

2

because surely a reasonable police officer could have

3

obtained a valid warrant.

4

analogizing that to the question that Justice Ginsburg

5

made.

6

qualified immunity at all.

7

question of damages as to whether you could think, oh,

8

well, perhaps the police might have gotten a valid

9

warrant and so forth.

And I was -- I was sort of

I don't think that really is a question of
I think that may be a

But -- so, I think, sure, it's

10

possible to imagine that the police could have gotten a

11

valid, narrow warrant limited to -- limited to search

12

for the sawed-off shotgun, and -- and certainly not the

13

gang-related activity, but they didn't.

14

to -- one has to measure the harm that the -- that the

15

Millenders suffered by execution of this --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. WOLFSON:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

question?

And one has

So, what happens --

-- invalid warrant.
-- below on that

Following up on --

20

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the same question

22

that Justice Kagan asked your brethren, which is how

23

about we find that it was reasonable to ask for the guns

24

but not for the gang-related materials?

25

do to your claim, and do you disagree with the manner in

Alderson Reporting Company

What does that

Official

49
1

which he described what the inquiry would be below or

2

before us now?

3

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

We do disagree.

We

4

would submit that the -- that it's still -- it's still

5

invalid.

6

appeals have wrestled with under what is called the

7

severance doctrine, which mostly is applied in

8

exclusionary rule cases, not in qualified immunity

9

cases.

But this is an issue that the courts of

10

This Court has actually never explicitly

11

endorsed the severance doctrine, and that is the

12

question -- suppose you have a warrant that is sort of

13

half valid and half valid or maybe half arguably valid

14

but half totally -- you know, totally invalid.

15

you do then?

16

would not permit this Court to -- to resolve that

17

because we don't know from the record before us sort of

18

what part of the search was conducted under what part of

19

the -- of the warrant.

20

What do

And the -- I think at a minimum the record

But --

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's to the gang

21

paraphernalia?

Why couldn't an officer reasonably

22

believe that there was a probable cause to seize that --

23

to search for and seize that, because it would link Mr.

24

Bowen with this residence where they hoped to find the

25

shotgun?

And you dispute the fact that he is -- that he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

is associated with that residence.

2

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

So, Justice Alito,

3

there certainly are circumstances in which it is

4

legitimate to seek for information that links a

5

particular person to a particular location for purposes

6

of establishing criminal liability.

7

there are many cases, for example, where the police come

8

across a meth lab or something like that.

9

course, in that situation the police have a legitimate

The -- you know,

And, of

10

reason to -- to want to know who is present, whose

11

fingerprints are all over the place, because that would

12

tend to establish that the person is -- is in unlawful

13

possession of methamphetamine.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And why couldn't a

15

reasonable officer think that that would be the case

16

here?

17

MR. WOLFSON:

For -- for a few reasons.

18

First of all, the 120th Street address, the Millenders'

19

house, is totally irrelevant to the actual crime under

20

investigation, which took -- someplace else.

21

it's just a happenstance that the -- that the police are

22

searching -- searching this place.

23

This is not a tavern or a still or --

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean,

It's not the place.

No, well, if they have

probable cause to believe that the sawed-off shotgun is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

there -- let's suppose they find the sawed-off shotgun.

2

Then there's going to be an issue at trial:

3

sawed-off shotgun?

4

residence is valuable evidence.

5

Was it his

And anything that links him to that

MR. WOLFSON:

But the gang-related indicia

6

part of the warrant is, first of all, much, much broader

7

than that; and, secondly, the Petitioners have never

8

argued until this Court that that was the purpose of the

9

gang-related indicia part of the warrant.

I mean, the

10

Petitioners argued that the gang-related indicia part of

11

the warrant is intended to establish his -- his gang

12

membership.

13

a -- an increase in penalty if something is a

14

gang-related crime.

15

And -- because, for example, there might be

Even while --

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought this was a test of

16

what they could -- what a reasonable officer could have

17

believed, not what they in particular believed.

18

MR. WOLFSON:

Well, that's correct, but I

19

think, you know, that does not mean that one can engage

20

essentially in a completely post-hoc rationalization of

21

what the objective search by the -- to be accomplished

22

by the warrant is.

23

itself says this is a spousal assault that the police

24

are investigating.

25

gang-related crime in any way.

I mean, the warrant application

There's no suggestion that it's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Wolfson, it seems that

2

many of the arguments on both sides are very

3

fact-dependent in nature, that you're asking what

4

inferences can be drawn reasonably from certain facts,

5

from a particularly violent incident, from the use of a

6

sawed-off shotgun, from the fact that this was not his

7

home, from the fact that he was a gang member.

8
9

And yet, the cases that you cite to us as
suggesting what a reasonable police officer should know

10

really are not cases that involve these facts at all.

11

They're cases that state very broad general propositions

12

about Fourth Amendment law.

13

those cases to what you're saying a particular police

14

officer in a particular set of circumstances ought to

15

know?

16

MR. WOLFSON:

So, how can you get from

Well, of course, this Court

17

has never required that, for qualified immunity

18

purposes, that the case -- there be another case exactly

19

on point.

20

And -JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.

But there seems to be a

21

very large gap between what this police officer has to

22

think about and the cases that you cite.

23

MR. WOLFSON:

Respectfully, Justice Kagan, I

24

don't think I agree, and I think that it's -- it's

25

useful to look at two related but somewhat different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

lines of cases, particularly in the Ninth Circuit but,

2

actually, you know, all across the board in the courts

3

of appeals.

4

The first line of cases says if the police

5

have reason or have probable cause to look for a

6

specific object or specific -- even a specific kind of

7

object, that doesn't give them probable cause to look

8

for the whole generic class of objects that are somewhat

9

similar.

10

The leading case on this in the Ninth

11

Circuit is the Spilotro decision, but there are many

12

cases coming both before and after that stand for that

13

proposition.

14

many contexts.

15

is committing fraud for years 1998 and 1999 and there

16

are billing records, you can't -- you don't have

17

probable cause to look for fraud, you know, for the

18

entire records, billing records from 1950 to the

19

present.

20

over somebody else in a green Nissan Sentra, you don't

21

have probable cause to search for all vehicles including

22

a red Ford -- a red Ford Explorer.

The -- the principle has been applied in

This is really that principle in the context

question that was asked before --

Yes.

6

8

MR. WOLFSON:

And if Mr. Bowen is arrested

and then, if -- if he is to be released on bail or on

2

pretrial release, it's a very common condition that he

3

not have access to any weapons.

4

required that he deposit those weapons with somebody

5

else who, you know, is a proper custodian --

weapons there.

10

They have to leave the

I don't think they --

necessarily have to leave the weapons there.

12

Well, let's say they don't

He's still at large.

MR. WOLFSON:

The police -- it may be

JUSTICE ALITO:

When they leave.

Why?

On

what ground could they seize them?

13

MR. WOLFSON:

If there is no -- well, if

14

he's not -- if he's not there, then it's not clear to me

15

that he has a Fourth Amendment standing to challenge

16

anything.

17
18
19

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's his room.

It's his

room.
MR. WOLFSON:

It's his room.

But if he's --

20

I mean, but if he's --- if they really believe that the

21

police -- that he is there, that it is his house, there

22

is no reason to believe that his possession of any of

23

these weapons is illegal, there are -- the police can do

24

things to secure them.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm putting in my notes

Alderson Reporting Company

that you're not answering the hypothetical.

2

MR. WOLFSON:

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.

I think there -- I'm not sure.

5

I don't think the police can say these weapons are just

6

ours, we're going to take them, we can seize them

7

without -- without probable -- without more probable

8

cause.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

They can't say, and we're

10

going to take them under -- we're going to take them so

11

that he can't use those to kill his girlfriend which is

12

what he has threatened to do?

13

them there --

14

MR. WOLFSON:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

They just have to leave

No --- and if he happens to come

16

back and -- and get those weapons, and he kills her,

17

well, that's just too bad?

18

MR. WOLFSON:

But if the police -- the

19

police have -- if the police have probable cause to

20

believe that he -- on the spot that he will use that

21

weapons, yes, they can seize them under that provision

22

of the California Penal Code, but that does not mean

23

they have probable cause when they apply for the -- the

24

warrant, to think that those weapons either will

25

exist --

Alderson Reporting Company

58

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

not answering my question.

3

MR. WOLFSON:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

You really -- you really are

I -My question is:

Everything

5

is exactly the same except that it's his room and he's

6

not a felon and he possesses them legally and there they

7

are, and they see them.

8

MR. WOLFSON:

I think --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And your answer is they can

10

take them.

In which case, my question is, why wouldn't

11

they have probable cause to search for those in the

12

first place?

13

say, well, what about the possibility that he will come

14

back, get those weapons, and carry out his threat using

15

those weapons?

16

Or they can't take them, in which case I

MR. WOLFSON:

They can -- they may be able

17

to take them, but that does not mean that they knew that

18

they existed in the first place or that they would be at

19

the Millenders' house.

20

fundamental difference.

21

That's -- that I think is the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What happened here when

22

they -- when they -- they did seize weapons that

23

belonged to the plaintiff, Mrs. Millender.

24

took them because they thought they were the

25

defendant's?

They -- they

But -- not that -- they thought they were

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

Bowen's?

2

MR. WOLFSON:

It's not clear, Justice

3

Ginsburg.

They took them under the authority of the

4

warrant.

5

specifically why they were -- why the gun was seized,

6

but the gun was seized.

7

the -- this point, that they went into the Millenders'

8

house, searched the house from top to bottom, and seized

9

the Millenders' -- Mrs. Millender's lawfully owned

They did not provide an explanation as to

And this -- I think this really

10

weapon really shows that this case is in the heartland

11

of what the Fourth Amendment is concerned about.

12

mean, this is exactly the kind of case that the Framers

13

were concerned about when they abolished the

14

general warrant.

15
16

I

This is the sort of case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, do you --

do you contend that anything in the affidavit was false?

17

MR. WOLFSON:

Yes.

False or at least --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. WOLFSON:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. WOLFSON:

What --

-- or at least misleading.
What was that?

I think the -- the -- the

22

proposition that Bowen, quote, unquote, "resided" at the

23

120th Street address and that that -- and that that

24

conclusion was drawn from, among other things, Detective

25

Messerschmidt's search of government databases was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

material misleading, because he didn't reside there.

2

may have been staying -- hiding out there, and the

3

search of the government databases which are actually --

4

the results are actually reprinted --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. WOLFSON:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

He

Where did the --

Sorry.
-- may have been --

may have staying there?

9

MR. WOLFSON:

That is what Shelly Kelly told

10

Detective Messerschmidt, which is, if I am not

11

mistaking --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you say it was

13

materially false that they said he resides there, and

14

what he knew is that he may have been staying there?

15

MR. WOLFSON:

He may have been hiding out

16

there.

When -- especially when you combine that with

17

all the other information that Detective Messerschmidt

18

actually obtained from the printouts of the databases

19

which are in the JA, which in fact say that he hadn't

20

been at the 120th Street address for several months and

21

that his most recent address was 97th Street, where he

22

lived with -- where he stayed with, at least sometimes,

23

Shelly Kelly and gave it out as his address.

24

that -- that is in the respects why we think that this

25

is materially misleading.

Alderson Reporting Company

So,

Of course, we were not allowed to appeal

that determination, so that really only half of the case

in that respect was before the court of appeals and is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY R. COATES

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. COATES:

With respect to the -- the

11

hypothetical that Justice Alito postulated in terms of

12

finding other weapons there, and Respondents' counsel to

13

say, well, we might go on the plain view doctrine, I

14

think these are circumstances in which we note that you

15

want to encourage officers, when they can, not to -- not

16

rely on exceptions to the warrant requirement.

17

here, if anything, the officers in an abundance of

18

caution attempted to get a warrant, contemplating those

19

precise circumstances.

20

liability for -- for going to that extra step and that

21

extra precaution.

22

there's actually probable cause, but whether a

23

reasonable officer could even believe that might be the

24

case for purposes of sending it to a magistrate.

25

And

I don't think they should incur

And, again, a step back from whether

And I think, under those circumstances, you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62
1

want to encourage officers to seek a magistrate's

2

determination and not try and rely on on-the-scene

3

exceptions to the warrant requirement to try and justify

4

seizing weapons under those circumstances.

5

With respect to Justice Scalia's concern

6

about the probable cause to seize all guns as opposed to

7

guns belonging to Bowen -- and I think the notion is

8

that Bowen, being a resident and that being established

9

for purposes of this contention at this point, still

10

down at district court, but it was assumed for purposes

11

of the Ninth Circuit that he was a resident, that as a

12

resident, that he would have access to that firearm.

13

And I think that this was bolstered by the

14

fact -- again, his status as a gang member.

15

Chicago Housing Authority v. Rose case, which talks

16

about the manner in which gang members often store and

17

use weapons at family members' homes.

18

unfortunate part of the -- of the gang culture.

19

it's not unreasonable for an officer to think there

20

might be probable cause at the very least to seize any

21

weapon found there, even if ultimately facts developed

22

that it is in fact not Bowen's weapon.

23

We cite the

I mean, it's an
So,

And this also goes to the indicia of gang

24

membership and why it's reasonable even to ask, because

25

that may be one of the means by which we could tie a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63
1

particular weapon to Bowen depending upon what's found

2

during the search.

3

This is a very high standard as established

4

by this Court, which is essentially plainly incompetent

5

or knowingly violating the law.

6

that has not hidden the ball with respect to what

7

transpired between Bowen and Kelly.

8

his superiors to look at; he submitted it to an

9

attorney.

And this is an officer

He submitted it to

And while that's not dispositive, I think

10

those are objective facts that a reasonable officer

11

could say, I've done this, this, and this; there's no

12

reason for me to believe that I'm violating the law in

13

sending it to a magistrate.

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel,

counsel.

16

The case is submitted.

17

(Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the case in the

18

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
