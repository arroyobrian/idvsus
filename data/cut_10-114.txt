ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

Mr. Fox has rock-solid legal claims against

11

a police chief based upon facts that were strong enough

12

to send that police chief to prison.

13

ordered to pay all of the attorney's fees for an entire

14

2-year course of a litigation because his lawyers

15

decided to plead and then drop a single Federal theory.

16

That award is wrong and it's not what Congress intended.

17

Congress wanted to protect defendants from the lying or

18

the vexatious plaintiff who shouldn't be in court at

19

all.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yet he's been

Did we take the case on

21

the assumption -- your -- your predecessor and you may

22

disagree -- but did we take the case on the assumption

23

that this was a frivolous cause of action?

24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the Court took

the case on the assumption that the legal theory was

frivolous, but that the underlying cause of action,

2

which is to say the operative facts, were meritorious;

6

was frivolous.

And so this is a wrongdoing defendant

They are going to

I mean, my

8

goodness.

You could say the same underlying facts

justify, you know, a suit for -- for libel, and also

10

justify a much -- a much greater suit.

11

that we look to simply the underlying facts.

12

what kind of liability was sought to be imposed upon the

13

defendant.

14

defendant is willing to pay for his lawyer, and how much

15

he has to expend in defending.

We look to

That's what determines how much money the

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

16

I'm not sure

Your Honor, in this case

17

the liability was far greater for the State court claims

18

than for the 1983 claims.

But Congress was concerned -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

Well, that's not quite

20

right.

To the extent they overlapped, even on the

21

theory the Federal claims were presented, the plaintiff

22

below was seeking attorney's fees -­

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the city's liability

would be greater.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

3

That was one incremental

4

increase.

5

constitutional claim was for, and the reason it was

6

found to be frivolous, was that he was seeking liability

7

on a constitutional claim for being deprived of his

8

right to run for office when in fact he won the office.

9

The intentional infliction of emotional distress, the

10

But the liability in this case on the

reputational harm was far greater.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

Mr. Rosenkranz, you knew

12

that, though, from day one.

This case is brought in

13

State court, it's removed to Federal court.

14

the plaintiff says:

15

my 1983 claim is no good.

16

that until 18 months after the -- the transfer.

17

doesn't the plaintiff have some responsibility for

18

running up all these costs in the Federal -- burdening

19

the Federal court, having discovery in Federal court,

20

instead of saying when defendant removed the case -­

21

either dropping the Federal claim or conceding at that

22

point that it had no merit so it's only the State

23

claims.

Ultimately

I recognize that as a matter of law
But the plaintiff didn't say

I mean, doesn't -- doesn't the plaintiff

bear responsibility for keeping that case in Federal

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

The answer is partial

But let's -- and I

think Your Honor is correct to be looking at the

burdens.

7

if this was indeed frivolous from inception, the

8

defendants could easily have filed a motion to dismiss.

9

It should have taken no time at all.

The burdens of the discovery were all the

It was the same nucleus of operative facts.

Now,

And if there was

10

incremental increase in discovery with respect to the

11

Federal claims, then the defendants have only themselves

12

to blame for not having moved to dismiss early on.
JUSTICE ALITO:

13

What if Mr. Fox had filed

14

the State claims in State court?

question.

the burden, but if -- if they're doing discovery on both

It's the incremental burden when you've got

3
4

these, these intertwined -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

5

You're proceeding on the

6

assumption which I -- I think is certainly, based on

7

what I know of the record, true here, that the State

8

claims are far from frivolous.

9

another case, where it isn't clear whether the State

But how is -- let's take

10

claims are any more meritorious than the Federal claim.

11

Then how is the Federal judge supposed to handle the -­

12

the calculation of attorney's fees in the separate

13

Federal suit?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

14

So, your Honor, we're still

15

operating on the hypothetical that they're separate

16

cases -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

19
20
21

Yes.

Yes.

-- not intertwined?

Because my answer might be different.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the facts are -- the

facts are intertwined, but they're two separate cases.

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
You have claims of unknown

24

merit in State court; you have a frivolous claim in

25

Federal court.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

My answer to that

2

hypothetical is the same as our point two, that if there

3

is -- if there are fees to be awarded at all, they have

4

to be fees that are tethered to the rationale for there

5

being a right to attorney's fees in the first place,

6

which is what was the incremental burden of the Federal,

7

of the Federal lawsuit?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9
10

And a judge would say -­

that?

So how do you calculate

I mean that -- that's what the question was.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, it would

11

be very easy in this case.

12

entries or ask the defendant to come forward with

13

entries that say this was specific to the Federal

14

lawsuit; I had to -- I had to file a removal notice, I

15

had to litigate over -­

16

What you do is you look for

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's an incredible

17

burden to impose on the district court.

It's hard

18

enough for clients to read through these billing records

19

and figure out what's valid and what's not, but to ask

20

the district court to then go through and look at it,

21

and see -- and maybe it doesn't say, you know, "1983

22

suit," "State suit."

23

then you've got to go through entry by entry and say

24

well, now, was that for the 1983 action or was that for

25

the State court action?

Maybe it's just an entry.

And

1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor -­

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that seems -­

3

just -- sorry, I don't mean to drone on, but that seems

4

to me to be an especially odd burden to impose when

5

you're dealing with an area where there is a heavy dose

6

of discretion to the district court in the first place.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

7

So, Your Honor, let me then

8

start -- move back to our overarching point, which is

9

that these are the sorts of incremental burdens that are

10

trivial, if they exist at all, and that shouldn't be

11

awarded attorney's fees at all.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Well, maybe in your

13

case, but there's no reason to suppose there won't be

14

cases where the things are flipped, and the Federal

15

claim, perhaps frivolous for a legal reason rather than

16

a factual one, is the dominant driving force in the

17

litigation and you've tagged on a few other State

18

claims.

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, that's a key

20

point in our presentation.

21

whether it's flipped or not.

22

are the same, by definition, for all of the legal

23

theories, so the factual -­

24
25

It actually doesn't matter

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The factual foundations

Mr. Rosenkranz, there -­

there are distinct differences in the 1983 suit because,
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first, the plaintiff has to show defendant acted under

2

cover of State law -- that's not going to be necessary

3

in the suit for extortion or defamation -- has to show

4

that Vice was an official policymaker for the city.

5

Those are discrete issues that relate to the 1983 claim

6

but have nothing to do with the extortion/defamation

7

claim.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

8
9

Indeed, Your Honor, and so

let me answer that question in two ways.

First is, if

10

the defendants see a complaint, a 1983 theory, that is

11

flawed at the inception, they have no business incurring

12

costs with respect to color of State law or policymaker

13

or not.

14

is presented on the face of the complaint.

They should move to dismiss on the theory that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

But that's a pretty

16

audacious claim, that you filed such a frivolous cause

17

of action that they shouldn't have wasted so much time

18

responding to it.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

19
20

My

point is -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

No, no, Your Honor.

That's a lot of

chutzpah.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

23
24

point.

25

the complaint.

You Honor, that's their

They're saying it was frivolous on the face of
Well, if it was frivolous on the face
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

from inception, they should have moved to dismiss from

2

inception.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3
4

And you shouldn't

have filed it.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I understand the argument,

7

Your Honor, but the Seventh Circuit has a very good

8

opinion that's cited in the brief that explains that

9

when the defendants are just racking up fees on a claim

10

that they claim is frivolous, that they could have filed

11

a motion to dismiss on, they shouldn't be racking up

12

fees on that claim.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

Counsel, can I

14

understand what legal analysis you're proposing?

15

blue brief seems to suggest, as does your argument a few

16

minutes ago, that you want the Sixth Circuit's rule,

17

which is the only circuit that applies this rule, that

18

says when the facts are identical and intertwined, the

19

defendant gets no fees.

20

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your

Your Honor -­
All of the other

22

circuits, as far as I can tell, don't go to that

23

extreme.

24

with, and your yellow brief suggests, is a but-for

25

cause:

They say something closer to what you started

The defendant is entitled to those costs related
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the defense of the frivolous claim.

2

theories are you advocating?

Which of the two

And then a separate question, of what

3
4

standard of review should be imposed in those situations

5

in which the activities are so intertwined, but there is

6

still a core essence of defense of the Federal claim,

7

which is some of the hypotheticals my colleagues -­
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

8
9

Yes, Your Honor.

Let me

begin by -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- assume.

-- correcting the premise,

12

if I may, Your Honor.

13

but the Sixth Circuit is an outlier because it says if

14

you have got a lawsuit with related and completely

15

unrelated claims, no fees at all.

16

the clear majority rule, is the rule that says no fees

17

at all when you've got intertwined claims.

18

Sixth -- which also has that other piece -- the Second,

19

the Ninth, and the Eleventh.

20

that is the primary rule that we are advocating:

21

fees if they're intertwined, because the burdens of

22

demonstrating that a legal theory is frivolous are

23

minimal.

24
25

The Sixth Circuit is an outlier,

The majority rule,

That is the

And that is the rule -­
No

But we have a backup -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there are difference

-- are differences in how we read those other circuits,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

but I'll accept your proposition.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And, Your Honor, I would

3

encourage the Court to look at the -- at the Schwartz

4

treatise, which says what I've just articulated is the

5

clear majority rule, not just among the circuits, but in

6

the district courts, where circuits haven't weighed in.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I clarify what

8

you mean by "completely intertwined"?

9

no incremental work just on the Federal action?

10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

You mean there is

No, Your Honor.

What I

11

mean by "completely intertwined" is that they arise from

12

the same core of operative facts.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you -- you're

14

looking for fees -- your first argument -- even though

15

they can identify fees that were incurred solely on

16

defending the frivolous cause of action?

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I'm looking to block fees

18

even though they can, and the reason is Congress was

19

concerned about burdensome litigation, not about minor,

20

trivial increases in litigation to utter three sentences

21

about a legal claim and then say -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

All right.

That's

23

an easier case.

What if it's 20 percent spent on the

24

Federal action?

Do you still completely intertwine?

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the premise

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

here is that the Federal action is completely frivolous.

2

There shouldn't be 20 percent spent on the Federal

3

action if they're all -- if they're all intertwined, if

4

it's frivolous on its face.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

What if it's not

6

completely frivolous, but frivolous enough to satisfy a

7

demand for fees?

8

40 hours to prepare the motion to dismiss it as

9

frivolous?

What if it does take them, you know,

Do they get those 40 hours?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

10

Your Honor, I guess I'm

11

having trouble accepting the premise.

It shouldn't take

12

40 hours to tell a court, here's the claim and here's a

13

string cite of 17 cases that say it's wrong.

14

But let me then move to the -­

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, you've got to

Sure, but if it takes 40

hours to do it, then it's probably not frivolous.

But let me move into the -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You've got to look

carefully at the facts.

They assume good faith on the

22

part of their adversary that would not file a frivolous

claim.

24

they're going to look at it and say, this is frivolous,

25

The idea that it's going to be able to -­

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doesn't reflect an adequate -- doesn't reflect a

2

realistic understanding of Federal litigation.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

3

I understand, Your Honor.

4

Let me just make one other point about our first rule,

5

and then move to the second rule.
The point that was made earlier, that Your

6
7

Honor made, Mr. Chief Justice, earlier about the burden

8

on the Court is yet another reason why we shouldn't open

9

up this new avenue of ancillary fee litigation.

When

10

it's just that incremental burden, we now have not just

11

the burden of a frivolous claim, but the burden of

12

courts addressing attorney's fees applications and

13

the -- on the frivolous claim, and the burden of the

14

courts now of defendants playing the games of

15

withholding motions to dismiss that should have been

16

brought earlier -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

And I don't want to have

18

you adopt this phrase, but just to clarify, are you

19

saying that it's a but-for test, that you get only those

20

fees for time that was -- that would not have been

21

incurred but for the frivolous claim?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

22

So let me move now to the

23

second argument, Your Honor, and the answer to that is

24

yes.

25

should be tied to the basis on which Congress is

If there are going to be fees at all, the fees

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

allowing defendants to get fees, and that is defendants

2

are suffering extra burdens; we want to protect them

3

from those burdens.
If that is the rationale, as everyone

4
5

agrees, then the only fees that should be covered are

6

fees that would not have been incurred but for the

7

existence of the Federal claim, and that is, to the

8

Chief Justice's question, actually not that hard to

9

demonstrate.

If plaintiffs keep good, accurate records

10

and they know that they're going to be seeking or may

11

well be seeking fees on the Federal claim, identify the

12

few documents that are really -­

No, that's not how

21

You say they know they're going to be seeking

So I do think it's a significant burden on

22

the district court to say, go back and read these -­

12

let me just explain how I think this works.

issues early, just like the plaintiff who is going to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In other words, you're

saying that the lawyer has to keep account of -- now, if

3

I'm going to spend time on "under color of State law," I

4

have to label that and figure the hours for that

5

separately; similarly for whether Vice was an official

6

policymaker, those hours that you are requiring that -­

7

instead of saying X number of hours for deposition of

8

witness A, you are requiring particularizing the issue?

9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, and that's

10

what Hensley says.

11

general litigation, and you don't try to parse it out,

12

but if there are -- in the case of plaintiffs, that

13

redounds to the benefit of plaintiffs, because the

14

entire case, all the general litigation, could have

15

contributed to the ultimate success.

16

Hensley says general litigation is

When it comes to the defendants, though, the

17

general litigation costs could easily or almost

18

certainly were incurred in connection with the overall

19

defense, and so it makes perfect sense to say to them,

break out the pieces, the documents that were really

just about the Federal lawsuit.

greater liability on them than the frivolous claim?

9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

All right.

Not this case,

10

of course, and you know this is a hypothetical.

11

answer to that would be, I can imagine a district court

12

being allowed to carve out an exception where they can

13

say, well, we hired much more high-powered lawyers than

14

we would have otherwise, and that was the -- responsible

15

for an incremental increase.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

Counsel, did the -- the

17

district court here said they're intertwined claims,

18

they all relate to the frivolous claim, they're entitled

19

to full fees.

The Fifth Circuit seemed to do the

20

but-for test.

Are you agreeing with that?

21

It's -- the language it uses sounds like a

22

but-for test:

"A defendant is only entitled to

23

attorney's fees for work which can be distinctly traced

24

to frivolous claims.

25

We're disagreeing about whether

this is simply a factual misapplication, which I believe

it was not, or a statement of a series of standards that

when district courts in the Fifth Circuit now apply

those standards we'll never get to the but-for test,

I'm not sure that we have to evenhandedly apply the

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

5

Your Honor, I actually

6

believe that the Court should not be evenhandedly

7

applying the same set of rules, but we reached the

8

opposite conclusion about which side gets the benefit of

9

the burden.

It is for plaintiff's benefit, for the most

10

part, that this fee shifting provision was in the

11

statute.

12

Now, this Court has so drastically narrowed

13

the range of cases within which a defendant is entitled

14

to fees, that all we're talking about now is whether the

15

Court is going to open up a new avenue of fee

16

litigation, and that is not for the frivolous lawsuits

but for the frivolous theory layered onto an otherwise

Thank you, counsel.

I would like to focus first on the question

of eligibility, but I do want to return later to why

13

Hensley supplies the correct analysis for calculating

fee awards.
Much of Petitioner's eligibility argument

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Eligibility, it has to

be a frivolous claim, that's -­
MR. STANCIL:

Where eligible, the standard

15

is, as under Hensley, what is the degree of overall

16

success in proving that these claims are frivolous?

17

Simply put, how much of the action or proceeding to

18

enforce section 1983 was frivolous?

19

standard set forth in section 1988.

20
21
22

And that's the

Section 1988 does not reference State law
claims that may be factually overlapping.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the liability

23

under the State law claims is $100,000 and the liability

24

under the Federal claims is the same, and you win on the

25

Federal claim and you lose on the State law claim, if I

Alderson Reporting Company

were the client, I would say your degree of success was

2

zero.

3

I still have to pay $100,000.
The fact that you won on one claim but then

4

lost the whole issue -- the whole value on another, I

5

wouldn't call that a degree of success.

6

MR. STANCIL:

Well, that would be something

7

that a district court would take into account as part of

8

its discretion, and that's exactly the point of Hensley.

9

Hensley says it's hard to pull some of these hours apart

10
11

in the ordinary case.
Now, this is not the ordinary case.

I think

12

that's clear.

13

State law claims in Federal court.

you would do what the district court said and look how

23

25

And the

"Plaintiff made certain allegations"

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Louisiana pleading rule were -- was that you state the

2

basis of your claim, and you do not have to plead legal

3

theories; and if that's so, then if this -- defendant

4

removed this case to Federal court; the plaintiff wanted

5

to keep it in State court; and in Louisiana, under the

6

Louisiana pleading rules, it would have been perfectly

7

appropriate.

8
9

The -- the claim alleged gave rise to
extortion claim, the defamation claim; so this complaint

10

was filed in Louisiana court that has a rule that says

11

tell us what happened, and then you can have whatever

12

legal theory you're entitled to.

13

MR. STANCIL:

Yes, Your Honor, but it

14

included a Federal cause of action that allowed removal

15

to Federal court, and once it's in Federal court, it's

16

subject to the Federal rules for pleading a claim

17

adequately and in specificity, and here the district

18

court found these State law claims, there was not a

19

whiff of them until the very tail end, 18 months later,

20

when it was actually in response to the town of Vinton

21

saying, by the way, just to be clear, there are no State

22

law claims here.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that implausible,

24

Mr. Stancil, when we consider that of all the claims

25

here, the one that would seem easiest to prove is
30

extortion, because Vice was convicted of extortion in a

criminal proceeding?

3

say what is the outstanding claim here, I would assume

4

that it was the extortion.

So if you're looking look and you

MR. STANCIL:

Well, Your Honor, again, look

at how the plaintiff used the fact of extortion.

If you

go -- this is the correspondents -- pardon me, the

like to point, Your Honor, specifically to the

plaintiff and he files a suit and it has a State claim
32
Alderson Reporting Company

There's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

and a Federal claim; and the Federal claim is a really

2

bad claim, it's frivolous; and it eventually gets tossed

3

out, and it's -- it's labeled frivolous.

4

claim is a really good claim and it wins, all right?

But the State

The plaintiff has requested $100,000 and the

plaintiff gets $100,000 because he's won on the State

claim.

8

are 20 percent was incurred solely for the State claim,

9

20 percent was incurred solely for the Federal claim,

Now, here are the legal fees.

The legal fees

10

and 60 percent was incurred in both because there were

11

overlapping issues and it's just impossible to tear them

12

apart.

13

MR. STANCIL:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

Okay.
What are the fees in that

case according to you?
MR. STANCIL:

16

It would be within the

closer to 20 percent than to 80 percent.

it's -­

Okay.

But again,

So -- but -- so in

22

other words, you're saying he gets all the work, the

relief; is that right?

All the work that is -­
At a -- at a minimum.
Even though the plaintiff

has, from the plaintiff's view has completely won the

lawsuit.

7

MR. STANCIL:

MR. STANCIL:

Correct, he has -- yes.
Go -­
Is there a follow-up?

I don't

want to interrupt the follow-up.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MR. STANCIL:

No.
Okay.

Go ahead.
Yes, he gets the 20

13

percent at a minimum that are but-for attributable, but

14

it is within the district court's discretion to award

15

more, and here's why.

16
17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and -- okay, go

ahead, I'm sorry.
MR. STANCIL:

The burden -- the question is

19

what is -- what does section 1983 authorize?

20

authorizes fees if you're a prevailing party entitled to

21

fees in an action or proceeding to enforce section 1983.

22

In Your Honor's hypothetical and in this case, there was

23

only frivolous section 1983 claims.

24

fulfilling the -- the mission, the statutory purpose

25

underlying section 1988, I think it would be incumbent
34
Alderson Reporting Company

It

So in terms of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

upon the district court to say, you know what, this

2

entire -- you -- you triggered a fee-shifting statute,

3

the entire section 1983 action was frivolous.

4

think it's within the district court's discretion to

5

give them something more, between 20 and 80 percent

6

under those -- under the hypothetical.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so I

So but on that theory,

8

the -- the plaintiff would be paying the defendant's

9

fees for work done where the plaintiff won.
MR. STANCIL:

10

Because the plaintiff levied a

11

frivolous -- not just a faulty or unsuccessful, a

12

frivolous cause of action under section 1983, and this

13

is the point of -- of why 1988 is different from, say,

14

rule 11 and other provisions that limit bad faith

15

actions.

16

burdens allocated to both sides, and there are

17

consequences or may be consequences within a district

18

court's discretion.

19

It's a policy choice by Congress.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There are

But I thought what

20

Congress said and what we've said in Hensley, that the

21

only thing that the defendant is entitled to fees for is

22

the burden of the frivolous Federal claim.

23

answer to Justice Kagan is suggesting that even if the

24

plaintiff wins, wins everything they were seeking,

25

you're still entitled to 80 percent of your fees, even
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Your -- your

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

though the Federal claim didn't add anything to your

2

work -- to your work, except 20 percent?
MR. STANCIL:

3

To be clear, Your Honor, I'm

4

not saying we would be automatically entitled to 80

5

percent.

6

Hensley, the district court would have discretion to

7

award more than 20 percent.

8

I'm saying Hensley, under the principles of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But tell me why we

9

would, given the differences that we've announced in

10

Hensley between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing

11

defendants -- because you can only prevail as to a

12

frivolous fee.

13

your entire fee and deduct from it, instead of starting

14

the other way, which seems more logical, which is you're

15

entitled to the fees related to your frivolous claim, so

16

why don't you have to prove that first?

17

Why do we start with your entitlement to

MR. STANCIL:

Well, I don't think it would

18

matter to the outcome of this case, and I would like to

19

come back to that.

20

does -- what is the 1983 fee in total, and working

21

backwards from there, is based on -­

22

But the reason for starting at what

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

No, no, no.

We're

23

assuming a lawsuit that has -- as this one, that has

24

both Federal and State claims and only one -- whether

25

it's one frivolous Federal claim or multiple Federal
36

claims and two are frivolous, one is not, and there is a

2

bunch of State court claims.

3

MR. STANCIL:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why do we start with

5

your total fee and deduct down, rather than start where

6

all the circuits are starting, which is to say, what can

7

be attributed to that frivolous claim, which is the only

8

thing you're entitled to fees from?
MR. STANCIL:

9

Well, section 1988 is the

10

answer, Your Honor.

11

if you're a defendant and if it's frivolous.

12

respect to an action or proceeding to enforce

13

section 1983, I think the but-for rule would make more

14

sense if we were talking about non-frivolous

15

section 1983 claims alongside frivolous section 1983

16

claims, because there the pie that section 1988 is

17

concerned about, the 1983 pie, is chopped up, but here

18

we have a State law pie and we have a 1983 pie, and all

19

of this pie, if you'll pardon the tortured metaphor, is

20

frivolous.

21

It says you get your fees, and -­
With

So you look at the terms of the statute.

22

What has Congress authorized?

Your fee for a frivolous

section 1988 claim.

24

reason, that it's consistent with the congressional

25

purpose to consider whether to reduce that award.

We say, and for, I think, good

Alderson Reporting Company

You

1

do not have to award them the entire pie, but I think it

2

is a faulty assumption.

3

of section 1988 to say, well, if you invoke this

4

frivolous claim and you put this fee shifting on the

5

table, that you're immune from fee shifting as long as

6

these claims are -- certain fees are relevant to both.

It doesn't fulfill the purposes

But I do want to come back to why this makes

7
8

no difference to the outcome of this case.

Not only is

9

that the standard that the Fifth Circuit announced and

10

applied, but it is also the case that the only claims

11

prosecuted in Federal Court were section 1983 claims.

12

And here, we have to come back to -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

Mr. Stancil, the first

14

magistrate to get this case said explicitly that the

15

discovery materials, the discovery in the Federal Court,

16

would be usable in State court proceedings where those

17

materials might aid in obtaining a judgment.

18

that have to be taken into account, that the discovery

19

materials developed in Federal Court will now be used in

20

the State court proceeding?
MR. STANCIL:

21

So doesn't

Well, Your Honor, there's a

22

difference between saying these depositions may be used

23

and saying they will be useful or finding that they

24

would be significant to the disposition of the State law

25

claims.

The District Court said only -- the first

magistrate judge's opinion said only that these

2

depositions may be used.

3

telling the parties, you know, don't come back to me and

4

argue about whether this deposition was properly noticed

5

and, you know, these questions and answers have been

6

asked.

This is a simple way of

7

But I think there's a more fundamental

8

point, Your Honor, which is the District Court, in

9

awarding fees, found there was no whiff of State law

10

claims until the very -- very much the 11th hour in this

11

claim.

12

back to your question, we really need district courts to

13

have discretion.

14

there are State claims and Federal claims, but as the

15

District Court found, those State claims are deeply,

16

deeply buried in the weeds.

17

in once -- in which the District Court needs to have

18

discretion to say -­

19

And this is precisely why, Justice Sotomayor,

If, as in this case -- we'll assume

That's precisely the case

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I assume you

20

agree that discretion can end up going either way?

21

could submit time sheets that show 35 percent of our

22

time was spent on the Federal case, and the district

23

judge can say, you know, time sheets are subject to -­

24

manipulation is too strong a word, but I'm just not

25

going to give you 35 percent; I'm going to give you 10

You

percent.

That's a reasonable exercise of discretion.

2

The judge doesn't have to say a whole lot about it and

3

it's certainly going to be upheld on -- on appeal,

4

right?
MR. STANCIL:

5

Correct, Your Honor, and this

6

goes to the question of whether these standards are

7

administrable.

9

part of three decades.

The abuse of discretion standard in fee

The surest way to invite

satellite litigation over fees is to -- is to announce a

akin to the opposite rule of saying if we dismiss the

MR. STANCIL:

Well, Your Honor, I think

the -- I think the statement of the but-for test in

application will become very -- will be very close to

5

the test that we're espousing here, and here's why.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Espouse your test for

me, because I still don't understand it except for

8

flipping through Hensley, but Hensley has a different

9

predicate, which is that plaintiffs are -- if they win,

they're entitled to fees.

The district court has

similar to -- not identical, but similar to a but-for

How do you reconcile the

test that the Fifth Circuit said it was applying, which

10

is -- seems to be a but-for test, with the fees that

11

were actually awarded here?
MR. STANCIL:

12

Because the only work done at

13

the time of the fee request was on a section 1983 claim,

14

because the State law claims were not pursued.

15

was the finding of the District Court that says, these

claims were so deeply buried, you weren't even on

once these section 1983 claims, all of them, are out and

Here, the argument seems to proceed on the

10

MR. STANCIL:

I think if the Court could

11

announce the principle, that would helpful, which is, if

12

the fees are fairly attributable, within the District

14

they have to be only attributable to a 1983 claim.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

some of the State court actions, why should you be

MR. STANCIL:

Because the district court

here, and in this case, and it may not be in many cases,

10

did not sufficiently allege these State law causes of

Did you -- are you

And again, it says, the court

finds that plaintiff failed to allege State tort law

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In answer to Justice

23

Scalia's question, basically the only difference you

24

have with the -- with the Fifth Circuit is that you

25

would say fees fairly attributable to Federal claims as
50
Alderson Reporting Company

opposed to fees exclusively attributable to Federal

2

claims; is that correct?

3

MR. STANCIL:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
So your presumption

5

would be that if the fees are -- support both State and

6

Federal claims, you're still entitled to fees?

7

MR. STANCIL:

But they have to be judged,

8

and this is under the eighth of these Johnson factors,

9

they have to be judged in the context of the overall

10
11
12
13

suit or the overall action to enforce section 1983.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I still -- I don't

understand what that means.
MR. STANCIL:

Well, if we were -- if we had

14

-- if as Petitioner suggests, this really was just an

15

add-on claim, that it was a section 1983 claim, and by

16

the way, you know, here are my breach of contract

17

claims, and, you know, it may also be a taking; and

18

nobody spent any time doing it and nobody spent a whole

19

of lot of -- you know, worried about the taking claim.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You want district courts

21

to determine how important the 1983 claim was in

22

relationship to the State claim?

23

MR. STANCIL:

Correct, Your Honor; I think

24

-- I think that's correct.

And I think that's precisely

25

the point of Hensley; and again as this case comes

before this Court, whether the district court abused its

Thank you, Your Honor.

I actually like Mr. Stancil's cake metaphor.

15

how much more energy it takes to bake this particular

16

sliver of the cake.

That is a misreading of that one sentence,

that sentence, which was the district court said that

23

they were not on notice that they needed to separately

24

defend the State law claims.

25

did not need to separately defend the State law claims.

Our whole point is they

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The district court was all turned around about the need

2

to do something separate.
And the reason we can be sure that Justice

3
4

Sotomayor's reading of the complaint is the same as

5

everyone else's is because the lawyers in this case, the

6

defense counsel, did realize that there were State law

7

claims.

Each one of them has three separate

reference to -- references to, if we are found liable

13

motivating them is irrelevant, unless of course apropos

14

of the earlier question, what was going on was they

15

really ratcheted up because they lose sleep over Federal

16

claims more than over State claims.
But, you know, a slip and fall, if you layer

17
18

on top of it a 1983 claim, no one's losing more sleep

19

over it.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if there's a cap on the

21

liability for the nonfrivolous claim but not -- maybe

22

treble damages on the frivolous claim?

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I think that would be

24

exceptional circumstance under which the district court

25

would be entitled to take into consideration something

1

that's quite a bit more extraordinary.

2

advocating an -- you know, hard and fast absolute rule,

3

just a guideline of the sort that this Court routinely

4

adopts.

5

And so I'm not

I mean, the notion that -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was wondering kind

6

of as a starting point, and I don't know why you would

7

fight so vigorously against the verbal formulation

8

"fairly attributable."

9

when they get it, they're going to start by looking at

I assume most district courts,

10

whatever his affidavit, this is how much our fees were,

11

and then if there's some reason, perhaps Mr. Stancil's

12

case, where everybody thinks it's a Federal that's all,

13

or maybe not, then they can just go "fairly

14

attributable" rather than but-for, which gives the

15

district court a lot more leeway and the sort of leeway

16

we have always held in this area they should have.

17

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

18

actually believe -- if I may answer the question, it is

19

quite a bit easier to apply a but-for test and review it

20

on appeal than it is to apply a test that is just a

21

mishmash of factors over, if which the stakes are high

22

enough, and they will be under Mr. Stancil's rule, there

23

is an enormous incentive to litigate to death.

24
25

If there are no further questions -- I thank
the Court for its attention.
