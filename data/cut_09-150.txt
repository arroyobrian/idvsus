ORAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. PALMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Formality is indeed essential to testimonial

11

utterance.

12

with two related situations:

13

by police officers and questions by 9-1-1 operators.

14

This Court noted that such questioning may often lack

15

the formality essential to testimonial utterance, as

16

officers called to investigate need to know whom they

17

are dealing with in order to assess a situation, the

18

threat to themselves, and the potential danger to

19

possible victims.

20

So said this Court in Davis, which dealt
On-the-scene questioning

The question here is whether those same

21

assessing questions -- what happened, who did it, where

22

did it happen -- asked by police officers who, upon

23

receiving a radio report of a man shot, found a wounded

24

man lying on the ground next to a car at a gas station,

25

bleeding, visibly in pain, and having trouble talking -

1

were made in a formal context sufficiently similar to a

2

magisterial examination so that the answers by the dying

3

-- by the dying victim are testimonial.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it can't all

5

be the formality of the context.

6

came in and said, well, has this person -- Rick, I

7

guess -- sold you drugs before, what was the -- what was

8

the quantity, and all those sorts of questions, the

9

answers to that would be testimonial, despite the same

10

I mean, if the police

lack of formality.

11

MS. PALMER:

Which is where the ongoing

12

emergency test from Davis comes into play.

13

questions need to be -- the primary purpose needs to be

14

to meet an ongoing emergency.

15

assessing the danger to others.

16

beyond that could arguably be testimonial, while -

Formality or no formality has nothing to

MS. PALMER:

Well, under Davis, you said

22

that was how you tested the formality.

If -- the Davis

23

test is a gauge of formality.

24

that respond to ongoing emergency, then this Court has

25

said that that is an indicator that it lacks the

1

formality.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do we tell that?

3

Because it seems to me, here, if you want to know what

4

happened, you'd ask the very same questions.

5

saying the questions are relevant also to securing the

6

situation.

7

you ask if you wanted to find out what happened?

8

was the past -- what were the past events?

9

You're

But what -- what different questions would
What

I mean, I'm trying to understand how you

10

take these questions and say we can put a label on them

11

here that says, well, this is to control an emergency

12

situation versus we want to know what happened

13

historically.

14

MS. PALMER:

Well, I think that what you

15

have to do is look at the -- I mean, obviously, things

16

can have dual purposes and often will.

17

at the primary purpose here.

18

an objective -- what would an objective person

19

viewing this test -

20
21
22

You need to look

And you said in Davis it's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But whose primary

purpose is it?
I mean, the victim here knew that the

23

incident hadn't happened there.

There was nothing he

24

had to share with the police, because they could see he

25

was bleeding from his stomach and he had been shot.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official

1

apparently didn't fear any threat, or there doesn't seem

2

to be any circumstances suggesting an immediate threat

3

to him.

4

had gone.

He had driven away.

5
6

Rick didn't know where he

So what's the ongoing emergency to the
victim?

7

MS. PALMER:

Well, I think here -- which is

8

why in Davis you said is the primary purpose of the

9

questioning, is what you look at in Davis.

10

And we're

not asking you to overrule that.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, wait a minute.

12

What is the primary -- isn't -- doesn't -- isn't there a

13

footnote that says the primary purpose of the declarant

14

is what is at issue?

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is -- that is what it

says.

17

MS. PALMER:

What -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's the -- it's the -

19

it's the purpose of the declarant, not of the

20

questioner.

21

MS. PALMER:

But the formality indicators

22

that the Court delineated in Davis did not include

23

whether the answers to the questions were for the

24

purpose of establishing past events, but whether the

25

primary purpose of the questions were for those ends.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The -- the question is one of context, not

2

content, as you noticed in -- as you said in Crawford.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, in Davis, the

4

issue is why was the declarant talking?

5

trying to do was to figure out whether the declarant was

6

seeking help or attempting to get someone arrested.

7

That's how I read the situation.

8
9

What you were

The questions provided context for that.
Are you seeking immediate ongoing help or are you

10

talking about an event, attempting to get the police to

11

intercede and arrest the person?

12

Isn't that a fair reading of that case?

13

MS. PALMER:

Yes.

And in Davis, you said

14

also that there comes a point where courts can tell when

15

the questioning takes on a different tone and the

16

answers might become testimonial.

17

When the questioning seeks answers that go

18

beyond meeting the emergency, then courts can properly

19

find there's a point where the nontestimonial statements

20

end and the testimonial statements -

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

In a situation like this, do

22

you think it's meaningful to ask what the primary

23

purpose of the victim was when he responded to the

24

police and said who shot him?

25

You have a man who has just been shot.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official

1

has a wound that's going to turn out to be fatal, and

2

he's lying there on the ground bleeding profusely, and

3

he says:

4

they can respond to an ongoing emergency.

5

also have the purpose of giving them information that

6

could be used at trial, but it's a little less -- that's

7

a little bit less my purpose than responding to the

8

ongoing emergency.

9
10

My primary purpose in saying this is so that
No, but I

It seems like it's totally artificial.
MS. PALMER:

Yes.

And I think it -- any

11

time you ask the courts to delve into the subjective

12

intent of someone who is not present and cannot testify

13

and cannot tell you, it necessarily complicates things.

14

And I think it would -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What possible response to

16

an ongoing emergency could he have had in mind?

17

possible response to an ongoing emergency?

18

MS. PALMER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What

He did ask for EMS -
He was bleeding to death,

20

and he could have said, you know, I'm bleeding to death.

21

Now, that statement would -- would be, you know,

22

suggesting an ongoing emergency.

23

But giving the name of the person who shot

24

him, where he was shot, what does that have anything -

25

how does that have anything to do with an ongoing
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

emergency?

2

MS. PALMER:

Well, the police, upon

3

responding to the scene, don't know that this emergency

4

is limited -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MS. PALMER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MS. PALMER:

9

But he does.

-- to that person.
But he does.

Which is why you have to look

at the entire context.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He knows -- he knows that

11

his -- that the person that shot him is nowhere near

12

there.

13

away was it?

14

where the shooter was.

15

He knows that -- that he drove, what -- how far
Six blocks or -- a good distance from
He knows all of that.

The only reason he could be giving the name

16

of the person who shot him is so that person could be

17

apprehended and punished.

18

MS. PALMER:

And yet that subjective mindset

19

doesn't affect the formality.

20

fact that this is an informal situation.

25

rule and that we will allow the Government -

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then -- then your

2

answer is that if we typed it as nontestimonial in my

3

trial scenario, it would be nontestimonial; it comes in.

4

MS. PALMER:

As long as it was not somehow

5

barred by the rules of hearsay, which I believe it would

6

be.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm confused of

8

what -- what Davis focuses our inquiry on.

9

purpose of the interrogators or is it the purpose of the

10

Is it the

declarants?

11

We say the statements are testimonial when

12

the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no

13

such ongoing emergency and that the primary purpose of

14

the interrogation is to establish or prove past events.

15

The -- the focus seems to be on the purpose of the

16

interrogation, which seems to be the question of what

17

the police thought, not what the -- the person dying

18

thought.

19

MS. PALMER:

That's correct.

And I

20

understand there is the footnote stating that,

21

obviously, the declarant's statements are at issue.

22

there were no declarant, then -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MS. PALMER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If

Yes, I mean -

-- there wouldn't be an issue.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

But what the

Official

1

footnote -- I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what the

2

footnote says is, in the final analysis, it's the

3

declarant's statements, not the interrogator's question,

4

that the Confrontation Clause requires us to evaluate.

5

So which -- I guess, which is it?

6

MS. PALMER:

Well, I think what happens is

7

the -- the interrogator's statements are not what are

8

going to be determined to be testimonial or

9

nontestimonial.

They provide a glimpse into the context

10

so we can determine whether those statements that are at

11

issue are testimonial or nontestimonial.

12

way to determine the formality of the situation.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They are one

One way to evaluate those

14

statements is what they are made in response to.

15

they are made in response to a certain type of police

16

inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial.

17

another kind -- you know, are you dying?

18

likely not to be testimonial.

19

statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether

20

they are testimonial or not.

And

They are more

But it is ultimately the

21

MS. PALMER:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.

But as -
Well, then, how does

23

that apply?

Now, is that testimonial or not?

Because

But you can -
And if you're worried about

5

that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on

the ground or do you examine the gas station first,

7

rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter

8

that you think is still in the gas station?

9

The -- the behavior of the police here gave

10

no indication that they thought they were in danger

11

immediately and were interrogating this person in order

12

to assess the danger to them.

13

14

MS. PALMER:

That wasn't what they

Well, to be fair, this was

15

before Crawford was answered.

16

were to determine whether this was an excited utterance,

17

and the questions that we would like to know now were:

18

What did you do for your safety?

19

What were -- that was not at issue, and that was not

20

asked.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The questions were asked

How were you worried?

Well, I'm not -- I'm not

22

sure that policemen should read Crawford before they

23

perform their -- their peacekeeping duties.

24

25

ask these questions and to use the word either "happens"

Alderson Reporting Company

The question is whether the -- the answers

inquiries.

5

7
8
9

Those are two different

MS. PALMER:

Correct.

And I was simply

saying the record would have been available to check -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And, of course, Crawford

rejects reliability as a criteria.
MS. PALMER:

Yes.

So our position here

10

simply is that you cannot evaluate an ongoing emergency

11

from hindsight.

12

When police -- you know, arrive on a scene

13

and find a wounded man bleeding, they don't know the

14

circumstances until they can find out what happened, who

15

did it, and where did it happen, and try to assess the

16

risk of harm, as you said in Davis, to themselves, to

17

the victim, and to others.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what does that have

19

to do -- we're back to the reliability test, really,

20

because they didn't do anything wrong.

21

to assess the situation.

22

any report of criminal activity occurs.

23

different inquiry than the inquiry of why should that

24

statement be permitted to be introduced at trial?

25

They were trying

But that's what they do when
That's a

It goes to the very essence of reliability.
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Was the statement made under circumstances that would

2

suggest an intent to testify?

3

getting at, isn't it?

4

MS. PALMER:

No.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's really what you're

No.
Well, you are, because

6

you're trying to pigeonhole yourself into an ongoing

7

emergency that suggests that in those situations,

8

whatever the person is saying is okay because it was

9

done to assess an emergency situation and not done for

10

purposes of catching somebody, primary purpose of

11

catching somebody.

12

MS. PALMER:

Which is what this Court said

13

in Davis, and said that that was not related to

14

reliability but to formality there, and that that was

15

not a formal thing akin to magisterial examinations.

16

We're not trying to question or in any way

17

change the test already set forth by this Court in

18

Davis.

19

with the application by the lower court of that test

20

here and the limitation it put on it.

21

We agree with that test.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We simply disagree

So are you saying that

22

the rule would be that whenever the perpetrator may be

23

in the vicinity, then the police are pursuing an urgent

24

emergency situation, rather than trying to find out what

25

had -- the nature of the crime?
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. PALMER:

We're not saying that any time

2

there is a perpetrator at large, there is automatically

3

an ongoing emergency until that person is caught.

4

What we are saying is that preliminary

5

inquiries on the scene to try to determine who the

6

perpetrator is and where it might be would be -- would

7

be nontestimonial -

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For all crimes, or only

for shooting crimes or knifing crimes?

10

What kinds of crimes would qualify?

11

MS. PALMER:

For explosions?

I think, obviously, violent

12

crimes raise ongoing emergencies, emergencies to

13

which -- more than others.

14

in which it would apply to other crimes.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There could also be contexts

So at least whenever the

16

police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a

17

violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could

18

plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not

19

still nearby, and that testimony will always be

20

admissible?

21

MS. PALMER:

It is preliminary questions

22

designed to assess the risk to themselves, the public,

23

and -

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MS. PALMER:

No, no, no.

So, yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Strike "designed to assess

2

the risk."

3

These policemen didn't say we're assessing the risk.

4

They just asked the questions.

5

to happen in future cases.

6

You don't know what they're designed to do.

And that's what is going

And you're saying, whenever policemen come

7

upon a victim of violent crime and said who did it,

8

what's his name, all of that will always be admissible

9

because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?

10

MS. PALMER:

I think if the context shows

11

that's the primary purpose, then, yes, that will often

12

be the case.

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you mean?

How

could it possibly be admissible?

15

First, there has to be a degree of

16

formality, as the Court held in Hammon, sitting in the

17

kitchen; and, second, it has to satisfy State hearsay

18

tests.

19

it is not admissible.

So unless it's an exception to the hearsay rule,

20
21

MS. PALMER:

Well, here, for instance, it

was admitted as excited utterance.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

exceptions.

24

co-conspirator exception.

25

declaration exception.

Well, of course, there are

1

whether the Constitution keeps it out, even though State

2

law -- because, say, it's a co-conspirator exception -

3

would permit it in.

4

So the answer is no, it's not the case that

5

whenever you come across a victim of a crime and ask him

6

questions, it's going to be admissible.

7

The State hearsay law, the exception, and whether

8

there's a degree of formality, as there was in Hammon.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

right?

11

a violent crime is excited.

12

It depends.

Only when he's excited,

Only when the victim who has been the object of

Or if State law doesn't apply and we're

14

right, and trial in Federal court?

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,

Absolutely.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As we understand the rule of

17

Davis v. Washington, it is a rule that focuses on the

18

primary purpose behind police interrogation, because

19

it's designed for a particular purpose:

20

a comprehensive definition of the term "testimonial,"

21

but rather to identify those statements that are

22

testimonial because they are made in response to police

23

interrogation.

24
25

Not to provide

When the objective primary purpose of that
interrogation is to enable police to meet an ongoing
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

emergency, rather than to collect evidence for future

2

possible prosecution, the statements that are given in

3

response to that interrogation are nontestimonial.

4

was -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That

Do you distinguish between

6

collecting evidence for a future prosecution and

7

collecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the

8

felon?

9

Do you distinguish those two?
And you can say these police -- these

10

policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future

11

prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter

12

was and where he was so they could go get him.

13

that -

14

MS. KRUGER:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

Would

Well, I think that -
Would that not be

collecting evidence for a future prosecution?
MS. KRUGER:

I think that there are often

18

multiple reasons, particularly in the wake of a violent

19

event like a shooting, why -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you say it has to be

21

for the purpose of a future prosecution.

22

in order to an arrest and bring into jail the person who

23

committed this crime, that doesn't qualify?

24
25

MS. KRUGER:

Just -- just

I think that what would qualify

under the Davis test is if police need to apprehend the
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person, not for purposes of bringing the person into the

2

criminal justice system, but rather to neutralize an

3

ongoing threat that they present to the community at

4

large, as is often the case when somebody has just

5

proven themselves both capable and -

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:
the case of a violent crime?

8
9

MS. KRUGER:

12

When does that not exist?

I think it makes a significant

difference -

10
11

When does that not exist in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's a violent criminal

out there.
MS. KRUGER:

Justice Scalia, I think it

13

makes a significant difference whether we're talking

14

about a -- an act of violence like a shooting, somebody

15

who has used a weapon that's capable of inflicting

16

deadly harm on multiple victims in a short period of

17

time, or someone who has used their fists, like the

18

alleged perpetrators -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So if you use a gun,

20

a knife, or a machine gun, whatever the victim says gets

21

admitted into evidence, because the police could -

22

could be not -

23

MS. KRUGER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think -
-- not trying to get

evidence, but just trying to safeguard society against

I don't think that we would

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought that's how you

just described it.

6

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I think that in this

7

situation, we have police arriving on the scene to

8

discover a man who has been recently shot; as it turns,

9

fatally.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. KRUGER:

12

Yes.


They need to find out in that


situation -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MS. KRUGER:

Who did it.


They need to find out who did


15

it so that they make sure that person isn't continuing

16

to threaten other people on the scene.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's always the case.

18

That's such a phony evasion of what the purpose of the

19

testimonial rule is.

20

case, at least when there's a violent crime.

That's always going to be the

21

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I think -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you may as well take

23

Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of

24

serious cases, if that's going to be your rule.

25

MS. KRUGER:

I don't think that that's the
23


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case at all, Justice Scalia.

2

much consistent with what this Court said in Davis.

3

I think it's actually very

It may very well have been that the

4

subjective purpose of the 9-1-1 operator was also to

5

bring the perpetrator in that case to justice.

6

Court, I think quite properly, recognized that in an

7

emergency situation, the attention of both law

8

enforcement and the declarant is quite properly going to

9

be focused on dealing with the emergency at hand and is

10

not going to be made of the kind of focused

11

understanding of -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But this

The crime was ongoing in -

13

in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with

14

the operator.

15

from the emergency that was occurring to her at that

16

moment.

It was ongoing.

She was seeking help

There's nothing like that here.

17

MS. KRUGER:

It's true that that is a

18

factual distinction between this case and Davis, but we

19

don't think that it's one that makes a dispositive legal

20

difference.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did the police know that

22

that was the case when they began the questioning?

23

24

he was not going to act in self-defense when they came

25

after him?

MS. KRUGER:

That's correct.

They had no

6

way of knowing that.

7

think it's important to emphasize -- did the declarant.

8

The fact that he was able to escape the scene and

9

managed to drive himself six blocks away in no way

10

And neither, for that matter -- I

indicates that he had any -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MS. KRUGER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Will they ever know that?

I -
I mean, is that -- is that

14

likely not always to be the case when -- when you come

15

upon a person who has been the -- the victim of a

16

violent crime?

17

You could say it all the time.

No, they

18

didn't know where the -- where the offender was, so

19

whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a

20

trial.

21

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I think it's important to

22

emphasize that what we're arguing for is not a rule that

23

would say, as long as there's a violent perpetrator at

24

large, as long as he is at large, any questions that

25

police ask of -- of potential people who have
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

information about the crime will necessarily be

2

nontestimonial.

3

Our argument is a far narrower one, and one

4

that we think follows very closely from the principle

5

articulated in Davis, which is when the primary purpose

6

of a police interrogation is to obtain information

7

that's necessary to enable them to meet an ongoing

8

emergency -

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, how do you know

that?

MS. KRUGER:

Let's say -

They weren't asking the kinds

of questions -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's say that we -- let's

5

say that we agree with you that there was an emergency

6

and the police were asking questions in order to

7

mitigate the emergency.

8
9

What would be the rationale for admitting
this statement, then?

Is it more reliable?

Because if

10

we say that, then we're undercutting Crawford, which

11

says reliability is not the key.

12

What is the reason for that?

Is it because

13

the police likely have less motive to manipulate the -

14

the statements and to ask loaded questions?

15

itself, it seems to me, is a reliable -- but what's

16

the -- assuming we adopt your distinction, what's the

17

rationale for the distinction?

18

MS. KRUGER:

That in

We think that the principle

19

that this Court announced in Davis and we're asking the

20

Court to apply again today reflects two principles that

21

underlie the Confrontation Clause as this Court

22

interpreted in Crawford.

23

The first is that testimony is typically

24

characterized by the kind of focused understanding by

25

the declarant that the person is providing information
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for potential use in a future prosecution.

It's -- the

2

petitioner in Davis, I would note, made an argument to

3

this Court that whenever a person calls 9-1-1, they do

4

so with an awareness that the information they provide

5

may be used for prosecutorial purposes.

6

But this Court rejected that argument,

7

because it understood, I think quite rightly, that

8

there's a difference between providing that sort of

9

information to law enforcement with a sort of vague

10

awareness that that might be its potential use, and

11

doing so with a kind of focused understanding that has

12

been characteristic of the testimonial statements this

13

Court has so far identified, like Sylvia Crawford's

14

stationhouse interview in Crawford or Amy Hammon's

15

interview with the police officer from the safety of her

16

kitchen that resulted in the execution of a formal

17

affidavit in the Davis case.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we look to the

19

specific situation?

I mean, one of the officers zeroed

20

in on the victim.

21

anybody was lurking in the bushes.

22

protecting the public, do we take into account that this

23

was between 3:30 and 4:00 in the morning when there are

24

not likely to be many members of the public around?

25

do we just say you find someone who looks like he has

No one was looking around to see if

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Then, as far as

Or

Official

1

been the victim of a violent crime, doesn't matter

2

whether the public is around or not, we -- that's

3

enough, the victim of a violent crime can be asked these

4

questions?

5

MS. KRUGER:

To take your first question

6

first, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the trial

7

testimony is not quite as clear on the question of what

8

fears the officers had as I think Respondent has

9

suggested in his brief.

If you look at Joint Appendix

10

page 136, Officer Stuglin testified that he was, in

11

fact, afraid for his safety when he got to the gas

12

station.

13

they left the gas station after EMS arrived, they

14

proceeded immediately to the location of the shooting,

15

the location that Anthony Covington had identified for

16

them.

17

position, they waited for back-up, and they did so

18

because they were afraid that a shooter was in the

19

house, and they wanted to proceed very cautiously in

20

making sure that they neutralized the threat that

21

shooter posed to the public safety, including their own.

22

I would note that all of the officers, when

When they got there, they took a tactical

I think that in examining the exigencies of

23

a situation a court would be justified in looking at the

24

circumstances in which the crime occurred, and could

25

very well take into account the fact that the crime
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

occurred at 3 o'clock in the morning as opposed to 5

2

o'clock in the afternoon.

3

expect any reasonable police officer to do precisely

4

what the police officers in this case did, which was

5

proceed directly to the scene, not use their interview

6

with Anthony Covington as an occasion to execute an

7

affidavit or otherwise engage -

8
9

But I think that we would

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but then you're

saying that the focus is on the police officers.

I

10

mean, after all, we're not saying that police officers

11

can't do this; we're just saying the testimonial aspects

12

can't be admitted into evidence or that's what your

13

friend is arguing for.

14

out is the issue the purpose of the interrogating

15

officers or the purpose and intent of the declarant?

16

MS. KRUGER:

I still have trouble figuring

I think that the test that the

17

Court set out in Davis is one that focuses on the

18

purpose of the interrogation because of the limited

19

context in which that -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

And what do

21

you do with the last sentence of footnote 1.

22

one that says -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. KRUGER:

acknowledgement that answers given in response to police

interrogation do not constitute the universe of possible

5

testimonial statements, that testimony can indeed be

6

volunteered as was Lord Cobham's letter, for example, in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER JON VAN HOEK

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16

MR. VAN HOEK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When Anthony Covington made his statement to

17

the officers at the gas station, not just once but

18

several times, he reasonably understood that he was

19

providing the police information as to events which had

20

concluded a half hour earlier at a location six blocks

21

away, with an understanding that that information would

22

assist the police in locating, apprehending, and

23

potentially prosecuting the person he felt was

24

responsible for his injury.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. VAN HOEK:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Apprehending.

Arresting -
-- involves something like

6

that, if -- what keeps that out?

I mean, assuming that

7

a State law or the Federal Rules of Evidence admit it as

8

an exception to the hearsay rule, why should the

9

Confrontation Clause bar it?

There is not great

10

likelihood that, like Sir Walter Raleigh or Cobham's

11

affidavit, it is going to be introduced per se into the

12

trial as a form of evidence that there was -- why would

13

we want to keep it out?

understand.

I'd like to hear your

answer because I don't think we decided it in Crawford.

7
8

Perhaps there is another

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now is a good time

to try to jump in, I think.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. VAN HOEK:

Okay.

The reason, Your

11

Honor, that the Confrontation Clause is the

12

fundamental -- part of the fundamental law of the

13

country, and what this Court, I believe, decided in

14

Crawford and then applied to those situations -- similar

15

situations in Davis and Hammon, is that where you have a

16

statement from a witness to a police officer as part of

17

a questioning and that statement is the functional

18

equivalent of testimony that witness would have given

19

had he or she appeared at trial and been subject to

20

cross-examination, then the admission of that statement

21

at trial even under a hearsay exception without

22

cross-examination effectively allows the police to

23

present -

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But does it mean -- does it

mean that the individual is thinking this may be used -
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's a certain formality to the situation; it may be

2

used at trial?

3

mean, what is the relevance of the formality of the

4

situation?

5

not an expert in history, and I'm also -- I understand

6

there have been situations where the Court's gone back

7

to prior cases and looked at footnotes and said it

8

doesn't express things precisely clearly and changed it

9

a little bit.

10

Or it may just happen to turn out?

I

When I looked into history I thought -- I'm

I think that that goal could be open to

us.

11

So I want to know what the basic reason is

12

that there -- that would justify keeping out, let's say,

13

an investigation.

14

and a policeman comes across a confederate who makes

15

some statements just generally that help the

16

investigation; therefore, it would come in under -- as

17

co-conspiracy, okay?

18

There's an investigation of a crime,

What in the Constitution, what functional

19

principle, is there that says we should keep that out of

20

Court?

21

MR. VAN HOEK:

Because I think what this

22

Court said in Crawford and Davis is that is the primary

23

test.

24

the reliability, the believability, the trustworthiness

25

of that evidence to be evaluated by a jury.

That is what our Constitution requires to allow

34

Alderson Reporting Company

We don't

Official

1

have a situation -

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it all hearsay?

Now,

3

all -- all hearsay evidence, despite State or Federal

4

rule makers saying there are exceptions where the

5

trustworthiness is sufficient, such as co-confederates,

6

confederates, all of that's wiped out by Crawford and

7

the -

8
9
10

MR. VAN HOEK:

statement at issue qualifies as testimonial under the
test this Court announced in Crawford and Davis.

11
12

It would be wiped out if the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what we said in

Crawford, isn't it?

13

MR. VAN HOEK:

Yes, it is.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, what I'm looking

15

for now because I'm -- is whether there's any sense to

16

that.

17

Crawford, but I have to admit to you I've had many

18

second thoughts when I've seen how far it has extended

19

as I have written it.

20

What is the constitutional rationale?

MR. VAN HOEK:

I joined

Well, I would have to say the

21

constitutional justification for that is the reason why

22

the right of confrontation is, isn't it, in the

23

Constitution, where you had a situation in English

24

common law, as we said, where magistrates were allowed

25

to go out, interview witnesses, come into court, and
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

present their memory, their version, of what the witness

2

said as substantive evidence in a case and the defense

3

is not allowed to question or talk to the witness -

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

So now you've just got what

5

I'm looking for.

6

Blackstone a little bit and look back and see what this

7

was after, was the problem of Sir Walter Raleigh's trial

8

and the Marian judges.

9

Because if I can't find a line, then what we've done,

What I'm looking for is I can go into

And now what I need is a line.

10

which seems just as wrong to me, is suddenly bar

11

virtually all hearsay exception evidence, of which for

12

400 years, or 200 years anyway, there has been quite a

13

lot in the courts.

14
15
16
17
18

MR. VAN HOEK:

I certainly don't think

Crawford and Davis bars all hearsay exception -
JUSTICE BREYER:

What, in your view, is the

correct line and why, most importantly why?
MR. VAN HOEK:

I believe this Court in

19

Crawford and Davis correctly established that line, in a

20

situation like this where it is the response of a

21

citizen to questions from a police officer, that you

22

look primarily, as footnote 1 indicates, to the content

23

of that statement.

24
25

If that's -

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it were established that

this was a dying declaration and was done in -- made in

2

contemplation of death, would it be barred by Crawford?
MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, this Court certainly

3

has suggested that in Giles, that a dying declaration

4

might be an exception to Crawford as an exception that

5

existed at the time of the framing.

6

deal with that question in this case because this is not

7

a dying declaration.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

We don't have to

Well, why not?

I understand -- I understand

10

that, but assume -- assume for the sake of argument that

11

it would be consistent with Crawford if it were a dying

12

declaration, which the Court has suggested.

13

that tell you about the understanding of the scope of

14

the confrontation right at the time when the Sixth

15

Amendment was adopted?

16

very well be testimonial under -- is likely to be

17

testimonial under the Crawford test.

What does

MR. VAN HOEK:

Yes.

And I think that the

19

dying -- maybe the dying declaration as being in that

20

situation is an indication.

21

dying declaration from all these other hearsay

22

exceptions is that, at the point the statement was made,

it's an understanding that that witness is never goint

I thought -- I thought the

rationale for dying declaration admissions was that they

are inherent reliable -- inherently reliable.

You can

But I thought that that was

MR. VAN HOEK:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that's correct.
On your death bed before

you're going to meet the maker, you're not going to

lie -- I think that was the test.

14

reliability component, correct?

15

MR. VAN HOEK:

So it was a

That's true.

And I think

16

that's -- that's also the -- the background of most

17

hearsay exceptions is that for the circumstances that

18

there's some degree of inherent reliability to that

19

statement which excuses the absence of cross-examination

20

if the witness is unavailable.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -
Now, suppose that there is

22

a universe of instances that we can identify as

23

questions in order to alleviate and stop an emergency to

24

prevent a crime from becoming aggravated and continuous.

25

Let's suppose we can have a universe of those questions.

MR. VAN HOEK:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is -- is there an argument

3

that responses made for that purpose are more reliable?

4

Is that what -- is that what underlies the so-called

5

emergency exception, do you think?

6

MR. VAN HOEK:

I don't believe so.

I don't

7

believe that -- that a -- a statement by a witness that

8

is a narrative of past events -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it -- so -- well -

10

and, of course, Davis certainly does not rest on

11

reliability -- or Crawford, rather, doesn't rest on

12

reliability.

13

MR. VAN HOEK:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. VAN HOEK:

No, no.

The 911 -- well, the

fact there's a 911 -

18
19

But isn't that really the

only way to explain the 911 exception?

16
17

No.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Isn't there a reliability

component that underlies this whether we like it or not?

20

MR. VAN HOEK:

I don't believe so.

I don't

21

think that the fact that someone calls 911 and makes a

22

report, whether they're talking about an ongoing

23

situation or reporting a past event, makes that somehow

24

inherently more reliable than if they used another

25

medium.
39

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I think the distinction made in Davis is

2

that the beginning of the 911 call that Ms. McCottry was

3

making to the case was not relating past events.

4

a declaration of emergency.

It was a call for immediate

It's a contemporaneous observation.

Therefore, it is

MR. VAN HOEK:

I don't -- no, I don't think

13

nontestimonial.

14

nontestimonial because it was not what a witness does

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's go back to this

MR. VAN HOEK:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Excited utterance was -

20

the prosecutor thought that was his best shot, and he -

21

and he prevailed, except that the -- Davis intervened.

I asked Ms. Palmer, suppose we were back

23

there at the trial and the prosecutor knew that excited

utterance wouldn't work.

25

declaration?

Could he have raised dying

She said absolutely yes.
40

Alderson Reporting Company

1

So my question to you is:

Just assume that

2

we should hold the Confrontation Clause is applicable.

3

Shouldn't the prosecutor then have a chance to say,

4

well, if I realized that, I could have made a dying

5

declaration plea here.

6

allow the prosecutor to try to establish that this

7

testimony was a dying declaration?

8
9

So it would only be fair to

MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, in -- in this case,

when -- when the initial attempted admission of this

10

evidence, at the preliminary exam, when it met a hearsay

11

objection, the prosecutor at that point argued that it

12

was admissible under Michigan evidence rules as either

13

an excited utterance and/or a dying declaration.

14
15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then she did argue dying

declaration.

16

MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, they argued dying

17

declaration.

18

he had not established the foundation for either one of

19

those.

20

foundation solely for excited utterance.

21

ruled the evidence admissible and specifically said

22

admissible only as excited utterance.

23

The judge sustained the objection and said

Mr. Van Hoek, what is the

exception from the Confrontation Clause?

I don't know

what the -

It is an exception from

hearsay, for certain, but from the Confrontation Clause?

MR. VAN HOEK:

I'm not -- if I -- if I

said is that this -

to the prior question to say that I conceded that, I'm

7

not saying that.

question about dying declaration, I pointed out that

this Court in Giles indicated that that may be an

MR. VAN HOEK:

Giles made the statement maybe

Yes.

And as you said, this

20

Court has not reached that question directly, and -- and

21

there's no need to reach that question in this case

22

because this is not a dying declaration case.

And it has not been decided.
Can there be a situation in

20

which the primary purpose for a statement or for the

21

question that elicits the statement is to respond to an

22

ongoing emergency rather than to gather evidence for

23

subsequent use in a legal proceeding when the statement

24

relates to something that has occurred, perhaps just a

25

few seconds before, but it relates to something that has
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

occurred as opposed to something that is occurring at

2

that very moment?

3

MR. VAN HOEK:

I think there are situations

4

where -- where the police are coming in and asking

5

questions:

6

here who is -- who is threatening you?

7

here who is coming to threaten you or threaten other

8

people?

9

information to put that in context, but we don't have

anything like that in this case.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I understand, but we

12

need to know where to draw the line.

13

that the line is not between a statement about he's

14

hitting me with a baseball bat as opposed to he just

15

finished hitting me with a baseball bat and is headed

16

out the door?

17

So, you concede

That's not where the line is drawn.

MR. VAN HOEK:

I think the line would be

18

drawn if those were the only statements, he's hitting me

19

with a baseball bat versus he -- he just hit me with a

20

baseball bat and he just left.

21

clearly drawn in Davis between -- the hitting me with a

22

baseball bat would be nontestimonial -

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think the line is

No, no.

I really would like

24

a clear answer to this.

Is -- can there be an ongoing

25

emergency where the statement relates -- where the
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statement recounts something that has occurred, not

2

something that is occurring?

3

MR. VAN HOEK:

I think that in the absence

4

of any statement by the witness alleging that there's

5

any current, ongoing, imminent danger, if the witness

6

only gives a statement that relates to past, completed

7

events, then it's not a showing of -- of an ongoing

8

emergency.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what do you do -

10

what do you do with the statement the guy in the gas

11

station shot me?

12

ongoing emergency?

13
14

Is that purely past, or is that an

MR. VAN HOEK:

That statement standing

alone -- I would say that that's past, purely past.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even though the guy

16

in the gas station is still there with a gun, the police

17

are within range?

18
19

Are we referring to a

specific person?

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

I mean, that

21

strikes me as something that happened in the past, he

22

shot me, but at the same time demonstrates an ongoing

23

emergency because he's right there and he might shoot

24

you.

25

Justice Alito doesn't work.

I'm suggesting the line you propose to

46

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, I -- I would -- I

2

don't -- I don't think that -- that the -- the -- there

3

has been discussion of verbs tense and past tense, and I

4

don't think that is the -- is the determining factor.

5

It's certainly important.

6

consideration in -

7

It's certainly a relevant

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The guy in the gas station

8

is present.

It's not past.

He's making an assertion

9

the guy who is now in the gas station shot me.

The

10

"shot me" is past, but he's asserting that the person is

13

That is a statement of a

MR. VAN HOEK:

Yes.

And I think if you look

14

at all of the circumstances together, it's a -- it's -

15

and going to the primary purpose is, is the witness

16

declaring some type of emergency, some sort of imminent

17

harm and requesting the police to render assistance to

alleviate that, to protect him -- him or her.

circumstances don't know whether John Jones is going on

victims.

How can they -- how can you answer that

question, what's the primary purpose there?

13

don't understand it.

14

MR. VAN HOEK:

I just

Well, I would think -- in

15

that situation, nothing about the Davis rule, nothing

16

about the Confrontation Clause precludes the police from

17

taking that information and asking those further

18

questions -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you -- you were the

20

one that drew the line between a past event and an

21

ongoing event.

now, and I'm going to shoot three other students,

23

good-bye.

Suppose the sniper says, I've shot you

That's a past event.
MR. VAN HOEK:

But if the statement is made

to the police that a sniper has said he's -- he is on
48

Alderson Reporting Company

the verge of shooting other people because he just shot

2

someone, I would say that's certainly a declaration of

3

an emergency and certainly would be nontestimonial under

4

the -- under the test of Davis.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any -- I'll try

6

this -- I think you're just -- you don't like my -

7

where I'm coming from, but -- and so you might not have

8

an answer to this.

9

But -- but in my mind, I see a line, and

10

that line is dividing what I think of as the

11

Confrontation Clause, Sir Walter Raleigh situation,

12

which I have in my mind as people going into a room and

13

saying, now write out your testimony, and they write it

14

out in the form of an affidavit, or they send in a

15

letter, and they say "bye," and then they walk next door

16

to the trial and introduce it.

I mean, that's Walter

6

they're getting narratives of past events from

7

witnesses, and they're acting on that.

8

about this rule prevents them from doing that.

And

And nothing

But the admissibility -- for them to be able

10

to come into court, and they alone to come into court,

11

and say this is what this witness told me and this is

12

what this witness told me and this is what this witness

told me -- and by the way, defense counsel, those

JUSTICE BREYER:

Davis is that the -- the definition of testimonial is

not across the board -

24

I guess it depends on what

you mean by "in the past," as Justice Breyer put it.
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Undoubtedly, under the regime of United

2

States v. Reynolds, which was what, 25 years old -

I'm sorry.

Roberts, which -
No relation.

Roberts.

I'm sorry.

9

Roberts, which -- Reynolds was the Mormon case -- which

10

was about 25 years old or so when Crawford was decided,

11

yes, hearsay was your protection, and that was it.

12

if by what you mean is in the past, Crawford examined

13

the past, and its conclusion as to what the past said is

14

quite different from what Justice Breyer now says,

15

although he joined Crawford.

16

MR. VAN HOEK:

Yes.

But

I -- and as you said,

17

in Crawford this Court looked at that and thought that

18

the protections of the hearsay rule, and the focus under

19

the Roberts standard of whether a statement fell within

20

a firmly established hearsay rule, was not sufficient

21

under the Constitution, under the Confrontation Clause,

22

to -- to alleviate the fact that there -- there's no

23

cross-examination.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Many -- I mean, like many

cases there is language that takes -- that can take us
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

far afield from the subject matter before us.

2

will admit that I did not foresee the scope of Crawford.

3

So I'm really asking about that scope and, in

4

particular, whether, looking to the past or to reason or

5

to whatever you want, there is a good reason for keeping

6

out the testimony of, say, a co-confederate, a

7

co-conspirator, where it was elicited, not with intent

8

to introduce it into the courtroom, but it was elicited

9

in the course of an ordinary investigation of a crime.

10

MR. VAN HOEK:

And I

Well, I'd have to go back to

11

my answer that the Confrontation Clause is the primary

12

law of the country, not State hearsay evidentiary rules.

13

Many of the examples -- the co-conspirator -- the

14

co-conspirator exception is not going to be applicable

15

in many cases because those statements aren't made to

16

police officers; they're made between co-conspirators in

17

the course of a conspiracy.

18

requirement.

19

That's the foundational

It's not going to eliminate hearsay rules.

20

Statements made to private citizens, statements made in

21

a lot of different circumstances are still going to be

22

evaluated solely under hearsay rules because they're not

23

going to be defined as testimonial, because they're not

24

the product of police -- police questioning.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm still trying to

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understand your conception of the scope of the ongoing

2

emergency doctrine.

3

idea is that the police have to have specific evidence

4

that there is an immediate threat of physical violence

5

that they want -- they need to respond to, in order for

6

the ongoing emergency doctrine to apply?

Would it be fair to say that your

can't do it.

Yes.

They have to -

immediate threat or not an immediate threat, then that

11

doesn't fall within that exception.

My position is that where the

13

witness has not provided any information to the police

indicating that there's an immediate threat, either

15

volunteered to the police or in response to questions

16

from the police saying is there a threat?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, not at all.
They can always ask the

questions.

23

ask the questions, but whether, after they ask them, the

24

answers can be introduced at trial.

25

The only issue here is not whether they can

Yes, and if the answers -- no

matter what questions they asked, if the answers all are

a narrative of past events, then that qualifies as

testimonial because it is the -- the equivalent -

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought you just said that

wasn't the test, past versus present.

7

between something that's taking place and something that

8

has taken place?

9

MR. VAN HOEK:

No.

No.

Didn't you say

I think my answer

10

was that -- that if the witness is declaring an

11

emergency and telling the police that there is a -

JUSTICE ALITO:

The witness has to say there

is an emergency?

14

MR. VAN HOEK:

Not in those words but -- but

15

in comparison to what the witness in Davis said, is that

16

he's beating me up.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's a shooting -

18

there's a report of shooting at a school, and the police

19

go and they find two students lying on the ground.

MR. VAN HOEK:

What if there are three

students who have been shot, four students who have been

shot, but nobody says, well, I think he's still in the

building, he may have an interest in shooting some more

students?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, certainly if the police

2

come on the scene and there's multiple students who have

3

been shot, you would think that if their primary

4

purpose -- if the primary purpose, if you take that as a

5

test, that their primary purpose of questioning the

6

witness is to determine whether there's an emergency,

7

they're going to ask those questions.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would they ask his name?

God, it's really important for us to know, four students

10

on the ground.

11

this?

What's the name of the guy that did

That's not the emergency.

MR. VAN HOEK:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.
They'd say:

Where is he?

Of course that -- of course

16

that's the emergency because how are they going to find

17

the person that they -- that they're looking for if they

18

don't know who it is?

19

Of course, if they come upon him and he has his gun in

20

his hand, then it's not a question.

23

What if he's thrown away his gun?

They have to know who to -- who to go

MR. VAN HOEK:

And they can ask all of those

24

questions.

As Justice Scalia said, there's nothing in

25

the -- in this Court's opinion in Davis or nothing in my
58

Alderson Reporting Company

1

position that prevents the police -

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I still -- I'm totally

3

puzzled now as to what you -- when you think there's an

4

ongoing emergency and when there isn't.

5

MR. VAN HOEK:

I think there's an ongoing

6

emergency -- that a statement relates -- would become

7

nontestimonial relating to an ongoing emergency when

8

there's some indication from the statement made by the

9

witness that such -- that there's some immediacy.

10

There's some request for assistance -

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

by the declarant?

13

circumstances?

14
15

It has to be made by the -

It can't be inferred from the

MR. VAN HOEK:

No, I don't think just from

the circumstances, because if you -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, sure it can.

If

17

he says the principal did it.

18

in the morning; you assume the principal is at the

19

school; and he says the principal did it.

20

from the circumstances that he's referring to an ongoing

21

emergency.

22

MR. VAN HOEK:

It's -- it's 10 o'clock

You can infer

I don't -- I don't agree.

I

23

don't agree because if that's the case, any report -- as

24

Justice Scalia I think said previously, any report of a

25

past crime certainly raises the potential that a
59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

subsequent crime will occur.

2

-

3

If that's the case, then

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's quite

4

different than saying, you know, this happened to some

5

guy driving by, or something like that.

6

principal did it, it's at 10 o'clock, it's in the

7

school -- that suggests to me more, not that the dying

8

student or the wounded student wanted to make sure that

9

the principal was convicted, but that there's an

10

If he says the

emergency, something is happening.

11

MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, again, I think that if

12

all it is that the principal shot someone before, that

13

basically is I think the -

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't think there's

15

a danger implicated by coming onto the lawn of a school

16

and a student is there and says the principal shot me

inside?

18

emergency, that the principal is still inside with a

19

gun?

20

You don't think that that suggests an ongoing

MR. VAN HOEK:

Well, if they ask those

21

questions and the principal is still inside and there is

22

an indication that the -

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no, no.

You

24

don't want them to have to go through, you know, a whole

25

list of questions while the student's there dying and
60

the principal is inside the building shooting people?

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did he shoot you because

he had a grudge against you, or is he just shooting -

4

MR. VAN HOEK:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- blindly, and he says

6
7

No -

he shot me?
MR. VAN HOEK:

No.

I'm not taking the

8

position that they have to go through a whole list of

9

questions before they can do anything.

If you go in

10

that a situation and a student says the principal shot

11

someone, certainly nothing about the Davis rule stops

12

them from immediately running into the school and

13

determining if there's a situation there.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LORI B. PALMER

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

18

MS. PALMER:

I'd just like to reiterate that

19

the underlying principle, as this Court has said

20

repeatedly in Crawford and in Davis, is formality, and

21

that's what the purpose of any inquiry should be in

22

looking at -- at the scene, whether there's an emergency

23

or not, or declarant's view or not.

24

to formality akin to a magisterial examination.

25

would also -
61

And I

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's go to formality.

It can't be that you arrive at a scene of a crime and

everything a victim tells you is admissible.

4

to be some emergency.

There has

That's what we've said.

5

MS. PALMER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Right.
Correct?

So the issue

7

here is how do you define that dividing line between

8

emergency and non, when the police officers are just

9

asking questions that by their nature are always going

10

to be testimonial, because they are going to use or try

11

to use whatever is said later?

12

primary purpose, I think your adversary is saying you

13

can't go by what the police officers are asking because

14

they are going to be asking dual motive always.

15

have to look to what the declarant tells you.

16

or she telling you something that suggests an emergency?

17

MS. PALMER:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

So, in discerning the

And is he

Well -
That's really the

difference between the two of you, I think.

20

MS. PALMER:

Well, even if -- even if you

21

take that view, that it's the declarant's purpose,

22

objectively viewed, that controls, I think here it's

23

difficult to see how Covington's purpose could have been

24

to provide evidence any more than the 9-1-1 call in

25

Davis.

I think he was in shock from a bleeding wound.
62

Alderson Reporting Company

He didn't call the police.

2

this wasn't even a 9-1-1 call where he sought them.

3

They came to him.

4

not him.

5

They came to him.

You know,

It's not clear who called, but it was

So even taking it from his point of view,

6

it's -- it's difficult to see here how the purpose would

7

have been anything other than, as he said, when is EMS

8

coming to help me.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand what

10

you're saying.

11

evidence that he knows will be used at trial?

think that's the test.

I don't agree with that, and -
He's intending to accuse

somebody.

16

17

intending to seek help because he has been mortally

18

wounded.
