please -- please let me know.
The court of appeals in this case made two

3

fundamental and separate errors, each of which should

4

require reversal of its decision.

5

the question whether Title IX precludes the use of

6

Section 1983 to enforce the Constitution is a matter of

7

congressional intent.

8

entirely disregarded all of the ordinary indicia of

9

congressional intent:

First, all agree that

Yet, the court of appeals

The statutory text, the statutory

10

background structure and evolution, the unquestioned

11

legislative purpose.

12

Each of these considerations points

13

conclusively towards a single outcome:

14

mean Title IX to preclude the use of Section 1983 to

15

enforce the Constitution.

16

Congress did not

Second, rather than consider any of this

17

direct and compelling evidence of what Congress actually

18

had in mind in Title IX, the court of appeals applied

19

what it thought to be a presumption that the

20

availability of Title IX's implied right of action to

21

enforce Title IX's own statutory prohibition of gender

22

discrimination somehow should be taken to mean that

23

Congress meant to preclude the use of Section 1983 to

24

enforce constitutional rules against discrimination.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Counsel, there is -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is a little bit of an air of unreality about all

2

this, because, of course, Congress didn't provide a

3

cause of action in Title IX to start with.

4

reason they don't have all these limitations and

5

restrictions is because they didn't put in the cause of

6

action.

7

And the

We implied it from the statute, and so it

8

seems kind of awkward to say:

9

limitations, as I said, when there was no cause of

10
11

Well, there are no

action.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I -- I guess there -

12

there are a number of points that I -- I can make in

13

response to that, Your Honor.

14

what -- what you say is absolutely right.

15

not expressly provide a cause of action in Title IX.

16

First of all, I think
Congress did

And so since -- since the question in a

17

preclusion case, the question whether or not Congress

18

meant to preclude the use of Section 1983, is whether

19

there is a clear indication of congressional intent to

20

do so, that there -- as a matter of definition, that

21

can't be present here.

22

But -- but before -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe the question ought to

23

be whether this Court intended to have the Title IX

24

action which it invented preclude 1983.

25

look to the intent of this Court?

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that -

4

Well, I -- I think not, Your

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you agree that this

Court invented the cause of action?

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, I -- I don't agree with

6

that.

I -- I do think -- and -- and I -- this is not my

7

principal point, but I do think it's quite clear that if

8

we are talking about what is the clear intent of

9

Congress regarding preclusion of use of Section 1983,

10

that the Congress did not expressly create a -- a

11

private right of action at all bears very significantly

12

on that.

13

I don't at all disagree that Congress

14

intended and expected that the courts would recognize

15

the right of action under -- under Title IX.

16

Congress actually in Title IX specifically I think

17

addressed the preclusion question that we have here.

18

But

There is a clear statutory test that answers

19

the question in this case in -- in several respects.

20

First of all, when Congress enacted Title IX, it

21

specifically provided that -- it specifically

22

contemplated that there would be continued, private

23

constitutional litigation challenging -- to end

24

discrimination.

25

It specifically authorized the attorney
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

general to intervene in private litigation "whenever" -

2

and I am here quoting from the text of the statute -

3

"whenever suit is initiated in any court of the United

4

States to assert rights, deprivation of equal

5

protection, under the Fourteenth Amendment of the

6

Constitution on account of sex."

7

Congress, therefore, specifically

8

contemplated when it enacted Title IX that there would

9

be -- there would, in fact, be constitutional litigation

10

challenging gender discrimination on account of sex.

11

And Congress surely knew that that litigation would

12

proceed under Section 1983.

13

Respondents -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did we rely on that

14

provision in implying the right of action under Title

15

IX?

16

MR. ROTHFELD:

The -- the Court did not.

I

17

mean there, the -- the Court looked at what it took to

18

be the general -- the manifest congressional intent when

19

-- when it enacted Title IX.

20

specifically rely on -- on that legislation.

21

legislation, of course, goes to whether or not Section

22

1983 suits were available, not whether there is a Title

23

IX implied right of action available.

24
25

But it did not
The

And, as I say, in that -- in that
legislative language Congress made expressly clear that

Your Honor, to the extent that the claims are identical

MR. ROTHFELD:

And I -- I assure you I will

3

The -- the complaint, we think, should be

4

taken also to be generally in response to complaints of

5

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
that out practically.

9

Spell that out -- spell

I know you used -

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think -- for example,

10

Your Honor, we think that one thing that -- that could

11

be developed and explored further is disparate treatment

12

of complaints; for example, the treatment of

13

complaints of bullying by boys more favorably perhaps

14

than by girls, believing testimony of boys rather than

15

believing testimony of girls.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

But there was no

allegation at all of that kind in this complaint.

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

I -- I -- I agree that that

19

was not set out specifically in the complaint.

different but related theory?

What would you write in that request?

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

What words would you use?

Well, there are a number of

19

points I should make in response to that, Your Honor.

20

think one is, just as a general matter, we think that

21

that's something -- this entire set of questions are

22

things that are better resolved by the courts of

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason I ask is

2

obviously if this case happens to be a case in which,

3

because of the finding that there was no intentional

4

discrimination and the school board behaved properly,

5

that if that's the finding and therefore you have no

6

claim under 1983 in respect to that, it becomes very

7

theoretical to say that they went too far and said you

8

might have no other 1983 claim because you would have

9

some other 1983 claim, but we should dismiss this as

10

improvidently granted and wait until somebody does this

11

again.

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, certainly -- I -

13

certainly, I understand that suggestion, Justice Breyer.

complaints another way?

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

That -- that would be one way

in which -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And as far as this record

5

shows, there has just been this one incident of

6

harassment.

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

Again, Your Honor, I think

8

one of the problems is that this case sort of went off

9

the tracks at the earliest possible stage, at the -- at

10

the time this motion for dismissal was granted.

11

could have developed in quite a different way.

12

And it

For example, discovery was requested on

13

these subjects that I -- that I mentioned to Justice

14

Breyer, which -- which could have been used to develop

15

that, in fact, requests by boys were treated more

16

favorably than requests by girls; complaints by boys

17

were responded to more -- more favor -

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

You do not have it in front

But I can tell you that the request was made,

6

the Respondents declined to respond it to it for, among

7

other reasons, the -- their assertion that it would not

8

lead to the discovery of relevant evidence or admissible

9

evidence.

After the 1983 conclusion ruling, and because

10

of the conclusion ruling, that was not followed up

11

because it would have been futile to try to develop

12

additional argumentation in that -- in that direction.

13

Had the case not hopped the track at this

14

point, if the complaint could have amended -- could have

15

been amended, additional individual defendants could

16

have been added, the case could have gone on in quite a

17

different direction.

were warned about all these problems in the brief in

opposition, weren't we?

MR. ROTHFELD:

That is correct.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Didn't that focus almost

23

entirely upon the fact that there is no 1983 cause of

action anyway?

And we nonetheless

granted -- granted cert?

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

Precisely the same arguments

4

that were made in almost identical language in the brief

5

in opposition are now being made as an argument as to

6

why this Court should decide the merits of the 1983

7

claim or dismiss as improvidently granted.

8
9

The Court -- I don't presume to tell the
Court what it was thinking when it granted review of the

10

case, but it did presumably reject those arguments at

11

that point, and there is no reason that they are any

12

additional basis now.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What I understand, Mr.

14

Rothfeld, that if you win on the question presented, you

15

would agree that the -- the arguments the other side

16

makes on this, on whether there's a cause of action

17

under equal protection and so forth, that would remain

18

open on remand?

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

Absolutely.
And you may still lose the

lawsuit even if you win here?

22

MR. ROTHFELD:

That is -- that is absolutely

23

correct.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Those

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

courts cut it short and threw the case out on conclusion

2

grounds.

3

And I -- I think the way in which the court

4

of appeals decided the case actually suggests that it

5

was of the view that there was more to the case than

6

simply the Title IX claims that had been rejected,

7

because one would have thought that if the court of

8

appeals was of the view that there is nothing to the

9

case beyond the Title IX peer-on-peer harassment claim

10

that has been reject, it would have ended its discussion

11

at that point.

12

It would have said:

those claims are precluded as a matter of per se Title

IX law, that Title IX is preclusive.

one would think that the court of appeals had it in mind

says, in so many words, that Title IX is the exclusive

avenue for the assertion of claims of gender

I think that that is the

scheme was pre-emptive?

They were relying on one case

22

in which the Court said that, in Smith v. Robinson, the

23

only time in 140 years that Section 1983 has been on the

24

books that this Court has ever said that Congress meant

25

to preclude its use to enforce a particular
18
Alderson Reporting Company

1

constitutional right.

2

And I think -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It did that because if

3

you could use 1983, then the very elaborate mechanism

4

that Congress had set up, who would use it?

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's -- that's absolutely

right.

7

point.

15

But that, as I said, is a parenthetical

I -- I think that something that we have

16

here which was not present in Smith at all -- and as you

17

said, Justice Ginsburg, it is absolutely right that

18

there was a much more elaborate, involved administrative

19

remedial scheme in the statute considered there, there

20

is nothing remotely like that in Title IX.

21

you could even get to that point, there is this

22

expressed evidence in the statutory text of Title IX

23

that Congress did not mean to preclude.

24

1983.

25

But before

This is Section

First there is the provision that I
19
Alderson Reporting Company

mentioned regarding the attorney general, which -- which

2

expressly contemplates there will be continued Section

3

1983 constitutional gender discrimination after the

4

enactment of Title IX.

5

was positive and tells the Court all it needs to know.

6

I think that in and of itself

But beyond -- there is -- there is more.

7

Beyond that, there is the language of the

8

antidiscrimination provisions of Title IX, which was

9

borrowed directly, is identical to the language of Title

10

VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

11

the phrase "race, color and national origin" that

12

appears in Title VI and substituted "sex" in Title IX.

13

Congress dropped

And, so, the Court has recognized that

14

Congress expected and intended that Title IX would be

interpreted just as -- as had been Title VI.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Have there been any

decisions on Title VI and 1983?

myriad of such decisions.

21

amicus brief supporting us, the American Civil Liberties

22

Union cites in its brief, there have been almost two

23

dozen cases decided before the enactment of Title IX in

which courts allowed the simultaneous assertion of

statutory discrimination claims under Title VI and

There had been, as we cite in

5

knew that that language had been uniformly, widely

6

construed across the country to allow the simultaneous

7

assertion of those claims, not the preclusion of Section

8

1983 claims for discrimination.

9

And so, at the

And so it's when Congress -- when

10

legislative language has been the subject of judicial

11

construction, as the Court has said many times, and

12

Congress repeats that language in a new statute, its

13

expectation and intention is that the judicial

14

construction is going to be taken as well.

15

And so that I think that is also dispositive

16

of the question in this case, because the Congress chose

17

language that it necessarily knew had been understood

18

not to preclude the use of Section 1983.

19

And I will mention as well, just to throw in

20

the suspenders along with the belt, an additional

21

consideration that the court of appeals ignored here was

22

the manifest legislative purpose of section -- of Title

23

IX, which was to expand and strengthen protections

24

against discrimination in schools.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, of course,

Official - Subject to Final Review

Title IX is Spending Clause legislation, and that, under

2

our precedents, imposes certain limitations on how we

3

interpret it that would not be applicable under Section

4

5

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

Absolutely correct.

And I

think that there are CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the point is

8

that that would then allow 1983 actions to circumvent

9

those limitations on the Title IX remedy.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I -- I think not, for a

11

couple of reasons, Your Honor.

12

is this direct evidence of what Congress had in mind.

13

It specifically referred to constitutional litigation

14

under the Fourteenth Amendment when it enacted Title IX,

15

and, therefore, by definition it could not have been

16

concerned about evasion in that sense.

17

their -- "evasion" is not the word to use here because,

18

on the one hand, there are statutory rights created by

19

Title IX; on the other, there are pre-existing

20

constitutional rights.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

First, as I say, there

But I think that

And those constitutional

22

rights have negated -- I think it might be -- it's at

23

least arguable that it would be harder to win a 1983

24

case, given that, as to the individual, you have

25

qualified immunity, and, as to the institution, you have
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to show a custom or practice.

2

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, the only availability

3

for individual liability is under the Constitution,

4

because Title IX, at least as construed by the lower

5

courts, does not permit suits directly against the

6

individual, only against the institution, which I think

7

is a significant distinction between the two and

8

supports the argument that Congress could not have

9

intended to preclude because, as the Court has

10

recognized repeatedly, the availability of individual

11

liability greatly adds to the deterrence, the effect of

12

deterring constitutional violations.

13

And the suggestion that, when Congress

14

enacted Title IX it would have -- meant to have the

15

perverse effect of allowing a school, by accepting

16

federal funds, to insulate school policymakers from any

17

personal statutory liability, you know, for even the

18

most blatant and obvious acts of unconstitutional sex

19

discrimination, would turn Title IX on its head.

20

inconceivable that Congress could have had that in mind

21

when it enacted a statute that was clearly designed to

22

expand and strength protections against sex

23

discrimination.

24
25

It's

I'll make sort of two additional points,
Your Honor.

As I suggest, I think the direct evidence
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the statutory text, as well as the legislative

2

purpose, is dispositive here and the Court need not go

3

beyond that to answer the question here.

4

the question of how the court of appeals got the matter

5

so far wrong.

6

is, ignoring the text, they applied what they thought to

7

be a presumption derived from this Court's decision in

8

cases like Smith v. Robinson and the Palos Verdes case

9

that the creation of a new statutory right and a new

11

intent to preclude the use of Section 1983 to enforce

13

been such a presumption.

14

There has never

The Court has said repeatedly, I think, as

15

was suggested earlier in the discussion, that when

16

Congress creates new statutory rights and new statutory

17

remedies, they are presumed to overlap with and to

18

supplement existing statutory rights and remedies,

19

unless the two are positively repugnant to one another,

20

unless they are inconsistent and can't be reconciled.

12

involved a new statutory right, a new statutory action

13

to enforce that right.

14

in significant respects, and the Court concluded, as a

15

matter of common sense, that one could infer from that

16

situation Congress intended that the new right with the

17

new remedial system would be exclusive, otherwise

18

plaintiffs could immediately go to court and render that

system a dead letter.

here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what would the

standard be under 1983?

8
9

We are

MS. HODGE:

The standard under 1983 is also

deliberate indifference, but it requires then that the

10

deliberate indifference be shown to be not just the act

11

of a school administrator who does not do what they

12

should do in order to pursue a particular complaint;

13

but, rather, there needs to be the specific intent to

14

discriminate or -- or specific intent to choose boys

over girls or girls over boys in that decisionmaking

process.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but if you lose under

MS. HODGE:

I -- I believe -- and that is,

21

in essence, the position that the Barnstable School

If they had done that, it would be

I believe, Your Honor, that we

have a situation in which you have both claim

12

preclusion -- both preclusion under Smith v. Robinson as

13

well as issue preclusion, which makes it somewhat

14

complicated.

15

these circumstances, because the issue was deliberate

16

indifference and because there was a finding both as a

17

legal matter as well as a factual matter of deliberate

18

indifference, that essentially the two sort of collapsed

19

into one.

But I would suggest in this case under

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you must, I

quite different from what this Court did.

Are you saying that it is impossible for

anyone to imagine a circumstance in which it would be

which the court held it did violate the Equal Protection

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. HODGE:

I believe that that is true.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. HODGE:

That's simple.

And I would point out that in

4

response to the Petitioners' argument today, they have

5

attempted to suggest that there may be some issues that

6

were not discovered; that were not, in fact, fully

7

reviewed by the court below.

8
9

And I suggest that the First Circuit did, in
fact, look at specifically that issue.

And the First

10

Circuit said in their decision that, in looking at the

11

equal protection claim in particular, that the

12

petitioners offer -- or in that case, they offer, the

13

plaintiffs offer -- no theory of liability under the

14

equal protection clause other than the defendants'

15

supposed failure to take adequate actions to prevent

16

and/or remediate the peer-on-peer harassment that

17

Jacqueline experienced.

18

And I suggest to you that that is exactly

19

the issue that -- that that is exactly the issue.

The

20

issue is whether or not, if you look at the complaint,

21

the claim that is being brought under Title IX and the

And I would suggest to you

And I would suggest that that is what leads

Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't

7

other claims that could be made with regard to others.

8

But for the institution, it -- I -- the -- it is very

9

important.

Congress established this particular scheme

10

under Section 19 -- under Title IX, and it would be our

11

view that Congress specifically and intentionally

12

focused -- fixed the responsibility for sex

13

discrimination on the institution and on the

14

institutional recipient of Federal financial assistance.

15

And that if you were to allow Section 1983

16

claims, that enforcement would not be nearly as

17

equitable.

18

is important to consider that recipients of Federal

19

financial assistance include not only municipalities

20

that include public schools; they include State entities

21

which under this Court's decision -- under this Court's

22

prior decision in Wills versus Michigan are not subject

23

to suit under Section 1983 and private entities that are

24

not subject to 1983 at all.

factual conclusion which would go to the general

discrimination issue.

6

we are making to this Court includes the fact that since

7

Title IX is as broad, if not broader, and I would

8

suggest the following through a visual picture.

9

The position that -- the argument

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is -- you are

10

leaving out something quite glaring in that respect.

11

For example, single sex schools, military academies,

12

admissions to elementary and high schools, are not

13

covered by Title IX.

14

MS. HODGE:

Oh, you are absolutely correct,

15

Your Honor, and under those circumstances, we would

16

suggest that as this Court found in Mississippi v Hogan,

17

that those institutions would then be subject to section

18

1983 review, but on the highly constitutional standard

19

which requires intentional discrimination; and second of

20

all, we believe that that is -- that Mississippi is an

21

illustration of the reason why the argument of

22

Petitioner regarding 2000h of Title IX, which deals with

23

the fact that -- that when they passed Title IX, they

24

also reserve the opportunity for the Attorney General to

25

become involved in a case under 1983, that the intention
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of that language was not necessarily to preserve 1983 in

2

cases against recipients who are in fact covered, but it

3

would have been to reserve the right of the Attorney

4

General to -- to intervene in cases in which either the

5

institution was not covered -- because you are

6

absolutely right, there are institutions which are not

7

covered -- and as you decided in Mississippi v Hogan,

8

they would be subject to section 1983; and/or

9

individuals that the First Circuit recognized might,

10

because they -- if they are -- if they are State actors,

11

that is not the case you have here, which was

12

peer-on-peer harassment -- but if you is had a situation

13

where for example, a teacher or an administrator was in

14

fact the alleged harasser, that a 1983 could be brought

15

against the individual, and indeed the Attorney General

could intervene in those cases.

that if you look at the First Circuit opinion, it sort

you can have a 1983 suit, but if there is no difference,

you can't."

that, I guess.

So I'm not certain what to do, because Selya

8

started his opinion by saying this isn't a case where

9

Title IX doesn't apply; it does apply; they have the

10

funding; but he doesn't talk about the exemptions and he

11

doesn't really talk about the -- a difference between

12

suing an institution and suing an individual.

13

what we should say is, maybe he meant it, but he didn't

14

say it.

15

MS. HODGE:

So maybe

Well, I would argue -- I would

16

argue to the Court that I would hope that this Court

17

would take -- would affirm the First Circuit opinion,

18

but I would say to -- to -- to Your Honor the following:

19

that with regard to the individual defendant in this

20

case, who is the superintendent of schools, who as we

21

argue, the question presented only deals with the

22

institutional recipient; but nevertheless the First

23

Circuit found that the individual was acting only in

24

their official capacity.

25

And once again, that -- that issue is not
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

before this Court.

2

acting in the individual's official capacity, we would

3

argue therefore that the individual would not be sued,

4

because the claim and all of the facts -

5

And having decided that they were

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you were saying if it's

6

an individual acting in his official capacity, you

7

cannot sue him under Title IX?

8

MS. HODGE:

To the -- yes.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MS. HODGE:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Okay.

Yes.
Then their answer to that

12

which is now say, look, we want to sue an individual in

13

his official capacity; that's why we want to bring our

14

1983 suit.

15

of collateral estoppel.

16

is.

And then you reply, but there are bars here
Claim preclusion, whatever it

(Laughter.)

MS. HODGE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23

Issue preclusion.
They all have new names.

Okay.
The -- the -- okay, so

that's your argument.
So why don't we just send it back, say

24

that's right; this suit is not precluded by 1983;

25

indeed, that's the only place can you bring it; it's not
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

precluded by Title IX, and now court, you go decide

2

whether claim preclusion exists, or whatever they call

3

it.

4

mean.

Collateral estoppel, or -- you understand what I

5

MS. HODGE:

Your Honor, I believe that they

6

did decide that in the language I did quote to you just

7

a moment ago from the First Circuit opinion, which is

8

found at the appendix 23a or the decision.

9

they are -- they are saying that -- that there was -

Essentially

10

that because no theory of liability was offered other

11

than this, that there isn't any further claim available.

12

With regard to sending this case back, we

13

argue, based upon the deliberative difference standard,

14

which I think is indisputably -- the standard falls

15

under Title IX, and the standard under the Equal

16

Protection Clause -- that that deliberative difference

17

standard and -- and the fact the First Circuit found

18

that -- that there was -- that the Barnstable School

19

Committee acted reasonably and without deliberative

20

difference, precludes -- there is no issue in

21

controversy anymore.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yet the other side says

23

that there may be, and I don't know why we ought to get

24

into that.

25

figure that out?

Why can't we just send it back and let them
And -- and -- and decide what we took
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this case to decide, namely, the split that now exists

2

in the Federal courts over whether Title IX precludes

3

the use of 1983.

4

why we took the case.

5

and then for all these loose ends, send it back to the

6

court of appeals?

7

That is an important question.

MS. HODGE:

It's

Why can't we decide that issue

Because there must be an issue

8

in controversy for this Court to send any -- there must

9

be an issue in controversy here and also -

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He says there is an issue

in controversy, that's good enough for me.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MS. HODGE:

Well -- well, with all due

14

respect, I would suggest that what you have to look at

15

is the complaint, and you have to look at the argument,

16

you know, what was in fact argued.

17

suggest -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I would

So -- I'm sorry, so

19

you seem to be saying that they were right, that 1983

20

actions are not always precluded, depending on whether

21

there is a difference in the issues that are presented

22

or whatever.

23

So you should never say that Title IX

24

precludes an action under 1983.

In fact, you should say

25

that sometimes the issues that are litigated under Title
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

IX may result in the fact that you don't have

2

available -- you don't get relief under 1983, but there

3

is still a cause of action.

4

MS. HODGE:

I don't -- I don't believe that

5

that is -- that that -- that that should -- that should

6

be the result of your decisionmaking.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's kind of odd to

8

say that -- as I understand what you are saying, you are

9

saying that whenever there is issue preclusion, the

10

consequence is that 1983 is precluded in the sense that

11

actions were precluded in Smith.

12

I've gotten -- maybe I am repeating the question.

13

do we have to decide that, and we would just say there

14

is a 1983 action, but you may not be able to pursue it,

15

I guess is the way to put it, if your claims are

16

precluded or the issues result in the fact that you

17

don't recover.

18

MS. HODGE:

Well why -- I guess

I -- I believe that that would

19

be satisfactory.

20

believe the issue preclusion applies that would be

21

satisfactory because we -

22

Why

From our point of view because we

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- but that doesn't

23

cover the situation in which a plaintiff says, I don't

24

want to proceed under Title IX; I want to proceed first

25

under 1983.

Then there is going to be no question about
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether 1983 is -- is unavailable because of issue

2

preclusion.

3
4

MS. HODGE:

There is no question, but in

those circumstances then as to an institution -

5
6

He is starting with 1983.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is your position on

that -

7

MS. HODGE:

Our position is that as a

8

recipient of Federal -- if the institution involved is a

9

recipient of Federal financial assistance who is covered

10

by Title IX -

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You can't proceed under

1983.

13

MS. HODGE:

Cannot proceed under 1983.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MS. HODGE:

So you are disagreeing.

Yes, we are.

Yes, we are

16

disagreeing, and I would suggest that the difficulty

17

that this Court is having, or at least as I experience

18

it, the difficulty with regard to issue preclusion and

19

claim preclusion turns in this case on the fact that

20

this perhaps being a peer-on-peer harassment case -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't it quite clear we

22

can forget about issue preclusion and assume as

23

Justice Scalia did, the client brought an action under

24

1983 and did not rely on Title IX at all, and just sued

25

the school board, you would say he can't do that?
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. HODGE:

Correct.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Correct.

And that's your issue,

3

whether that's right or wrong.

4

about issue -- issue preclusion to decide that issue.

5

MS. HODGE:

We don't have to talk

That is correct, except that as

6

we argue -- what we have argued before the Court is that

7

under Smith the question is, is there a comprehensive

8

remedial scheme, and we would argue that there is; but

9

then have you to determine whether the claims are

10

virtually identical; and we would argue that here the

11

claims are virtually identical.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wouldn't your reasoning

13

apply to, say, a race discrimination case in employment?

14

We have got title VII and you have 1981.

15

a lot of accoutrements, a lot of text to go through;

16

1981 is plain and simple.

17

to preempt 1981, right?

18

discrimination and employment, title VII would end any

19

access to 1981.

20

wouldn't it?

21

Title VII has

So therefore, title VII ought
So you -- in the area of race

It would be the same kind of argument,

MS. HODGE:

I believe that -- that there is

22

that argument, but to be honest, I'm not in a position

23

right now to reflect on exactly -- I believe that that

24

would be certainly the direction, however, there are

25

unique aspects of race.

And I believe that that is yet
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

another basis on which I would quarrel with the

2

Petitioner with regard to suggesting that Title VI

3

and -- and Title IX ought to be treated exactly the

4

same.

5

discrimination are quite different in scope.

6

The history of sex discrimination versus race

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What does that have to

7

got to do with what you are arguing is that if you have

8

an elaborate mechanism, which you said you have under

9

Title IX, I think that is debatable?

But that was

10

certainly the picture in Smith, and it's the picture in

11

Title VII, Title VII versus 1981.

12

your -- the -- your description, Title VII and 1981,

13

much better than Title IX and 1983, I think.

14

MS. HODGE:

That -- that fits

I guess I -- I don't agree.

It

15

is our -- it is our view that 19 -- that in this

16

particular instance -- and I -- and I think I may have

17

misspoken if the view is, is that it's the

18

administrative schemes that get compared.

19

believe under Smith, the issue is whether or not there

20

is a comprehensive remedial scheme, and here you have

21

the remedy -- both an administrative remedy as well as a

22

private right of action, which we would argue should

23

preclude the 1983 claims.

24
25

I -- I

Moreover, we would also look with regard to
the fact that this is a constitutional claim to the 46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to Bivens -- to the line of cases under Bivens which we

2

cite in our brief, the fact that when Congress provides

3

a remedy for a particular area -- in a particular area,

4

that that remedy can preclude an independent action

5

which even is based on the Constitution.

6

suggest that that would be -- that that is something

7

that we would urge this Court to consider -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And we would

Well, that's because

we're still in the business of implying rights of action

10

under Bivens.

11

you say we are applying it, but as soon as Congress does

12

something, we are not going to do that.

13

different than construing a provision like 1983 which

14

Congress has enacted.

15

And it's different to say -- you know, if

MS. HODGE:

That's quite

Well, that is correct, except

16

that this Court has, in fact, applied its preclusion

17

doctrine by looking at whether or not Congress has made

18

any statement in the statute, then if you want to take

19

it statute to statute, then what you would be looking at

20

is you would be looking at essentially Rancho Palos

21

Verdes.

22

decided Rancho Palos Verdes, it remanded for

23

consideration communities of equity, which is a Title IX

24

case for reconsideration by, I believe it's the Eighth

25

Circuit under the Rancho Palos Verdes decision.

And as -- as this Court did in -- when it

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And while that case ultimately did not come

2

back to this Court, but the circuit court determined

3

that it treated -- it treated the issue differently, and

4

we would argue that that is a part of this split, and

5

that that is -- and that is not the appropriate

6

resolution.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was no

constitutional claim in -- what was it -- Palos Verdes.
MS. HODGE:

Exactly.

There was no

constitutional claim in Rancho Palos Verdes.

11

this Court did cite Smith and did cite Smith in its

12

decision and -- and favorably so.

13

would argue that -- the question is really a different

14

-- comparing a statute to statute, which is Title IX to

15

section 1983.

Congress allows for actions under Title IX, or whether

17

or not you are looking at the issue of Title IX versus a

constitutional claim.

However,

also seeking to have equity of enforcement.

Further, as set for in the amici in support

of the Respondents' position, we would point out that if

2

federal financial assistance on a variety of issues that

3

are totally unnecessary including qualified immunity.

4

And on the peer-on-peer harassment case, I

5

think it's very important to focus on what this case is.

6

It is a peer-on-peer, student-on-student harassment

7

where, what you would have is, if you were going to

8

allow additional claims under section 1983 against the

9

institution, it would -- it would intrude and interfere

10

with the school's processes of disciplining students.

12

And I would also suggest that it might also
interfere in the classic manner in which -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you one sort of

14

anomaly that keeps running through my mind in this case.

15

If you have two school boards, one of -- two schools,

16

state schools, one gets federal funds and the other does

17

not, does this preclude -- no 1983 remedy against one,

18

but there is a 1983 remedy against the other, that's

19

your view, isn't it?

20

MS. HODGE:

It is exactly our view because

21

the recipients would be subject to the remedial scheme

22

set forth in Title IX.

23
24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is it anomalous to think

it MS. HODGE:

I don't think anomalous.
49

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

believe the reverse is anomalous, because what you would

2

be suggesting if you do not preclude section 1983, you

3

would suggest that the recipient could have both the

4

1983 and a Title IX, whereas the nonrecipient would have

5

just section 1983.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would it prove the same

7

facts in both cases?

8

involve the same evidence, same alleged wrongdoing, and

9

then one case you can rely on 1983 and the other you

10
11

I mean, the case of it would

can't?
MS. HODGE:

I believe under those

12

circumstances, Justice Stevens, that what we would be

13

talking about would be the situation where a -- under

14

Title IX there is -- there's actually an easier path to

15

recovery, if you will, because it does not require the

16

specific intent required by Massachusetts v. Feeney,

17

which we believe sets a slightly higher -- a bar and a

18

higher level of intentionality.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought you just said

20

that a deliberate indifference under both statutes,

21

under 1983 and Title IX.

22

MS. HODGE:

Your Honor, it is -- deliberate

23

indifference is the standard.

However, in order to

24

prove a constitutional violation, you must also have the

25

specific intent for invidious discrimination that we 50

Official - Subject to Final Review

that this Court has not imposed and did not impose in

2

Davis for violations of peer -- for peer-on-peer

3

harassment cases.

4

So, while the discrimination needs to be

5

intentional under Title IX, it is not required that

there be the specific intent to favor one over the other

7

or one protected status over the other.

But you -- excuse me, I'm sorry.

11

You would have gender discrimination if you have a

responds.

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I

will try not to use my extra ten seconds.
Two principal points.

First on the proper

22

disposition of this case.

The First Circuit's holding,

23

and I'm reading from 24a of the petition appendix:

24

comprehensiveness of Title IX's remedial scheme

25

indicates Congress saw Title IX solely as vindicating
52
Alderson Reporting Company

the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the constitutional right to be free from gender

2

discrimination perpetrated by educational institutions;

3

it follows that the plaintiff's equal protection claims

4

are precluded.

5

That was not a holding that had to do with

6

claim preclusion, issue preclusion, title estoppel; it's

7

a holding that constitutional claims simply cannot go

8

forward.

9

advanced below, argued to both courts, that have not

So there were constitutional claims were

10

been discussed by any court at any point, and I think

11

the proper disposition here is, the most regular course

12

in a case of this sort to is decide the question

13

presented, send the case back.

14

It certainly is not the case -- it's a

15

commonplace that the Court has threshold questions that

16

are presented to it.

17

have to be resolved on remand, it's certainly not the

18

plaintiffs can -- can prevail on those claims on remand

before deciding the threshold question on which cert was

granted.

23

There are remaining issues that

I think that's the appropriate approach for

On the merits, very quickly.

Again I think

24

we have to -- the gold standard of evidence as to

25

preclusion, we have expressed statutory text that deals

General can intervene.

That is not

The provision says

Clearly Congress had it in mind

10

that there would be such claims, and this was enacted as

part of -- Title IX was enacted as part of the statute

receiving Federal funds.

then it -- then it has validity whether or not you agree

20

with your position.

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's true but I think it

22

answers the preclusion question that it suggests that

Congress has it in mind that there would in fact be

discrimination.
