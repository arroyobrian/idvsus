            General Schmidt.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK L. SCHMIDT

8

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court:

11

            These sentences do not offend the Eighth

12

Amendment.  Each of these jurors was able to give

13

meaningful effect to anything and everything they heard

14

and presented in mitigation.  The verdicts reflect the

15

reasoned moral response of these jurors to the

16

aggravated brutality of these crimes, the weak claims

17

for mitigation, and the individual assessment of each

18

Respondent's moral culpability.

19

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Do you agree  do you

20

agree, whatever the Eighth Amendment does not require,

21

that it would be better practice for the trial judge to

22

tell the jury what the burden is on mitigators, just to

23

ward off any possibility of confusion?

24

            MR. SCHMIDT:  And, in fact, Justice

25

Ginsburg, that now happens in Kansas.  Subsequent to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

this case, the State made a decision to alter its

2

pattern instructions, but that'd not required by the

3

Eighth Amendment.  In fact, the Kansas 

4

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So why can't we presume

5

it's required by the State law, not the Constitution?  I

6

mean, as I'm reading the decision below, the court is

7

saying that the principles of the Eighth Amendment give

8

voice to or support for the use of this burden and

9

Kansas is commanding it.

10

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, I think not, Your Honor.

11

This decision  these decisions were plainly based on

12

the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation not of State

13

law, but of the Eighth Amendment.  And I  I would

14

point out a couple of reasons I believe that conclusion

15

is inescapable.

16

            First, the court's conclusion, which is

17

indicated at page 103 in our application, the summary of

18

what it did, the court indicated very plainly that it

19

was talking about mitigating evidence as required by the

20

Eighth Amendment with no reference to State law or State

21

practice whatsoever.

22

            Second, this argument has been presented

23

previously when Kansas has been before this Court.  This

24

Court rejected a similar argument in Kansas v. Marsh; it

25

rejected a similar argument in Kansas v. Cheever two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

terms ago.  It presumably rejected or at least not

2

embraced the similar argument made at the cert stage in

3

these cases.

4

            And in fact, in the Kansas v. Marsh case 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Did the Kansas Supreme

6

Court read these cases?

7

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Perhaps I ought not answer

8

that, Justice Scalia, but 

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  How can you explain it

10

if  if indeed our prior cases are so clear on the

11

point?

12

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Scalia, I, of course,

13

don't 

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  They don't like the death

15

penalty.

16

            MR. SCHMIDT:   know how to answer that

17

question.  I can only say that this decision  these

18

decisions clearly are based on that court's

19

interpretation of the Eighth Amendment.

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But that can't be.

21

Already we know and the Kansas court knew the dissent

22

pointed out that a burden for mitigating circumstances

23

of a preponderance of the evidence is okay, so they

24

can't believe that no burden is required by the

25

Constitution.  They know that there is no requirement

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

because the cases mentioned by you and Justice Scalia

2

say that.  So it has to be their view of State law.

3

            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, Your Honor, I believe it's

4

error, and that's why we're in front of this Court.  And

5

if there's any question about that 

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I  I suppose the issue is

7

not what they believe, but what they said.

8

            MR. SCHMIDT:  They did in fact 

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I mean, we  we  we

10

don't psychoanalyze the lower courts; we  we look at

11

what they said.  And if they said that it's the Eighth

12

Amendment, it's the Eighth Amendment.

13

            MR. SCHMIDT:  In the 10 pages of the

14

majority opinion on this subject in the Gleason case,

15

Your Honor, there are 8 references to the Eighth

16

Amendment; in the dissent slightly fewer pages in total,

17

but 18 references to the Eighth Amendment.  And in the

18

Gleason decision, it's in our reply at page 8, the

19

Kansas Supreme Court rejected the notion that the

20

subject matter at issue here wasn't required by the

21

Eighth Amendment, instead, wrote both recommended

22

statements from the prior case, the one at issue.

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If you prevail here on

24

your position, is it necessary for us to remand to the

25

Kansas Supreme Court to determine  for them to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

determine whether State law would require a different

2

result on this issue?  I know there are some other

3

issues in the case, but on this issue or 

4

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Not on this issue, Your Honor.

5

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:   or are we permitted

6

simply to reverse outright?

7

            MR. SCHMIDT:  I believe you're permitted to

8

reverse outright.

9

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Certainly remand on some

10

on other issues, I understand.

11

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Correct.  We presume there

12

would be further proceedings below on other issues that

13

weren't decided in the case.

14

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why couldn't  why

15

couldn't the Kansas Supreme Court say on remand, thank

16

you for enlightening us about the Eighth Amendment, but

17

we still think that Kansas law, independent of any

18

Federal constitutional requirement, requires juries to

19

be told what the burden is?  They could do that on

20

remand.

21

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Ginsburg, that would,

22

of course, be an issue that we would argue on remand if

23

it were briefed.  That's not what they did here.  And,

24

in fact, if this Court does not correct the Eighth

25

Amendment error, I would respectfully submit we'll never

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

get to that question on remand because the Eighth

2

Amendment, that court's interpretation of it, will

3

dispose of this case.

4

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about the other?

5

Didn't they say something about inadmissible hearsay

6

having prejudice  cause prejudice in the Carr case?

7

            MR. SCHMIDT:  In the Carr case, there was an

8

issue with respect to that, Justice Ginsburg.  It is not

9

part of the questions that were presented or being

10

argued in front of this Court.  It was, as you know, a

11

voluminous record with many, many issues discussed.

12

            The Kansas Supreme Court's decision below

13

should be reversed by this Court because it made two

14

errors.  First, the Kansas Supreme Court incorrectly

15

found in the Eighth Amendment what the dissent called a

16

per se requirement.  They found that there was a

17

requirement in the Eighth Amendment for an affirmative

18

instruction that mitigation need not be proven beyond a

19

reasonable doubt.

20

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Is there  to go back to

21

the question that Justice Ginsburg has asked, as we say,

22

this Court has never held that there is an absolute

23

requirement that you give the reasonable doubt  don't

24

say it's no reasonable doubt in a mitigating case, just

25

what you said.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Correct.

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  We send it back because, as

3

you said, they just  if the law in the State is

4

different, they've changed it.  When they changed it,

5

did they apply the change retroactively?

6

            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, Your Honor.

7

            And, in fact, if this Court 

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What did they say?

9

            MR. SCHMIDT:  The pattern instructions in

10

Kansas that would be applicable in a circumstance like

11

this on this subject have been changed prospectively.

12

And we now use them.

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But that court's held it's

14

only prospective?

15

            MR. SCHMIDT:  I don't believe that's been 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  how can you

17

retroactively give an instruction?  Right?

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, you very simply say,

19

yes, have a new trial, that's how.  I mean, you simply

20

set a new sentencing hearing 

21

            MR. SCHMIDT:  But, Your Honor, of course,

22

there would be no need for a new trial if this Court

23

will correct the Eighth Amendment error, which is what

24

we're trying for 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  There would be a need if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

Kansas law, as is now revealed by their pattern

2

instructions, suggests that you do have to give the

3

instruction that's required, that the  that the

4

defendant wants, and you'd have to have a new sentencing

5

proceeding, wouldn't you?

6

            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, Your Honor, not 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?

8

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Not unless that instruction

9

were to apply retroactively in the case 

10

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes 

11

            MR. SCHMIDT:   and that question, of

12

course, is not presented.

13

            In fact, there are currently 9 persons under

14

sentence of death in Kansas and this issue, this Eighth

15

Amendment issue, as our court has expressed it, is

16

present in 6 of them.  So twothirds of the death

17

penalty cases in our State are negatively affected in

18

the event this Court were to decline to correct the

19

Eighth Amendment error and allow the Kansas court to

20

continue to misapply the Eighth Amendment in the manner

21

that it's done.

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  How  how was the change to

23

the pattern instructions made?  Who made it?

24

            MR. SCHMIDT:  There's a pattern instruction

25

committee, Your Honor, that develops these pattern

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

instructions.

2

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is it approved by the

3

Supreme Court or is it divorced from the Supreme Court?

4

            MR. SCHMIDT:  I believe that's correct, but

5

I  I don't want to swear to that, Your Honor.

6

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You believe it's correct,

7

that it is approved by the Court.

8

            MR. SCHMIDT:  I want to doublecheck on that

9

point, Your Honor.

10

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Okay.

11

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  My thinking is the

13

following, so you'll understand why I ask this question.

14

It, I think, could be the case that you're right, that

15

this Court has never held that the Eighth Amendment

16

requires giving such an instruction.

17

            Next question:  Should it now hold it?

18

Well, the answer to that question could be this is not a

19

good case to decide that.  Because it may be that the

20

Kansas court has held it as to the future and may apply

21

the future rule as to the 9 people who are involved in

22

the past.  Therefore, send it back.

23

            What do you think of that reasoning?

24

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Well 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Probably not much, but I'd

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

like to know your reasons.

2

            (Laughter.)

3

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Respectfully, I  I share

4

your conclusion on that point, Justice Breyer.

5

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Isn't it true, General

6

Schmidt, that it makes a big difference whether this is

7

done under the Federal Constitution or under Kansas law?

8

And presumably, the Kansas Supreme Court understood that

9

it had the capability of basing its decision on Kansas

10

law.  But if  if it did that, it would have to take

11

responsibility for the decisions in these cases, which

12

involve some of the most horrendous murders that I have

13

seen in my 10 years here.  And we see practically every

14

death penalty case that comes up anywhere in the

15

country.   These have to rank as among the worst.  So it

16

didn't take responsibility for that.  It said it's the

17

Eighth Amendment, and we have to apply the Federal

18

Constitution.

19

            Now, it may be they will say, well, we're

20

going to say that Kansas law requires this, but then

21

it's their responsibility; isn't that true?

22

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Alito, I, of course,

23

won't speculate on what the Kansas court was  might

24

do. I 

25

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I wasn't speculating

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

on why they did what they did, but the consequences of

2

basing it on the Federal Constitution.  One of the

3

consequences of basing it on the Federal Constitution is

4

that they don't have to take responsibility for it.

5

            MR. SCHMIDT:  I have no ability to dispute

6

that 

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do  do you have retention

8

elections in Kansas?

9

            MR. SCHMIDT:  We do, Your Honor.

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yes.  And the fact 

11

how  how many people are there on death row in Kansas?

12

            MR. SCHMIDT:  There are currently 9 under

13

sentence, with a tenth 

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which would suggest that 

15

that Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think

16

the death penalty is unconstitutional and indeed very

17

much favor it, which might suggest that a retention

18

election that goes before such people would not come out

19

favorably for those justices who create Kansas law

20

that  that would reverse these convictions.

21

            I'm just speculating, of course.

22

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Scalia, all I can say

23

is that in these cases, it's certainly apparent to us,

24

and I think to any fair reading, that the Kansas court

25

relied on the Federal Eighth Amendment in making these

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

decisions, and absent correction of those occurred by

2

this Court will continue to do so.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What is this Court

4

supposed to do when it's told its own lower courts three

5

times before this case, or two, you must give this

6

instruction?  What  what  what's the Court supposed

7

to do?

8

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Are you asking about what the

9

Kansas Supreme Court is supposed to do in that case,

10

Your Honor?

11

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Yes.  Whether the

12

Constitution requires it or not, it has said the better

13

practice is to give this instruction.

14

            What's a court supposed to do?  Say,

15

willynilly, my lower courts can disagree with me and

16

not do it?

17

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Sotomayor, no.  And I

18

would leave it to the Kansas court under Kansas law and

19

practice.  It is, of course, the supreme court of the

20

State to determine what the appropriate step would be

21

under State law.  But what the Kansas court is not

22

supposed to do in that circumstance is pivot to the

23

Eighth Amendment and make a Federal decision that is

24

incorrect under this Court's practices.

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.  And it can't 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

and it can't, by doing so, immunize itself from  from

2

review in this Court.  And that's Michigan v. Long,

3

which  which  which I don't know if were cited in

4

the brief, but Michigan v. Long, to Justice Alito's

5

point, made it very clear that a  a State court can't

6

hide behind a  a Federal law and  and  and be

7

immune because there might be a State law to predicate.

8

We have to see what they wrote.  And this  I assume

9

that Kansas would pride itself on  on being cited in

10

other jurisdictions.  And if it's wrong and it uses a

11

Federal calculus that's incorrect, it's  it's this

12

Court's duty to reverse.

13

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, Justice Kennedy, I

14

certainly agree.  And to that last point on other

15

jurisdictions, we've identified, and they're in our

16

briefs, at least 5 states that we believe are similarly

17

situated, where they actually impose no burden, but

18

don't require an affirmative instruction.

19

            And we believe, notwithstanding the

20

backandforth in the briefs, that the Uniform Code of

21

Military Justice looks much more like the Kansas system

22

on this point than on what the Kansas Supreme Court says

23

is constitutionally required.

24

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I suppose  I suppose

25

that it is true that if you're a juror and you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

considering whether or not to grant mercy, that's not

2

something that's easily subject to a burdenofproof

3

analysis one way or the other.  If a juror thinks I have

4

sympathy for this person or I want to grant mercy,

5

that  that's not really the  the kind of fact like

6

you're  you're 18 or you're 21 or your father did or

7

didn't abandon you that can be proven in  with a

8

burden of proof of any sort.

9

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Certainly correct,

10

Justice Kennedy.  And, of course, a mercy instruction

11

was given in each of these cases.  And in addition,

12

separate and apart from the mercy instruction issue,

13

this Court has in the past looked at what you've called

14

catchall instructions, like the Factor K instructions

15

from California, has looked on them favorably.  And in

16

these cases there was a catchall instruction given as

17

well.  It's an instruction 7 on Gleason 6 and 8 with

18

respect to the Carr cases.  So there was both a

19

beltandsuspenders alternate option.

20

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Sorry.  What does that mean,

21

a "catchall instruction"?

22

            MR. SCHMIDT:  It's the language in  it's

23

the last paragraph of Section 7.  It reads this way, if

24

I may, Justice Kagan:  "You may further consider as a

25

mitigating circumstance any other aspect of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

defendant's character, background, or record, and any

2

other aspect of the offense which was presented"  not

3

proven, presented  "in either the guilt or penalty

4

phase which you find may serve as a basis for imposing a

5

sentence less than death.

6

            And to Justice Kennedy's point, that's

7

clearly not a finding subject to some burden of proof.

8

It's an openended invitation to consider and weigh and

9

give effect to anything else these jurors think

10

appropriate in rendering a reasoned, moral judgment.

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Didn't the Court 

12

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm reading that from

13

Gleason, and that's also in Carr?

14

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes, Your Honor.  It's

15

Instruction 6 and 8 in Carr.  Similar language.  It may

16

not be exactly identical, but it's substantively

17

identical.

18

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Didn't the Kansas Court

19

say, yes, we have that, but the only burden of proof in

20

any of the instructions was in aggravating circumstances

21

and that the State bore that burden?

22

            And it pointed to the fact that aggravating

23

and mitigating were mentioned in the same clause 5 or 6

24

times with no explanation of what the burden was for

25

mitigating.  The Kansas Court thought that the jurors

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

could be confused or would be confused by what burden of

2

proof was needed.

3

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Sotomayor, and that's

4

the second reason we would respectfully ask this Court

5

to reverse the Kansas Court, in addition to the

6

brightline per se rule.

7

            The Kansas Court reported it said it was

8

applying this Court's instruction from Boyde v.

9

California to test whether or not the Eighth Amendment

10

is offended by instructions that are alleged to be

11

ambiguous or confusing, which I think is what's

12

happening there.

13

            The Kansas Court said it was applying Boyde,

14

but then it went on to conduct no actual Boyde analysis

15

other than what Your Honor points to, which is simply

16

the State said repeatedly, in both cases, that there is

17

a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the

18

State must prove with respect to aggravators, and also

19

with respect to the weighing factor.

20

            And the mere silence on the other side

21

somehow led the Kansas Court to conclude that Boyde was

22

violated because jurors would have inferred what was

23

imposed on the State must also have been imposed on the

24

Respondent.  I just don't think that follows either

25

logic or natural language.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I think what

2

they're saying is that some jurors would be confused.

3

And certainly, there have been jury  jury studies to

4

indicate that jurors are often confused, generally,

5

about burdens of proof.

6

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Sotomayor, I certainly

7

agree that is what they seem to be saying, but the test

8

this Court has adopted and applied repeatedly since

9

Boyde is not that there is some speculative possibility

10

in a hypothetical circumstance somebody might have been

11

confused.  It is there is a showing, that there is a

12

reasonable likelihood that these jurors applied their

13

instructions in a way that prevented them from

14

considering constitutionally relevant mitigation

15

evidence.  There's no showing of it.

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It is such common sense

17

that there is a maxim of interpretation that invokes it.

18

When  when somebody says interestfree loans for

19

people with good credit, it implies that there are not

20

interestfree loans for people who don't have good

21

credit.  Inclusio unius, exclusio alterius.

22

            And if one says there are aggravating

23

factors and mitigating factors, and you must prove the

24

aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, the

25

normal understanding is you don't have to prove it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

beyond a reasonable doubt for the mitigating factors.

2

            That's such  such common reasoning that 

3

that any juror who doesn't follow it is  is certainly

4

not the typical juror, and not the person for whom the

5

jury instructions have to be devised.

6

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the jury

7

instructions don't have to be devised necessarily for

8

the Court.  They should be understandable to jurors.

9

And I doubt very much that any juror has heard of that

10

maxim.

11

            But putting that aside, the Kansas Court,

12

which has much more experience than we do with trial

13

court decisions, has determined that confusion exists or

14

can exist.  Why isn't that enough for us?

15

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Your Honor, I would point you

16

back again to the concluding paragraph, because I think

17

it illustrates my response that  there's suggestion of

18

the response throughout the record, but it illustrates

19

it well.

20

            Again, back on page 103 of the Gleason

21

appendix, this is what our court said:  "The district

22

court's instruction on mitigating circumstances failed

23

to affirmatively inform the jury that mitigating

24

circumstances need not be proven beyond a reasonable

25

doubt."  So there was silence on that point.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

            Next sentence:  "And the penalty phrase" 

2

"phase instructions as a whole exacerbated the error

3

because they referred only to the State's burden of

4

beyond a reasonable doubt," which, of course, will

5

always be true because it's constitutionally required

6

that the jurors be informed the State, the government

7

bears that burden beyond a reasonable doubt.

8

            The Kansas Court then concluded in the next

9

sentence  I won't read it because I've cited it before

10

 but under these circumstances, in other words, when

11

there is an instruction that the State must prove beyond

12

a reasonable doubt and there is silence on the other

13

side, we conclude there is a reasonable likelihood that

14

 the Boyde is violated  I'm summarizing, of

15

course  it is conclusory and nothing else.

16

            In other words, it is back to that per se

17

application that was novel in the Kansas Supreme Court's

18

holding.  They gave it the gloss of Boyde.  They said

19

they were applying Boyde.  But they misapplied this

20

Court's instruction from Boyde and instead merely said

21

here's our Boyde analysis.  There's a per se violation

22

because there is a beyondareasonabledoubt instruction

23

correctly for the State and silence on the other side.

24

No other indication of juror misapplication or

25

confusion.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

            Justice Scalia, back on the point that you

2

were raising.  I would just say that it is  perhaps

3

ironic is the correct word, but frustrating from the

4

standpoint of the government in this case  the State

5

in this case, that we bent over backwards to make clear

6

to these jurors the heavy burden borne by the State.

7

            We did repeatedly tell them, at multiple

8

places, the State bears a burden to prove aggravation

9

beyond a reasonable doubt and to prove on the weighing

10

factor, and that the death penalty should be imposed.

11

The phrasing's in there; it's a normative phrase.  It's

12

obviously not subject directly to a burden of proof.

13

            And because we told them that repeatedly to

14

make clear how heavy the State's burden was, that now

15

has turned into an argument that we somehow misled the

16

jury.

17

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, the prosecutor in

18

Carr did tell the jury, I'm going to create reasonable

19

doubt as to the defendants' mitigating evidence.  So

20

that prosecutor didn't do what you said.

21

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, Justice Sotomayor, the

22

Carr records are very thick.  And I would say on

23

Gleason, I think it's bright line, very clear.  We

24

conceded the existence of all but two of those

25

mitigating factors that were asserted in Gleason.  And

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

the other two merely asked was anything produced; was

2

there any evidence on that, which this Court has said at

3

least since Marsh is permissible.  So I think Gleason is

4

a clean example on behalf of the State.

5

            Carr, I'd admit, is a much longer record and

6

has a lot more back and forth in it.  You had expert

7

testimony and some back and forth on that.

8

            But even in the Carr case, this Court has

9

instructed since Boyde, and has done so repeatedly, that

10

in determining whether or not there's a reasonable

11

likelihood of unconstitutional juror confusion, if the

12

jurors thought they couldn't consider something, you

13

look at the context of the entire trial.

14

            And if you look at the overall instructions

15

that were given in the Carr case, you'll also see that

16

the Carr prosecutors  and I'd refer the Court to pages

17

392 and 393 of the Joint Appendix, as well as 442 and

18

443 of the same  the prosecutor told the Carr juries

19

that the jury's task is, quote, "to research and to

20

analyze and to distribute the information and to weigh

21

it and measure it and turn it upside down and look at it

22

backwards and to have a healthy discussion about the

23

relative merits of that which you have heard in this

24

courtroom."

25

            And then went on at the secondary cite I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

gave you to ask the jury in the Carr cases to render a

2

death verdict, and I quote, "Because you have looked and

3

listened to all the evidence, and the evidence warrants

4

that kind of punishment.  Anything that would reduce

5

culpability has not been presented here."

6

            I offer those as examples,

7

Justice Sotomayor, to make the point that it is, of

8

course, always possible, particularly when dealing with

9

the transcription of oral statements made during trial,

10

to find a phrase here or there that, in hindsight,

11

perhaps was inartfully crafted.

12

            But the overall thrust of these

13

instructions, the arguments of counsel, the nature of

14

the evidence that was put on, to Justice Kennedy's

15

point, was these jurors were told to consider and weigh

16

everything.  In fact, they were literally told that

17

phrase in Instruction 2, to consider and weigh

18

everything admitted into evidence that would weigh on

19

aggravation or mitigation.  It was clear they were given

20

an openended instruction, and 

21

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But General, if I can

22

understand your argument, you're saying not only that

23

that analysis would come out the State's way, but you're

24

saying this  the lower court really never did that

25

analysis at all, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

            It didn't think that it was doing that

2

analysis.  It didn't think that that analysis was

3

necessary because it thought that there was just a per

4

se rule that one had to give this instruction; is that

5

correct?

6

            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, Justice Kagan, that's not.

7

What I'm saying is that the lower court correctly

8

identified Boyde as the proper analysis, said that was

9

what it was doing, but then wholly misapplied Boyde and,

10

instead, conjured this per se rule.

11

            Their misapplication of this Court's

12

precedent in Boyde is what resulted in their incorrect

13

conclusion that the Eighth Amendment requires this sort

14

of per se instruction.

15

            So it's not just that they didn't get to

16

what they should have done and they did something

17

different.  It's that they tried to do what they should

18

have done under this Court's precedent; they just did it

19

wrong.  And that's why we asked 

20

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I find that a little bit

21

confusing.  It just  it sounds like they just sort of

22

cited Boyde but failed to pay attention to anything

23

Boyde said about what the analysis ought to be and

24

instead substituted their own analysis, which was a per

25

se rule deriving from the Eighth Amendment.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Well, except, Your Honor, to

2

your point about citing Boyde, they did more than cite

3

Boyde.  They also recited some of the concepts from

4

Boyde.  I mean, for example, the Court said  and I

5

believe I already mentioned this passage to you  our

6

court said that they looked at the context of the trial,

7

which is something that Boyde says must be done in a

8

proper Boyde analysis.  But in their conclusion, the

9

prosecutor's statements made matters worse,

10

notwithstanding the fact it was already discussed with,

11

Justice Sotomayor.  I just don't believe that is a fair

12

conclusion or an accurate conclusion.

13

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  What a  what a

14

wonderful system we've created.  We give  even when a

15

State court is wrong in convicting somebody, so long as

16

they're reasonably wrong, we uphold them.  And when

17

they're wrong on a legal conclusion applying our test,

18

we jump in and reverse them, right?

19

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Justice Sotomayor, all I can

20

say is on this case, our court was wrong under the

21

Eighth Amendment.  We would ask for reversal.

22

            Mr. Chief Justice, with permission, I'd like

23

to reserve the balance of my time.

3

                NOS. 14452 AND 14449

4

            MR. GREEN:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

please the Court:

6

            I'd like to first address Justice

7

Sotomayor's questions, briefly.

8

            Justice Sotomayor, you were correct, the

9

Kansas Supreme Court has 3 times addressed this issue

10

before, not 2 times.  There was a case cited in the

11

submission that we made to the Court on Monday.  That

12

submission was the objection to the jury instructions

13

offered by counsel for Jonathan Carr and Reginald Carr.

14

            In that  in that objection to the  or

15

excuse me  the affirmative jury instructions offered

16

by those attorneys.  In those affirmative instructions,

17

they explained that one of the reasons why they wanted

18

an instruction that the jury should be told no beyond a

19

reasonable doubt standard applies to mitigating

20

circumstances is  is a case called Harman, and that is

21

cited  at and, again, it's in our submission  254

22

Kansas 87 from 1993.  Kansas 

23

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is that true of the

24

Gleason case?  There was no  am I right, that there

25

was no objection to these instructions given on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

mitigators in Gleason?  You pointed out in your letter

2

there was in Carr.

3

            MR. GREEN:  That's correct, Your Honor.

4

That's correct.  But I submit for this 

5

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And did you  did you

6

ask  oh, it was the court in Gleason.  Was the

7

sentencing court asked to charge that mitigators need

8

not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt?  Was there any

9

request to charge that was turned down?

10

            MR. GREEN:  No, there was not in Gleason,

11

Your Honor.  But, again, these cases are consolidated

12

for this purpose.  And my friend on the other side of

13

the podium here has conceded that these instructions are

14

identical for purposes of the Eighth Amendment analysis

15

that  that we're going to do.  So we do have a

16

preserved objection, but it doesn't matter anyway.  We

17

would submit, Justice Ginsburg, because Kansas has a

18

nowaiver rule for such failures to object in the

19

Gleason case, and in any event, the Kansas Supreme Court

20

passed on it.

21

            But I want to get back to what Kansas said

22

about  in the Harman case.  It said that the jury

23

instructions were  and these are the same jury

24

instructions here in a mandatory minimum case.  Kansas

25

has a bifurcated proceeding in mandatory minimum cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

These same jury instructions were confusing, and for

2

precisely the reason that we have here.

3

            Then we have the Kleypas case that comes

4

later.  In the Kleypas case, the courts  the Kansas

5

Supreme Court's  Kansas Supreme Court's analysis is

6

exactly this:  The instruction is okay on the unanimity

7

principle for Mills and McKoy purposes.  So it's okay.

8

It's okay.  But for purposes of understanding how

9

mitigation evidence is to work, it's confusing.  No

10

citation to Federal authority.  None whatsoever.  And so

11

they say there should be an instruction given to every

12

penalty phase juror in Kansas  jury in Kansas, and

13

that is, first, let's have the nonunanimity

14

instruction, then let's have the instruction that says

15

no beyond a reasonable doubt.

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't understand the

17

point you're getting to.  What  what is your point?

18

That this was  this decision was based on State law?

19

            MR. GREEN:  Yes, Your Honor, that it was

20

based on State law.

21

            And, in fact, if you go to Scott, the next

22

decision in the proceeding, Your Honor  Your Honor

23

invited us to look at the cases.  If you go to Scott,

24

the court says the same thing.  We're reiterating what

25

we said in Kleypas, and by the way, we think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

implicates Federal law.

2

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I thought the whole

3

point of our decision in Michigan v. Long was to make it

4

clear to State courts that we weren't going to do this

5

kind of thing.  We weren't going to try to look, well,

6

how many Federal cites, how many State cites.  Unless

7

it's clear that it's based solely on State law, then we

8

assume it's the Federal question and Federal basis in

9

that case.  And  and I assume your friend was correct

10

about how many times the Eighth Amendment was  was

11

cited in the opinion.

12

            MR. GREEN:  I think that's probably true

13

with respect to this decision.  I would call the Court's

14

attention to  to the Gleason Pet. App. 102, in which

15

the  the core statement of the Kansas Supreme Court

16

there is an interpretation of Kansas State law.

17

            With respect to your question 

18

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  It doesn't matter under

19

Michigan v. Long.  It's debatable whether that's a good

20

rule or not, but it is the rule.  It says if there's any

21

doubt, this Court will assume that the State court was

22

going on the Federal ground, not the State ground.

23

            MR. GREEN:  I understand that, Your Honor,

24

and I would submit that, if you look at the history of

25

this jury instruction rule that the Kansas Supreme Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

has announced, which originally  or which ultimately

2

was enshrined in the Kansas pattern jury instructions,

3

that does rely solely on State law and solely on the

4

Kansas Supreme Court's decision or interpretation of its

5

own State law, but  please.

6

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, I was just going to

7

add, are you asking us to dismiss the case because

8

there's an adequate and independent State ground?

9

            MR. GREEN:  I am asking you, first, to issue

10

an opinion that would say the origins of this rule are

11

not Eighth Amendment.  They're in fact Kansas State law,

12

the Kansas Supreme Court's interpretation of its own

13

statute.  And second, the Court might consider dismissal

14

of the case.

15

            But to answer your earlier question to my

16

friend on the other side of the podium, Justice Kennedy,

17

it would be difficult to imagine a circumstance in which

18

this Court wouldn't say, well, you were wrong, Kansas,

19

about the Eighth Amendment here, and therefore we're

20

going to remand so you can resolve this issue about

21

whether or not this is in fact a Kansas Supreme Court

22

reading of the Kansas State law.

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But if  if  if this

24

Court determines that this instruction is not confusing

25

as a matter of Eighth Amendment law, that surely has a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

significance  I would think it would have a

2

significance on any remand proceedings that might take

3

place.  And plus  and it has additional significance

4

for the other jurisdictions that use this  and other

5

States that use this instruction.  So surely we have

6

something significant and necessary to decide under the

7

Eighth Amendment.

            MR. GREEN:  Well, it may be that  and that

9

is why my first alternative suggestion was that the

10

Court take a look at  at this.  And maybe this is the

11

case that's bracketed with Michigan v. Long.  There's a

12

sufficient history of Kansas Supreme Court

13

interpretation of Kansas law that would allow the Court

14

to say this isn't a Michigan v. Long case.  If a State

15

supreme court simply says, look, we have a decision

16

here.  We think it's confusing.  The history is it's an

17

interpretation of State law.  And by the way, we have

18

support under Federal law that's  that is not a

19

Michigan v. Long case.

20

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, presumably,

21

the Kansas Supreme Court is familiar with Michigan v.

22

Long, as we are, and they're on notice that if they

23

start putting the Federal authorities mentioning the

24

Eighth Amendment 8 times, that the court is going to

25

look at it as a decision based on Federal law.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

            The whole point of Michigan v. Long was

2

that  so that we wouldn't have to do what we've been

3

doing for the last 10 minutes, which is to debate

4

whether a decision that mentions both State and Federal

5

law is based on State or Federal law.

6

            MR. GREEN:  Well, I won't  I won't waste

7

more time 

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Of course, you know, if

9

they didn't read our Eighth Amendment cases, maybe they

10

also didn't read Michigan v. Long.  I mean, that's

11

entirely understandable.

12

            MR. GREEN:  I'm going to  I'm going to

13

demonstrate to you in a minute that they did read your

14

Eighth Amendment cases and that they got it right,

15

Justice Scalia.

16

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But would it not be true

17

that the Kansas issue  the Kansas law issue could be

18

raised in a State collateral proceeding?  Why is a

19

remand necessary?

20

            MR. GREEN:  Well, in part because if it's a

21

Kansas collateral proceeding, the presumption of

22

legality and finality would attach on direct review.

23

This case is still on direct review.  And so I would

24

submit, Justice Alito, that the Kansas Supreme Court

25

ought to have the opportunity in the first instance to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

sort this out.

2

            JUSTICE ALITO:  In the ordinary case, let's

3

say a State Supreme Court decides an issue.  They make

4

no  they make no reference whatsoever to State law.

5

They based it on the Federal Constitution.  It comes up

6

here; we reverse.  We would not remand and say, well,

7

you didn't say anything about State law, but it's

8

possible that you might want to find that the same rule

9

applies under State law.  We wouldn't do it in that

10

situation, would we?  In every case like that we would

11

remand?

12

            MR. GREEN:  I don't know about every case,

13

but I can imagine that the Court would want to go back

14

and say, well, look, Federal law doesn't work this way,

15

but it  but, you know, Kansas Supreme Court or State

16

supreme court, if you think it works another way, fine.

17

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, is that what we have

18

done in such cases?  We've remanded all of those for

19

them to say, well, you didn't mention State law, but

20

maybe you want to think about State law?

21

            MR. GREEN:  I haven't seen a case like that.

22

But to go to the Chief Justice's question, Michigan v.

23

Long was  was kind of the reverse of this case.  It

24

wasn't using Eighth Amendment jurisprudence to support

25

or Federal jurisprudence just to support to add

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

additional weight to the decision.  It was the basis of

2

the decision.

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  All right.  If we assume for

4

the sake of argument that we would not do that in every

5

case, then what you are proposing is that we do it here

6

because you think there's a sufficient  there's

7

sufficient uncertainty about the basis for the decision.

8

And then we're going to get into the situation in all of

9

these cases of deciding, is there enough?  Well, they

10

cited some State cases, they might  we're going to

11

have to be making these decisions in every one of these

12

cases.

13

            MR. GREEN:  Well, I would submit that this

14

would be such a case, especially given the history of 

15

of the Kansas Supreme Court's decisions on this issue

16

interpreting its own statue.

17

            But if I might, Your Honor 

18

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The other States that

19

have no mitigating burden, do you know how many of them

20

require an instruction just like this one?

21

            MR. GREEN:  Yes.  We cited in our brief

22

at  our Gleason brief at pages, I think, 27 and 28,

23

Your Honor, that  that there are 24 States that

24

expressly require a statement to the jury about what the

25

burden of proof is with respect to mitigating

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

circumstances.  That is out of 31 states remaining in

2

the United States that have the death penalty, Your

3

Honor.

4

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're not saying that

5

that's required by the Eighth Amendment; is that right?

6

You're not advocating a per se rule that such

7

instructions are necessary.

8

            MR. GREEN:  No.  That's right, Justice

9

Kagan.  We're not  we're not advocating that kind of

10

per se rule.  In fact, one could imagine a set of

11

circumstances  a set of instructions that are silent

12

with respect to mitigation, but nonetheless would pass

13

muster under the Eighth Amendment.

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So could I  could I talk

15

about the circumstances of this case?

16

            MR. GREEN:  Please.

17

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Which is, you know, you have

18

an instruction here that is unfortunate in its

19

juxtaposition of the reasonable doubt standard and the

20

reference to mitigating circumstances.  And, you know,

21

it is unfortunate, and I can see why they changed their

22

pattern instructions.

23

            But  but we've said that the analysis is a

24

holistic one.  We look at everything.  You also have

25

this mercy instruction.  You have a catchall

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

instruction.  You have, in both cases, arguments by the

2

prosecutors that indicate fairly clearly that this is

3

really all up to the jurors in Gleason.  It says,

4

"Mitigating circumstances are every juror's individual

5

choice."  In  in Carr, the prosecutor says, "Anything

6

in fairness may be considered as extenuating."

7

            So I guess the question is, even if this is

8

a really unfortunate wording in the reasonable

9

doubt/mitigating circumstances juxtaposition, why

10

doesn't all of this other stuff indicate that no juror

11

was likely to be confused?

12

            MR. GREEN:  Because the unfortunate wording

13

that Your Honor refers to is repeated throughout these

14

instructions.  Please let me demonstrate here.  With 

15

with respect to the findings of  findings of

16

aggravating circumstances, every time the Court is told

17

that it must find aggravating circumstances beyond a

18

reasonable doubt, the same sentence says, "And any

19

mitigating circumstances found to exist."

20

            There is repeated parallelism in these  in

21

these instructions with respect to the use of the verbs.

22

Let's go to Justice Scalia's point earlier with respect

23

to what a reasonable juror would have known.  The

24

juror  if you look at Instruction No. 1, Instruction

25

No. 1 says that  reminds the jury that the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Which  which case?  In

2

which case, Gleason?

3

            MR. GREEN:  Yes.  I'm sorry, Your Honor.

4

This would be in our Gleason app, Appendix 1(a).

5

Instruction No. 1 says that when a Defendant  excuse

6

me.  "The laws of Kansas provide that a separate

7

sentencing proceeding shall be conducted when a

8

Defendant has been found guilty."

9

            Now, the verb "find" or "finding" appears 7

10

times in the  throughout the instructions saying that

11

the jury must find mitigating circumstances.  Three

12

times in the instructions, at crucial points in  in

13

Instruction No. 10, which I'll ask us to look at in a

14

minute, and Instruction No. 12, which is the verdict,

15

the jury is referred to  or the jury is asked to make

16

findings with respect to aggravating circumstances.  So

17

it's the same exercise throughout.

18

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But the jury was also

19

aware that there was a big difference between

20

aggravators and mitigators.  They were told they had to

21

be unanimous on the  on the aggravators.  But on

22

mitigators, each jury  each juror was to make the

23

determination for herself and, moreover, that the same

24

mitigator need not be found by all the jurors.  So

25

the  the aggravators, unanimous, they all have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

agree on the aggravated.  Mitigator, one could say this

2

one, the other could say that one, and that would be

3

okay.

4

            MR. GREEN:  Well, I might agree with that,

5

Your Honor, except for the jury was expressly told in

6

Instruction No. 7 that  that with respect to

7

mitigators, it didn't have to be unanimous.  However,

8

the jury  the instructions went on.  It continued to

9

draw parallels with respect to the burden of proof

10

between finding mitigators and finding aggravators.

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Don't you  don't you

12

think it's  it's sort of hard to contemplate each

13

juror  each juror's ability to find mitigators on his

14

or her own without regard to whether others find the

15

same mitigator?  Isn't that somewhat incompatible

16

with  with the juror's belief that the juror had to

17

find it beyond a reasonable doubt?  My goodness, if it's

18

beyond a reasonable doubt, you would think every other

19

juror would find the same mitigator, and they were

20

expressly told that they don't have to find the same

21

mitigator.

22

            MR. GREEN:  Beyond a reasonable doubt is the

23

only  the only standard that the jury is offered, Your

24

Honor.  It's the only one that they know.  It's the one

25

that they've sat through the guilt phase with.  It's now

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

the one that they're trying to apply in the sentencing

2

phase, executing a moral  pardon the pun  executing

3

a moral judgment as to whether a defendant should live

4

or die.

5

            So with respect to what jurors might say to

6

one another in the jury room, one can imagine a

7

situation where one juror says, mercy, I'm not  you

8

know, maybe there should be mercy.  Another  another

9

juror says to that juror, well, I didn't  I didn't see

10

enough evidence for that.  I mean, are you certain mercy

11

should be applied here?  No.  You know, you have to be

12

certain that mercy applies here.

13

            I don't think that's a farfetched notion at

14

all, especially when you look at an instruction like No.

15

10, which is on page 5A of the Joint Appendix.  And

16

Instruction 10 draws an express parallel and uses the

17

verb "to find," Your Honor.  "If you find unanimously

18

beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more aggravating

19

circumstances exist and that they are not outweighed by

20

any mitigating circumstances found to exist, then you

21

shall impose a sentence of death."

22

            Let's jump down to the next paragraph.  The

23

next paragraph says, "However" 

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where are you quoting from?

25

            MR. GREEN:  I'm sorry.  Page 5A of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

Gleason Appendix 

2

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh, the Gleason.

3

            MR. GREEN:   red  red brief.  My

4

apologies, Your Honor.

5

            The next paragraph says 

6

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  You put it in the red

7

brief.  It's also in the petition for writ of certiorari

8

appendix, the white appendix.  Gleason 133, page 133 of

9

the white.

10

            MR. GREEN:  The second paragraph of

11

Instruction No. 10 says, "However, if one or more juries

12

is not"  "jurors is not persuaded beyond a reasonable

13

doubt on the burden of proof in the paragraph above."

14

            So, again, the jury is called to look at the

15

beyond the reasonable doubt standard when assessing both

16

aggravating and mitigating circumstances in parallel.

17

And, again, this is the only  this is the only

18

standard that the jury has been exposed to throughout

19

the trial.

20

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Your proposal is that 

21

is that the floor was not telling them, mitigators don't

22

have to be shown beyond a reasonable doubt.  But that

23

still doesn't tell the jury what the burden of proof is

24

on mitigators.

25

            Why are you urging beyond  you don't have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

to find beyond a reasonable doubt.  Okay.  So what do

2

you have to find in order to accept a mitigator?

3

            MR. GREEN:  It doesn't expressly say that

4

and  Justice Ginsburg.  That's the whole problem, is

5

that I  I respectfully disagree with Justice Scalia.

6

A lawyer might look at these instructions and say, aha,

7

the fact that there is an absence or a silence with

8

respect to what the burden of proof is as to mitigating

9

instructions creates a negative implication.

10

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, I have the same

11

question.  Suppose the jury is instructed you 

12

mitigators do not have to be proved beyond a reasonable

13

doubt.  And then the jury sends a question, well, what

14

is the burden of proof on mitigators?  How should the

15

trial judge answer that?

16

            MR. GREEN:  In Kansas, the answer is, it's a

17

burden of production and a burden of production only.

18

And all that means is 

19

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  We're asking under the

20

Eighth Amendment  or at least that's my interest 

21

under the Eighth Amendment, what is required in response

22

to Justice Alito's question?  I didn't mean to

23

interrupt.

24

            MR. GREEN:  Well, it may be just the

25

negative, that there is no  that there is no burden

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

of  there is no burden of proof, and each of you as

2

individual jurors should consider all of the evidence.

3

I mean, it's about weighing and  and maybe the judge

4

could say to the jury, you should  you should consider

5

and you should weigh all of the evidence that the

6

defendant 

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  It's not a matter 

8

we're asking the factual finding of whether the

9

mitigator existed, not weighing the mitigators against

10

the aggravators, the factual finding of whether the

11

mitigator existed, whether indeed this defendant had a

12

troubled childhood or whatever else.  What is the burden

13

that the juror has to sustain in order to come to that

14

judgment?

15

            MR. GREEN:  Well, consistent with  with

16

Woodson and Lockett and that  that entire line of

17

cases, that  that  the exact language is, is the

18

jury can't be precluded from considering any relevant

19

mitigating circumstances.

20

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So anything 

21

anything that was presented to them.  I think you said

22

earlier burden of production.

23

            MR. GREEN:  Any  any 

24

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, that's what

25

the instruction said.  When you're considering

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

mitigating circumstance, you  back on any aspect of

2

the offense which was presented in either the guilt or

3

penalty phase.  If it was presented to the jury, they

4

should consider it.  I don't 

5

            MR. GREEN:  Well, but that  that

6

doesn't  I mean, that doesn't speak to the burden of

7

proof.  It  and it does relate to both aggravating and

8

mitigating circumstances.

9

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, it says they

10

have to consider anything that was presented, not things

11

they found beyond a reasonable doubt.  If it was

12

presented, they need  they can consider it.

13

            MR. GREEN:  If the  if the instruction

14

said that alone, then the instructions might be okay.

15

And that's precisely why we're answering Justice Kagan's

16

question that we're not saying that the Eighth Amendment

17

commands that juries be instructed 

18

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the instruction

19

said something that you think is okay, and consider

20

evidence that's presented.  But you say, well, we have

21

to draw a negative inference from what it said about

22

aggravating circumstances to outweigh what would have

23

been an acceptable instruction on its own.

24

            MR. GREEN:  I  I'm saying that  that

25

consistent drawing of parallels between the two without

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

stating exactly what the burden of proof is with respect

2

to mitigating circumstance creates a reasonable

3

likelihood that there would be confusion.

4

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

5

            MR. GREEN:  Thank you.

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Mr. Katyal.

7

             ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

8

    ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT IN CASE NO. 14450

9

            MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

and may it please the Court:

11

            A man is being put to death under jury

12

instructions that are so confusing that there is a

13

reasonable likelihood that some juries would interpret

14

those instructions to bar consideration of the

15

mitigating evidence and others would not.  That

16

ambiguity and inequity is impermissible under the Eighth

17

Amendment.

18

            Now, the State's answer is the instructions

19

allowed the jury in a catchall provision to consider

20

everything as mitigating.  That's irrelevant.  There are

21

two fundamentally different questions.  The first is the

22

"what."  What kinds of circumstances count as

23

mitigating?  And second is the "how."  How does a jury

24

determine if those circumstances exist in a given case.

25

So 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  The circumstances 

2

the circumstances that count as  as mitigating, 4(a)

3

of the  the Gleason brief, "any other aspect of the

4

defendant's character, background or record, and any

5

other aspect of the offense which was presented."

6

            MR. KATYAL:  Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.  We

7

agree that, for example, the jury was instructed that

8

Reginald Carr's child abuse, if it existed, could be a

9

mitigating factor.  The question is:  How was a jury to

10

determine whether Reginald Carr was abused in the first

11

place as a child?

12

            So the catchall provision doesn't answer

13

that question.

14

            Now, General Schmidt's answer is, well, look

15

at the language of instruction 2.  And, Mr. Chief

16

Justice, I think you were referring to that.  This is

17

what they say  what he says in their reply brief at

18

page 

19

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I was

20

quoting from 7.

21

            MR. KATYAL:  Okay.

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Maybe it's the same

23

as 2.

24

            MR. KATYAL:  In 7  in 7  in 7, I don't

25

see quite the same thing.  But  but I  I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

our  out general point here is that this Court has

2

said repeatedly in AbdulKabir and in Braverman that the

3

mere presentation of evidence is enough.  The evidence

4

has to be given full effect as a mitigating

5

circumstance.

6

            And I understand that different people can

7

look at this  these set of instructions as a whole and

8

come up with different ways of interpreting them.  But

9

this Court's decision in Boyde says as long as there is

10

a reasonable likelihood that a jury could read them in a

11

confusing way and bar the consideration of mitigating

12

evidence, that is enough.

13

            Now, Justice Scalia, you said, well, that

14

doesn't square with common sense.  What about an example

15

like, quote, "interestfree loans for people with good

16

credit"?

17

            Now, our argument is not simply that the

18

jury instruction said beyond a reasonable doubt, though

19

they did 9 times.  It's that they coupled the beyond a

20

reasonable doubt with the language found to exist, that

21

mitigating circumstances must be found to exist 9 times.

22

And so, Justice Scalia 

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you say

24

something  if you're considering whether to retire,

25

you said you should be absolutely sure you have enough

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

money to live on and you ought to think about whether

2

you're going to be bored.

3

            MR. GREEN:  Well 

4

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You wouldn't think

5

you had to be absolutely sure you were going to be

6

bored.

7

            MR. GREEN:  Well, let me just do it,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to the  the

9

hypothetical that Justice Scalia said.  If  if the

10

hypo was interestfree loans should be given to those

11

found to have good credit, found to have good credit,

12

which mirrors these instructions, and then the language

13

used found with a certain standard beyond a reasonable

14

doubt, or whatever, I think it's absolutely plausible

15

that people would read that instruction and say that

16

applies just as much to people without good credit.

17

They'd apply the same standard.  And that squares not

18

just with the experience in the States.  At least 24

19

States are using this, if  if not every State.  They

20

can't point to a single State that says found to exist

21

occurs in the jury instructions 9 times.  It's not just

22

the absence of an affirmative instruction, it's that

23

these instructions are injecting confusion and

24

uncertainty.

25

            And the distinction here is that you can

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

have two men going to  having committed virtually the

2

same crime with the same aggravating and mitigating

3

circumstances; one will be sentenced to death, one to

4

life, simply because of a legal interpretation of what

5

the jury instructions say.  That is not 

6

            JUSTICE ALITO:  If were on a  I'm sorry.

7

Finish the sentence.

8

            MR. KATYAL:  I was just going to say, that

9

is not death for the worst offender, Mr.  Justice

10

Alito, that's  that's  that's the death penalty to

11

be imposed for the worst interpretation of jury

12

instructions.

13

            JUSTICE ALITO:  If  if I were on a jury

14

and I were told that the burden  that mitigators do

15

not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, I would

16

find that confusing because then I would ask what is

17

the  the burden of proof on mitigators?  And I don't

18

think there's any way, really, to answer that question.

19

So maybe this is a situation like trying to define

20

reasonable doubt where less is more.  It's better not to

21

get into the question of burden of proof at all.

22

            And let me  just to finish this  this

23

suggestion, and maybe it's misdirected, but you

24

mentioned the mitigator of  of child abuse.  What

25

would  if there is any burden of proof, what would be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

the fact as to which it would apply?  The overall

2

category that this person had a bad childhood or that

3

the  the individual was beaten by his mother or beaten

4

by his father or subjected to sexual abuse or was around

5

people who were using drugs?  Unless you define what the

6

mitigators are, which can't be done, I don't see how you

7

can apply any kind of burden of proof.

8

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Alito, I think

9

this Court has never said that if jury instructions are,

10

by silence, confusing, that that silence alone is enough

11

to rise to an Eighth Amendment violation.  Here, our

12

point is that the instructions themselves injected the

13

confusion.  And so I don't think this Court is going to

14

police every possible thing that the jury might thought

15

in their heads.  The point is here they mentioned only

16

one standard, beyond a reasonable doubt.  They mentioned

17

it 9 times.  And they said that the mitigating

18

circumstances had to be found to exist.

19

            If the jury interpreted it this way, then

20

this Court  then the Court would be blessing a jury

21

instruction on beyond a reasonable doubt for the first

22

time ever in its history that said that a jury, all 12

23

of them, might have believed mitigating circumstances

24

actually existed and could not give it effect.  That is

25

what the effect of

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what burden

2

of proof do you think the jury applied with respect to

3

the showing of mercy?

4

            MR. KATYAL:  Well 

5

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  They were clearly

6

instructed that they can show mercy.  So what  they

7

didn't say anything about the burden of proof.

8

            MR. KATYAL:  And Mr. Chief Justice, they

9

were clearly instructed that mercy was a, quote, "a

10

mitigating factor."  And so they were then told 9 times

11

that they had to find a mitigating factor.

12

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you think they

13

had  they would have interpreted that I have to

14

determine whether to extend mercy beyond a reasonable

15

doubt?

16

            MR. KATYAL:  Absolutely, Your Honor.  I

17

think this Court has said many times that we presume a

18

jury follows its instructions, and this is a perfect

19

example of that 

20

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I know.  But

21

you're  you're begging the question to say the

22

instruction was this and the jury didn't follow it.

23

            MR. KATYAL:  I don't  I don't think so,

24

Mr. Chief Justice.  I think this is a perfect example of

25

how mercy would have been applied beyond a reasonable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

doubt.  If there was case for mercy after reading all of

2

the  all the sentencing proceedings, it was that

3

Reginald Carr had been abused badly as a child.  And

4

that's why mercy should have extended.  We are  we're

5

talking about deathqualified jurors here who already

6

can't extend mercy just simply because death is on the

7

line.  There had to be something additional.  That

8

something additional, in the context of this case, was

9

all about the child abuse of Reginald Carr.

10

            And, Justice Kagan, that's exactly what the

11

State, time and again, Joint Appendix pages 250 to 256,

12

said that  that Reginald Carr did not meet his burden

13

of proof on.  And so this was front and center at the

14

mitigating phase of the trial.  This was extremely

15

confusing, I think, to a jury.  And, of course, this

16

Court's decision in Boyde has a far lower standard than

17

that.  It's simply just was there something more than a

18

possibility, it doesn't even have to be 50 percent, that

19

the jury interpreted the instructions the wrong way.

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Mr. Katyal, Kansas has

21

already answered this question, hasn't it?  Its

22

requirement is that a jury be instructed both that

23

mitigation need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,

24

and, second, that the jury be told it has no  that

25

there is no burden of proof.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

            MR. KATYAL:  Exactly.  And just like in

2

Maryland v. Mills where this Court, under the Eighth

3

Amendment, looked to that, here it's significant that

4

not even Kansas is defending the rule that these jury

5

instructions left the jury with the impression of.  I

6

mean, indeed, I'm not aware of a single State that does

7

so.  There's no amici on the State's side saying that

8

this is going to impose any sort of harm to them.  This

9

is the most modest fix in the world.  It could be done

10

not just with an affirmative instruction, it could be

11

done by just striking out the words "found to exist" out

12

of the jury instructions.

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What do you think

14

the jury  if you  are they supposed to consider

15

things they didn't find to exist?

16

            MR. KATYAL:  Oh, no.

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I think it's a bit

18

of a stretch to say found to exist implies a particular

19

standard of proof.

20

            MR. KATYAL:  I don't think so at all, Your

21

Honor.  I think found to exist, that's the most natural

22

way of reading it.  And if there's any doubt, just look

23

at Instruction No. 1.  The first thing the jury was told

24

 this is at Petition Appendix page 500 of the Reginald

25

Carr petition.  "The laws of Kansas provide a separate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

sentencing proceeding shall be conducted when a

2

defendant has been found guilty of capital murder."

3

            That's what they're told after hearing

4

months of testimony about whether or not the Carrs

5

committed the crime under what standard?  The

6

beyondareasonabledoubt standard.

7

            That was the only thing the jury was told,

8

time and again, both at the guilt phases, the 9 times in

9

the mitigating phase of this trial.  It thinks  it's

10

absolutely reasonable for a jury to have interpreted the

11

jury instructions to say that's the standard that

12

applies here.

13

            And boy, if that's the standard that applied

14

in this case, that is unlike any proceeding in

15

AngloAmerican jurisprudence to my knowledge.

16

            JUSTICE ALITO:  What does it mean to say

17

there's no burden of proof?

18

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think it means that 

19

that 

20

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Every juror decides

21

individually?

22

            MR. KATYAL:  I think that  in Kansas, I

23

think that's right.  Now, of course you could have

24

minimum thresholds, evidence, and relevance, and so on,

25

as this Court's decision in Tennard said.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

            This is the opposite.  This is the highest

2

standard in all of law, beyond a reasonable doubt.  It's

3

never been done.  And these jury instructions did so.

4

            And look, I understand that we could read

5

these facts and say these are horrific crimes, as you

6

said, Justice Alito.  But so, too, Reginald Carr had a

7

horrific upbringing.  And I think the jury was entitled,

8

and this Court's decision in Stringer says, that it is

9

 when  when the injection of an arbitrary factor is

10

put in and two juries could reach different results on

11

the same facts, that violates the Eighth Amendment.

12

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

13

            Case 14452 is  oh, I'm sorry.  You have

14

rebuttal time.

15

            (Laughter.)

16

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You have, in fact,

17

four minutes of it.

18

          REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DEREK L. SCHMIDT

19

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Mr. Chief Justice, I'm anxious

21

on the point.  Thank you.

22

            Two or three points as time allows,

23

Mr. Chief Justice.

24

            First on Mr. Katyal's point that the issue

25

here is the how and not the what.  I would come back to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

the point that there was both a catchall and a mercy

2

instruction here.  And I would further point this Court

3

to what this Court has suggested in the past.

4

            This Court has fairly consistently suggested

5

that the cure to a Lockett type of error, that there was

6

something presented that might not have been able to be

7

given effect, would be catchall or mercy types of

8

instructions.

9

            And I would refer you to pages 310 and 11 of

10

Penry 1 where it wasn't the Court, but it was defense

11

who requested a mercy instruction that was not granted.

12

And as a result, the case wound up in front of this

13

Court.

14

            But also suggest that you look at page 803

15

on Penry 2 where this Court suggested 

16

Justice O'Connor writing  that a catchall instruction

17

wellcrafted would have been the cure for the error this

18

Court found in Penry 2.

19

            A similar implication at page 242 in

20

AbdulKabir, and a similar implication in page 308 of

21

Blystone.  So I think Kansas has done here precisely

22

what the Court has repeatedly suggested 

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  What is the  I know it's

24

your rebuttal.  What's the catchall instruction you

25

rely on?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

            MR. SCHMIDT:  The catchall instruction is

2

the last paragraph of Instruction No. 7.

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Of 7.  Of 7.  Thank you.

4

            MR. SCHMIDT:  Yes.  Correct.  And the mercy

5

instruction is earlier.  I believe it's the second

6

paragraph in Gleason.

7

            Secondly, with respect to Justice Ginsburg's

8

observation that there  a juror would have noticed

9

that there's a different between the use of finding with

10

respect to unanimity, or finding in another context,

11

suggesting that this argument's not very persuasive,

12

that the mere use of the word "find" repeatedly somehow

13

created confusion, I think that's correct.  And I think

14

there's other contrast in this record that shows it.

15

            For example, with respect to the verdict

16

forms.  In those cases where the beyond a reasonable

17

doubt language is included, finding is included with

18

respect to both aggravation and mitigation, but the

19

jurors were asked to check the box on what aggravators

20

they had found.  They weren't asked to do anything like

21

that with respect to mitigators.

22

            Now, a lay juror, being asked to do one task

23

for one purpose and a different task for a different

24

purpose, is not likely to conclude that the two tasks

25

are in some way equivalent.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

            Likewise, to the point that was suggested

2

earlier, Mr. Katyal correctly points out that the mercy

3

instruction is described as a mitigating circumstance.

4

That's absolutely true, but it certainly doesn't follow

5

that the jury would have thought that they have to apply

6

some burden of proof to mercy.  It's an act of grace.

7

That's the entire point of mercy.  And that further

8

suggests that it wasn't reasonable to conclude that

9

reading these words "find" time and again somehow led

10

them to an equivocal  an equivalent understanding of

11

how they ought to be used.

12

            Third, with respect to the Kleypas decision,

13

I am well on it, but this is back to the point that was

14

referenced by Mr. Green on the Kansas Supreme Court's

15

referencing of Kansas case law.  I would merely point

16

this Court to what this Court itself said in rejecting

17

precisely the same argument in the Marsh case  it's at

18

page 169  where the Court ultimately concluded Kleypas

19

itself  State law case that they draw upon  Kleypas

20

itself rested on Federal law.  And the same is true

21

here.

22

            The Kansas 

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Harman didn't.

24

            MR. SCHMIDT:  I'm sorry?

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Harman didn't.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

            MR. SCHMIDT:  That's correct.  Harman was

2

not a death penalty case.  It was a predeath penalty

3

case 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, no.  But they say just

5

what they said here.

6

            MR. SCHMIDT:  And beyond that, Harman was a

7

1993 case, barely after this Court 

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  But then as a succession of

9

references back.

10

            MR. SCHMIDT:  No.  But the point, Your

11

Honor, is that when the Kansas Supreme Court talked

12

about Harman, this Court only three years previously had

13

laid down the rule that governs this case.

14

            It is now well developed what the Eighth

15

Amendment rule is.  Harman doesn't say anything about

16

what this Court has been asked to decide.

17

            And finally, I would urge the Court to end,

18

I suppose, where we began, which is there's Eighth

19

Amendment error here.  And absent correction of that

20

Eighth Amendment error by this Court, it will be the

21

Eighth Amendment interpretation given by the Kansas

22

Supreme Court that disposes of this case, disposes of

23

the other similarly situated cases in Kansas 

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  As we said this  so as we

25

said, just that.  Four sentences you quote, they're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

wrong.

2

            Now, as to whether the  the instruction in

3

content here was too confusing because of the placement

4

all the arguments you heard, they didn't really go into

5

that.  Nor did they really go into the question of State

6

law.  Nor did they get into the question of whether the

7

new State law is retroactive.

8

            All those remain open on remand for the

9

parties to ask the Court to consider it, and if the

10

Court decides it's appropriate to raise it at that time,

11

to consider it.  Is that satisfactory to you?

12

            MR. SCHMIDT:  No, Justice Breyer.

13

Obviously, we'll deal with whatever State law questions

14

may arise subsequently.  But this was 

15

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Not just State law, it's

16

the confusion.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Forget it.

17

            I wanted to know if it's satisfactory.  The

18

answer is no.

19

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

20

            Case 14452 is submitted, and we will hear

21

the second question in the other two cases in a moment.

22

            (Whereupon, at 11:05 a.m., the case in the

23

aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
