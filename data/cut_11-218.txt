ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALEXANDRA T. SCHIMMER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. SCHIMMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here from the Sixth Circuit,

10
11

which held that habeas claims can be stayed indefinitely

12

because prisoners have a statutory right to competence

13

to assist in their case, but even Mr. Carter now disowns

14

the circuit's rationale, and the court's indefinite stay

15

order was wrong for two other reasons.

16

First, habeas claims cannot be stayed

17

indefinitely.

Doing so is fundamentally incompatible

18

with the timeliness concerns underlying AEDPA.

19

Second, while we readily acknowledge that

20

limited stays will be appropriate in some situations,

21

this is not one of them.

22

record based and, therefore, resolvable without his

23

assistance.

24
25

All of Mr. Carter's claims are

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What situations would they

be appropriate in?

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. SCHIMMER:

Limited stays, we think, Your

2

Honor, would be stay -- appropriate in situations where

3

the prisoner's ability to effectively communicate with

4

his counsel or to disclose evidence would be necessary

5

to his claim.

6

case, potentially, where AEDPA does not restrict Federal

7

review to the state court record.

8
9

And we think that would be true in a

So here, for instance, we think that the
prisoner's assistance would not be necessary, and

10

therefore, even a limited stay would not be appropriate

11

because all of Mr. Carter's claims were vetted before

12

the state courts and decided on the merits.

13

therefore, under 2254(d), in this Court's decision in

14

Pinholster, the Federal court is limited to reviewing

15

the state court record.

16

And

We don't think that the prisoner's

17

assistance in that case is necessary.

18

Mr. Carter has made a case for why his assistance would

19

be necessary in this specific case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

We don't think

Well, why -- why shouldn't

21

the rule be that an indefinite stay is -- is never

22

necessary?

is missing.

Then it

1

could be open to argue in a later case that there was


2

new evidence that was not available.


3

MS. SCHIMMER:

Well, we absolutely agree,


4

Justice Kennedy, that indefinite stays are never


5

appropriate, regardless of the circumstances; that

6

indefinite stays contravene AEDPA's timeliness concerns.

7

And to the extent that all of the parties in this case

8

agree now that, to the extent district courts have some

9

power to issue stays -- we say only limited stays -- in

10

these cases, that power is grounded in equitable

11

discretion.

12

And we do not think that it comports with

13

equitable discretion to allow a prisoner essentially to

14

win his case, to obtain a suspension of his capital

15

sentence, the ultimate end relief that he seeks --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about the second part

there's new evidence.

22

So, suppose that there's no

He then becomes competent and claims
Would -- would that be grounds to

MS. SCHIMMER:

Well, we think in those

23

situations -- certainly, the State of Ohio wouldn't

24

contest, for instance, under 2254(b), that if you were

25

incompetent before, that that would be a legitimate
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

basis, potentially, for not having been able to

2

reasonably discover a new claim, if one had a new claim.

3

So we do think that -- moving forward, that

4

no indefinite stay should be permitted.

5

courts move forward, yes, if someone's competency is

6

later restored, there are backstops.

7

certainly in Ohio, can always go back to state court

8

and --

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The person,

And would the backstop be

newly discovered evidence?

11

MS. SCHIMMER:

The backstop would be a newly

12

discovered claim, I would say.

13

what --

14

And when the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think that would be

Ms. Schimmer, if you are

15

right that no stay was appropriate in these

16

circumstances, we would never reach the question of how

17

much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances;

18

isn't that right?

19

MS. SCHIMMER:

I think that's right because

20

I think -- to the extent that, using this case as a

21

springboard, the Court could draw the boundary line --

22

could -- could draw one bright boundary line and say

23

indefinite stays are never permitted, but limited stays

24

might be permitted in cases where the claims are not

25

record based.

I -6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm saying the exact

opposite.

3

MS. SCHIMMER:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Oh.
In other words, if there was

5

one bright line, which says that stays are not

6

appropriate in a record-based claim because there's

7

really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd

8

have no need or cause to reach the second question of

9

what happens, in a case where a stay might be

10

appropriate, how long that stay should be.

11

MS. SCHIMMER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

I'm sorry, I agree -- I agree with you that the Court

13

could rule on that ground.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Alternatively, we could --

15

we could rule that indefinite stays are never

16

appropriate; in which case, it would be unnecessary to

17

decide whether any stay is appropriate where -- for a

18

record-based claim, right?
MS. SCHIMMER:

19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We can do it from either

end.

MS. SCHIMMER:

MS. SCHIMMER:

I suppose, yes.

I mean, we

would -- we would -- we would urge the Court to, I

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Am I -- am I

5

understanding that your position, in response to the

6

question from Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, is

7

that, for you, indefinite is any stay whatsoever?

8
9

It sounds like what you are proposing -- or
in response to them, is that no stay for purposes of

10

determining competence, whether it's short or long, is

11

permissible.

12

Is that your argument?
MS. SCHIMMER:

That is not our argument,

13

Justice Sotomayor.

14

indefinite stay is a stay that is imposed until the

15

prisoner is restored to competence.

16
17

Our -- our definition of an

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Like -- like the stay in

Rees?

MS. SCHIMMER:

Like -- like the stay in

19

Rees, or, really, like the stay the Sixth Circuit has

20

issued.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You would have to -- to

22

maintain your position, the Court would have to qualify

23

Rees, or at least the interpretation that says the stay

24

should be indefinite once the petitioner is found

25

incompetent because that's what has happened there.

Well, Your Honor, we don't

6

guidance in this case.

7

where a prisoner was seeking to abandon his further

8

appeals.

9

That, of course, was a case

There are multiple reasons why we -- why we

10

think that Rees does not endorse the power of Federal

11

courts to indefinitely stay habeas proceedings.

12

One is the fact that the Court's stay order

13

was completely unexplained and very terse.

15

It didn't

Second, the historical record shows that the

16

Court's stay in Rees was, at most, a judicially

17

negotiated settlement, meaning far from a demonstration

18

of the Court's inherent power.

19

carefully orchestrated exercise of consented-to power.

It seemed to be a very

20

The third point is that --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I could take objection

22

to that characterization because the clerk of the court

23

told the court that neither party was happy with what

24

was happening, and the court still entered the order.

of stays?

6

MS. SCHIMMER:

Are you opposing those kinds

For -- not in -- not where

7

it's appropriate, no, Your Honor.

8

Honor, our definition of an indefinite stay is --

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But under your

definition, it's never appropriate, really.

11

MS. SCHIMMER:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.
You argue -- you argue

13

two things.

15

And again, Your

You say, under Pinholster, they -- courts

MS. SCHIMMER:

Correct.

We would -- here's

16

how we would taxonomize the appropriateness of stays:

17

We would say indefinite stays are never permitted,

18

meaning a court can never premise a stay exclusively on

19

the restoration of the prisoner's competency, in saying

20

however long it takes --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even though a doctor

22

says, it can be done, we have to try?

23

MS. SCHIMMER:

If -- if a doctor says, it

24

can be done, we have to try, and it's a situation where

25

it's appropriate -10

They can say --

-- we have to try.


There is a reasonable

Well, they can never


JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We would say,

That -- that's also --

I'm not sure how they can do that until they try.
MS. SCHIMMER:

10

Right.

So we would say, in

11

certain situations, yes, that would be perfectly

12

appropriate.

13

The State of Ohio certainly agrees that

14

having a competent prisoner is a desirable thing in a

15

habeas case and that courts do have some discretion to

16

try to vindicate that goal.

17
18

Our point, though, is simply that it cannot
come at all cost, meaning --

indefinite stay in -- in the absolute sense, was it?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

somebody's competency is the point at which we have

2

returned to the definition of saying that indefinite

3

stays are proper.

4

And the bottom line is that we think that --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it's not an indefinite

6

stay.

I think the judge would do what the Chief Justice

7

suggested, that -- you know, it's not for ever and ever.

8

We're just going to come back to it periodically.

9

if the answer is the same, which is that the client's

10

participation is necessary for a full and fair

11

adjudication, then the court's answer should be the

12

same, too.

But

13

Why isn't that right?
MS. SCHIMMER:

Because we do think that

14

there comes a point, given the finality concerns

15

underlying AEDPA, that a limited stay, when that window

16

expires -- the person has a reasonable period of time to

17

be restored to competency; that when that window

18

expires, at some point, the proceedings do have to

19

continue.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's really -- it's

21

really not the same question when it comes back, is it?

22

Because there are two questions:

23

competence useful for his defense?

24

second question, is there a reasonable probability that

25

he can be restored to competence?

Is -- is reasonable

14

Alderson Reporting Company

But, also, the

1

The first time, there obviously is that, and

2

you give him a year.

3

you say, well, it's been a year, they usually come back

4

within 6 to 9 months, there is no longer a reasonable

5

probability.

6

When you come back a second time,

MS. SCHIMMER:

That's exactly right,

7

Justice Scalia.

And to the extent that we are balancing

8

different parties' interests in these cases, after the

9

preliminary limited stay expires, we believe at that

10

point the prisoner's interest in a continued stay has

11

diminished, and the state's interest in the proceedings

12

continuing and moving forward has then increased, and

13

that the court should then move on.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And there'd be no stay at

15

all, unless it's necessary for just adjudication of the

16

claim, so that would be a threshold question.

17

MS. SCHIMMER:

That would be the threshold

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT MICHELMAN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. MICHELMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

6

Ohio and the United States have agreed today

7

that courts have the authority to stay habeas

8

proceedings when the petitioner is mentally incompetent.

9

So then the questions for this Court are when may such

10

stays issue and how long may such stays be?

11

The Court's answers should reflect the

12

important principle that no individual should lose

13

potentially meritorious claims because of mental

14

illness.

15

I'd like to begin by addressing --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Petitioner says they

17

won't because they can come back with new evidence after

18

habeas is closed.

19

Why is that inadequate?

MR. MICHELMAN:

I -- I think that's --

20

that's a crucial question, Justice Sotomayor, that

21

Justice Kennedy asked as well, and -- and it goes to the

22

limits on second or successive petitions.

23

come back if they are later competent, if they first

24

lose their claims, because they didn't have the evidence

25

they needed and then try again later.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

They can't

Official

1

They are subject to the bar on second or

2

successive petitions, which requires, not only that they

3

have new facts, but also that they have new law.

4

that's a very restrictive standard that would not allow

5

them to simply pick up where they left off.

from picking up where they left off?

petitions.

it.

22

And then he can't simply

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm presume -- I presume

23

that the one claim among your many -- yours is the

24

defendant who was excluded from trial, correct?

25

MR. MICHELMAN:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
17


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that if he comes back

2

and says, I told my attorneys I would behave, and I

3

wanted to come back earlier, and they never let me back

4

in, this would not be a new claim, this would be part of

5

the old claim that has been adjudicated, correct?

6

MR. MICHELMAN:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8
9

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.
But without his

information?
MR. MICHELMAN:

Yes.

And, in fact, the --

10

the record lends some support to this suggestion by

11

showing that counsel frequently put their own safety and

12

their own concerns ahead of my client's interests, for

13

example, stating on the record -- and I'm quoting here

14

from trial counsel -- "I am still worried about him

15

behaving during this phase, so the bottom line is he

16

wants to stay where he is."

17

whether trial counsel was -- was really looking out for

18

Mr. Carter's interests at that time.

So there is a question of

19

There's also the question of whether --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that, you could

21

see from the record.

22

whether he told counsel he would behave, and counsel

23

ignored that information, correct?

24

The question in my mind would be

MR. MICHELMAN:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

There is strong support in the record to suggest that

district courts have a wide amount of discretion in that

a little evidence here, but based on what I think you

I think it is consistent

with AEDPA, Your Honor, because of this Court's recent

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Michelman, we -- we

have established a different standard for the degree of

competence that has to exist in order to prevent

execution, right?

of what is being done and why it's being done.

The -- the prisoner has to be aware

6

MR. MICHELMAN:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's a much lower

8

standard than the standard of competence required for

9

deciding whether he can assist counsel, right?
MR. MICHELMAN:

10
11

It's a different standard,

Justice Scalia.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's -- no, it's a

13

much -- it's a much easier standard for the state to

14

establish.
MR. MICHELMAN:

15

Well, it could be easier in

some cases, but harder than others.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mental -- mental

That's -- that's true,

The test --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

that I'm right about that, okay?

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That there are two

8

standards, and one is really quite more difficult than

the other.

Why isn't the difference between the

10

standards utterly eliminated?

11

a capital case, a habeas petition is filed, and counsel

12

says, my -- my client cannot -- cannot -- cannot assist

13

me.

14

but he may have a new claim, he may be able to tell me

15

stuff, so we have to stay the execution indefinitely

16

until he can assist -- assist me in -- in continuing his

17

defense.

18

Because whenever there is

Oh, yes, he understands why he's being executed,

You've just converted the standard for

proceeding with the execution from an easier one to a

MR. MICHELMAN:

true, Justice Scalia, because the -- the two standards

why we rely on the district courts to do what they do

every day in the trial competency context and adjudicate

14

conflicting claims about a petitioner's mental

competence --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Am I -- am I -- is it

correct that the petitioners in both cases -- pardon me,

18

that the criminal defendants in both cases here, the

22
23
24
25

MR. MICHELMAN:

I don't think you are,

Mr. Carter does not press a Constitutional
argument here, only the argument that a district court's

Alderson Reporting Company

discretion, which the State of Ohio recognizes, to stay

2

habeas proceedings should cover --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But once you concede the

Constitutional point, so that there's no fundamental

5

unfairness, then it seems to me that -- that you have

6

all but given away your case.

MR. MICHELMAN:

Well, I don't think there

needs to be Constitutional unfairness for there to be

unfairness.

MR. MICHELMAN:

16

Well -It's unfairness that's not

fundamental.
MR. MICHELMAN:

I think Martinez v. Ryan is

17

an excellent illustration of that point,

18

Justice Kennedy, because, there, the Court held -- not

19

that there was a Sixth Amendment right to effective

20

assistance of counsel at the habeas stage, but that

21

ineffective assistance on initial review collateral

22

proceedings could provide cause and prejudice to

23

overcome a procedural default, in order that the

petitioner would not lose his claim, and that -- to

25

prevent a situation where no court would hear the claim

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

the value is to wait for the Ford analysis or the Ford

examination to the time of execution?

7

We think there are a few

8

values, Justice Sotomayor.

First of all is that the

10

don't concede that Mr. Carter is Ford incompetent.

11

Those -- that --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

"At all costs" is what

you seem to be saying.

But even if the

implementation of that sentence is ultimately

forestalled by a Ford ruling, that's true in a dignitary
