CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 11-465, Johnson v. Williams.

5

Ms. Brenan.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MS. BRENAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A fairly presented claim has been

11

adjudicated on the merits when a state court issues a

12

decision denying relief unless it has made a plain

13

statement to the contrary.

14

where the state court has grappled with the substance of

15

the alleged error.

And this is especially true

16

And this rule is correct for three reasons:

17

First, state courts discharge their duties.

18

They are sworn to uphold the Constitution.

Therefore,

19

they must adjudicate claims that can -- that allege

20

constitutional violations.

21

a decision denying relief, it must necessarily have

22

considered and rejected all of the claims.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So when a state court issues

What happens when there

24

is a challenge to the admission of evidence on a state

25

law ground on -- on a Confrontation Clause ground, and
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all the state court does is grapple with the evidentiary

2

rule, but it's self evident that the Confrontation

3

Clause is based on a different theory?

4

Are we to assume, in the light of that kind

5

of decision, that the court actually grappled with the

6

Confrontation Clause?

7

MS. BRENAN:

Your Honor, we would assume

8

that there the state court, through its denial of

9

relief, did adjudicate the presented Confrontation

10

Clause -- claim.

And that would be because --

11

for a number of reasons.

12

First, the presumption of regularity that

13

judicial officers do do their job, and it can only be

14

rebutted by clear evidence.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Am I to make that

16

assumption when, before our line of cases in this area,

17

state courts generally had held that if hearsay was

18

admissible under their evidentiary rules, that that was

19

the end of their Confrontation Clause challenge?

20

Is a Federal court supposed to continue with

21

that presumption in light of an undisputed state's

22

statement that their rules are consonant with the

23

Confrontation Clause.

24
25

MS. BRENAN:

In that situation, if the state

court rule is consonant with the Confrontation Clause,
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we would have certainly an adjudication of the

2

Confrontation Clause.

3
4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let's assume it's

not after our -- we render our decision.
MS. BRENAN:

And if it were -- if it were

6

different, we would still hold that in that situation,

7

as this Court -- in relying on Richter, in that

8

situation it would be more of a summary denial on the

9

confrontation analysis.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If one -Well, we can continue and

12

probably should talk about this broad theory that you

13

want us to adopt.

14

Really, in this case, the court of appeals

15

in -- in the state system cited Nesler, and Nesler in

16

turn cited, at page 104 of the petition appendix, a

17

Supreme Court case you don't even -- you say citation,

18

you don't even give -- but it -- it's -- it's the

19

Supreme Court case, United States v. Wood, written by

20

Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.

21

it's very clearly ties its state analysis to the Federal

22

Constitution and a Sixth Amendment discussion in Wood.

23

And it seems to me

So it seems to me that you're -- you have a

24

very strong argument that they did adjudicate the

25

Federal claim anyway.

I know you want us to maybe reach
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the bigger issue, but -- and your brief almost downplays

2

it -- but it seems to me pretty clear that you have the

3

argument, that you don't strongly make, although you

4

don't, by any means, abandon it, that -- that here the

5

state law was tied to the Federal standard, and the

6

Federal standard was the basis for the entire

7

jurisprudence.

8
9

MS. BRENAN:

Yes, Your Honor, we agree that

in our situation it just so happened to be that the

10

state standard also encompassed this Court's Sixth

11

Amendment jurisprudence because it -- it was citing U.S.

12

v. Wood, and it was citing Smith v. Phillips among the

13

-- the Sixth Amendment cases.

14

happens that it does.

In our case, it just so

But we posit also that our case shows why

15
16

this is illustrative as to why this Court should adopt

17

the broader rule that, in situations where a state court

18

has denied relief or a claim has been fairly presented,

19

that this Court and all Federal courts should assume

20

that the state courts did their job by adjudicating

21

claims --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MS. BRENAN:

Irrebuttably?

Your Honor, in -- we have

24

suggested that -- that it can be rebutted by a plain

25

statement, if the state court says that it is not
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reaching it or, more particularly, if a state court

2

imposes a procedural bar.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I see exceptions to that

4

already.

There are cases where the state court reaches

5

one prong of the Strickland standard, has no need to go

6

to the second.

7

MS. BRENAN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10
11

Yes -So you really can't say

in that situation that you can assume they reached the
second, can you?
MS. BRENAN:

Well, Your Honor, I posit that

12

those Strickland cases are different.

13

different because in all of those cases of Wiggins v.

14

Smith and Rompilla, that there the courts -- what the

15

State court did was follow exactly what this Court has

16

said of how a Strickland claim may be answered entirely

17

by only addressing the one prong of Strickland.

18
19
20

And they are

And so there they're doing exactly
adjudicating everything through the analysis of one.
Additionally, in those cases, by doing so,

21

the courts are not in any way suggesting that the State

22

courts failed to do something.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Well, suppose that the -Ms. Brenan, we are

straying pretty far from this case.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

And correct me if

Official

1

I'm wrong, but, as I understand it, the argument was

2

made under State law, and then Williams said there was

3

an abuse of discretion under State law and therefore the

4

Sixth Amendment was violated.
So there really isn't any 


5
6

independent -- Williams hasn't stated any independent 


7

Sixth Amendment right.

8

therefore the Constitution was violated. 


It's State law was violated and 


So it seems to me if we just look at the 


9
10

position that Williams was taking, that these two, the

11

State and the Federal claim, are tied -- tied together.

12

And we don't -- to go beyond this case and imagine some

13

other case that might come before us some day would not

14

be wise.
MS. BRENAN:

15

Yes, Your Honor, I completely

16

agree with the view that here Williams did present a

17

completely dependent Federal claim; and, therefore, the

18

State's analysis -- the State court's analysis would

19

have fully adjudicated that.
However, we suggest that this case does

20
21

illustrate why that broader rule is important.

22

important because, otherwise, other Federal courts may

23

not view it as this Court did, of seeing it as a dependent

24

claim --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
8

Alderson Reporting Company

And it's

The -- the court of

Official

1

appeals, whose decision we're reviewing, understood the

2

Respondent to present a separate State claim and a

3

separate Federal claim, correct?

4

MS. BRENAN:

Exactly.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

to the whole question we have before us, right?

7

MS. BRENAN:

8

So --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the predicate

Exactly, Your Honor.

Let me give you this

10

hypothetical.

11

State court of appeals contains 25 pages of argument on

12

a Federal constitutional claim.

13

claim.

14

arguments.

15

dealt with in two pages.

16

intermediate court of appeals, issues an opinion that

17

addresses only the two State law claims and says nothing

18

about the Federal constitutional claim.

19

The brief filed with an intermediate

Let's say it's a Brady

And then it also has two other claims, two other
They are State law claims, and each one is
And then the State court,

You would say there that -- that it's

20

conclusively presumed that they adjudicated the Federal

21

constitutional claim?

22

MS. BRENAN:

Yes, Your Honor, in that

23

situation we would.

One, because of the presumption of

24

regularity; two, because of what this Court has said in

25

Richter, where we could view it as a summary denial;
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and, third, what underlies that is ­ is the view that

2

if it's not written in the opinion, that it has been ignored.

3

But that's not what this Court said in

4

Castillo, where it said, if a court chooses to ignore in

5

its opinion, which should be read as in its opinion 


6

writing, means that that claim has been impliedly 


7

rejected. 


8

So, therefore, just because a State court 


9

chooses not to write about it in its opinion does not 


10
11

mean that it didn't consider and reject that claim.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is it necessary to go so

12

far as to require a plain statement?

13

protect the same interests if you had a rule that said

14

that there is a presumption that they have adjudicated

15

the claim on the merits, but that it can be rebutted if

16

there is a strong inference that they overlooked it or a

17

very strong inference that they overlooked it.

18

Why wouldn't you

Then you wouldn't have situations like the

19

one that Justice Sotomayor posed in her hypothetical or

20

the one that I just mentioned to you.

21

MS. BRENAN:

Sure, Your Honor, but the

22

reason why there should be a plain statement is because

23

it's long been held that in order to rebut that

24

presumption of regularity, you need clear evidence.

25

And, really, the only clear evidence that one could have

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be a plain statement.

2

And this Court reinforced that when it said

3

in Richter, it talked about an indication or other State

4

procedural bars, and it cited Harris v. Reed.

5

Harris v. Reed is a case that talked about plain

6

statements.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Well, I assume that in --

8

in many cases, especially capital cases, one could argue

9

for years over whether -- whether, in fact, there was

10

enough indication that the court did not consider it or

11

not, right?

12

so to speak.

13

And every year is a reduction of sentence,

MS. BRENAN:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And

14

that's -- that's why having a broader rule with this

15

presumption --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I suppose -- I

17

suppose the broader rule, if you took $28.52 out of the

18

State's judicial budget and bought them all a stamp

19

which just says, we have considered and rejected all

20

constitutional claims, then there would be no problem?

21

MS. BRENAN:

Your Honor, they really do that

22

when they say "affirmed" at the end of the decision.

23

really adds nothing.

24
25

If it were a stamp, it would be merely
reflexive, and therefore would in the end give you no
11

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

1

indication whether an argument had been considered or

2

not.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Any idea based on

4

your experience how many separate claims are typically

5

raised in a capital case of this sort?

6
7

MS. BRENAN:

If -- this was not a capital

case --

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MS. BRENAN:

I'm sorry.

-- but an LWOP case.

However,

10

in a capital case there can be hundreds.

11

hundreds of pages of documents -- or hundreds of pages

12

in an appellant's opening brief, and, therefore, if one

13

were to slip in, in a phrase an apparent claim, and that

14

the State court happens not to --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we -- or

There would be a lot of

16

good debate over whether it was presented clearly

17

enough, is presenting it in two sentences enough to

18

require the court to answer it.

19

you know, a whole train of litigation on this wonderful

20

subject, a whole new area of law.

21

State supreme court overlooked something that was

22

clearly enough presented, and is there enough indication

23

that the State court has overlooked it?

24

that's the problem.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I can see a whole --

Has the -- has the

I mean --

All of the circuit

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts basically have a rule close to the one announced

2

by Justice Alito, don't they?

3
4

MS. BRENAN:

Your Honor, if they happen not

to mention one particular claim?

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All of them have

6

essentially a presumption that's rebutted by some form

7

of evidence, except for perhaps the Eleventh and this

8

circuit that have a clear, almost irrebuttable

9

presumption.

10

I'm sorry.

11

MS. BRENAN:

Not the Ninth, but the Eleventh.
Well, Your Honor -- the

12

Eleventh Circuit and, I believe that, the Sixth Circuit as

13

well.

14
15
16
17
18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it's not as absolute

as the Eleventh.
MS. BRENAN:
has a broader rule.

True that the Eleventh Circuit

And we believe --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have a -- you know, I

19

mean, for every rule you're going to find an exception

20

that abuses it.

21

It's the nature of human nature.

Do you know what the total number of habeas

22

petitions there are and what the percentage that are

23

actually granted?

24
25

MS. BRENAN:

I don't have that figure off

the top of my head, Your Honor.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you be willing to

2

accept that it's -- in relationship to the total

3

granted, it's very, very small?

4

MS. BRENAN:

Yes, I believe that is true,

5

that there is a small number of granting of petitions,

6

yes.

7
8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So whatever the abuse of

the system is, it hasn't halted justice.
MS. BRENAN:

Well, Your Honor, the thing is

10

that -- and I think that Justice Scalia has adverted to

11

this -- is that if we were to -- to require only an

12

indication, it would create a situation where there

13

would be all this litigation.

14

Court, when it does -- has accepted conclusive

15

presumptions in other cases, for example in Coleman v.

16

Thompson, talked about we will accept these conclusive

17

presumptions because they work in almost all of the

18

cases, and we will accept the small number of errors in

19

exchange for the reduction workload.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's why this

So --

Well, why can't they just

21

do what we used to do?

Many district judges do this

22

and -- because there sometimes thousands of

23

petitions of different kinds.

24

attorneys that look them over and flag the arguments,

25

and you put at the end, just to be on the safe side:

A lot go to the staff

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Any other arguments that are made are rejected.

2

right.

3

Now, that serves one purpose.

All

A human being

4

has a hard time writing that unless he's thinking:

5

looked this over pretty carefully.

6

attorney preparing a draft, the staff attorney doesn't

7

want to -- doesn't want to write those words unless he

8

or she has really looked with some care.

9

I've

And if it's a staff

And so it serves a purpose.

It means they

10

don't do it just as a form.

They could turn it into a

11

form, but they shouldn't.

12

that, and therefore if we get nothing then you put into

13

play these presumptions, et cetera.

14

MS. BRENAN:

And so if -- let them write

Justice Breyer, I would

15

disagree with -- with that proposal because it is in the

16

end just -- could become reflexive --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, anything.

Judges can

18

not do their job.

But -- but when you write something

19

like the word "denied," which is all most district

20

judges write in respect to many motions, they read the

21

motion, they think about it, that's their job.

22

So -- so, similarly, a staff attorney or a

23

judge who is going to have to write certain words will

24

want to do his job or her job, and they will do it.

25

So I'm just suggesting that it won't -- that
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

isn't a big deal.

2
3

Now, this case, they didn't write that for
some reason.

4

Many do.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't the -- doesn't the

5

word denied at the end of the order say the same thing?

6

We've considered --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- all of the points made,

9

and we have denied them.
And wouldn't it be the case that if you

10
11

require such a statement, but you have a situation where

12

a Federal question occupies 90 percent of the brief, and

13

the court only addresses explicitly the state things,

14

the state claims, and then at the very end says, we have

15

considered all the other claims, presumably including

16

the 90 percent Federal claims that are not addressed,

17

would we be out of the woods, or would you be here again

18

arguing the same problem?

19

MS. BRENAN:

I think we could be arguing the

20

same problem.

21

inclusion of the word denied, or, if you're affirming a

22

conviction in a direct appeal, the word affirmed covers

23

that.

24

other claims.

25

I think, as Your Honor's noted, that the

It says exactly, we have considered all those

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Brenan, can I ask you
16


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what you mean by a plain statement?

Because you've said

2

a couple of times a plain statement to the contrary.

3

Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have

4

given you hypotheticals, very different from this case,

5

but hypotheticals, where there is, I think, a strong

6

inference that there was no adjudication of the

7

particular Federal claim alleged.

8
9

You said that's not a plain statement, even
though it seems as though there is a strong inference.

10

So what would be a plain statement?

11

MS. BRENAN:

A plain statement would be a

12

procedural bar, or if there were -- a court were to say,

13

we're not, for some reason, going the reach the

14

constitutional claim, that they really need to say it

15

out loud.

16

that's what would be required.

17

I don't know why they would say that, but

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, I don't know why they

18

would say that either.

19

adjudicating this, you know.

20

your test is an irrebuttable presumption.

21

MS. BRENAN:

Well, by the way, we're not
So if that's your test,

No, Your Honor, I would

22

disagree, because there is the possibility of having --

23

having the procedural bar.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

What if -- what if the

brief raises five arguments, and the opinion says the
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appellant has raised four arguments, is that a plain 


2

statement that the fifth -- the fifth argument was 


3

overlooked? 


4

MS. BRENAN:

I would say that it possibly 


5

could be if it were in that situation.

6

would -- I would still go back to -- to really, the

7

Richter presumption of saying that that word at the end,

8

denied, denied is denied is denied, and it covers every

9

fairly presented claim.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10

However, I

That's not a plain

11

statement?

What if there is one Federal claim -- one

12

Federal argument and five state arguments, and the

13

opinion says, this appeal raises only issues of state

14

law, is that a plain statement?
MS. BRENAN:

15

Possibly it could be,

16

Your Honor, but here we don't -- we don't have that

17

situation.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you about the

19

underlying claim here?

It is quite troublesome.

20

think this is a state that doesn't allow an Allen

21

charge; is that right?

22

MS. BRENAN:

Correct.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Correct, Your Honor.

And the possibility of

24

getting rid of the juror, the hold-out juror, in this

25

way is -- is really troublesome.
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The judge can't give an Allen charge to urge

2

the jury to deliberate further, but can say -- now, the

3

judge knows who the hold-out is, and to just dismiss

4

that juror, it is -- it is very troublesome.

5

MS. BRENAN:

Well, Your Honor, the thing is

6

that here we have a trial court who is looking at this

7

juror and makes the determination that the juror is

8

biased.

9

any sort of constitutional violation, it would be to

And, therefore, if there was to be anything of

10

keeping that juror, a biased juror, on the jury.

11

would be a violation of the Sixth Amendment.

That

Well, I have to -- I mean,

this takes us into the merits, which is really

14

interesting, but I -- we probably shouldn't go there,

regularity.

And the fact that the trial judge is upset,

that's the reason that you should leave the jury alone,

it seems to me.

I think it's very troublesome.

MS. BRENAN:

Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a

2

situation where, through the voir dire, what comes out

3

is not that we're trying to get -- that the trial judge

4

is feeling to get rid of this juror because he's the

5

hold-out juror, but it's because through the voir dire

6

he determines that this juror is biased, and that is the

7

bias, and that's what makes it different.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That the person is not

saying of his disagreement or -- that he just really did

13

not believe with the felony murder rule.

14

it's that -- that under any evidence, whatever evidence

15

was presented, that he would not be able to convict

16

because he disagreed with the very basis of the law.

17

It's the bias comes from what he was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Therefore,

That -- that's -- that

18

may be your strongest point, but most of what he said

19

was basically this is a murder case, and the evidence

has to be beyond a reasonable doubt, and I think it has

21

to be clear enough for me to be convinced.

Is that a

That is not a biased juror, but

that's what he said to the court.
But what comes out through the voir dire of

1

the other jurors is not that he was using a reasonable

2

doubt standard, but that he was using a no doubt

3

standard, an absolute doubt standard.

4

And that's where he's not following the law,

5

and that's where he's biased.

6

becomes a biased juror who has no right to be on that

7

jury.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that's where he

I must say that, like

Justice Kennedy, I'm deeply troubled when trial judges
intrude in the deliberative processes of juries.

11

Most of the time when we're assessing bias,

12

we're assessing it on the grounds of extraneous

13

evidence, a juror who has said one thing in voir dire

14

and is now either a convicted felon or introduced

15

extraneous circumstance.

16

But the degree of being convinced is the

17

very essence of jury deliberations.

18

troublesome.

19

MS. BRENAN:

This case is

Well, Your Honor, I believe in

20

this situation it's one where the judge was presented

21

with possible misconduct, and therefore had to do

something.

It was only

3

biased juror.

At that point in time, the Sixth

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I go back, Ms. Brenan,

6

to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I

7

understand what you're arguing now.

8
9

In your brief, you talked about focusing on
the error.

So if evidence was admitted, you would say

10

it doesn't matter that there were three different

11

theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong;

12

you should just look at the fact that we're talking

13

about the admission of evidence.

14

what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the

15

states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you

16

know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and

17

one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel,

18

you would still apply the same rule?

19

MS. BRENAN:

Now, is -- is that

What we're saying is that, at

20

the very least, in our type of situation where -- where

21

the court discusses the alleged error, there is an

22

adjudication on the merits, but that plays into the

23

larger and broader rule.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:
make any sense?

Well, why does your theory

I mean, we're supposed to be
22

Alderson Reporting Company

1

interpreting a statute here that says whether the claim

2

was adjudicated on the merits.

3

claims, we speak of legal grounds for relief.

4

look at a claim and say, we'll just check, you know,

5

what -- we don't use an operative facts test, and you

6

seem to be suggesting that that's the kind of test we

7

should use.

8
9

MS. BRENAN:

Usually when we speak of
We don't

Yes, in -- especially if you're

going to look at the state courts, which are -- must

10

decide both the Federal and state questions.

11

interpretation of what a claim is does not necessarily

12

mean what it eventually becomes when it's in Federal

13

habeas.

14

So their

And the Federal habeas courts are limited by

15

their jurisdiction to only be Federal law theories, and

16

a Federal petitioner can only bring such claims.

17

So, for that reason, it's -- it's not the

18

good fit for the state courts to limit them in that way.

19

And that's why we're saying, at least in a situation

20

where a state court has grappled with the substance of

21

the error, that it has adjudicated the claim, which it

22

could have viewed, as was here, sort of a single claim

23

independent, or it could have state law theories and

24

Federal law theories that it puts together.

And in the red brief

at page 39 I talk about that, and also at page 43 of the

11

that the claim was exhausted.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, again this is

14

fact-specific to the case.

It doesn't address the rule

15

that we want to address and was the reason for us taking

16

the case, but 104a, the State court, State appellate

court, cites the United States v. Wood, and -- and it

18

also cites Cleveland, and Cleveland had three circuit

19

court cases, all of which involved the Sixth Amendment.

20

It seems to me that the Federal

21

constitutional claim was intertwined with and -- and

controlling of the procedural matters that the court

13

MR. HERMANSEN:

If that were the case, then

we would have a different case.

15

California Supreme Court explicitly rejected or declined

16

to adopt the Brown, Symington, Thomas --

20

MR. HERMANSEN:

They were not.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they -- isn't the --

22

isn't the reasonable reading of Cleveland that we're

23

adopting this rule, this is our State rule, it's based

decisions on this issue and we respectfully disagree

3

with their interpretation of the Sixth Amendment.

4

We mention the Federal courts of appeals

MR. HERMANSEN:

Correct.

So if the -- if

5

Cleveland were to come before this Court, then there

6

would be a clear indication from the opinion that they

7

had considered the Federal standard, but didn't adopt

it.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. HERMANSEN:

In this case what happened was -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure how you can

14

State rule is that the State believes that if you remove

15

a juror for actual bias, that that is okay under the

16

Sixth Amendment.

17

presented with the argument in this case by the briefing

18

that the juror was not biased and hence the Sixth

19

Amendment was violated.

20

biased, and I see as a natural, clear inference that

21

they were saying the Sixth Amendment wasn't violated

22

because he was biased.

23

I mean, I think the simplest statement of the

They said it in Cleveland.

Official

1

under Thomas, Symington and Brown --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's a different

question.

4

Supreme Court's Cleveland decision, its assumption that

5

a biased juror violates -- doesn't violate -- the

6

removal of a biased juror doesn't violate the Sixth

7

Amendment, is that an unreasonable application of

8

Supreme Court precedent, not circuit court precedent?

9

That question is whether the California

MR. HERMANSEN:

This gets to the -- my

10

down.

12

into 2254(d)(1) what is contrary to and what is the

13

United States Supreme Court law, but we never get to

14

That's the

So if the claim was not adjudicated on the

23

Instead --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- I'm sorry.

Go ahead.
MR. HERMANSEN:

Instead you look at Brown,

views on the merits of the case have been expressed and
30

Alderson Reporting Company

the juror might be kicked off because of -- which is

2

exactly what happened here -- kicked off because of his

views on the case, then the Sixth Amendment has been

violated.

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What Supreme Court

precedent commands that result?

7

MR. HERMANSEN:

Supreme Court precedent

8

doesn't command it, but because it's de novo review and

9

because -- because it's a quid pro quo.

2254(d),

10

Congress said States are going to get deference and they

11

are going to get a limitation on the law that the

12

Federal courts can look at, the United States Supreme

13

Court law.

14

States to get that deference and limitation on the law,

15

they have to have adjudicated the claim.

that's --

But for that quid pro quo to happen, for the

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The discussion

22

you've been having with Justice Sotomayor and Justice

Alito highlights another problem with your approach, is

24

that the court is going to have to decide in every case

So that's a rare

Normally, just looking at the opinion you can

presumption, because when you have a unexplained order

2

it makes sense that, in that context, that they have

adjudicated everything on the merits.

4

greatest respect to the State courts in comity and

federalism is to look at what the order says, and if

California has made it completely clear in other cases

Whether it's applying a correct

23

I

MR. HERMANSEN:

24

Cleveland -- a careful reading of Cleveland shows that

25

the majority does not adopt the Federal standard.
33

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

the consensus standard in the -- in the Federal circuit

2

courts is that if the merits of --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You're quite right, it does

4

not adopt the consensus standard.

5

rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do

6

that.

7

that it has to follow, it can say, we have a different

8

view of the Sixth Amendment.

9

Justice Alito here said.

10

It specifically

As a state court, with no Supreme Court decision

I'm just repeating what

And that's what it's doing.

It's saying,

11

we're applying the Sixth Amendment, we're applying it

12

differently from the way these other courts have done so

13

because we think they're wrong.

14

MR. HERMANSEN:

And so two points on that.

15

First, is the concurrent chides the majority for not

16

being concerned about the Sixth Amendment.

17

The second is the -- my friend cites People

18

v. Allen with an ellipse and doesn't give the full

19

context of Allen.

20

2006, that talks about how the demonstrable reality

21

test, which is just a notch up above substantial

22

evidence, is designed to protect constitutional rights

23

of due process and Sixth Amendment, what they don't say

24

is in People v. Allen, they only reached the statutory

25

issue, they never reached the constitutional issue.

So when they cite more recent law,

34

Alderson Reporting Company

at most, it's dicta.
And the California Supreme Court has never

held -- has never addressed the issue of when is the

4

Sixth Amendment violated when a juror is kicked off in

this fashion?

6

allow free intrusion into the deliberative process.

7

don't adopt Symington and Brown and Thomas when they say

8

that -- when a juror's views on the merits of the case,

9

questioning should stop.

10
11

And instead, they -- their role is we
We

JUSTICE ALITO:

The -- section 1089 is very

12

broadly worded; isn't that right?

13

being interpreted in Cleveland?

The section that was

14

MR. HERMANSEN:

Section 1089 -- I don't --

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

You think that

16

the California Supreme Court said, we're announcing a

17

rule of state law, and, you know, we've been told that

18

this rule is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment, but

19

we don't care, and we're not even -- we're not going to

20

worry about what the Sixth Amendment requires, we're

21

just going to adopt this rule as state law; do you think

22

that's what they did?

23

MR. HERMANSEN:

In People v. Collins, the

24

California Supreme Court said that 1089 is a rule of

25

efficiency so that courts can efficiently deal with
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

possible juror bias.

2

That hasn't changed.

3

And that -- that's still good law.

So that's why Justice Werdegar, in her

4

concurrence, was saying, we need to be worried about the

5

Sixth Amendment.

6

opinion was it used to be, well, if there's just

7

substantial evidence that the juror is not deliberating

8

as a juror should, she wasn't satisfied that that was

9

sufficient; but, because there had to be a demonstrable

And the only reason she joined in the

10

reality from the record that the juror wasn't

11

deliberating, she signed on in Cleveland.

12
13

And in Cleveland, they reversed under 1089.
And this case should have been reversed under 1089.

14

consist of state law too; but, I mean, how can we say

14

they didn't consider the Federal issue?

15

MR. HERMANSEN:

17

Because Nesler doesn't talk

one iota about kicking off the holdout juror.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, they didn't quote --

Nesler doesn't.

Nesler, they quote the Federal case.

nothing to do with kicking off a holdout juror.

Well, maybe it doesn't.

Maybe they didn't properly -- maybe they didn't properly

25

state what Federal law is.

Everybody has some concerns

about that one.

2

But what I don't see is how when they spend

3

14 out of 27 lines quoting a Federal case which they

4

believe sets the standard for impartiality and

5

partiality you can say that they didn't discuss the

6

Federal issue.

7

MR. HERMANSEN:

You hit the nail right on

8

the head, Justice Breyer, because they are talking about

9

impartiality.

That's all they're talking about.

10

They're looking at a Federal case to see what the

11

definition of impartiality is.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

For Constitutional

13

purposes.

And this guy was kicked off the jury because

14

they thought he was not impartial.
MR. HERMANSEN:

15

The bottom line is they did

16

not apply the Federal rule.

17

that if the juror's views on the merits of the case have

18

been revealed, then the juror should not be kicked off.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the Federal rule is

Well, then your claim over

20

in the Ninth Circuit is not that they didn't consider

21

it, but that, rather, they considered it, but no

22

reasonable juror could reach -- no reasonable jurist

23

could reach the conclusion that they reached on the

24

issue.

25

That argument is open to you.
38

Alderson Reporting Company

The only

Official

1

thing I don't understand is how you're saying -- or

2

everybody -- I must be wrong, because everybody seems to

3

be saying it -- that they didn't reach the Federal issue

4

when they spent 14 lines discussing it, rightly or

5

wrongly.

6

MR. HERMANSEN:

Respectfully,

7

Justice Breyer, they don't -- they're just talking about

8

a definition of one word, of what actual bias is.

9
10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Which happens to be the

issue in this case.
MR. HERMANSEN:

The issue in this case is

12

can you kick off a juror who has expressed 10 or 15

13

times -- and this came out right out of the bat -- the

14

foreperson was called out, asked about some notes and

15

said, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said, I don't

16

think there's sufficient evidence.

17

from whether we look at Federal law to -- for the

18

definition of actual bias.

19

So that's different

My -- I think it's a reasonable position to

20

say that you can't infer from this discussion of Nesler,

21

only talking about what the definition of actual bias

22

is, that the actual Sixth Amendment claim -- and even

23

the trial attorney was arguing in Symington, Your Honor,

24

please don't question these jurors.

25

right out of the box said that Juror No. 6, 10 or 15
39

Alderson Reporting Company

The foreperson,

Official

1

times, has already said that he thinks there isn't 


2

sufficient evidence. 


3

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

Now, what the court 


4

says about that argument, what the court of appeals 


5

says, is that the argument of your client not only

6

misstates the evidence -- that's their -- not you, but

7

they're criticizing -- and then he says, "It ignores the

8

trial court's explanation that it was discharging Juror

9

No. 6 because he had shown himself to be biased."
So this court of appeals thinks the issue is

10
11

whether he had shown sufficient bias.

12

answer to that is clearly no.

13

it's yes.

14

opinion, but I'm back to my question.

You think the

The Government thinks

And I can understand the differences of

It seems to me in 14 lines they do address

15
16

the Federal constitutional question of bias.

17

that's -- that's -- maybe it wasn't the right issue,

18

et cetera, but -- or maybe they didn't decide it

19

correctly.
But you see what's bothering me.

20
21

I've listened to the answer.

22

anything?

23

MR. HERMANSEN:

And

And so

Do you want to add

I would respectfully request

24

that, read -- that reading this whole thing in context,

25

it's clear that the California Court of Appeals is
40

Alderson Reporting Company

1

dealing with 1089.

2

Federal standard that we're grappling with here, which

3

is if a juror's views on the merits of a case have been

4

expressed, can you then interrogate all the jurors --

5

They are not dealing with the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is this -- is this a

6

holding that the Sixth Amendment requires you to keep a

7

biased juror as long as the juror says, I have doubts

8

about the sufficiency of the evidence?

9

MR. HERMANSEN:

10

No.

If there is good

cause --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, answer my question.

12

Does the Sixth Amendment require you to keep a biased

13

juror?

14

MR. HERMANSEN:

No.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So, if the

16

Sixth Amendment doesn't require you to keep a biased

17

juror, then why is it that the state court's finding

18

that this juror was biased a Sixth Amendment holding,

19

that it wasn't violated because the juror was biased?

20

The logic is almost inescapable to me.

21

MR. HERMANSEN:

Yeah, right.

So for a

22

minute we'll get into the issue that wasn't certified,

23

but what happened in this case was the judge -- the

24

Ninth Circuit found that the finding of bias wasn't good

25

cause under the Federal standard because the -41

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

find the juror was biased?

3

MR. HERMANSEN:

Did the California court

Yes.

Because he was

4

applying too high of a standard because he said very

5

convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, and there was a

6

quibble about what does the word very add to beyond a

7

reasonable doubt.

8

responded that very convinced beyond a reasonable doubt

9

is the same as convinced beyond a reasonable doubt.
And so that doesn't show bias when

11

And the jury very eloquently

someone --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

That was one of the things.

13

Then they go through in those four pages about six

14

other -- they called -- he gave one story to the judge,

15

Juror No. 6.

16

Then the prosecution calls about eight other

17

jurors, and they come up with quite a different story

18

about what he was telling them in the jury room and --

19

that I'm not going to convict him.

20

quite say that; he was talking about Vietnam and talking

21

about the slaves, and you don't want to convict a person

22

for -- make him return the slave.

23

Well, he didn't

I mean, they talked about a lot of things.

24

And he went through all that, and then concludes he was

25

biased.

And your point was he wasn't biased.
42

Alderson Reporting Company

He was

Official

1

going to decide it fairly.

2

Okay, I'm listening.

3

MR. HERMANSEN:

But the threshold issue is

4

when the foreperson, at the very, very, very beginning,

5

says, Juror No. 6, 10 or 15 times has said he doesn't

6

think there is sufficient evidence, all questioning

7

should have stopped at that point, because there was no

8

indication of bias.

9

But -- and how do we know that there --

10

there's a possibility that he's being kicked off because

11

of his views on the merits of the case?

12

because the prosecutor filed a motion saying, let's

13

reopen questioning.

14

okay, yeah, let's reopen questioning.

15

We know that

And that -- then the judge said,

But the foreman had already said, I think

16

your response to the jury note has satisfied that; I

17

think it will be fine.

18

motion to reopen because the prosecutor knew that this

19

juror had reasonable doubts.

20

Yet, the prosecutor filed a

And so that's why there's clear evidence in

21

this case that the motion to dismiss the juror was based

22

on the juror's views on the merits of the case.

23
24
25

And -- and, also, this is not a capital
case, it's just a -- an LWOP case.
And if there are no further questions, thank

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ms. Brenan, you have four minutes remaining.

4

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHANIE BRENAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MS. BRENAN:

7

I would just like to make about four points.

8

First, my friend discussed the case of Smith

9

v. Digmon.

Thank you.

And I think I would like to point this Court

10

to the words that were used in Smith v. Digmon, which is

11

where the state court chooses to ignore in its opinion.

12

And as this Court later said in Castille talking about

13

that, that's an implicit rejection.

14

So, really, the way it should be interpreted

15

is, if a state court fails to mention in its opinion

16

writing, it's implicitly rejected, not that it's been

17

ignored.

18

Secondly, I'd just like to agree that, yes,

19

California believes that 1089 is Constitutional under

20

the Sixth Amendment.

21

Miller v. Stagner said that it was facially

22

constitutional.

23

And, in fact, the Ninth Circuit in

Third, I would just like to agree with

24

Justice Sotomayor that here, where the trial court made

25

the finding of bias, that answered the Sixth Amendment
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

question.
The entire argument below and throughout was

3

a disagreement as to whether the juror was biased, or

4

was he just having -- harboring doubts about the

5

sufficiency of the evidence.

6

counter-arguments.

Those were the

7

The trial court, by making the determination

8

that there was bias, necessarily answered that question.

9

Secondly, as to that point, I would just

10

like to also point this Court to the language in People

11

v. Cleveland that talks about agreeing with Thomas, and

12

Brown, and Symington that you cannot dismiss a juror

13

based on his views of the evidence.

14

P.3d at page -- 1236.

And that's at 21

15

So it couldn't have -- in order to have good

16

cause in California, you couldn't have gotten rid of him

17

for his views of the evidence.

18

Finally, I'd just like to say that

19

Mr. Chief Justice is correct that this would increase

20

the litigation.

21

courts all the time trying to decide whether there was a

22

sufficient indication or not by deciding whether state

23

law is coterminous with Federal law.

24
25

We would have courts, Federal habeas
