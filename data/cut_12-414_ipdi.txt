 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

argument next in Case 12414, Burt v. Titlow. 

5

 Mr. Bursch. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 

7

10

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. BURSCH: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 No court has ever held that AEDPA and 

11

Strickland can be satisfied by presumption based on a 

12

silent record.  Yet that is precisely the approach the 

13

Sixth Circuit adopted in granting habeas relief here. 

14

 The record doesn't say how attorney Toca 

15

investigated or what advice attorney Toca gave, but 

16

based on that record silence, the Sixth Circuit assumed 

17

Toca was ineffective.  And under AEDPA and Strickland, 

18

the presumptions run the opposite way. 

19

 Now, if there's one thing that the Court 

20

takes away from the oral argument this morning, I hope 

21

that it's  it's this:  How upside down the Sixth 

22

Circuit's analysis is when it says, on page 19A of the 

23

petition appendix, that Toca was deficient because the 

24

record contains no evidence that he advised Titlow about 

25

elements, evidence, or sentencing exposure.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The correct question is whether the record 

2

contains evidence that Toca did not do those things. 

3

And that record silence is dispositive in favor of the 

4

State on habeas review. 

5

 Now, if we could pull the curtain back and 

6

see what really happened here, it may be the case that 

7

Toca gave the proper advice, that he advised Titlow 

8

about all the perils of going to trial, and that Titlow 

9

continued to maintain her innocence. 

10

 Under Strickland, we're supposed to presume 

11

that Toca did exactly that, especially when it's 

12

Titlow's burden to satisfy the burden of proof, and she 

13

failed to do that. 

14

 So I'd like to begin with our first issue, 

15

which is AEDPA deference and the performance prong of 

16

Strickland. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

May I just ask a question 

18

about what you just said?  The record does show that 

19

Toca came into the case very late in the day, and he 

20

asked to have a postponement because he said, I have to 

21

get up to speed.  I don't know anything about this case. 

22

 So Toca, himself, is saying, I'm not 

23

acquainted with the case  with the case. 

24
25

 MR. BURSCH: 

Well, I don't think he's 

he's saying that, Justice Ginsburg.  He's saying I'm not

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prepared for trial yet, but he says, I've got a lot of 

2

materials here.  He goes through a very sophisticated 

3

sentencing analysis with the  the sentencing court in 

4

this plea withdrawal hearing. 

5

 If you understand Michigan sentencing, if 

6

you've got a manslaughter charge, there's a grid.  And 

7

there's all kinds of different boxes that this could 

8

have fit into, and he would have had to have analyzed 

9

the evidence in order to determine that the two to five 

10

range was appropriate for a manslaughter conviction and 

11

to be able to then negotiate with the prosecutor about 

12

whether that was or was not appropriate. 

13
14
15

 And so we know that  that Toca did a lot 
of work. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Was  was the sentence that 

16

was ultimately imposed after the trial for the 

17

seconddegree murder conviction within the guidelines 

18

within the Michigan guidelines? 

19

 MR. BURSCH: 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, it was. 

21

those guidelines were? 

22

 MR. BURSCH: 

What  do you know what 

I don't recall, but it's 

23

something on the range of 15 to 20 years.  And when 

24

we're talking about guidelines, it's important for the 

25

Court to understand the difference between what the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

guidelines called for, for manslaughter, and what was in 

2

the plea agreement because Michigan's got this 

3

indeterminate sentencing system, where you've got a 

4

range for the lower end. 

5

 And so the plea deal was 7 to 15 years on 

6

the lower end.  And a manslaughter conviction  that 

7

is, if they had gone to trial and lost for manslaughter, 

8

the lower end was 2 years to 5 years. 

9

 And so it was entirely reasonable, from an 

10

objective perspective, for an attorney, looking at this 

11

record, at the time the plea was withdrawn, to say, yes, 

12

if you want to maintain your innocence, the most likely 

13

bad result at trial is most likely better than the plea 

14

deal that you already have. 

15

 Sure, there's a risk that something worse 

16

could happen, but this Court has said in Strickland and 

17

Lafler and other places that bad predictions are not 

18

deficient performance. 

19

 And so, really, when you get down to it, 

20

it's really a problem with both the advice being 

21

reasonable, but also the failure to carry the burden of 

22

proof.  It's just the case that Titlow has not come 

23

forward to demonstrate, as he was required to do  she 

24

was required to do, on the record, what Titlow  or 

25

what Toca did to investigate and what advice Toca

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

actually gave to Titlow. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

When we're asking whether 

3

the advice was reasonable, what force do we give to the 

4

proposition that a wellcounselled defendant was now 

5

insisting that he wanted to change his plea?  And there 

6

was only three days.  How do we ­ how do we factor that in?  If 

7

if we look  just at what the counsel did 

8

 MR. BURSCH: 

9

important factor. 

10

Right.  I think that's an 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 it may lead us to one 

11

answer.  But if we know that a previously 

12

wellcounselled defendant had now changed his mind and 

13

wanted to withdraw, how do we factor that in? 

14

 MR. BURSCH: 

I think that's a significant 

15

factor because, as you point out, before the ink was 

16

even dry on the plea agreement, Titlow was already in 

17

prison saying, I'm innocent, maybe I should be 

18

withdrawing this plea, setting in motion a chain of 

19

events that resulted in her firing the first attorney 

20

and then hiring a second attorney. 

21

 And I don't think that the court of 

22

appeals  the Michigan Court of Appeals, articulated 

23

any kind of a  a per se rule about that  you know, 

24

certainly, we all understand that the ethical obligation 

25

of the lawyer is that, if your client insists that they

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

want to maintain their innocence, you have to allow them 

2

to do that. 

3

 But what the court of appeals did, at pages 

4

100 to 101A of the petition appendix, it looked at that, 

5

but it also looked at the other evidence.  It looked at 

6

the Strickland presumption that Toca did his job.  And 

7

then it says, at the very conclusion of that sentence, 

8

based on all the proofs and arguments presented, Titlow 

9

failed to satisfy her burden.  This instance is one part 

10
11

of that. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could you  could you 

12

explain the procedural situation before the Michigan 

13

Court of Appeals?  There was a motion by the Respondent 

14

for a remand to the trial court to create a record; is 

15

that  that correct 

16

 MR. BURSCH: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

18
19

That's correct. 
 on the issue of 

ineffective assistance of counsel? 
 And so the  the question that the court of 

20

appeals had to decide was whether the materials that 

21

were submitted by the Respondent were sufficient to 

22

justify the hearing. 

23

 MR. BURSCH: 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

That's correct. 
And the court of appeals, I 

gather, said they're not sufficient and cited, among

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other things or principally, the fact that the 

2

Respondent had claimed innocence, and that was the 

3

reason for the  the change of attorney. 

4

 So the issue really wasn't  that was 

5

before them was really not entitlement to relief, but in 

6

the course of deciding whether there should be a remand, 

7

they necessarily got to the issue of whether there was 

8

an entitlement to relief. 

9
10
11

 Is that  is that correct? 

Or do I not 

understand? 
 MR. BURSCH: 

Just to be clear about Michigan 

12

procedure, the defendant has an opportunity to ask for 

13

what's called a Ginther hearing in Michigan, and that's 

14

this evidentiary hearing to develop a record for an 

15

ineffective assistance claim. 

16

 Titlow did not ask for that hearing in the 

17

trial court.  She did ask for it in the  the Michigan 

18

Court of Appeals.  But under the Michigan court rules 

19

this is 7.211(C)(1)(a)(2)  she was required to make a 

20

proffer to justify that hearing on this motion to 

21

remand. 

22

 And so the court of appeals, before it 

23

issued its merits opinion, issues a onesentence order 

24

that says, that motion to remand is denied because you 

25

have not proffered enough evidence to demonstrate that a

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

hearing is warranted. 
 And that makes sense because the only 

3

proffer was the polygraph, the Lustig affidavit, and the 

4

Pierson affidavit.  You know, it would be entirely 

5

appropriate  this often happens  that Titlow herself 

6

would have submitted an affidavit saying, this is what 

7

Titlow knew  or I'm sorry, this is what Toca knew, 

8

this is what Toca advised, and I relied on that. 

9

 Or it sometimes is even the case, that the 

10

previous defense counsel is willing to submit the 

11

affidavit that says, this is what I knew, this is the 

12

advice that I gave.  None of that was there.  And so 

13

that's why you have this denial of the motion. 

14

 So now, in the context of that record and, 

15

Justice Kennedy, the claim of innocence and this whole 

16

thing being set in motion by that claim of innocence, it 

17

was quite easy for the Michigan Court of Appeals to say 

18

that, on the proofs presented and in light of the 

19

Strickland presumption, there was nothing objectively 

20

unreasonable about allowing Titlow to recall her plea. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

In just thinking about that 

22

Michigan Court of Appeals decision, there is one sort of 

23

troubling line in it to me.  It says, "When a defendant 

24

proclaims his innocence, it is not objectively 

25

unreasonable to recommend that the defendant refrain

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

from pleading guilty no matter how good the deal may 

2

appear." 

3

 And one way to read this is it's a kind of 

4

categorical rule, which says that, when the defendant 

5

says he is innocent, basically your obligations to 

6

properly advise him about a plea, go away.  Now, I 

7

understand you not to read it that way. 

8

 MR. BURSCH: 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Correct. 
So could you tell me a 

10

little bit about what you think of that question and why 

11

you read the sentence the way you read the sentence? 

12

 MR. BURSCH: 

Yes.  I think it would be very 

13

difficult to defend the opinion if that was the only 

14

sentence of analysis because we do not agree that a 

15

simple claim of innocence by your client relieves the 

16

attorney of any responsibility to do anything.  That's 

17

not what happened here. 

18

 Four sentences before the sentence you just 

19

read on page 101A, the court of appeals talks about the 

20

Strickland presumption that the attorney is doing his or 

21

her job.  Two sentences after that sentence you just 

22

read, on page 102A, the Michigan Court of Appeals 

23

specifically says, "On the proofs and arguments offered 

24

by defendant, there is no ineffective assistance here." 

25

 And so that was part of a larger discussion

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about attorneys who do their job when their clients are 

2

claiming innocence.  And you have to put all that 

3

together. 

4

 And I think it's significant, also, that the 

5

Michigan Court of Appeals was giving Titlow the benefit 

6

of the doubt here because, on page 100A, just one page 

7

earlier, it assumes Titlow's position, that is that Toca 

8

actually gave the advice to withdraw the plea.  We don't 

9

even know that because we don't have credible evidence 

10
11

in this record. 
 We don't have an affidavit from Titlow. 

We 

12

don't have an affidavit from Toca that indicates that 

13

Toca ever gave that advice.  Again, if you could draw 

14

the curtain back, it may very well have been, as we 

15

assume under Strickland, that he totally and completely 

16

advised about all the risks of trial before the plea was 

17

withdrawn. 

18
19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you clarify something 

for me about habeas corpus law? 

20

 MR. BURSCH: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
I  I have to imagine the 

22

facts, so let's take it as a hypothetical.  That  The U.S. 

23

the district attorney says, this lawyer was adequate, 

24

and really, two factors make that obvious.  The first 

25

factor is that the client said that she was innocent,

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and taking that into account with the other things, that 

2

could have justified, adequately, his withdrawal of the 

3

plea and not convincing her not to. 

4

 Second, the sentence that the district 

5

attorney wanted to give was more than a year greater 

6

than the guidelines for manslaughter, and that could 

7

have justified it. 

8

 Now, it writes  the court then writes in 

9

its opinion only the second reason and never mentions 

10

the first.  Now, we go to habeas, and the habeas court 

11

thinks that second reason is pretty flimsy there.  Gee, 

12

she was exposing herself to murder, et cetera, it's 

13

pretty flimsy.  The first isn't so bad, but they didn't 

14

rely on it.  Okay. 

15

 So now, what is the habeas court supposed to 

16

do?  Is  should the  should the defendant have gone 

17

back to the State court first?  Is the habeas court 

18

supposed to have its own independent hearing and make up 

19

its own mind? 

20

 How does this work? 

21

 MR. BURSCH: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

 know the answer. 

24

 MR. BURSCH: 

25

That's a delightful question. 
I'm glad.  I would love to 

And I want to start with a 

record response to distinguish our case from your

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

hypothetical and then address the habeas question.  Your 

2

hypothetical assumed that the State court only mentioned 

3

one of the two reasons, and here, obviously, the court 

4

of appeals talked about innocence.  We've discussed that 

5

at length. 

6

 But on page 100A of the opinion, the court 

7

of appeals also notes that the defendant moved to 

8

withdraw her plea because the agreedupon sentence 

9

exceeded the sentencing guidelines range.  So they are 

10

both here. 

11

 But assuming your hypothetical that we only 

12

had one and not two, the question is really easy under 

13

2254 because, so long as the decision was not a 

14

misapplication of this Court's clearly established 

15

precedent, there is no violation, even if their 

16

reasoning might not have been as strong as it could have 

17

been, had they mentioned the other reason. 

18

 So next habeas question, does the defendant 

19

get an opportunity to have a Federal habeas hearing to 

20

further develop the record about what happened?  And the 

21

answer is no, because under 2254(e)(1) and (e)(2), there 

22

is a presumption of correctness about everything that 

23

was found in the State court system. 

24
25

 And there is no right to get a Federal 
evidentiary hearing if you have not adequately pursued

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

your ability to develop the record in the State court. 
 And as Justice Alito has already pointed 

3

out, it was Titlow's failure, not the State's failure, 

4

to properly proffer evidence to get the Ginther hearing. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you make of the fact 

6

that  what do you make of the fact that, at the change 

7

of plea hearing, the first attorney didn't mention the 

8

claim of innocence, only mentioned the fact that the 

9

sentence was above the guidelines? 

10

 MR. BURSCH: 

I don't think that's 

11

significant because those two things are not mutually 

12

exclusive.  The defendant could believe, in her heart of 

13

hearts, that she's innocent, and at the same time, the 

14

attorney could acknowledge that there are facts in the 

15

record already admitted that a reasonable jury could 

16

conclude that you were guilty of manslaughter. 

17

 And so it would not be inconsistent for that 

18

attorney to argue for a lower guidelines range in the 

19

plea, and so there's really nothing inconsistent about 

20

that.  But the important thing to understand here is 

21

just the failure of the burden of proof.  The Sixth 

22

Circuit is upsidedown when it reads into the record's 

23

silence ineffective assistance. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

When you say the record 

is silence  silent, I am looking at the Joint

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Appendix, page 295, and this is Titlow's statement.  "I 

2

would have testified against my aunt...had I not been 

3

persuaded to withdraw my plea agreement because an 

4

attorney promised me he would represent me.  He told me 

5

he could take my case to trial and win." 

6

 So that sounds like she was persuaded by 

7

Mr. Toca to go to trial because she could win.  And he 

8

had, at that point, not made any appraisal of the case. 

9

 MR. BURSCH: 

Well, first, I have to disagree 

10

with the premise of your question, Justice Ginsburg, 

11

because there is no doubt that Toca made an appraisal. 

12

He had  you know, the quote from the plea withdrawal 

13

hearing is "a lot of materials," and he made a very 

14

sophisticated argument about what the guidelines range 

15

should be, and that range was lower than the plea 

16

actually offered. 

17

 But what you need to understand about this 

18

testimony from Titlow right here, this was a plea for 

19

leniency at sentencing.  This was not part of the 

20

proffer to the Michigan Court of Appeals as part of the 

21

motion for remand.  What  what Titlow could have done 

22

was submit her own affidavit or the affidavit from Toca 

23

establishing whether this was actually true or not. 

24

 In addition, you've got to take the context 

25

of this and juxtapose it against the other things that

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Titlow was saying at this very same sentencing hearing. 

2

And it  it's remarkable, really, that she says both of 

3

these things. 

4

 She says she feels sorry for her Aunt Billie 

5

for being this manipulating and evil person and thanks 

6

God that she did not do what Billie asked her to do. 

7

And she says it was only because of her, Titlow, that 

8

the truth came out.  So somehow, it's  it's still a 

9

claim of innocence, even after trial, even after there 

10
11
12

has been a conviction. 
 If there are no further questions, I will 
reserve the balance of my time. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

 Ms. O'Connell. 

15

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL, 

16
17

Thank you, counsel. 

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 

18

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

19

it please the Court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

20

 There are two primary points that the United 

21

States would like to make.  First, when evaluating 

22

Strickland prejudice in the context of a rejected plea 

23

offer, the statement of a convicted defendant that she 

24

would have accepted the plea absent deficient advice 

25

should be viewed with skepticism, and to support a

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

finding of causation, the statement should be judged 

2

based on all the objective circumstances. 

3

 Second, when a Federal habeas court finds a 

4

Sixth Amendment violation in the rejected plea context, 

5

it should not categorically require the government to 

6

reoffer a rejected plea deal.  That decision should be 

7

left to the sentencing court, and requiring the 

8

government to reoffer a rejected plea deal in a context 

9

like this case where the plea agreement required the 

10

defendant to do something other than plead guilty 

11

give testimony against her aunt  it doesn't make 

12

sense, and the government should not be required to make 

13

the reoffer. 

14

 Every defendant who rejects a plea offer and 

15

then is convicted after a trial will have an incentive 

16

and will want to revert back to a plea deal that she

rejected beforehand.  The statement of a convicted

defendant that she would not have withdrawn her plea

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, years ago, one 

20

of my colleagues, not on this bench, but a different 

21

one, said to me  you know, there's much todo about 

22

judges basing credibility on demeanor.  And he said, no 

23

one does that.  What you base it on is the internal 

24

consistency and logic of the testimony and how it's 

25

corroborated by circumstances.

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And he said, otherwise, you just rarely hear 

2

anybody say, story makes sense, nothing corrupt story doesn't 

3

make sense, the story's not corroborated, but the guy 

4

looks like he's telling the truth. 

5

 I'm reading all the decisions that you cited 

6

for me and not one, including in this circuit, relies 

7

simply on that kind of statement.  Every one of them is 

8

based on comparing the testimony to other factors; to 

9

logic, to evidence, to objectives. 

10

 So I don't know what rule it is, what 

11

objective evidence means.  Do you need corroboration the 

12

way you need to prove a murder?  Is that what you want 

13

us to announce? 

14

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

I don't  we're not asking 

15

for any kind of a special rule that there has to 

16

be  you know, a certain amount of corroborating 

17

evidence in addition to the defendant's statement.  I do 

18

think it is just a general rule that you have to expand 

19

out to all the objective circumstances to evaluate the 

20

credibility of the defendant. 

21

 And what the Sixth Circuit said in this case 

22

is, unlike some circuits, this court does not require 

23

that a defendant must support his own assertion that he 

24

would have accepted the offer with additional objective 

25

evidence.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It said it, but it 

didn't do it. 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, to the extent that the 

4

court was saying that the defendant's statement should 

5

be credited or not credited alone, without necessarily 

6

looking at everything, that's wrong.  And to the extent 

7

that it  that it looked to other evidence in the 

8

record and to corroborating circumstances, the ones that 

9

it pointed to were too weak, and they were also very 

10
11
12
13

selective. 
 The court pointed to two things that the 
court 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, counselor, that's 

14

what juries do all the time, selectivity.  That doesn't 

15

move me.  What I want to know is, why do we announce a 

16

rule that, somehow, suggests a limitation that can't 

17

exist?  Meaning what judges look to, to determine 

18

credibility relies on factors that you can't sum up in 

19

one word? 

20

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

All we're asking the Court 

21

to announce or to clarify on this question is that the 

22

subjective statement  or the selfserving statement of 

23

a defendant in these circumstances should be viewed 

24

with skepticism and that the court should look 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Every court says that.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, to the  there could 

2

be confusion on what the Sixth Circuit's rule is.  I 

3

mean, there is  the Sixth Circuit believed that it was 

4

announcing a rule or that it has a standard 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, are there rules in 

6

this area?  I didn't think  are there rules?  I mean, 

7

doesn't every judge, whenever that judge is deciding a 

8

factual matter or the jury, take into account from every 

9

witness, whether that witness is making a pretty 

10
11

selfserving statement?  I mean, that's a factor. 
 And I guess we could have some situations, 

12

sometime, in some place, where a witness got on the 

13

stand and said something that was totally in his favor, 

14

but when you heard it, hmm, and you knew the case, hmm, 

15

he's right.  And then that could happen with this kind 

16

of witness, too.  It could happen.  I'm not saying it 

17

very often does, but it could. 

18
19
20

 So why should we have any special rule for 
these witnesses and not for any other? 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

We are not asking for any 

21

kind of a special rule.  We are just asking that  that 

22

the Court clarify, if it addresses the second question, 

23

that what the Sixth Circuit is saying, that you 

24

essentially  if you interpret it to mean that you 

25

don't have to look out to all the  the objective

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

circumstances to determine the credibility of the 

2

defendant, that that's wrong. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you need to 

4

give us some examples of things that don't count.  I 

5

thought it was in your brief that you had said, look, 

6

the fact that it turns out to have been a very bad 

7

deal  you know, the bargain was one year, and the 

8

sentence after guilty was 20 years, that, I take it, you 

9

say is not a corroborating factor. 

10

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Not in this case.  The 

11

the disparity between the sentence that a person 

12

receives after the plea deal and the sentence that they 

13

received after a trial is going to be present in every 

14

case. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Right. 

In fact, it has to be for 

17

prejudice.  That could be a corroborating circumstance 

18

or something to support the defendant's statement in a 

19

case where, like some of the court of appeals' opinions, 

20

the defendant was misadvised on sentencing exposure. 

21

The lawyer said, well, you should reject this plea deal 

22

for 15 years because the maximum that you could get at 

23

trial is 20, and so it's worth the risk. 

24

 But this defendant understood completely and 

25

said multiple times, on the record, that she understood

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the  the potential sentence for a murder 

2

conviction was a life sentence and that that was back on 

3

the table, if she withdrew the plea offer. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

On the question of this 

5

of this sentence, what do you think were the  the 

6

range of reasonable sentences that could have been 

7

imposed in compliance with our recent decisions? 

8

 You have  you have the sentence that was 

9

offered before the trial, but that was predicated on, A, 

10

testimony and, B, not having to go to trial.  And then 

11

you have the sentence that was imposed after the trial, 

12

when there was no testimony and there was a trial. 

13

 So what was the  what do you think a trial 

14

court could reasonably do in that situation, just split 

15

the difference? 

16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, I think the trial 

17

court has a lot of discretion under the Court's opinion, 

18

but I think what  what should have happened in this 

19

circumstance is to go back to the sentencing court, not 

20

require the government to reoffer this plea deal, which 

21

just simply can't be  can't be offered and accepted 

22

anymore. 

23

 In fact, in the record, when you see it 

24

being reoffered, they're saying we're offering 

25

manslaughter in exchange for her testimony at a trial

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that already happened.  It doesn't make sense. 

2

 In this case, there  there should be no 

3

reoffer.  We should go based on the conviction after 

4

trial because of that, and perhaps there could be some 

5

kind of a reduction of the sentence within the district 

6

court's discretion to 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why  why  you made 

8

the point that this plea bargain could not be carried 

9

out once the number one condition, the prosecutor said, 

10

you testify against your aunt, and then we'll give you 

11

this deal.  Once the aunt is tried and she doesn't 

12

testify, there's no  there's no plea bargain. 

13

 So why isn't that enough to decide this 

14

case?  If you can't tell a prosecutor to renew a bargain 

15

that can't be carried out, then it's become impossible. 

16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, I mean, we think 

17

that's right.  I don't know that it makes sense to say 

18

that, because there is no remedy, that the Court 

19

shouldn't address the first or second questions. 

20

 I mean, maybe if the Court thinks that 

21

there's  there's definitely no remedy and that this 

22

20 to 40year sentence should remain in place, but 

23

but, exactly, we don't think that the  that the 

24

government should be required to reoffer the plea 

25

agreement in these circumstances.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But we're in a position now, 

2

aren't we, where the State court can do exactly that, 

3

can say the circumstances have changed and  and so 

4

leave everything undisturbed. 

5

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Yes.  The problem  one of 

6

the problems here is that the Sixth Circuit sort of 

7

took, as a given, that in circumstances like this, that 

8

the  the original plea offer has to be reoffered.  And 

9

what we think the court was saying in Lafler is that 

10
11

that's one thing that's on the table. 
 It's not necessarily required in every case. 

12

There could be other creative remedies, like there could 

13

be a defendant who can no longer  who missed the 

14

opportunity to give the testimony she was supposed to 

15

give, but perhaps she has information on somebody else, 

16

and so maybe we could do a renegotiation of the plea. 

17

 The Sixth Circuit, we do not think, should 

18

be just requiring after it finds a Sixth Amendment 

19

violation that the government reoffer a plea agreement 

20

in circumstances that are different from those in 

21

Lafler. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But isn't that  I 

23

mean, the court didn't say that the court  that the 

24

court below  the Sixth Circuit didn't say that the 

25

court below had to accept the reoffered plea agreement.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It seemed inherent in Lafler and Frye that 

2

what the Court was saying is that the court below has to 

3

use its judgment on whether offer  accepting the plea 

4

is  is right or giving another remedy is right.  All 

5

of these arguments should be before that court, not 

6

before us, as an absolute rule. 

7

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

That's right.  And  and we 

8

simply think that the decision whether to require the 

9

government to reoffer it in the first place should also 

10
11

be something that's left up to the sentencing court 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So that's your only 

12

point, which is that that should be an issue for the 

13

court below? 

14

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Yes.  That this should all be 

15

left to the discretion  discretion of the sentencing 

16

court to come up with an adequate remedy.

But some remedy has to 

Well 
 if there is a 

violation. 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

The  the Court's opinion 

23

in Lafler, I think, leaves that question open.  It says 

24

that it could be the circumstances that the sentencing 

25

judge determines that the most fair result is to leave

26

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF VALERIE R. NEWMAN 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

8

 MS. NEWMAN: 

9

please the Court: 

10

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 There is no question that the Michigan Court 

11

of Appeals erred and created an endrun around 

12

Strickland in finding the professed  that if a 

13

defendant professes innocence, that there's no need to 

14

look any further to say that defense counsel provided 

15

effective assistance. 

16

 There is also 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I agree with you  I 

18

agree with you and so does your adversary, but he says 

19

there is nothing in this record to show what research 

20

was done or not done. 

21

 The fact that the prior counsel's record 

22

wasn't reviewed doesn't say that he didn't talk to the 

23

prosecutor, doesn't say that he didn't look into other 

24

record evidence, any of the discovery that had been 

25

filed with the court, or any of the other circumstances

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that could have informed him adequately. 
 MS. NEWMAN: 

That is partially true, Justice 

3

Sotomayor.  The record does show that, at every turn, 

4

when Mr. Toca stepped into the courtroom, he asked for 

5

more time and indicated he wasn't ready.  The record 

6

does show that, as soon as the plea was withdrawn, 

7

Mr. Toca said, I need more time.  I'm not ready to go to 

8

trial.  And in all fairness, my  my client deserves to 

9

have a fair trial.  I'm not ready. 

10

 He's not ready to go to trial. 

He doesn't 

11

have a good handle on what the record is.  My brother 

12

counsel makes an argument that Mr. Toca made a very 

13

sophisticated sentencing analysis and, therefore, had a 

14

grasp of the record.  I would disagree with that 

15

interpretation of the record. 

16

 Mr. Toca came in and said that the 

17

guidelines were two to five on the minimum sentence. 

18

The prosecutor said, I don't know what the guidelines 

19

are, and I don't care.  There's  we don't even know if 

20

his recitation of what the guidelines range was, was 

21

accurate, so there is nothing on this record to show 

22

that Mr. Toca even knew anything about the 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

Well, that's 
Are you arguing that he 

he needed to be  he needed to have enough material and

28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

to have familiarized himself enough with everything 

2

that's relevant to the case to be able to go to trial 

3

before he could move to have the  the previous plea 

4

withdrawn? 

5
6
7
8
9

 MS. NEWMAN: 

No, my argument does not go 

that far.  What I'm arguing 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Well, then I 

don't understand what the argument was. 
 MS. NEWMAN: 

The argument is that defense 

10

counsel has a duty to investigate, that the defense 

11

attorney has a duty to be able to inform the client of 

12

the risks of either accepting a plea, withdrawing a 

13

plea, whatever the case.  In this case, it's withdrawing 

14

a plea that has already been accepted by the court. 

15

This is a very significant step in this matter. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's true, but 

17

but you  you have the duty, or  or counsel for the 

18

defendant has the duty to show that counsel did not do 

19

that.  It's  it seems to me you are putting the burden 

20

on the other side to  to prove that the  that 

21

counsel knew all this.  And that's not the way  that's 

22

not the way the game is played. 

23

 MS. NEWMAN: 

I agree with that, 

24

Justice Scalia, and we are not putting the burden on the 

25

other side.  There is  I will refer the Court to the

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Pierson affidavit, which is in the Joint Appendix at 

2

page 298.  That affidavit, in particular, paragraphs 6, 

3

7, and 8, indicate that, at an arbitration hearing, 

4

when Ms. Titlow testified and Mr. Ott or deputy 

5

Sheriff's Deputy Ott testified  in arbitration 

6

hearings, witnesses are put under oath, and the 

7

affidavit is a sworn affidavit from an attorney. 

8
9

 So it is a notarized affidavit from  about 
testimony that was taken under oath, that indicates that 

10

Mr. Toca approached Ms. Titlow while she was in jail, 

11

while she was represented by counsel, that the approach 

12

was, you should reject the plea and not testify against 

13

your aunt.  That's the evidence that we have in the 

14

record, and that is not just Ms. Titlow. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But just  just to be 

16

clear, isn't that after Titlow had asked for an attorney 

17

because Titlow had talked with the jailer, who 

18

encouraged Titlow to plead innocent?  So  so you have 

19

to include that preface to this statement, or it's quite 

20

incomplete. 

21

 MS. NEWMAN: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23
24
25

Justice Kennedy 
Or correct me if that's 

wrong. 
 MS. NEWMAN: 

I would say that's wrong, and 

that's where the court of appeals was wrong again and why

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the State court's findings are entitled to no deference 

2

because the state court took that affidavit from William 

3

Pierson and turned the words on its head. 

4

 The affidavit does not state that Vonlee 

5

Titlow approached the sheriff's deputy and asked for a 

6

new attorney.  The affidavit states that the sheriff's 

7

deputy approached her.  He told her she should consult 

8

with his attorney because his attorney was really good 

9

and his attorney would be able to help her. 

10

 And so it's the sheriff's deputy, 

11

unequivocally, from this affidavit, because it's the 

12

only place that this evidence comes from, it's the 

13

sheriff's deputy  I'm sorry.  Were you looking  it's 

14

on page 298 of the Joint Appendix in William Pierson's 

15

affidavit. 

16

 It's the sheriff's deputy that sets 

17

everything in motion about innocence.  And why does he 

18

do that?  Because he's in the courtroom when the plea is 

19

entered.  And what is part of the plea?  Part of the 

20

plea is that Vonlee Titlow passed a polygraph.  Well, to 

21

a layperson what does that mean?  You pass a polygraph, 

22

you are innocent, you didn't do the crime. 

23

 Well, in this case, that's not the situation 

24

at all.  The passing of the polygraph cemented her guilt 

25

in participating in this crime.  But what the  what

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

she passed in the polygraph was that she was an aider 

2

and abettor, so it was her aunt who took the pillow and 

3

smothered her uncle, not Ms. Titlow, but she was 

4

present.  She participated.  She accepted money after 

5

the crime. 

6

 So everything that happened in the Michigan 

7

Court of Appeals took the actual facts and turned them 

8

on its head, which is why the factual findings are not 

9

entitled to deference. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Isn't it  is it 

11

unreasonable to read the Pierson affidavit  and  and 

12

you submitted that; isn't that correct? 

13

 MS. NEWMAN: 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Correct. 
All right.  To read it to 

15

mean that there were discussions between Deputy Ott and 

16

Titlow, and Titlow said she wasn't guilty?  Ott said, 

17

well, if you are not guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. 

18

I will refer you to an attorney.  If you want me to, I 

19

could ask somebody to come and talk to me. 

20

 That seems to be a direct quote from  from 

21

Titlow.  Isn't that  so isn't it reasonable to read it 

22

that way? 

23

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Justice Alito, that's one 

24

part of what you said, I would agree with, that the 

25

it does state in the affidavit, certainly, that he had

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an attorney that was really good and could ask somebody 

2

to come talk to me.  But the rest of the statements, I 

3

would argue, are  are inferences and not facts, and we 

4

have facts in the affidavit. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So the point is that there 

6

has to be some evidence.  You  you are saying that the 

7

court was wrong when they said your client said she 

8

wasn't guilty. 

9

 Now, this affidavit doesn't show that. 

I 

10

mean, paragraph 6 doesn't say who spoke first, but 

11

common sense suggests that the deputy sheriff wouldn't 

12

have made that statement, unless she spoke first.  I 

13

mean, does he go around saying to everybody, just 

14

generally, oh  you know, if you are not guilty, you 

15

shouldn't plead guilty. 

16

 I mean, it says they had discussions, and 

17

during the discussions, he told her she shouldn't plead 

18

guilty if she wasn't guilty. 

19
20

 MS. NEWMAN: 

It also  it also says, with 

all due respect, that 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

 MS. NEWMAN: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MS. NEWMAN: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Where? 
 the deputy approached her. 
Where  approached her 
Right. 
 and had discussions with

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

her.  It doesn't say why he approached her.  I mean, I 

2

just don't think people normally do that, they go to 

3

every person in jail and say, you know, if you are not 

4

guilty, you shouldn't plead guilty. 

5

 I mean, somebody might, but something 

6

triggered that advice, and the affidavit doesn't tell me 

7

what triggered that advice.  So I could infer that what 

8

triggered the advice was her statement she was not 

9

guilty, or I could infer this is an unusual situation 

10

where, for some reason unknown, he brought it up.  I 

11

don't know, from reading paragraph 6. 

12

 MS. NEWMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MS. NEWMAN: 

And Justice Breyer 
So whose burden is it? 
Justice Breyer, I would argue 

15

that it's  it's an inference that doesn't matter. 

16

It's an 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MS. NEWMAN: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
 in this case. 
It doesn't matter.  Why 

20

doesn't it matter?  Because if she went, he  she 

21

said  you know, I'm not really guilty, he said, well, 

22

you shouldn't plead guilty, she said  but I have a 

23

lawyer that will get rid of your guilty plea.  If it 

24

went something like that, and then we assume the lawyer 

25

was told about this  it doesn't say, but that's a

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable assumption. 

2

 And then the court opinion of Michigan seems 

3

to make sense that that was a reason  that was one of 

4

the reasons that made his conduct in  in withdrawing 

5

the plea or  you know, not strongly advising her 

6

against it.  That was one reason why that wasn't an 

7

inadequate assistance of counsel. 

8
9
10

 Now, where have I made my mistake in this 
chain? 
 MS. NEWMAN: 

Well, in paragraph 8 of William 

11

Pierson's affidavit on page 298, it indicates that it 

12

was Frederick Toca who encouraged her to reject a plea 

13

agreement to testify against the aunt.  So, again, we 

14

have the attorney, who is not Ms. Titlow, who is saying, 

15

I want to withdraw my plea.  It's the attorney who is 

16

saying to her and encouraging her to reject the plea. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Ms. Newman  you know, 

18

I  I'm  this may be the first case that I have been 

19

involved in as a judge  and there might be others, but 

20

myself, personally  where, in a situation like this, 

21

the defendant has not put in an affidavit to explain 

22

what happened. 

23

 There is some force to your adversary's 

24

argument that there's a really sparse record here, and 

25

AEDPA deference requires the burden on you.  You can't

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deny that.  I guess  I don't know if you were 

2

responsible, but what other circumstances that would 

3

occasion a defendant not saying, this is what I was 

4

told? 

5

 MS. NEWMAN: 

I was not the attorney.  I came 

6

into the case at this level, so I did not do any of the 

7

litigation below.  However, there are  there is record 

8

evidence to support, not  there is record evidence 

9

that supports the claim and maybe was a strategic 

10

decision by the attorney not to submit other affidavits 

11

because the attorney was simply looking for a hearing to 

12

expand the record.  So we have 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But they didn't ask for 

14

the hearing in the court below.  They only asked for it 

15

at the court of appeals. 

16

 MS. NEWMAN: 

They  Michigan  Michigan 

17

the way Michigan works is, within 56 days of getting the 

18

transcripts, you can file in the trial court.  If you 

19

if you fail to make that 56day deadline, then your 

20

alternative is to go to the court of appeals and ask for 

21

a remand. 

22

 So we don't know when the case got to the 

23

attorney.  So I don't think that there's any inference 

24

that can be drawn from the fact that, within that very 

25

short time period, there was no motion filed in the

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

trial court. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Who was the attorney at that 

3

stage?  I take it, it wasn't the trial attorney because 

4

the  a big part of the claim before the Michigan Court 

5

of Appeals was that the trial attorney was also 

6

ineffective. 

7

 MS. NEWMAN: 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9

 MS. NEWMAN: 

10
11

Right.  It was 

It was an appellate attorney, 

Liz Jacobs, was the attorney at that stage. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12

your office or she's 

13

 MS. NEWMAN: 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15

 MS. NEWMAN: 

16
17

Who was it? 

And she's  is she with 

She's not with my office, no. 
But she was appointed. 
She was  I don't know if she 

was appointed or retained, but she's not with my office. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

May I ask you, 

18

Ms. Newman, if you would agree that the Sixth Circuit 

19

was wrong, at least to this extent, is there  what is 

20

the argument for directing a prosecutor to make a plea 

21

offer that was never previously made?  The offer that 

22

was made is impossible to carry out now.  The offer was 

23

conditioned on her testimony at her aunt's trial.  That 

24

didn't happen. 

25

 So there is no  there is no plea bargain

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offered.  And yet, the court instructs a renewal, 

2

instructs the prosecutor to renew an offer that doesn't 

3

exist. 

4

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg 

5

Ginsburg, as the Court decided last term in 

6

Lafler v. Cooper, the point of the remedy is to put the 

7

defendant as closely as possible back in the position he 

8

or she would have been in, but for the ineffective 

9

assistance. 

10

 In Lafler v. Cooper, the Court recognized 

11

that there's going to be situations where circumstances 

12

have changed, and there's going to be circumstances 

13

where that is not possible to  to do that exactly. 

14

 In this case, of course, she cannot testify 

15

against her aunt because her aunt was acquitted and is 

16

deceased; however 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Then how could  how 

18

could the Court order the prosecutor to renew an offer 

19

that can't be made? 

20

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Well, it is an offer that can 

21

be made if you remove the condition precedent.  So the 

22

offer  the  the premise of the offer is a charge 

23

reduction.  From firstdegree 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the whole  what 

drove the prosecutor to make this bargain was he wanted

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the testimony, so how  how can that  that's  I've 

2

never seen anything like this, where a court orders a 

3

prosecutor to make a plea offer that was never made. 

4

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Well, again, referring to 

5

Lafler v. Cooper, the remedy goes  the Sixth Amendment 

6

right attaches to the defendant, not to the prosecution, 

7

so the goal here is to remedy, if the Court finds and 

8

agrees that there's a Sixth Amendment violation, to 

9

remedy that Sixth Amendment violation.  If there is an 

10

unequal burden to be borne by one  one side or the 

11

other, it has to be borne by the government. 

12

 And so, therefore, the way to remedy the 

13

Sixth Amendment violation, it was a charge reduction, is 

14

to reoffer the manslaughter plea, which has already been 

15

done in this case, by the way.  My client has already 

16

accepted that plea. 

17

 And then it's up to the trial court now 

18

whether or not to accept the plea, reject the plea, or 

19

do some sort of modification, which is exactly what the 

20

Sixth Circuit ordered and is exactly what this Court 

21

ordered in  in Lafler v. Cooper, to allow the trial 

22

court to have the discretion in fashioning a remedy that 

23

both will take care of the Sixth Amendment violation and 

24

can balance the concerns of the prosecution in what's 

25

been lost in that process, but still be able to craft a

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

remedy. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know that it's so 

3

strange to make the prosecutor  to make the 

4

prosecution submit an offer that can no longer be 

5

accepted.  I mean, it doesn't seem to me any more 

6

strange than to make the prosecution submit an offer 

7

where the situation was at the beginning.  You do this, 

8

and I will  you know, I will prosecute.  The quid pro 

9

quo was you avoid the possibility of conviction. 

10

 But here, she's already been convicted. 

She 

11

had a trial  you know, by 12 fair, impartial jurors, 

12

and she was guilty.  That's  that's what the jury 

13

found.  So it seems to me just as strange to make the 

14

prosecution, now that we know she's guilty, submit 

15

submit that prior offer. 

16

 So, I mean, it seems to me quite weird, in 

17

any event.  So one  one incremental weirdness is  is 

18

not so bad. 

19

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Justice Scalia, though, I think 

20

you hit the point on the head.  She  she was always 

21

guilty.  And as my brother counsel stated, this case, in 

22

some ways, is very, very similar to Cooper.  You have 

23

comments on the record by Frederick Toca that the 

24

prosecution is  has made comments and  and they 

25

reference this in the appendix, they reference a

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

newspaper article, the prosecutor talks about the fact 

2

that this is nothing more than a manslaughter case. 

3

 This is  we're charging firstdegree 

4

murder, but really, it's sort of a  in sheep's 

5

clothing, it's really just manslaughter.  And Frederick 

6

Toca is saying on the record, this is just a 

7

manslaughter case. 

8
9

 Why should my client accept an 
aboveguideline sentence of a sevenyear minimum and 

10

have to testify against a codefendant.  She's going to 

11

go to trial, and the prosecutor's already admitted this 

12

is nothing more than a manslaughter case, so she'll be 

13

convicted of manslaughter, and she's going to be in a 

14

better position following trial and conviction, just 

15

like in Cooper. 

16

 There was no question Mr. Cooper was going 

17

to be convicted.  There was no question at all.  Defense 

18

counsel gave the same advice.  You can't be convicted of 

19

the charged offense.  You're going to be convicted of a 

20

lesser sentence, and following that conviction, you will 

21

be in a better position for sentencing than you will be 

22

with this plea. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

24

 MS. NEWMAN: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If that's the case 
The facts are in all force. 
Your arguments seemed to

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be  have had a headon collision.  If this is nothing 

2

but a manslaughter case, then why was  what argument 

3

do you have that Toca was ineffective in saying, let's 

4

go to trial.  So if you're convicted of manslaughter 

5

without the plea, you'll get your guidelines sentence on 

6

the manslaughter case? 

7

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Because it's for the same 

8

reason in Cooper.  He was absolutely wrong, and he was 

9

not aware of the evidence that had been marshalled 

10
11

against Ms. Titlow, including their own confessions. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's not a 

12

manslaughter case.  I thought you were just saying it's 

13

a manslaughter case. 

14

 MS. NEWMAN: 

I'm saying that his 

15

representations on the record are similar to the 

16

representations made by Mr. Cooper's attorney on the 

17

record.  That you would  in response to Justice 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the charge was 

that she was convicted of seconddegree murder, right? 
 MS. NEWMAN: 

She was convicted of 

21

seconddegree murder.  And in this case  in Cooper, 

22

the defense attorney never filed a motion to quash.  So 

23

he never challenged the efficient  the legal 

24

sufficiency of the evidence. 

25

 In this case, attorney number one,

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mr. Lustig, did file a motion to quash.  He tested the 

2

sufficiency, the legal sufficiency of the prosecution's 

3

case for firstdegree murder. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

5

 MS. NEWMAN: 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You have my head 
So there's no question 
You have my head spinning. 

7

I thought you were making the argument that there's 

8

nothing unfair about requiring acceptance of  about 

9

the imposition of a manslaughter sentence because this 

10

was a manslaughter case.  I thought you were making that 

11

argument. 

12

 MS. NEWMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

14

 MS. NEWMAN: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not making that 
Did I misunderstand that? 
I'm not making that argument. 
I thought your argument was this  there 

16

is a reason that they spoke about, which was, well, she 

17

said she was innocent.  Now, as to that one, what they 

18

wrote is the record discloses that the second attorney's 

19

advice was set in motion by defendant's statement to the 

20

sheriff's deputy that he did not commit the offense. 

21

 Now, you say that's just contrary to fact as 

22

you point to the affidavit.  And the affidavit I read, I 

23

think it's a little  rather ambiguous in that respect, 

24

and I can overturn that, or a Federal court can, only if 

25

this factual statement I just read you is clearly wrong,

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clearly.  So I have a tough time saying it's clearly. 

2

 And I know they overstated because they said 

3

automatically, and that's good  well, that may be an 

4

overstatement.  You have to read it in light of that 

5

sentence.  But then you're making a second argument, I 

6

take it, if this is right.  Your second argument is, 

7

anyway, he was incompetent for a completely different 

8

reason. 

9

 He didn't read the record. 

And if he'd read 

10

it, he never would have made the statement that this is 

11

just a manslaughter case.  He would have seen that, if 

12

she withdrew her guilty plea, she'd be tried for murder, 

13

and then she'd get a really long sentence. 

14

 So that's an ineffective assistance of 

15

counsel.  Now, what does the court in Michigan say about 

16

that?  Nothing.  Nothing.  So now, I wonder.  Maybe 

17

nobody made that argument to them, or maybe they made 

18

it, and they rejected it sub silentio.  That's why I 

19

asked my first question.  Okay?  So  and you heard the 

20

response. 

21

 Even if they had heard that argument and 

22

they said nothing about it, they don't have to  they 

23

don't have to mention every argument made.  If they just 

24

deny, we assume they deny it, and what we do is see 

25

whether they were within their rights to deny it.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That's how we are supposed to look at it, does it 

2

clearly violate Supreme Court law to deny it? 

3

 And there is going to be a factual part of 

4

that and a legal part.  All right.  How do we deal with 

5

that? 

6
7
8
9

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Well, 2254 gives  has 

separate provisions for the legal aspect of that. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

First of all, did anybody 

make the argument as clearly as you have made it?  I saw 

10

what it was, I think.  So that's  did anybody make 

11

that argument to the Michigan court? 

12

 MS. NEWMAN: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not that I'm aware of. 
No.  Okay.  Well, that's 

14

the end of that, isn't it?  What you are coming for is 

15

you have to proceed by asking for reopening in the 

16

Michigan court and see if they say it's too late.  And 

17

then  you know, et cetera, they're all spelled out in 

18

this opinion, which I can't remember, Cullen or 

19

Pinholster or something, and this isn't an argument for 

20

us now. 

21

 MS. NEWMAN: 

It's just a factual argument 

22

trying to respond to the Court's questions about what 

23

happened in this case and about what is contained in the 

24

record and what Mr. Toca did say on the record. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

If I could move

Official

1

beyond the particular facts to some of the broader 

2

points that the Solicitor General has raised?  If you 

3

don't have the requirement of at least some 

4

corroboration, then all you have in every case is a 

5

completely selfserving assertion, I wouldn't have pled 

6

guilty ­ if you know, if I had known this or I had known 

7

that. 

8

 And everybody will raise that argument. 

9

Everybody raises ineffective assistance of counsel 

10

anyway, and they will just add onto it this plea 

11

assertion.  I mean, shouldn't it be  the Sixth Circuit 

12

really went out of its way saying there is no 

13

requirement of corroboration at all. 

14

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, there is no 

15

question the Sixth Circuit, in dicta, said that we don't 

16

require it, but it exists in this case.  And the reality 

17

is, as we discussed in our brief, that every circuit 

18

looks  it's a Strickland analysis. 

19

 Just like every other Strickland analysis, 

20

the court looks at the entire record and makes a 

21

determination based on the record.  And this Court has 

22

always eschewed hard, fast, brightline rules in terms 

23

of telling courts what has to exist in order to make a 

24

specific finding. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

So you think the

Official

1

Sixth Circuit was wrong in what you are characterizing 

2

as dicta?  You think it was wrong to say that and that 

3

the other circuits which require something in addition, 

4

that that's the rule that we should adopt? 

5

 MS. NEWMAN: 

I don't think  no, I don't 

6

think that any particular rule should be adopted.  I 

7

think the rules that exist under Strickland are fine for 

8

the circuits.  The rules have existed for decades, and 

9

the circuits have no trouble figuring out when the 

10
11

threshold is met and when it's not. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I thought 

12

maybe I'm misremembering, but the Sixth Circuit 

13

distanced it itself from the other circuits, didn't it? 

14
15
16

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Yes, it did distance itself by 

stating 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Now, you are telling 

17

me the circuits have always done this.  So the 

18

Sixth Circuit at least thinks it's doing something 

19

different? 

20

 MS. NEWMAN: 

It may think it is doing 

21

something different, but in this particular case, there 

22

was objective evidence that they pointed to, and as the 

23

Solicitor General mentioned, there's always going to be 

24

sentencing disparity because you're going to have to 

25

have a sentencing disparity in order to show prejudice.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So, in effect, there will always be objective evidence 

2

that will support any subjective statement of a criminal 

3

defendant, or you're never going to see a 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, if there is 

5

always going to be objective evidence, that's like 

6

saying you don't have to have corroboration. 

7

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Right, but for this Court  my 

8

point is, obviously, the Court can  can set forth a 

9

rule, but in doing so, I think we are going to run into 

10

what Justice Sotomayor said earlier, in terms of judges 

11

do this all the time, they  they figure out who's 

12

credible.  I mean, it's never just like here's these 

13

things, but this guy's credible, so I'm going to believe 

14

him. 

15

 It's the totality of the circumstances, and 

16

it's always going to have to be a totality of the 

17

circumstances.  So to say, here's the line, there has to 

18

be objective evidence, then what is the objective 

19

evidence?  How are we going to define objective 

20

evidence. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So the Sixth Circuit 

22

was wrong when it said, we are doing something different 

23

than the other circuits? 

24
25

 MS. NEWMAN: 

They certainly did not do 

anything different in this case.  In the other cases

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that I have reviewed from the Sixth Circuit, I have not 

2

seen a case that relied only on subjective testimony, so 

3

I can't point to a case where the Sixth Circuit is doing 

4

something different than any other case, and I don't 

5

believe anyone else has pointed to a particular case. 

6

 So they might think they are doing something 

7

different, but in reality, they are doing the same thing 

8

as everybody else. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I ask you about Mr. 

10

Mr. Toca's ethical lapses?  Are they  do they have a 

11

legal significance in this case? 

12

 MS. NEWMAN: 

They certainly speak to his 

13

credibility. In United States v. SotoLopez is a very 

14

similar case out of the Ninth Circuit, where the Court 

15

did rely on the fact that the attorney had significant 

16

problems, ethical problems.  And in this case, 

17

Mr. Toca's actions and his ethical problems go 

18

handinhand. 

19

 I mean, he approached a represented 

20

defendant who was in jail and encouraged her to reject a 

21

plea.  He did this on a very short timeline, 

22

admitting that  well, not admitting, but we know, from 

23

prior counsel, that he had not even picked up the phone 

24

to speak with prior counsel, who had spent almost a year 

25

litigating this case.  He had not retrieved prior

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

counsel's file.  It appears from the record  those are 

2

facts. 

3

 In terms of inferences, it appears from the 

4

record that he got his information from the media.  This 

5

was a highly, highly publicized case.  He signed a 

6

retainer agreement with a client who had no money, who 

7

gave him some jewelry and the right to promote her 

8

story. 

9

 So he had every  he violated multiple 

10

ethical rules, and those violations lead to the 

11

conclusion  a reasonable conclusion that the reason 

12

for withdrawing the plea was to make the deal more 

13

lucrative.  It is not lucrative if she pleads. 

14

 She had already pled, so she had already 

15

entered a plea, and all that was left was sentencing. 

16

That's not a very exciting story, if your entire 

17

retainer agreement relies on the fact that you have the 

18

media rights to sell this story. 

19

 So, yes, I would argue that the ethical 

20

lapses are very significant in this case and lend 

21

credibility to 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In what sense is his 

23

credibility  did his credibility figure in the 

24

decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals? 

25

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Well, it didn't.  There were

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

separate issues raised on ethical violations, and they 

2

were denied by the Michigan Court of Appeals, and they 

3

were denied by the Federal court. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you know whether the Michigan 

5

Court of Appeals was ever presented with this argument 

6

that, in fact, he gave the advice that he did because of 

7

the peculiar fee arrangement that he had? 

8
9

 MS. NEWMAN: 

They were specifically 

presented with the conflict argument, and off the top of 

10

my head, I apologize, I don't recall if that is 

11

specifically contained in there, but I think it was.  I 

12

mean, it was definitely briefed and argued, the ethical 

13

violations. 

14
15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And Mr. Toca is now, remind 

me, disbarred for? 

16

 MS. NEWMAN: 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

18

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Disbarred. 
Forever? 
Yes.  He committed multiple 

19

misdemeanors and a felony and, in part, was disbarred 

20

based on this conduct in this case, so he is no longer 

21

practicing law.  Last I checked, he is no longer 

22

practicing law anywhere in the United States. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What was submitted to the 

24

Michigan Court of Appeals?  Not the  I am not talking 

25

about the exhibits that were attached, but there was a

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

motion, a brief?  What was it? 
 MS. NEWMAN: 

Yes, in Michigan, it's called a 

3

motion to remand.  You are required under the court 

4

rules to submit a brief in support of that motion to 

5

remand, and you are required to submit a proffer.  So 

6

the proffer

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It's not in the habeas 

8

record, it's not in the record of the Federal Court. 

9

And we've been unable to get it from the State court, 

10

but it does exist? 

11

 MS. NEWMAN: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

13

 MS. NEWMAN: 

Yes. 
This motion? 
Absolutely, yes.  You have to 

14

file a motion to remand, and the court of appeals 

15

specifically references that motion to remand and the 

16

proffer by the affidavit in stating that normally they 

17

wouldn't consider those, that proffer as substantive of 

18

evidence, but in this case, inexplicably, they did, 

19

which leads to another reason why the Michigan Court of 

20

Appeals decision is unreasonable because it is the Michigan 

21

Court of Appeals that failed to engage in further fact 

22

finding. 

23

 So we take the record, as we get it from 

24

them and under Williams and other decisions, if the 

25

Court is the one that's responsible for an inadequate record,

52

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I mean we have what we have, and I would argue to 

2

this Court that the record that we had supports that the 

3

Michigan Court of Appeals erred both legally and 

4

factually in its findings, and therefore, neither are 

5

entitled to any deference.  And the Sixth Circuit's habeas grant 

6

should be affirmed in this matter. If there are no further questions 

7

 Thank you, your honor.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Bursch, you have four minutes remaining.

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN J. BURSCH 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

12

 MR. BURSCH: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

13

 A few cleanup points, starting with this 

14

idea that the actual predicate was wrong.  As we 

15

explained in our briefing in the habeas pleadings in 

16

this very case, Titlow already conceded that the factual 

17

predicate was correct. 

18

 And, Justice Breyer, you asked about the 

19

quantum of proof necessary to overcome that assumption 

20

that the Court of Appeals made based on the record 

21

before it, and actually, the legal standard under AEDPA 

22

is not clearly wrong.  Under 2254(e)(1), which is 

23

reprinted in our blue brief, it is presumed correct, and 

24

that presumption can only be overcome by clear and 

25

convincing evidence, and we don't have that here.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 Second, with respect to the advice, my 

2

friend on the other side points to Paragraph 8 of the 

3

Pierson affidavit.  And it's a little ironic that they 

4

put all their eggs in that basket now because, in their 

5

briefing, they disclaim it as triple hearsay and say 

6

this Court should not rely on it, and she said some 

7

things characterizing that paragraph that aren't in 

8

there.  There is nothing in paragraph 8 or the rest of 

9

the affidavit that says Toca approached Titlow.  I don't 

10

know where that comes from. 

11

 But assume that everything that she says is 

12

correct and that Toca did give the advice to withdraw 

13

the plea, that still doesn't mean that it's bad advice 

14

when you apply the AEDPA and Strickland rubrics because, 

15

as Justice Alito pointed out, the differentiation in the 

16

manslaughter guidelines and what was actually in the 

17

plea actually makes this objectively reasonable advice. 

18

 And, in fact, it's more than that because, 

19

at the time the plea was withdrawn, consider all the 

20

facts that were known from talking to the prosecutor, 

21

looking in the police file and everything else that 

22

that Toca presumably did.  At that time, no one knew 

23

about this critical Chahine testimony, which only came 

24

out at trial, that it was actually Titlow who held Uncle 

25

Don down while he was being smothered.

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 I mean, that completely changes the 

2

complexion of this case.  And so to say that Titlow was 

3

always guilty when all of her testimony up to the point 

4

of the plea withdrawal had been, I told my Aunt Billie 

5

to stop, and then I left the scene, that's just not 

6

credible. 

7

 Point on the second issue, the prejudice 

8

prong.  Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Sotomayor, you 

9

note that the other circuits all look at objective 

10

evidence, and we think that's the right way to approach 

11

this.  And you're exactly right, Chief Justice, that the 

12

Sixth Circuit takes a different approach. 

13

 The Sixth Circuit says, although some 

14

circuits have held that a defendant must support his own 

15

assertion that he would have accepted the offer with 

16

additional objective evidence, we, in this circuit, have 

17

declined to adopt such a requirement. 

18

 And you can see how that difference played 

19

out in this very case because the Sixth Circuit didn't 

20

look at all the other evidence that was in the record 

21

that was contrary to this selfserving statement that 

22

Titlow made; that Titlow had the plea in hand and, 

23

before the ink was even dry, was already professing 

24

innocence and talking to other lawyers; that she fired 

25

Lustig and there was no reason to do that, unless she

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wanted to  to withdraw the plea; that she did not have 

2

a propensity for truthfulness. 

3

 At trial, she lied about the fact that she 

4

was drunk, when she was not, the night of the murder. 

5

The evidence came out that she asked Chahine to lie 

6

about the alibi, and she hid the murder weapon.  And 

7

then you've got all these statements at the sentencing 

8

hearing and post remand, where she's continually 

9

asserting her innocence.  It's happening all the time. 

10

 When you consider all that objectively, 

11

under the other circuit standards, clearly, that would 

12

not be sufficient to establish prejudice here. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 MR. BURSCH: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I 
That's the objective evidence. 
I  I don't understand 

16

what you're saying.  The other side says  and I think 

17

it's the standard  that you look at the totality of 

18

the circumstances. 

19

 MR. BURSCH: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Correct. 
And what you're saying 

21

is they didn't do that here.  It's not that  they use 

22

some objective evidence, you're saying they didn't use 

23

other objective evidence.  I am 

24
25

 MR. BURSCH: 

Here's  yeah.  Here's the 

connector, Justice Sotomayor.  The reason they didn't

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

look at the other evidence is because they have a 

2

different rule.  They don't think they have to look at 

3

it.  They did look at things like sentencing 

4

disparities. 

5

 As the Solicitor General's office explained, 

6

that shouldn't come into play here because that was a 

7

wellknown disparity; it wasn't something that was 

8

hidden by client's ineffective assistance.  And they 

9

the Sixth Circuit talks about the fact that she accepted 

10

the plea once and then withdrew it.  Obviously, that 

11

cuts both ways. 

12

 So all you are left with is the subjective 

13

testimony.  And when you look at all the other objective 

14

evidence, the evidence that other circuits would look 

15

at, there's really only one possible outcome here. 

16

 So in sum, Your Honors  oh, I guess I do 

17

want to mention one other quick point since my light 

18

hasn't gone yet.  The book deal, there was no book deal. 

19

Look at page Joint Appendix 60, and I've seen copyright 

20

assignments.  That wasn't the case here.  They were 

21

trying to raise money for the trial. 

22

 And  and this case had nothing to do with 

23

the reason why Toca was disbarred.  That's at Joint 

24

Appendix 302 to 317.  It was because he falsely put 

25

someone else's license tabs on his license plate, and

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that was a misdemeanor, and then he lied about it. 


2


 In sum, record silence under AEDPA and 


3


Strickland means the State wins, not the convicted 


4


murderer.
