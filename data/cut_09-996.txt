We'll hear argument

next this morning in Case 09-996, Walker v. Martin.
Mr. Marshall.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD MARSHALL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. MARSHALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Charles Martin never adequately explained

11

why he waited more than 5 years to present additional

12

claims to the California Supreme Court.

13

no surprise that these claims were rejected as untimely.

14

California employs a habeas corpus timeliness rule that

15

merely requires reasonable diligence and disclosure.

16

The rule is adequate under this Court's longstanding

17

precedents, and the Ninth Circuit's decision to the

18

contrary should be reversed.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As such, it was

Well, what about the

20

charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general

21

5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from

22

the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the

23

5- to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on

24

the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do

25

it on the merits, sometimes they do it as time-barred,
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

and there's no rationale to when they do one or the

2

other.
MR. MARSHALL:

3

Three brief responses, Your

4

Honor.

5

you can't tell from a summary denial ruling what the

6

court was thinking about the time of delay.

7

The first is that to measure summary denials,

The second point is that delay in California

8

is only half the equation.

In California, there is the

9

substantial delay and then there's also the

10

justification portion.

So persons who operate under

11

substantial delay still have an opportunity to justify

12

that delay and gain the desired review.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the third?

Would they have to -

15

would they have to justify the delay first?

16

there was something about, well, if the time question is

17

more difficult and the merits are easy, there's no

18

merit, so we just decide this.

19

MR. MARSHALL:

I thought

California's policy is to

20

take a first look at a habeas petition and determine

21

whether it is -- has a prima facie case or whether

22

procedural bars are apparent.

23

case on the merits isn't necessarily saying the matter

24

was timely, and courts should be permitted to reach

25

whatever is the most judicially efficient method of

A court that's denying a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

resolving such a question without it being held against

2

them.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So basically you're

4

taking the position or you're conceding that the

5

California courts are not consistent in their

6

application of the timeliness rule?

7

MR. MARSHALL:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

No -

try to defend that position.

Your brief doesn't even
Are you conceding that

there is inconsistent application of the rule?

11

MR. MARSHALL:

No, Your Honor.

12

The point that we're making is that when you

13

look at a rule, whether you apply it or not -- or

14

whether you impose it or not doesn't mean you're not

15

applying the rule.

16

review matters under the Fourth Amendment, a decision

17

not to exclude the evidence doesn't mean they didn't

18

apply the Fourth Amendment.

For example, when trial courts

19

In this case, if the trial court -- or if

20

the reviewing court looks at the length of delay, and

21

then they may look at the justification to determine

22

that the delay was justified.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -- I might be

24

speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus

25

Resource Center brief showed that the court, the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

California court, did reach some cases where an

2

explanation had not been proffered.

3

just a simple rule, that if you don't proffer an

4

explanation, you won't get heard.

5

step in that?

So what's the next

Why do they reach some and not others?

MR. MARSHALL:

6

And so it can't be

The California Supreme Court,

7

if a case is patently meritless and perhaps the

8

procedural question of timeliness is more complex -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

when there's no justification offered?
MR. MARSHALL:

11
12
13

How could it be complex

The question of how long it

was -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, they pointed to a

14

certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in

15

delay where no justification was offered, and in some

16

they reached the merits and in others they applied a

17

procedural bar.

18

So how is that consistent?

MR. MARSHALL:

Well, the State court has

19

discretion to determine on the -- on procedural grounds

20

or on the merits -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there some Federal rule

22

that says you have to apply a procedural ground before

23

you decide the merits?

24

MR. MARSHALL:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is not.

There's a -

So it's up to California

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

which of the two it wants to use.

2

MR. MARSHALL:

That's correct.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in California, if it

4

just says "denied," then the presumption is it's denied

5

on the merits; is that it?
MR. MARSHALL:

6
7

That's correct, a lack of a

prima facie case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

And -- and if -- so if

9

it's going to be denied on time bar grounds, there has

10

to be something to indicate that it's for that reason?

11

Otherwise we assume it's on the merits?
MR. MARSHALL:

12

That's correct.

Typically,

13

the citation is to Clark and Robbins, just as it was in

14

this case.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do we know that

16

the California court just thinks that the Federal

17

question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it?

18

It may be meritorious.

19

applying the decision to reach the merits on an

20

arbitrary and capricious basis or one that seeks to

21

avoid hard Federal questions?

22

How do we know they're not

MR. MARSHALL:

First is this Court has never

23

taken the position, when measuring adequacy, of assuming

24

that the rule is inadequate.

25

this Court has always taken when looking at the adequacy

The starting position that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

of a State rule is to look for evidence to see that -

2

if it can be shown to be inadequate.

3

there's no evidence in this case that has been presented

4

to show that the State court is using their rules as a

5

pretext of any kind.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I posit that

Is it arbitrary and

7

capricious for a court to take the ground of least

8

resistance, to decide the case on the easiest issue

9

that's presented?

10

Is that arbitrary and capricious?

MR. MARSHALL:

I posit that it's not.

This

11

Court endorsed in Lambrix that it's all right for courts

12

to address procedural default after Teague if that's a

13

more judicially efficient method of handling the matter.

14

Strickland cases permit addressing either prong,

15

whichever is easier under the circumstances.

16

And so the State courts ought to be

17

permitted to address habeas corpuses on whatever the

18

easiest, most judicially efficient basis is without

19

being forced to answer a timeliness question if a case

20

is patently meritless.

21

of inconsistency about that.

22

And there should be no finding

And, more importantly, summary denials, as

23

we're discussing here, don't afford any notice to

24

litigants of what the State's procedures are or what

25

they're thin king, because you have to guess.
Alderson Reporting Company

You have

Official

9
1

to guess at how long the delay was, you have to guess at

2

whether there was any justification offered.

3

denials do not assist the inquiry.

4

never endorsed using summary denials in its adequacy

5

measure.

6

State cases that explicate the rule.

So summary

And this Court has

This Court has always looked to published

This Court is looking to see whether the

7
8

rule has been pronounced by the State for a certain

9

amount of time, and then all of a sudden the litigant

10

that's receiving the imposition of the rule receives a

11

rule that was unexpected, either because the rule was

12

changed or because the rule was novel.

13

that has happened here.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

Nothing like

The phrase is "substantial

15

delay."

Are there factors other than temporal factors

16

that go into whether or not the delay is substantial;

17

that is to say, the prisoner had difficulty contacting

18

his counsel and so forth?

19

at -

Is that what the court looks

20

MR. MARSHALL:

Those are -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- when it looks at

22

"substantial"?

23

cases that tell us what the -- how do we define

24

"substantial"?

25

And is there -- are there California

MR. MARSHALL:

Yes, Your Honor, to both.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

The kind of circumstances you're describing

2

are exactly the kind of circumstances which makes

3

California's rule fair, because it considers how long it

4

takes a litigant to find his claim, get it prepared, and

5

get it into court.

6

And there are, in fact, concrete examples.

7

The Robbins case specifically provided that a 5-month

8

window from the discovery of triggering facts to the

9

presentation of the -- of the claim was a reasonable

10

amount of time.

11

provided that 18 months of delay from the discovery of a

12

declaration was substantial and had to be justified.

13
14
15

By contrast, the Stankewitz case

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When does the State think

that Mr. Martin's claim became untimely?
MR. MARSHALL:

Certainly he hasn't given any

16

reason why he didn't present his additional claims at

17

the time of his earlier habeas corpus challenges.

18

Mr. Martin went through a full round of superior court,

19

court of appeal, and supreme court challenges, and then

20

waited some additional years and has never explained why

21

he didn't include these additional claims in those

22

earlier challenges.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

within 60 days.

So you think it -
It's supposed to be filed

I don't -- this is along the same lines
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

as Justice Kagan's question.

Suppose there's the first

2

round of habeas, and then he waits 60 days and files the

3

new claim.

Would that be substantial?
Because you're indicating that failure to

4
5

include it in the first review is a factor to be weighed

6

against him.

7

inquiring about.
MR. MARSHALL:

8
9

And I think that's what the Justice is

against.

Yes, it does -- it does weigh

And it's a rule of reasonableness, and it's a

10

discretion-based rule.

And he would have to offer,

11

well, why didn't he include those claims earlier?

12

if he had a good -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

And

Yes, and what -- isn't that

14

a separate rule?

I mean, no matter how soon, if he does

15

it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you

16

can't come back with another habeas with material that

17

you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas?

18

MR. MARSHALL:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

to do with that.

21

bar.

So time -- time has nothing

It's just a separate -- a separate

MR. MARSHALL:

22

That's correct, Your Honor.

California has articulated

23

that successive petitions are a type of delayed

24

petition.

25

California between successive petitions and delayed

But you're right, there is a difference in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

petitions, and the ruling here is that he was delayed

2

substantially.
I was just addressing the point about when

3
4

they might have been timely had they been presented

5

earlier, and it appears that in the earlier -- he didn't

6

get a timeliness ruling in his earlier challenges.

7

it appears that he could have raised them then and did

8

not.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

So

But if we can take out the

10

second and successive aspect of this and just focus on

11

the timeliness, when does the State think that this -

12

that these claims were -- became untimely?
MR. MARSHALL:

13
14

It's a rule of reasonableness

and diligence that's circumstantially based, and -
JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

Well, you have the

16

circumstances here, so -- so under those circumstances,

17

when did the claims become untimely?
MR. MARSHALL:

18

In the Robbins case, it

19

explains that you have -- a 5-month span from discovery

20

of the claims to presentation of the claims would be

21

reasonable.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The claims here -

The 5 months would be

24

reasonable.

So is a year unreasonable?

25

outer bounds, you know, assuming you don't have a good
Alderson Reporting Company

Is 5 months the

I understand that if you have a good reason,

2

that can lengthen it.

4

late?

But suppose you don't have a good

When does the State think, okay, that's too

MR. MARSHALL:

5

There isn't -- there isn't a

6

defined time line.

But our position is that a defined

7

time line is not a necessity for adequacy.

8

has endorsed reasons of -- rules of reasonableness and

9

diligence.

This Court

For example, in the Federal prisoner context

10

in Johnson v. United States, this Court said diligence

11

in discovery, while it isn't exact, is good enough.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

Well, I'm -- I'm trying to

13

get to even around, not -- not exact.

14

not exact.

15

months, around 3 years, around someplace in the middle?

16

It's just around.

MR. MARSHALL:

My standard is

Around what?

Around 6

The position of the State is

17

that Robbins has indicated that 5 months is reasonable,

18

18 months is definitely too long, and that there is a

19

discretion-based determination in the middle.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if it's filed within 6

21

months and it's -- it's rejected as untimely, and the

22

petitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this

23

represents a grave departure from the way these are

24

normally handled by the California Supreme Court?

25

there any way for the petitioner to do that?
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MARSHALL:

He would point to the

2

published authority and argue that his case was outside

3

of the parameters of what the State had done in the

4

past.

5

ruling is adequate, that there would be no evidence of

6

such available to this particular litigant.

7

hypothetical litigant might be able to proffer that

8

prior cases had treated claims differently.

9

However, our position is that, since California's

A

And the other problem with California is

10

that it would require two exact same litigants, and it's

11

very rare for two exact same litigants to have the exact

12

same claims, the exact same bases for their delay, filed

13

in exactly the same amount of delay.

14

is difficult.

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So true comparison

You think 5 years is too

long, though?

17

MR. MARSHALL:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
There -- this was taken

20

over by California from capital cases, but in the

21

capital case context, there -- they have a 90-day

22

presumption of timeliness.

the presumption that within 90 days is timely.

25

there reason for that?

Respectfully, I must

the general timeliness rule for themselves and added the

5

presumption.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

The

Was there reason for and

7

then saying, well, in the capital context, we're going

8

to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely.

9

didn't they add that to the original rule?

10

MR. MARSHALL:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. MARSHALL:

Why

To the other litigant rule?
Yes.

They, I think, felt that the

13

rule was adequate the way it was, that a

14

circumstantially based rule, a reasonableness-based

15

rule, was sufficient to guide the conduct of litigants

16

to tell them what they needed to do to present their

17

case.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why would it be

19

different in the capital context?

20

for adding the 90 days there?

21

MR. MARSHALL:

What was the reason

Capital cases are

22

significantly more complex, the punishments are -- are

23

more significant, and so additional scrutiny might be

24

warranted in those contexts.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- I'm a little bit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

confused by your response to Justice Scalia.

I thought

2

from your brief that you were positing that there was no

3

claim of inconsistent application of a rule that could

4

ever survive.
Let's assume for the sake of argument the

5
6

following hypothetical, and probably not far off the

7

mark.

8

they're not educated in it, say that they have just

9

learned about a new California case that gives them a

Litigants who don't know the law, who claim

10

ground to challenge their prior sentence.

11

litigants learn about the case anywhere between 3 and 6

12

months of the issuance of the case by the supreme court.

13

A dozen litigants apply for this discretionary review,

14

and half of them are granted review and half are not.

15

Half of them get a correction of the sentence and half

16

of them don't.

17

that's discernible.

18
19
20

There is no difference between them
They each just claim ignorance.

Is that a case where someone would be out of
luck, and why, for a claim of inconsistent application?
MR. MARSHALL:

I didn't follow the

21

hypothetical.

22

individuals getting time-barred?

23
24
25

And the

Was -- were some of the hypothetical

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Getting time-barred.

Some are time-barred; some -
MR. MARSHALL:

And some of the individuals

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. MARSHALL:

4

Exactly.

And is there yet a third set

of people who are getting -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

No.

Some -- all of them

6

are within that small framework of 3 to 6 months from

7

the time the supreme court decision was issued.

8

all claimed they just learned of it and filed

9

immediately, and some are getting relief and some are

10

They

not.
Is that an inconsistent application that

11
12

would be cognizable under your view of the rule as it

13

should be?

15

me, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And five of them, if you were to

get to the merits of their claim under this new decision

of this Court, five of them would be entitled to relief,

14

five who would be entitled to relief are procedurally

barred and the five who were not entitled to relief on

Now, would that be an adequate State ground?

would be adequate under this Court's prior tests.
JUSTICE ALITO:

2
3

So fair notice is not the

only requirement.
MR. MARSHALL:

4

This Court has also required

5

legitimate State interests, and this Court has used the

6

legitimate State interests context, like, for example,

7

in Smith v. Texas, where this Court has declared a

8

particular kind of violation was a constitutional

9

violation and the Court exercised its discretion not to

10

reach the violation, this Court found that the State had

11

no legitimate State interest in such a ruling.

12

Our point is that -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but the cases that

14

you're using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the

15

sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in

16

which the effect of the State decision was to exclude

17

the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision.

18

The matter could not come before the Federal courts.

19

MR. MARSHALL:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.
This is something quite

21

different.

This is applying a time limit.

22

why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into

23

the -- whether it's not discretionary.

24

it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar

25

cases may be treated differently.
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't see

I mean, to say

MR. MARSHALL:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor, exactly.
So I don't know why you -

3

you concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that's

4

used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally

5

different situation.
MR. MARSHALL:

6

It was the meritorious nature

7

of the claims.

And in California, meritorious claims

8

don't receive the time bar because there's exceptions

9

that take those into consideration.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

But none of this is -- is a

11

device as is used in the cases that -- that you are

12

referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude

13

the Federal courts from the case.

14

what's going on here, is it?

15

MR. MARSHALL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- that's not

That's correct.
I guess if the situation

17

were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and

18

has to figure out has there been too much delay or not,

19

suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he

20

said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases

21

come out one way and half of them come out the other

22

way.

23

and say, Court, look what you have been doing?

24

would the court then grant a hearing on that and

25

possibly correct it?

Could he then go to the California Supreme Court

saying there is no such evidence.

5

MR. MARSHALL:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.

In fact -

That's what I suspected

7

reading this.

But if there were such evidence is there

8

a route in California that they could deal with it?
MR. MARSHALL:

9

Certainly.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's not a question

12

of adequacy, is it?

It's a question of notice.

That's correct, Your Honor.
Adequacy of notice, because

no notice might be an inadequate notice.

But it's

real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you

So -- what?

Of course he's going to file the Federal

habeas and see if it's determined to be adequate or

15

inadequate, correct?

16

MR. MARSHALL:

California's rule is

17

perfectly suited to such a scenario.

18

has to do is explain why they didn't bring the claim

19

sooner, either from late discovery or some other

20

impediment, and the substantial delay can be justified

with exactly those sorts of circumstances.

who made a claim based on the trial and appellate record

5

that probably 98 percent, 99 percent have no more than a

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

These cases that you cite,

8

before you go any further -- are they cases in which the

9

California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying

10

that 6 years was okay?

11

without an opinion, the California Supreme Court went to

12

the merits?
MR. BIGELOW:

13

Or are they just cases where,

They are -- well, in the

14

Sanders case and in the Jones case, there were -- I

15

believe that they were decisions in -- they were

16

decisions.

These cases predated the Clark/Robbins

17

situation.

In the Cooper case and the Duke case, those

18

cases -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what do you mean

20

they were decisions, written opinions or just went to

21

the merits and decided the merits?

22

anything about the delay question?

23

MR. BIGELOW:

Did they say

They did say something about

24

the delay question in at least two of the cases, well,

25

at least in one of the cases, the Mitchell case, which
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

was a 2-year delay.

They said 2 years is unreasonable,

2

but I didn't cite those.

And I cannot speak to -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

But the other side says

4

that, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may

5

have gone to the merits is it was just a lot easier.

6

MR. BIGELOW:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

No -
They didn't have to worry

about it.
MR. BIGELOW:

9

To that extent, it -- it's my

10

recollection they went to the merits.

11

silent denials, and they don't cite Clark/Robbins

12

because they predated Clark/Robbins.

13

the Cooper case and Duke case, those I believe were

14

silent denials.

about California.

are merit denials when they are silent, but we really

that that simple practice, which I've never heard of as

4

attacked as unconstitutional -- how do we know that that

5

isn't what's going on?
MR. BIGELOW:

6

So how do we know

Well, in -- in any given year

7

recently, in recent history at least, there are about

8

800 truly silent denials, no explanation.

9

State says we can't consider them because they mean

Now, the

10

nothing.

11

something, and they have to count because we don't have

12

the information that the litigant in this matter is -

13

doesn't have the same kind of resources, for example,

14

that the State does.

15

From our perspective, they have to mean

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

they -- what's your point?

17

What does that show?

18

MR. BIGELOW:

All right, but that's -
Eight hundred are silent.

That they have got to count in

19

the adequacy -- in the consistency application, they've

20

got to count against the Petitioner.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. BIGELOW:

23
24
25

Why?

Because the Petitioner is the

one who has the resources and has the opportunity -
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I mean, but then you

can make any claim against him.

I mean, what I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31

wonder -- maybe this is where I'm leading -- the

2

California Supreme Court is not the only court in

3

California where people file for habeas petitions, is

4

it?

5

MR. BIGELOW:

No.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

The appellate court -
Yes.

So why, if there's

7

inconsistency in this rule, wouldn't somebody go look at

8

the decisions of the appellate courts which write their

9

reasons down, and then you would know whether it is

10

being decided -- applied inconsistently or not

11

inconsistently.

12

at people who write opinions?

Why look at a blank wall?

And then you'll find out.

Not all -- not all habeas

petitions in California are filed in lower courts.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, of course not.

But is

16

your claim -- are you conceding, or are you conceding,

17

are you denying, are you just saying nothing about

18

whether the practice in this rule, applying the rule of

substantial unexcused delay, disqualifies you for -

In all courts below, I do not

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

So you don't know.

So what

6

you've come -- what you've done your research on are

7

questions that cannot be answered due to the fact that a

8

supreme court normally doesn't say why when it denies

9

something, but you haven't looked into the research that

10

is readily obtainable, which is these are courts that

11

write opinions.

12

correctly?

Is that -- have I gotten that

13

MR. BIGELOW:

statement.

And

23

filed, while the rule is you start the period of running

25

from the case it was reasonably -- the person should

2

time as the time his case was decided against him.

point the Court makes.

when his petition was filed late.

-- everybody in this room can tell him that he is

obligated to file the petition as promptly as the

circumstances allow.

scenario that is likely to happen, but the construct

that the Court has -- "as promptly as circumstances

any.

MR. BIGELOW:

I -- I would disagree.

think that they did, in fact, look at explanations for

delay, and a curious thing that they did find, which is

look -- did they look for explanations for delay when

MR. BIGELOW:

I think the short answer to

that is yes, but they also looked at silent denials as

well.

24

for delay, more of those cases were decided actually on

25

the merits than cases that did offer a delay.

detail in their analysis of Wende briefs, which is the

that rule or with respect to substantial delay.
JUSTICE ALITO:

8

But the other point that I would like to

understand the need for a finite period of time to

impossible cases that you should have heard because it
