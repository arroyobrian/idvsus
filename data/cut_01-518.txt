CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

National Labor Relations Board.

Mr. Baskin.


7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE BASKIN


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10

MR. BASKIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


11

This case presents an important question arising


12

under the Petition Clause of the First Amendment. 


13

Petitioner BE&K Construction is asking the Court to hold


14

that the First Amendment protects objectively based


15

lawsuits from being declared unlawful by the National


16

Labor Relations Board. 


17

Now, the Court has already held that the First


18

Amendment does protect lawsuits from statutory sanction


19

under both the NLRA and the antitrust laws so long as the


20

suits are meritorious, meaning that they are not


21

objectively baseless.

22

Court said -- and I quote -- it is not unlawful to pursue


23

a meritorious lawsuit under the National Labor Relations


24

Act.

25

cited the Noerr-Pennington doctrine of the antitrust law. 


In the Bill Johnson's case, the


In fact, the Court said it twice and specifically


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Then it --


2
3

QUESTION:

How do you describe the test applied


by the board?


4

MR. BASKIN:

Well, the test by the board is one


5

which says that the employer must be -- must prevail, must


6

be 100 percent prevailing in the lawsuit.

7

that's impossible for any employer to anticipate in


8

advance.

9

of prevailing. 


10
11

As a standard


No -- no employer can ever be 100 percent sure


QUESTION:

Should there be any other component? 


I mean, I think your client lost basically.

12

MR. BASKIN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BASKIN:

So --


Well, the question is what was --

What else should be part of the test?

The test is what is the -- was


15

there an objective basis for the litigation.

16

win-or-lose test, as the Court said in Professional Real


17

Estate -- and I'll quote again -- it's got to be


18

objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable


19

litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.


20

QUESTION:

It's not a


Well, should the test from


21

Professional Real Estate automatically be carried over to


22

the Labor Relations Act?


23

MR. BASKIN:

Well, in this case, Your Honor, an


24

answer is yes because the Court itself has interacted with


25

the -- both of the acts.

They cross reference with each

other.

Motor Transport.

3

Bill Johnson's as if it's one consistent whole.

4

is.


5

Bill Johnson's referred directly to the California

Professional Real Estate referred to


QUESTION:

And it


Well, but I -- I wonder if -- if the


6

National Labor Relations Board doesn't have some


7

discretion to say that the labor situation is somewhat


8

different, as they apparently do, from the antitrust


9

situation. 


10

MR. BASKIN:

Well, but the irony here is that


11

the NLRB has not -- has not interpreted its own statute. 


12

It's not being deferred to here.

13

this Court's decision in Bill Johnson's.


14
15

QUESTION:

The NLRB is interpreting


Which happened to say precisely what


the NLRB said it said. 


16

MR. BASKIN:

17

QUESTION:

Well, no, Your Honor.

In Bill --


If a judgment goes against the


18

employer in the State court, if it goes against him, then


19

he's had his day in court.

20

to adjudicate the unfair practice claim, and then the


21

employer's suit, having been proved unmeritorious, the


22

board can take that fact into account when it decides the


23

labor law violation.


24

MR. BASKIN:

25

QUESTION:

And then the board may proceed


Three --

And you've been reading three cases

Period.

I


End of the


That's what the board decides. 


4

Now, I put that so you'll reply to it.


5

MR. BASKIN:

Yes.

Three things in the phrasing


6

that you just said.

7

proceed, did not say it's an automatic result.

8

adjudicate the unfair labor practice, did not say it's an


9

automatic result. 


10

First, the Court said the board may

Said may


And then key phrase, having proved to be


11

unmeritorious, what does unmeritorious mean?

12

Court has consistently said what unmeritorious means.

13

said so before Bill Johnson's in the Christiansburg case.


14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BASKIN:

16

QUESTION:

Well, this

It


Mr. Baskin, back up a bit. 

Yes. 

The -- the Court in that very


17

paragraph gave a definition of what it meant.

18

wouldn't look outside this document for what the Court


19

meant by with merit/without merit when the -- look at the


20

sentence in the middle of that paragraph.

21

judgment goes against the employer and the State court.


22

MR. BASKIN:

23

QUESTION:

So, I


It says if the


Yes. 

Judgment against you.

Or if his suit


24

is withdrawn or is otherwise shown to be without merit. 


25

Otherwise shown to be merit.

I took that to mean if you

6

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

lose, it's shown to be without merit.

2

situations in which it's shown to be without merit.

3

it seems to me the best place to find out what the Court


4

meant merit/without merit is the very opinion that we're


5

construing. 


6

MR. BASKIN:

There may be other

So,


Yes, and if it were the holding of


7

the opinion, it would have greater weight.

8

not the holding that we're talking -- that we're parsing


9

out here.

10

But this is


This is dicta because the essential --

QUESTION:

Well, there are two responses to the


11

dicta point it seems to me.

12

dicta, but it was dicta that preceded a remand in which


13

this issue in fact would be explored.

14

response is the -- as I understand it, the board itself


15

has followed the -- the dicta for -- I forget how many


16

years now, but consistently followed it and Congress has


17

done nothing about it.

18

and B, even if it is, isn't it the kind of dicta that at


19

this point definitely should be followed? 


20

MR. BASKIN:

The first one is it was


And the second


So, A, query whether it's dicta,


It is clearly dicta because the


21

Court stated what was the issue before it, and the sole


22

issue before it in Bill Johnson's is stated at the


23

beginning of the opinion, whether the NLRB may issue a


24

cease and desist order to halt the prosecution of a State


25

court civil suit brought by an employer to retaliate

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

against employees. 


2

And the holding of the case, which analyzes the


3

First Amendment at great length, says that the right of


4

access to the courts is too important to be an unfair


5

labor practice.

6

reasonable basis, language in the Court's opinion. 


7

And it also defines meritorious as being


QUESTION:

I think there's another element that


8

you're ignoring.

9

whether it was a meritless lawsuit against the unions and


10

I thought the board looked both at


whether it was for a retaliatory purpose.


11

MR. BASKIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BASKIN:

14

Isn't that the other element?

Yes.

Both elements must be


present.


15
16

Yes.


QUESTION:
retaliatory purpose?

17

MR. BASKIN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. BASKIN:

Okay.

And how do we define


What -- what constitutes that --

Well, it's --

-- do you think, in the board's rule?

Yes.

It's very -- pretty much the


20

same as the improper motivation purpose test that was in


21

the Professional Real Estate case, which also has the two-


22

part test.

23

then and only then if there's no objective basis, you look


24

at whether there was a retaliatory motive. 


25

You look at the objective basis first, and


And how that's defined, although the Court did

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not grant cert on that issue, we contested vigorously the


2

-- the board's finding of retaliatory motivation here --


3

because in fact the board has made it a rubber stamp. 


4

It's become automatic if the case relates in any way to


5

union activity, the board finds that it's retaliatory


6

motivation. 


7

But the first part of the test is an objective


8

one that the Court has spelled out both in Bill Johnson's


9

itself and in Professional Real Estate.

And to take any


10

-- to take the board's standard puts employers in an


11

impossible situation.

12

the question of dicta or not, you have ambiguous language


13

at best because we have several different references to


14

meritorious throughout the Bill Johnson's opinion. 


15

QUESTION:

It is unworkable.

Going back to


May I just ask this, Mr. Baskin?

Do


16

you think there is a distinction between an ongoing case


17

and a completed case? 


18

MR. BASKIN:

It's one mostly as to timing and


19

facts available to the board, and I think that's what the


20

Court was --


21

QUESTION:

But the -- in your view, the standard


22

is the same.

It's not that the board tries to enjoin the


23

proceeding as -- as opposed to later on bringing an unfair


24

labor practice after it's over.


25

MR. BASKIN:

The substantive standard should be

9

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the same. 


2

QUESTION:

3

MR. BASKIN:

4

QUESTION:

5

It should be, but --

Should be.

-- do you think that Johnson says


it's the same? 


6

MR. BASKIN:

We're all here today because the


7

language in the tail end of the Bill Johnson's opinion is


8

ambiguous as to what they intended the standard to be.


9
10

QUESTION:
different standard. 


11

MR. BASKIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

As to -- the -- the impact was --

And your view is there should be no


different standard. 


14

MR. BASKIN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BASKIN:

17

And at least it says there's a


Correct.

And that's the whole key to the case.

That really is the whole key to the


case.


18

QUESTION:

And why not? 


19

QUESTION:

Mr. Baskin, is your -- is your


20

argument -- in your opening remarks, you -- you referred


21

only to the First Amendment.

22

constitutional argument you're making?

23

with you here, do I have to agree that if Congress passed


24

a law adopting the English rule on -- on attorney's fees,


25

that would be unconstitutional? 


Is -- is it -- is it a

To -- to agree

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BASKIN:

No.

We are not saying that.

We


2

are not seeking to constitutionally -- we are asking no


3

more than that you apply this standard to the two statutes


4

you've already applied it --


5

QUESTION:

6

Which says -- so, it's a statutory


argument. 


7

MR. BASKIN:

No.

It is a constitutional and


8

statutory argument, which is what the Court itself said in


9

both of these cases because there's a sanction involved.


10
11

QUESTION:

it -- does the Constitution prohibit it or not?


12
13

MR. BASKIN:

QUESTION:

MR. BASKIN:

17

QUESTION:

So, your


Constitutional and statutory.

You -- you cannot -- that Congress


could not adopt the English rule. 


19
20

The Constitution prohibits.

answer to my question is --


16

18

It prohibits a statute from


prohibiting it. 


14
15

I don't know what you mean by a -- is


MR. BASKIN:

No.

The difference -- here's the


important difference. 


21

QUESTION:

22

MR. BASKIN:

It would do that by statute.

But is there an -- a declaration of


23

unlawfulness involved?

There are many fee-shifting


24

statutes.

25

but the National Labor Relations Board is saying that BE&K


We're not taking issue with mere fee-shifting,


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

broke the law, and that's what also happened under the


2

antitrust laws.

3

and desist order from filing so-called nonmeritorious


4

litigation.


5

They're saying -- they're issuing a cease


QUESTION:

But the fact that it's triple damages


6

is a little different than fee-shifting.

7

easily say, when you're exposed to treble damages,


8

putative damages, yes, that's a punishment.

9

shifting is the rule in most countries in the world. 


10

So, what is the more here?

So, one could


Here fee-


I understand the


11

more in antitrust cases, treble damages.

Here you say,


12

well, there's a finding that you have committed an unfair


13

labor practice.

14

that you have to pay the other side's legal fees?

15

are the adverse consequences --


16

MR. BASKIN:

What are the consequences in addition to

What


First, the most important is the


17

declaration that you are a law violator in and of itself. 


18

You have to post a notice for your employees not only at


19

this job site but all across the country.

20

-- your customers become aware of it.

21

certainly make sure your customers become aware of it. 


22

There's the serious danger of debarment either privately


23

or by governmental action.


24
25

QUESTION:

Explain that.

You have your


The unions


You did say that in


your brief about debarment, and I didn't -- I can

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

understand when you say someone -- someone's reputation is


2

affected by being labeled a law violator.

3

something about -- about the jeopardy of debarment and I


4

wasn't clear how that would work. 


5

MR. BASKIN:

But you said


It's not meant in the legal sense


6

and the Government -- we're not -- we're not talking about


7

whether the Government has to debar the company, but both


8

private actors and many Government contracting officers


9

take the view they don't want to deal with people who have


10

been declared to be law violators.

11

reputation of the company is at stake.


12

QUESTION:

The goodwill and


Well, in our lower case, the --


13

Wisconsin set out to do that on a State basis, didn't it? 


14

If you violated the Labor Act, the State was not going to


15

deal with you.


16

MR. BASKIN:

Yes, they did.

And then the


17

Federal Government just last -- 2 years ago in the


18

previous administration, had come through with a set of


19

rules saying that companies would be debarred if they were


20

found to have violated labor laws. 


21

So, having this -- a declaration of illegality


22

in place is what makes this different, Justice Scalia,


23

from a random fee-shifting statute, and that's why we are


24

not asking you to do anything other than what you've


25

already done, which is to apply the First Amendment to two

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statutes which you have determined have great commonality


2

over the years, as each one keeps referring back to the


3

other in this doctrine. 


4

QUESTION:

What do you do with the 2 decades


5

that have elapsed -- about 2 decades -- since Justice


6

White's opinion which has been interpreted by the board


7

the way the language most naturally reads?

8

is to say when the case first came out it was ambiguous.


9

But now we have 2 decades of consistent interpretation of


10

The one thing


that language by the board.


11

MR. BASKIN:

I regret to say it's a tribute to


12

the speed of the board's processes and the process of


13

getting this case up to this level on this issue because


14

this case alone has taken 7 years to work its way through


15

the board.

16

was 1987.

17

considerable doubt as exactly -- as to exactly what it


18

meant.

19

that are part of the appendix, the unions raised Bill


20

Johnson's and said that it -- they were protected under


21

it, citing it interchangeably with Professional Real


22

Estate.


23
24
25

When the litigation was begun in this case, it

The Bill Johnson's case was fresh.

Didn't they win -- they won some 15


MR. BASKIN:

Depending on how you count, they


just barely got over 50 percent. 


5

QUESTION:

Did you ask -- talking about the


6

history of the case, could you tell me how did this case


7

end up in the Sixth Circuit? 


8
9

MR. BASKIN:

Well, in fact, by the time this


case got to the court of appeals, BE&K was no longer doing


10

business in California.

11

business was in the Sixth Circuit. 


12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BASKIN:

14

The gravamen of its doing


I see. 

And that's why the decision was


made --


15

QUESTION:

I'd like you to address, if I can go


16

back to the -- what I think was the Chief Justice's


17

question.

18

with you, as I will, for the moment that the language is


19

ambiguous in Bill Johnson, is that we should treat or the


20

statute should be interpreted as treating the antitrust


21

statute and the labor statute a case brought by a


22

defendant the same way. 


23

Your -- your basic point, I take it, assuming


And obvious differences, which I'd like you to


24

address, are that, one, there is a history in the labor


25

law of employers using cases brought at law either to

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

break unions or to win disputes.

And that was one of the


2

reasons why the NLRA was passed.

That had nothing to do


3

with the antitrust laws.

4

There is no such history.


Second, the employer -- the -- the matter is


5

committed to an expert board in the labor area, which


6

apparently believes that the way to enforce the labor law,


7

unlike the antitrust law, is to say the sham exception


8

exists before the case is decided, but once the case is


9

decided, we're going to keep employers out of the courts


10

by saying if they lose, that's the end of any immunity


11

that they get.

12

was in bringing this lawsuit.

13

We have a different history.

And we will now look to what their motive


14

MR. BASKIN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BASKIN:

We have an expert board. 

We have different statutes.


The --

And now, what is your response?

The irony is that the Court


17

considered those purported differences in the Bill


18

Johnson's case and rejected them.


19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BASKIN:

21

All right.
No, no.

Obviously -- look --

I'm talking about the


first part. 


22

QUESTION:

I -- but I'm trying to stay away from


23

Bill Johnson because obviously if you're right that the


24

statute holds it, I mean, I -- all right.

25

Sorry.

Go ahead. 


I didn't mean to interrupt.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BASKIN:

Well, to me it's -- the interesting


2

thing about this case is the Court has itself considered


3

these very questions that you're raising and you have


4

answered them, and you do not need to revisit them to --


5

to come out with the conclusion that the NLRB has either


6

misinterpreted the standard or that the standard is


7

unworkable. 


8
9

QUESTION:

Well, but I -- I have -- I have the


same question that I think underlies Justice Breyer's


10

concern.

11

board's interest in stopping a purely retaliatory suit. 


12

The board says, now, you have organized this clerical unit


13

and if -- if you persist in your union activity, we're


14

going to sue you for the way you've been keeping our


15

books.

16

blah, blah, blah.

17

the suit, they can do that in your -- or am I misstating


18

your view?


19

You would seem to give zero weight to the


We're going to sue you for malpractice, blah,

It has


We are not here defending


Well, I suppose there's always abuse

of process if there's -- but if there's some basis, then

you can use it specifically to retaliate.

More than some.

reasonable basis.
QUESTION:

You can specifically use it to


retaliate. 


4

MR. BASKIN:

The Court -- this Court has said


5

that if there is an objective basis, that means it's a


6

meritorious lawsuit.

7

of retaliation.

8
9

Then there may also be a motivation


Weighty, countervailing considerations.


QUESTION:

But -- but we're talking -- we're


talking in -- in the labor context. 


10

MR. BASKIN:

11

QUESTION:

Yes. 

And you lose the suit.

So, there's


12

-- you do not -- you're not the prevailing party in the


13

suit.

14

the board can do about it if you've done it specifically


15

to retaliate and for no other purpose. 


16

And you -- you lose on the merits.

MR. BASKIN:

There's nothing


If it is a reasonable, meritorious


17

suit, as this Court has defined it, where the right of


18

access to a court is too important to be called an unfair


19

labor practice solely on the ground that what is sought in


20

the court is to enjoin employees from exercising a


21

protected right because of the First Amendment to the


22

Constitution, the right to petition the courts with a


23

meritorious lawsuit. 


24
25

QUESTION:

But the First Amendment argument goes


by the boards once the case is over.

MR. BASKIN:

No, Your Honor, because -- for the

Estate.

guessed with 20/20 hindsight as long as it had a


5

reasonable basis for the suit. 


The employer has the right not to be second


6

QUESTION:

Yes, but that ignores the fact that


7

we're not concerned solely with chilling; we're also


8

concerned with retaliation.

9

retaliatory character of the lawsuit involved, I would


And if we didn't have the


10

think you would have a much stronger argument as you just


11

made it.

12

we can accept your -- in effect, your chilling argument


13

without ignoring the retaliatory character. 


14
15

But the retaliation is there and I don't see how


MR. BASKIN:

Because the employers are being


chilled and, in effect, the retaliation --


16

QUESTION:

Well, they're being chilled in -- in


17

engaging in retaliation for the exercise of statutory


18

rights.


19

MR. BASKIN:

But there's actually less


20

retaliation that's going to take place once the suit is


21

completed.

22

should be instructed to intervene sooner to keep the


23

employees from having to spend more money to defend


24

themselves. 


25

If that were the standard, then the board

we've got a federalism interest in letting the State

answer to that objection.

MR. BASKIN:

We've got a --


So, that's the

compelling interest.

under.

QUESTION:

You have two statutes, Federal


All right.

Let's go back then to the


10

-- to the difference between the two Federal statutes. 


11

The premise of Justice Breyer's question a moment ago


12

accepted the ambiguity.

13

if we read Bill Johnson's the way Justice Ginsburg read it


14

-- and I will be candid to say I read it -- number one,


15

the ambiguity does not leap out at us. 


16

If we are not that indulgent and


And number two, I'd like to go back to Justice


17

Ginsburg's question.

18

ambiguity at the beginning, we have had 20 years of board


19

practice which seems to me to have dissipated any


20

ambiguity.

21
22
23

Even if we assume there was


What's your response to that?

MR. BASKIN:

Well, the ambiguity was in the


opinion that led the board to take an erroneous view --

QUESTION:

That's right I believe, and the board


24

has made it very clear how the board is reading it, and


25

after 20 years, we've got a pretty clearly settled body of

MR. BASKIN:

Well, a settled body of erroneous


And is that what the Court --


4

QUESTION:

And we're interpreting statutes --


5

the -- the settled body is clear and Congress is


6

apparently quite agreeable to it. 


7

MR. BASKIN:

Well, first, the Court has said you


8

don't defer -- that -- that you can't read anything into


9

congressional inaction, particularly when it has taken


10

this long before the board ruling really was definitive. 


11

And it has taken that long.

12

for most of that 20-year period. 


13
14
15

17

The issue has been in doubt


But the -- going beyond that, the -- the

board --

QUESTION:

I don't understand that.

Why do you


say it's been in doubt for most of the 20-year period?

MR. BASKIN:

Because it's been in doubt.

like this one have been taking a long time to wind their

Absolutely. 

Has the board ever taken a different

There have been dissents, but no,


So, the board's position has been

The board is slow.

It may take the

MR. BASKIN:

But the board is not entitled to


12

or of this Court's decision.

14

talking about here is the board's interpretation of the

And that's all that we're


It's not


I think we're not raising -- I think

geared to an issue of deference.

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And there is a good reason, which underlies


2

ultimately our -- our approach to stare decisis in


3

statutory cases, for letting settled statutory


4

understandings stayed settled unless the legislative


5

branch wants to change them.

6

we're getting at, not deference. 


7

MR. BASKIN:

And that's the argument


Well, it is -- stare decisis is a


8

form of deference, and we're talking about stare decisis


9

would apply to the Court's own opinion.

Only this Court


10

is required to defer to itself about its own opinion. 


11

Your -- and so that's why we are talking about deference,


12

I would submit.

13

asking should you stick with what the board has come up


14

with.

At least I interpret your question as


This Court has not ruled on --

MR. BASKIN:

I'm saying that --

I'm saying that in -- as -- as your


19

own answers indicate, for 20 years there seems to have


20

been a -- a settled practice on the part of the board


21

which at best is not inconsistent with our opinion.

22

shouldn't we let a settled statutory regime stay settled


23

unless the legislative branch wants to change it? 


24
25

MR. BASKIN:

I contest that it's a settled


statutory regime, that we are dealing with a First

Why


1

Amendment right, and that the board's outcome, which it


2

has taken this long to reach back to the court, is wrong


3

under the First Amendment.

4

and it subjects employers to the impossible situation in


5

future cases and in cases going on right now that they are


6

expected to have 100 percent certainty of the outcome.


7

It has proved to be unworkable


Indeed, the -- the board could, under this

standard, say that you can win a jury verdict, go -- have


9

it upheld by the district court, only to be reversed by an


10

appeals court, and still be found under this Court's


11

standard to be nonmeritorious and you lose.

12

you have violated the law.

QUESTION:

14

MR. BASKIN:

You have --


If there's a retaliatory motive. 

If there's a retaliatory motive. 

There's a retaliatory motive. 


15

And that's all it takes.

16

You go through all of that based on an attack on your

lawsuits.

19

to spend the money to do it, but they're under attack.

general situation.

MR. BASKIN:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Well --

We're trying to carve out a -- an


exception where you're home free from that. 

MR. BASKIN:

Well, no, it's the board that's


6

carving out an exception from the basic First Amendment


7

protection that this Court has recognized already. 


8
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Baskin, that -- that goes back


every time to how you construe this paragraph, and so if


10

the position that Justice White is making a distinction


11

here between, on the one hand, an ongoing proceeding --


12

the First Amendment says you can't stop it.

13

deference to State courts.

14

that weighs it to the same end, but traditionally under


15

the First Amendment, a prior restraint, stop it, has been


16

what the Court has looked at most cautiously.

17

Justice White tells us, but it's different once the


18

adjudication is over. 


19

Never mind


That's another consideration


Then


The -- the line between prior restraint and


20

subsequent punishment goes all the way through First


21

Amendment learning, and you treat this as, well,


22

ambiguous, but if it were clear it's that there's any


23

difference between stopping an ongoing proceeding and


24

looking at a situation after it's been adjudicated?


25

MR. BASKIN:

There -- there can be a difference,

25

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

QUESTION:

Well, listen a little more closely.


11

Do you disagree with Mr. Baskin's contention


12

that the word meritorious is used inconsistently in the


13

part of Bill Johnson's that we're talking about?


14

MR. WALLACE:

I do disagree with that, and --


15

and no court of appeals that has reviewed board decisions

Now, you know, it said what would happen in that

here is whether the Court was wrong to say that. 


10

I mean, it -- it

It may be the


The Court did not have before it a case in which


But the issue that your opponent wants to argue


MR. WALLACE:

I beg to differ.

The Court


11

specifically noted that some of the claims of the employer

had already been dismissed in the State courts, and in

1

MR. WALLACE:

In any event, if I may turn now to


2

address the question that the Court asked the parties to


3

address in formulating the question presented here.

4

submission in this case is that this Court's holding in


5

Professional Real Estate Investors interpreting the


6

antitrust laws and the Court's decision in Bill Johnson's,


7

including this -- these dicta to govern further


8

proceedings interpreting the National Labor Relations Act,


9

are entirely compatible with one another in light of the


Our


10

important differences in the purposes, processes,


11

remedies, and practicalities of enforcement that were


12

implicated in the two statutory schemes at issue.


13

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I have one particular


14

difference in mind that I'd like you to comment on.

15

I -- it's -- it seems to me that what is sought to be done


16

here is much worse as far as the independence of the


17

courts and the guarantee of access to the courts by -- by


18

the citizenry is concerned than what was sought to be done


19

in -- in -- what case -- Professional Real Estate.


20

And this is the difference.

I --


In Professional


21

Real Estate, it would have been the courts that would have


22

decided the facts which would have imposed upon the losing


23

party attorney's fees.

24

be the Labor Board that will decide the factual question


25

of whether there was a retaliatory motive, and the courts


In this situation, it is going to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

will have to defer to that factual finding if there is a


2

basis in the record, whether the courts agree with it or


3

not.


4

I find it quite offensive to think that Article


5

III courts are going to be told that certain people who


6

have come to them for relief will pay a penalty for doing


7

so on the basis of a retaliatory motive found not by


8

Article III courts at all but by the labor court -- but by


9

the Labor Board.

In that respect, this case is much worse


10

than -- than what was going on in -- in Professional Real


11

Estate.


12

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the board is not


13

contradicting anything found by the courts.

14

of retaliatory motive was not at issue in the underlying


15

litigation, and the board has to wait under this Court's

decision in Bill Johnson's before it addresses the

question of whether there's been an unfair labor

practice --

times the board has imposed this kind of an unfair labor

decisions in which it -- it ordered a union to do so. 


6

Now, is -- is there some reason that unions are not using


7

lawyers as much as companies are these days?


8
9

MR. WALLACE:

Since the

are less apt to bring lawsuits to interfere with the


11

rights of employees under section 7 for concerted

activity.

We're talking about a retaliation against


QUESTION:

Usually that's been the subject of


There were union lawsuits in this

MR. WALLACE:

Plenty of them. 


But those were against the


19

employer, and -- and they --


20

QUESTION:

But suits -- suits against the


21

employer can certainly be brought to impair the -- the


22

rights of the employees not to -- not to unionize.


23

MR. WALLACE:

That would have to be a showing a


24

violation by the union of 8(b)(4), not -- not that the


25

lawsuit was an 8(a)(1) violation against the concerted

activities rights of employees.

2

to show that the union lawsuit violated duties that the


3

union owes, and that was resolved against the employer on


4

the merits in this case because the -- the subject of the


5

lawsuits was about working conditions at the site of


6

employment, which was a legitimate union concern.


7

QUESTION:

The employer would have


Never -- never mind the 26 to 3. 


8

Just -- just tell me why I -- as -- as an Article III


9

judge, I should not be concerned about leaving it to a


10

Federal agency to make the factual finding that will


11

determine whether somebody will be punished for bringing a


12

reasonable lawsuit, although one which ultimately loses in


13

Federal courts.

14

Why shouldn't I be concerned about that?


MR. WALLACE:

Well, this isn't punishment.

It's


15

make-whole relief under an administrative scheme which is


16

meant to protect employees in the exercise of their


17

concerted rights, and it involves no contradiction of any


18

issue that was before the -- the court in the underlying


19

litigation which did not have occasion to address whether


20

the suit was brought for a retaliatory purpose.


21

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, Mr. Baskin told us that


22

there are punitive aspects to this that could lead to


23

debarment he said.

24

fee-shifting, but that there are heavy consequences. 


25

So, it's not simply to provide for

1

Chief Justice referred earlier, Wisconsin Department of

Industrial Relations against Gould, was one in which this


3

Court held that Wisconsin law was preempted, and Wisconsin


4

could not refuse to make purchases, State purchases, from


5

companies that had been found to have violated the


6

National Labor Relations Act because the whole purpose of


7

the remedy scheme under the National Labor Relations Act


8

is remedial and the remedies are limited, and the idea is


9

to get labor disputes behind us, not to have disruptions


10

of the economy, to keep productivity going, and to keep


11

the people employed. 


12

QUESTION:

Well, is -- is the point of this


13

colloquy whether or not this act can be called punitive or


14

this NLRB doctrine can be called punitive?

Maybe you think nothing -- maybe you think nothing turns

on that.

MR. WALLACE:

-- that anything would turn on it, but it is not punitive. 


20

The only remedy that's granted is a make-whole remedy that

the result is to leave it to the board to decide whether

meritorious but ultimately unsuccessful suit in Federal

court?


5

MR. WALLACE:

Well, board proceedings are much


6

less burdensome than -- than court proceedings to those


7

that are issue, and the Court held in Bill Johnson's that


8

the board remedy of recompensing the defendants who


9

prevailed in this suit for their costs, because the suit


10

was brought to defeat their section 7 rights, was a


11

permissible remedy by the board.

13

QUESTION:

We held it or -- or said it.

I mean,


that -- that's one of the disputes here, isn't it?

MR. WALLACE:

Yes.

They held it in the sense of

-- of prescribing that rule for the further proceedings to

be held in that very case on remand from the Court's

order.

QUESTION:

We're just going around the dictum

is whether that was a wise thing to say.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I -- do you agree that


2

under the board's rule here that it does allow the board


3

to find the unfair labor practice and impose the sanctions


4

on litigation brought by employers that is not limited to


5

just shams and abuse of process? 


6

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

That's --


It does allow the imposition of these


8

things for an employer suit that could be considered


9

objectively reasonable at the time it was brought.


10

MR. WALLACE:

Exactly so.

That -- I thought the


11

Court made it quite clear in Bill Johnson's that as long


12

as the suit was an unmeritorious one, in the sense that it


13

did not prevail, the board could afford the limited remedy


14

that's available under the act. 


15

QUESTION:

Well, does that have the necessary


16

effect of at least chilling some conduct that is protected


17

by the First Amendment?

18

You have to -- you would have to concede that it does.


19

MR. WALLACE:

I mean, it seems to me it does. 


But it -- it's a far less daunting


20

situation than what the Court was faced with under the


21

antitrust laws in the Professional Real Estate Investors


22

case. 


23

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, isn't it correct that


24

the scope of chilling is limited to those with a


25

retaliatory motive?

36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

Absolutely.

Federal courts on their own find a retaliatory motive.

MR. WALLACE:

But, of course, the board's


findings are subject to judicial review. 

QUESTION:

For -- so long as there's substantial


evidence, which means -- you know. 


11

MR. WALLACE:

Correct.


12

QUESTION:

All right.

QUESTION:

In every 8(a)(1) case, the

retaliatory motive is found by the board.

the statutory proceeding, isn't it?


16

MR. WALLACE:

17

QUESTION:

That's part of


That is correct.


The other parts of this statutory


18

proceeding do not exclude the Federal courts from their


19

business, do they, which this does by imposing penalties


20

upon people who come to the Federal courts?


21

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think this Court's make it


22

quite -- this Court's decisions make it quite clear that


23

under the National Labor Relations Act, it is board rather


24

than courts that have the responsibility of ruling about


25

unfair labor practices.

1

QUESTION:

We agree with that and the only issue


2

is whether that statutory provision places within the


3

board the power to impose this particular sanction for an


4

unfair labor practice, a penalty for bringing a


5

meritorious lawsuit. 


6

MR. WALLACE:

7

QUESTION:

Well, make-whole relief --


Isn't the make-whole relief simply


8

that they've said, since ours is a statute which foresees


9

taking labor disputes out of the courts and putting them


10

into the board, since that's why it was passed, we're


11

going to say a -- a loser in a Federal lawsuit that


12

violates that basic underlying purpose has to pay


13

attorney's fees to the winner?

14

here other than that?


15

MR. WALLACE:

Now, is there anything


Not -- not at all.

That's -- that


16

is what is at issue, and the -- the National Labor


17

Relations Act authorizes the board, under this Court's


18

opinion in Bill Johnson's, to afford that kind of a


19

limited remedy --


20

QUESTION:

Well, isn't what --


21

QUESTION:

Is the courts' -- is the board's


22

definition of a unmeritorious lawsuit simply one which --


23

in which the plaintiff does not get what the plaintiff


24

wants.

25

It's thrown out of court, so to speak.

MR. WALLACE:

That's approximately it, yes, Mr.

MR. WALLACE:

Why do you


Well, there can -- there can be


5

cases in which a voluntary dismissal was taken with


6

prejudice.

7

unmeritorious suit becomes a debatable question.

8

ordinarily it's one, as it was in this case, in which the


9

courts have ruled against claims that the employer made. 


10

Sometimes the question of whether it was an


QUESTION:

But


Is there any

authority?

12

maybe there would be some authority like a -- an


13

electricity generating regulator would have said in

certain kinds of lawsuits, you have to have fee-shifting. 


15

The SEC might say in certain kinds of lawsuits, certain


16

companies have to pay attorney's fees.

18

certain instances the barbers have to pay the legal fees


19

of somebody else.

any other place that you've found? 


21

I mean, I thought, as a matter of proposition,


The barbers'


Is -- is there any comparable authority


It -- it doesn't seem to me an absurd


22

proposition of law or of constitutional law that a


23

regulator who's in charge of a particular group of


24

individuals or businesses says in particular circumstances


25

there will be fee-shifting.

But maybe that's total --

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we -- we didn't come up with

analogies in which regulatory agencies do the fee-

for fee-shifting.

them. 


7

There are certainly many statutes that provide

That's what our


And here with -- with no


10

more explicitness than there was in the case in Summit


11

Valley, the -- the agency is assuming the power to fee-


12

shift and to make the factual determination upon which the


13

fee-shifting turns.

14

I think that's extraordinary. 


MR. WALLACE:

Well, there is not a reference to


15

fee-shifting as such in the National Labor Relations Act,


16

but Congress did say in section 8(a)(1) that it shall be


17

an unfair labor practice to an employee to interfere with,


18

restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the


19

concerted activity rights for mutual aid and protection


20

that are guaranteed in section 7.

21

Johnson's recognized that there had been a history of the

use of the courts for that purpose.

In -- in a case like this, if we have

essentially these facts, if the finding of the board was

Alderson Reporting Company

is that the purpose of the employer in bringing the suit


2

was because the employer's board of directors met and they


3

say, we are being hurt in the marketplace, public opinion


4

is against us, we must bring these suits to protect our


5

position in the business community, I take it that is a


6

retaliatory motive.


7

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the retaliatory motive would


8

be -- it would have to be shown that the suit was brought


9

for the purpose of coercing, discouraging, suppressing,


10

restraining the employees in the exercise of their rights.

QUESTION:

Well, but you -- you know what I'm

19

QUESTION:

The


In other words, Noerr-Pennington


doesn't have a constitutional underpinning. 

MR. WALLACE:

It -- it certainly construed the


20

antitrust laws in light of the fact that those laws focus


21

mostly on private conduct in the marketplace, not on


22

petitioning for Government-imposed restraints, and that


23

there was a need in construing them not to -- to allow


24

improper chilling of the bringing of lawsuits or other


25

forms of petitioning activity. 

42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And in -- in Professional Real Estate itself,


2

the procedural posture focused on the need for summary


3

judgment to be available against a counterclaim for treble


4

damages under the antitrust laws in circumstances in which


5

the counterclaimant, after the underlying copyright


6

infringement suit was found to be objectively reasonable,


7

was saying, but I still need further discovery in order to


8

ascertain the intent and motives of the original plaintiff


9

in bringing the copyright infringement suit because it's


10

my view that -- that they didn't really expect to prevail


11

and that they were bringing it for anticompetitive


12

purposes. 


13

And the danger that the Court was addressing


14

there was that much of the protective quality of the Noerr


15

doctrine itself could be undermined if the original


16

lawsuit that supposedly is protected could be chilled by


17

the prospect of burdensome discovery and treble damages.


18

QUESTION:

My -- my concern -- my concern is --


19

is this, is that the First Amendment has its own


20

corrective counterspeech, but what the board has done here


21

is it's defined retaliatory motive so broadly that it's


22

taken away that First Amendment corrective.

23

itself a distortion of First Amendment principles which


24

allowed the unions to bring these suits in the first


25

place, it seems to me. 


And that is

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WALLACE:

Well, there -- there is a very


2

limited remedy available here compared to the prospect


3

that treble damages might be awarded on the basis of


4

rather unpredictable findings about subjective motivation


5

in bringing the lawsuit.

6

that's been applied against a background of what this


7

Court in Bill Johnson's referred to as a -- a powerful


8

tool.

9

And it -- it -- it's a remedy


Powerful was the word the Court used.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, is retaliatory motive --


10

is that before us in this case?

11

this Court, by saying that the board -- that there was,


12

even in this case, insufficient evidence of retaliatory


13

motive, but I didn't think that was the question presented


14

here.


15
16
17

MR. WALLACE:

I mean, it may be that


I agree with you on that point,


Justice Ginsburg. 

QUESTION:

Because on that, I was going to ask


18

you, well, what is it that shows that this was in


19

retaliation for violation of section 7 rights instead of


20

being in -- in response to the union's desire simply to


21

harass the employer?

22

questions about that, but my view was of this case that --


23

that wasn't before us.

MR. WALLACE:

25

I think that there are very serious

1

QUESTION:

I take it -- I take it the background


2

of this case is that there was a finding of retaliatory


3

motive and we have to make our decision based upon the way


4

the board interprets retaliatory motive in cases such as


5

this. 


6

MR. WALLACE:

Well, it's certainly part of the


7

background of the case, but the Court did limit the grant


8

of certiorari to whether these two decisions are


9

compatible given the differences between the two acts.


10

QUESTION:

And we have to defer both to the


11

board's determination of what constitutes a retaliatory


12

motive and, even more so, to the board's factual


13

determination that retaliatory motive existed.

14

takes is one witness who says it existed, and that would


15

constitute substantial evidence.

16

with that witness, the courts have to effectively penalize

the company for seeking resort in the courts.

And if the board goes


Well, there is seldom direct

evidence of that kind, although occasionally there is

But the board has relied on a number of factors, which


22

we've set out on page 47 of our brief, in various -- in

various cases in seeing retaliatory motive.

one of the more persuasive ones was that the lawsuit was

MR. WALLACE:

That's correct. 


But -- but --

-- was about the compatibility of

the Court's decision in Professional Real Estate with what


11

we had taken to be the Court's clear prescription of the


12

limits on the remedy of the 8(a)(1) and unfair labor


13

practice in the Bill Johnson's case.


14

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, we are concerned with


15

the Bill Johnson's case, and a question has been raised


16

about where does the authority to come -- come from for


17

this fee-shifting.

It does appear in the Court's opinion


18

in Bill Johnson's.

If a violation is found, the board may

wrongfully sued, for their attorney's fees.

of the courts for retaliatory litigation that whether the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MAURICE BASKIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


15

MR. BASKIN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I would


16

just briefly like to address the question of retaliatory


17

motive, but only as I understood the Justices' questions


18

to be does it suffice alone so that they -- the board can


19

rightly ignore the question of the objective basis.

20

-- and the reason it does not suffice, among others, is


21

perhaps looking at the 26 decisions Justice Scalia found,


22

there's only one among them where there was no finding of


23

retaliatory motive and there only because it was found


24

that the action didn't relate in any way to the union


25

activity.

13

lose.

14

Well, if it


The employers lose. 

And what the result of that is, is that no


15

employer can go to court if any sort of protected activity


16

is even arguably involved because even if you convene a


17

panel of experts, as BE&K did in this case, and go as far


18

as you can to make sure you are not trampling on any

employee rights, if you go to court, you will be found to
