 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER C. PHILLIPS

8

10

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

 This Court has made clear that class actions

12

are only appropriate when the plaintiff's proof is

13

tailored to their specific theory of liability in a way

14

that allows classwide injury to be determined in one

15

stroke, and that the lower courts must engage in a

16

rigorous analysis in order to demonstrate that fact.

17

 In this Federal Fair Labor Standards Act,

18

the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue a class of more

19

than 3300 employees who occupied job  more than 400

20

jobs which required widely differing amounts of time to

21

perform their donning, doffing, and washing tasks.

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, is that so?

23

Because as far as I understand this, there was some

24

donning and doffing that was common, that is, there was

25

some sanitation and some protective gear that they all

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

4
1

had to wear.  And then there was a difference between

2

the night  knife wielders and the others, but they

3

weren't all that different.  So in one case, one wore

4

mesh aprons, and in the other case, rubber aprons.  It

5

didn't seem to be that wide disparity.

6
7

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, there  there are a

number of answers to that, Justice Ginsburg.

8

 First of all, if you  if you just look at

9

the activities that Dr. Mericle specifically testified

10

about, for certain activities, he found some employees

11

who take 30 seconds to get dressed and others who took

12

more than 10 minutes to get dressed 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

14

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

15
16

Well, but you didn't 
 in certain circumstances

in 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 the statistical

17

mechanism of your own, you didn't have a Daubert

18

objection to the testimony, and you suggest in your

19

brief that uninjured plaintiffs are included in

20

aggregate damages, but you were the one that objected to

21

the bifurcated trial.  And so far as uninjured

22

plaintiffs recovering, that has to be determined on

23

remand anyway.  I  I just don't understand your

24

arguments.

25

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

There are a number of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

5
1

questions embedded in there, Justice Kennedy.

2

 The  the first one is  and we objected

3

all along to having this class certified on the basis

4

that there were a wide range of 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yeah, but once you lose

6

that, you have also other defenses:  Your own expert, a

7

Daubert objection, et cetera.

8
9

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

But Justice Kennedy, we don't

have to bring forward an expert.  What we did in this

10

case is we  we crossexamined both their  the named

11

plaintiffs, the four named plaintiffs who testified, and

12

demonstrated two things about that.

13

 One, that in general, they way overestimated

14

their own time; and two, none of their times were

15

remotely the same as Dr. Mericle's time.  So we proved

16

that.

17

 Second, we crossexamined Dr. Mericle about

18

his testimony and demonstrated again that his methods

19

were completely haphazard and scattered, and therefore

20

couldn't demonstrate.

21

 And this notion that you patch over the

22

entirety of these problems simply by averaging all of

23

the times of all of these employees is simply the kind

24

of shortcut this Court has  has rejected in the past

25

in both Comcast and WalMart.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

1

 I'm sorry, Justice.

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Phillips, I'm

3

completely at a loss as to what you're complaining

4

about.  That's exactly what you did.

5

 And what this expert did  I mean, as far

6

as I could tell, between your expert that you used to

7

calculate "gang time" and "Ktime" did exactly the same

8

thing this expert did.  You came out with a lower

9

number, but you used fewer people.  At least their

10

expert used hundreds of people instead of the few that

11

you did.  I'm  I'm just completely at a loss.

12

 Would you suggest that if one plaintiff came

13

into court, that he could not use the  this expert to

14

prove his case circumstantially to show that in fact,

15

the average is this, and he doesn't really know how much

16

time he took?  When he does it now, it may be 12 minutes

17

instead of 10?

18

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Justice Sotomayor, I would 

19

I would  yes.  I would categorically reject that,

20

because that's no more different than Employee A coming

21

into court and saying I don't know what I worked, but

22

Employee B, who does vastly different activities 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Oh, no, no.  But they

24

know what they worked.  They know that people were

25

working over 40 hours because there were time records

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

7
1
2

with respect to that.
 What you're basically saying is that Mt.

3

Clemens is completely wrong.  You can't estimate your

4

time when the employer doesn't keep records.

5

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

We  we don't have any

6

quarrel with Mt. Clemens the way it was written.  The

7

Mt. Clemens made  makes a very clear divide between

8

what needs to be proven, what the plaintiff's burden is

9

to demonstrate that he or she has worked beyond the

10

40hour work week, and then what happens if

11

that's proof 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

to that effect here.

14

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

15
16

There were time records

Right.  But there were a lot

of people who didn't work beyond the 40 hours.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.  There were

17

200andsomethingodd people that their expert showed

18

didn't work above 40 hours.  The jury knew about those.

19

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

And  and the jury rejected

20

Dr. Mericle's averaging of  of 18  18 and 20  18

21

and a half and 21 minutes, and we don't know what the

22

impact of that is.

23

 What we do know is that Fox calculated that

24

a mere three minutes' departure from Mericle's numbers

25

dropped the damages award by $1.41 million, and dropped

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

8
1

the number of plaintiffs out by close to 125.

2

 So Justice Kennedy, the small differences

3

make a big difference in  in this particular case.

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can we go back to

5

Justice Sotomayor's basic question, that is, when the

6

government sued Tyson or Tyson's predecessor and got an

7

injunction 

8

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Right.
 what Tyson's did, it

10

had its own industrial engineer observe the workers as

11

they were donning and doffing their gear, and that

12

expert averaged the times that they spent.  And it seems

13

to me that the plaintiff's expert here is doing exactly

14

the same thing that Tyson's expert did when the

15

government was bringing 

16

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

And in some ways,

17

Justice Ginsburg, that explains why we didn't bring the

18

Daubert motion that Justice Kennedy asked about because

19

the methodology isn't inherently flawed.  The problem

20

with the methodology is it's applied to the theory of

21

liability in this case.

22

 It's one thing for an employer to say, look,

23

we're entitled under the Department of Labor regulations

24

to average, as a mechanism for trying to avoid the kind

25

of picayune details and discrepancies that the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

9
1

identified in Mt. Clemens and said those can be

2

disregarded as mere trifles, we're allowed to do that.

3

And the effect of what we, in fact, did hear was to

4

round up in order to provide more time to people than

5

they might otherwise have gotten.

6

 And indeed, if you go to the pre2007 period

7

when you're talking about the people who just put on the

8

normal sanitary clothing, they were  they were all

9

given four minutes of Ktime when they  it took them

10
11

all of about 30 seconds to do that.
 So the idea that we could overcompensate

12

somebody using those kinds of data is one thing, but

13

that's a vast difference from saying that in order to 

14

to maintain as  under a rigorous analysis the idea

15

that this can proceed as a class when all you've got is

16

averaging across the widest imaginable range of  of

17

employees performing different tasks with different

18

requirements, and indeed, although I don't think 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Phillips, you say the

20

question is whether it can proceed as a class.  But it

21

seems as though that's really not the question in this

22

case because of Mt. Clemens; that what Mt. Clemens does

23

is to suggest that certain kinds of statistical evidence

24

are completely appropriate in FLSA cases generally, even

25

if they're brought by the government, or even if they're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

10
1
2

brought by a single person.
 And so the question that you really are

3

putting before us is not a Rule 23 question, it's a

4

question of whether this sort of evidence complies with

5

the Mt. Clemens standard; isn't that right?

6

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

No.  I would go  I would

7

actually go at it the other way.  I would say that the

8

first question is:  Can you use this kind of averaging

9

in a  in a run minecase period under Rule 23?  And it

10

seems to me the answer to that has to be no, that

11

this  this simply papers over the problems of the

12

class.

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But the Rule 23 inquiry,

14

Mr. Phillips, is always dependent on what the

15

substantive law is.

16
17
18

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Right.  And then the question

is 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That was true in Halliburton

19

where we said, look, if we didn't have the basic

20

presumption, we would think of this as very

21

individualized.

22

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24
25

Right.
But we have the basic

presumption, so the proof is not individualized.
 And the same thing, it seems to me, is true

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

11
1

here because of the Mt. Clemens inquiry.

2

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.
Where it says if the

4

employer hasn't kept the appropriate records, even a

5

single plaintiff can prove the amount of work done

6

through the use of statistical 

7

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

That's not what Mt. Clemens

8

says, Justice Kagan.  Mt. Clemens says that it's the

9

burden on the employee to demonstrate that he or she

10

worked the requisite hours in order to get past 40.

11

Once you got past 40 in determining exactly what the

12

damages would be, at that point it was reasonable

13

because we hadn't  because  because Mt. Clemens

14

hadn't maintained records to go ahead and give the

15

plaintiff a pass.  It's the same  it's the Story

16

parchments test all over again.

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I can't see how that account

18

of Mt. Clemens would make most  much sense.  You're

19

suggesting that a person past 40 can produce the

20

statistical evidence, but if I worked 39 1/2 hours and

21

all of this overtime is going to push me over 40, the

22

Mt. Clemens presumption wouldn't be available to me?

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

I think that's exactly the

24

line the Court drew in Mt. Clemens.  It's the line that

25

the Court has consistently drawn in antitrust cases,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

12
1
2

from parchment.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But you've changed your

3

theory.  Question 2, as you presented in the petition

4

for certiorari, whether the class may be certified if

5

members were not injured.  Then you changed that.

6

Page 49 of your brief, you say that the plaintiff must

7

demonstrate a mechanism to show that.  So now you're

8

talking about  about the mechanism.

9

 So the  so the case has been argued on

10

different theories at  at many points, and it seems to

11

me Justice Kagan is precisely right.  You said, well, I

12

want to start first with class action.

13
14
15

 She said, no, no. 

The point is we start

with Mt. Clemens.  That's the substantive law for FSLA.
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

To be sure.  I mean, you can

16

go at it either way.  But at the end of the day,

17

obviously, what  as I started  as I started my

18

remarks, is  is that the Court  is that the

19

plaintiffs are obliged to demonstrate that a class works

20

on the basis of the substantive liability that they have

21

to  burden that they have to 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right.  So Mt. Clemens says

23

exactly this.  I'll read it.  I think it's correct.

24

"Where"  "Where an employee's records of time worked

25

are inaccurate or inadequate"  that's your case,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

13
1

right?  "then the employee attempting to bring a claim

2

can show time worked by producing sufficient evidence to

3

show the amount and extent of that work as a matter of

4

just and reasonable inference."

5

 That's what it says to do.

6

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right.
And then it says the

8

employer can't complain that the damages lack the

9

exactness and precision of measurement that would be

10

possible had he kept records.  But he didn't.  So they

11

used some statistics to show it.  What's wrong with

12

that?

13

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

There are two answers to

14

that.  The premise  the first part of that sentence

15

is, if he proves that he has, in fact, performed work

16

for which he was improperly compensated.

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Yeah.
None of these employee  a

19

huge number of these employees have not made that

20

showing.

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

statistics.  I mean 

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Well, they did through

No.  They 
I mean, you say an

antitrust case.  Okay.  Let's imagine an antitrust case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

14
1

There's an agreement among sneaker manufacturers to use

2

shoddy material.  And large customers, distributors buy

3

these shoddy materials.  They're hurt.  How much are

4

they hurt?  It depends on how many sneakers their

5

employees used and when and so forth.

6

 There is no way people don't keep sneaker

7

records, so what we do is we hire a statistician to use

8

sampling.  And if he's a good statistician and uses

9

sampling correctly, we have probably a better measure

10

than if we asked the employees to go back and remember

11

how many sneakers they wore and what days and what hours

12

50 years ago.

13

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

But Justice Breyer, your 

14

your entire hypothetical is premised on the fact that

15

they had already shown that they were injured in the

16

first 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, some of them, it

18

might turn out, actually did not wear sneakers during

19

the period of time that the conspiracy has been shown to

20

exist.  But we didn't know that at the beginning because

21

we thought we could prove a conspiracy from January to

22

December, but we only ended up proving it from January

23

until June.  Now, there we have it.  We put them in the

24

class to begin with because we thought we could prove

25

injury.  As it turns out, we can't.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

15
1

 Now, I  I've never heard that you had to

2

be able to know exactly how you're going to win your

3

case when you form the class action because you don't

4

know quite what the proof will be.  I mean, isn't that

5

how class actions work?

6

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

9

No, because 
Why not?
 because there's a  I

mean, the class certification decision is still open

10

until the final  until a judgment is rendered by the

11

district court.  So the district court has a continuing

12

responsibility in the face of challenges to the class

13

certification to consider decertifying the class.  And

14

we raised  and we raised that issue right after

15

WalMart.

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But why decertify the

17

class?  If we've shown or we do show the conspiracy

18

lasted from January until June, not through December?

19

Some people will recover; other people will not recover.

20

Can't we wait until the evidence is presented before we

21

tell the people who didn't 

22

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24
25

But see, the problem 
 buy the sneakers, then

you don't recover?
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

The  the problem with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

16
1

this  and this would raise exactly the same Comcast

2

problem  is my guess is your expert testified about

3

the conspiracy that lasted through the entire period.

4

And for whatever reason the jury rejected it, just as it

5

rejected Mericle in this case.  And now you're stuck in

6

a situation where you've got this huge judgment where we

7

knew there were 200 and some people who  but now we

8

know there are more than a thousand plaintiffs.

9

 And  and Justice Kennedy, we didn't shift

10

the  the answer.  Our answer was this is invalid

11

because there are so many defendant  plaintiffs  who

12

are 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I'm having

14

difficulty understanding your point.  There are records,

15

aren't there, of how many hours they worked without

16

donning and doffing the equipment at issue, correct?

17

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, there are.
All right.  So I thought

19

that Dr. Mericle's using those actual records figured

20

out how many people worked over 40 hours.

21

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

But  but only because 

22

she didn't do that to say who's over 40.  I mean, she

23

obviously identified some who weren't.  But she took

24

Mericle's average numbers, 18 1/2 and 21 and  and

25

slotted them in when nobody worked 18 1/2 and 21

minutes.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, you didn't have an

expert to say that?
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

We didn't need an expert to

5

say that.  We had our industrial engineer who said 

6

and the  and the Federal government's industrial

7

engineer said the same thing for four minutes.

8

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Is there any  there

any  reject 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is there any way at this

11

point to determine which employees were actually injured

12

and which ones were not?  Because I  I gathered

13

because the jury rejected the full verdict that was

14

requested by the plaintiffs, they did not accept

15

Dr. Mericle's testimony regarding the amount of time

16

needed to don and doff for employees in various

17

categories.  And without knowing that, I don't see how

18

you can at this point  I'll  I'll ask Mr. Frederick

19

the same question  how you can separate the employees

20

who were injured from the employees who were not

21

injured.

22

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

It  it's impossible to do

23

that.  And  and Fox, who was their expert who

24

testified on the damages, was very clear about that

25

because it's not linear.  So that if  if it turns out

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

18
1

that some period of time drops, the number of employees

2

who fall below the 40hour threshold plus the  plus

3

the Kcode time will drop.

I don't understand.  You

you can get a class certified, some of whom have not

the trial for the trial court to determine who has not

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, you can't do that.  And

no; and second, you couldn't do it anyway.

You have conceded that

the initial certification was okay because at that time,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

2

we didn't know which ones 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, I wouldn't say we

3

conceded that.  Obviously, we  we filed an opposition

4

to their motion to certify, and we brought forth dozens

5

of supervisors who testified about the  the myriad

6

jobs and the  and the wide range of donning and

7

doffing requirements for them, and said that under the

8

circumstances, this is not an appropriate case to

9

proceed as a class.

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But didn't you say that

11

in general, a class could be certified going in, even

12

though at that point, we don't know?

13

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

No.  No.  We  I mean, we 

14

in general, we say classes can be certified.  I mean, I

15

think you could have certified a walking time class in

16

this case.

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm still having the same

18

problem.  When I heard Justice Scalia's question, I

19

thought the answer is of course you can put in your

20

class people whom, it will turn out, are not hurt.  I

21

have a class of people who were hurt by a pricefixing

22

conspiracy that lasted from January to December.  That's

23

what I said.  I have good reason to think it.  But I

24

prove it only lasted until June.  That's a failure of

25

proof.  Half of them were not hurt, okay?  So we don't

pay them.

 MR. PHILLIPS:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4
5

But the 
I thought that's the most

common thing in the world.  Am I wrong?
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

But the problem is  yes,

6

you are, Justice Breyer, because the problem there is

7

the expert who testified to the conspiracy would have

8

assumed that the conspiracy covered the entire time

9

of

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

That's right.
 proof.  And, therefore,

12

the damages number that that expert will put forward

13

will be a vastly larger number than what the jury comes

14

back in based on the  on the finding that there was a

15

shorter conspiracy.

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Yes.
And there's no way to know

who was injured in that context and who was not injured

in that context.

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why do you have

Because 
 the jury, obviously,

5

rejected something.  It obviously was told to exclude

6

people who were not entitled, and it did it.  You didn't

it sounds like invited error.

Because our concern is that

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

No, no, no, no, no.  It's 

11

it's quite possible that there are people who have

12

been  who have been undercompensated because of this

13

particular scheme, and who could claim that because they

14

weren't allowed to participate, their due process rights

15

were violated 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They were allowed to

participate; they just didn't opt in.
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well others  but others

19

didn't  that's  that's true, but the  but the

20

bottom line here remains the same, which is, they are

21

absent class members whose interests were  may  may

22

have not been fully protected, and the only question

23

there is do we have standing to raise this issue,

24

which 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I've never heard of a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

24
1

case where absent class members are somehow bound by a

2

judgment in this case, when they didn't opt in.  I hope

3

that  I thought that was the whole purpose of not

4

opting in, so you're not bound by this judgment.

5

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

If it's a class judgment and

6

you  and you didn't opt out  I mean, there are two

7

different classes here, right?  There is a 23(b)(3)

8

class, and there's the FSLA collective action, which

9

have now been merged in on the judgment.  So there's no

10

reason to look at this as anything other than a 23(b)(3)

11

class of individuals.  And, you know  and their  so

12

that means there are literally thousands of absent class

13

members whose  who are  who are either entitled to

14

or not entitled to damages without any ability to know

15

whether they were or were not injured.  And therefore,

16

under those circumstances, what this Court said in

17

Phillips Petroleum is that the defendant has a right to

18

be sure that the mechanism by which the judgment

19

ultimately is entered across the entire class is such

20

that it  that it protects us as a collateral

21

estoppel 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Phillips, do

23

you have  do you have a theory as to why the jury

24

awarded less than half of the damages that were

25

requested?  Did they  I take it they didn't identify

Alderson Reporting Company

particular workers.
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

They did not identify

particular workers.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Did they  did they

disagree with the 18 minutes, 21 minutes?
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

They had to have disagreed

7

with it, and there was good reason to do that because if

8

you  if you take the testimony of the four named

9

plaintiffs, they  they were significantly different

10

than the  than the 18 and 21 minute times.  And so

11

the  the best evidence was, is that Mericle, by this

12

method of sort of  of nonrandom observations of

13

selfselected employees, came up with widely  wildly

14

extravagant numbers, and the jury rejected them.  And it

15

was the plaintiffs' decision to go for the  for the

16

entirety of the claim rather than take a more narrow

17

approach of maybe seeking walking time where the conduct

18

of the individual plaintiffs is much more homogenous.

19

 The problem with this is that it's very 

20

it's a vast  I'm sorry.

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If I could go back to

22

Justice Kennedy's question at the start, because it

23

really was your decision not to have a bifurcated

24

proceeding, where it would have been clear  it would

25

have been proved separately in a highly ministerial way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

26
1
2

which employees worked over 40 hours.
 And having made that decision, you're in a

3

position now where you're saying, oh, there's one sum 

4

there's one lump judgment; we don't know what to do with

5

it.  But, in  in essence, what's going to happen is

6

that it's going to go back in remand, and the judge is

7

going to do something that looks an awful like  lot

8

like the bifurcation that you rejected, which is, the

9

Court will say, now we figure out in this highly

10

ministerial way who worked more than 40 hours, and so

11

who is entitled to share in the judgment.

12
13
14

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

The  the bifurcation that

the plaintiffs proposed, two things to say about that.
 First of all, they took it off the table

15

themselves, not us.  We did object, but that wasn't 

16

it wasn't rejected because we  we objected to it.

17

They  they pulled bifurcation off the table.  So I

18

don't think you can put the burden on us.

19

 But, second of all, the  the bifurcation

20

they proposed was that first you were going to decide

21

whether Mericle is right or not, and that means whether

22

18 and a half and 21 can be averaged across your class.

23

And then the second part was going to be Fox testifying

24

about how to slot that in.

25

 Well, that's not  that's not going to 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

27
1

it may help with respect to the  to the uninjured 

2

to the injured class members, but it would not have

3

remotely helped with the more fundamental question of

4

the inadequacy of this as a class action device where

5

you patch over the problems of this  of this class by

6

simply averaging everything together.

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But it  it absolutely

8

helps with the question, your second question presented,

9

which is this point that you are making that there might

10

be some people who didn't work 40 hours, who would

11

nonetheless get money.  And it absolutely helps for

12

that.  It takes care of the entire problem.

13
14

 That leaves you with only your first
question presented 

15

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.
 which is this question

17

about was the class too varied.  And on that, I have to

18

go back to this  to this issue of, it's not a class

19

issue.  It's an FLSA issue under Mt. Clemens as to

20

whether this kind of statistical evidence could have

21

been presented.

22

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

And  and my answer to the

23

Mt. Clemens one, which, obviously, I'm not persuading

24

you on, is that if  the way I read Mt. Clemens, it

25

says, you don't go to fair and reasonable inference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

28
1

on  on the liability phase.  You only do that on the

2

damages phase.  And I would still argue here that even

3

if you use Mt.  the fair and reasonable inference

4

standard, it won't be satisfied by what Mericle did

5

here, because it's one thing to  to do some kind of

6

sampling.  It's another thing to say, I'm going to take

7

wildly different, 30 seconds versus 10 minutes and

8

average everybody across the plant without any effort to

9

be more tailored in our approach than that, Your Honors.

10
11

 I would like to reserve the balance of my
time.

 Mr. Frederick.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

15
16
17
18

Thank you, counsel.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
 Let me start with your question, Justice

19

Kennedy, because there absolutely will be remand

20

proceedings on the presumption that you affirm the

21

judgment of the Eighth Circuit so that the money can be

22

allocated, and we know the names of every single person

23

who would be entitled to an award based on a very long

24

spreadsheet that Dr. Fox compiled in conjunction with

25

Dr. Mericle's analysis.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

29
1

 And so you're right, Justice Kagan, that

2

there is a pot of money based on the jury verdict that

3

will be allocated, assuming that the Court affirms the

4

class certification judgment.

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, there is no question

6

the money can be divided up.  The question is whether it

7

can be divided up between those who were actually

8

injured and those who were not actually injured.

9

 So suppose you have  if you have three

10

employees, one worked  one was  one was given credit

11

for working 39 hours a week, one was given credit for

12

working 38 hours a week, one was given credit for

13

working 37 hours a week.  Without knowing how much

14

additional time the  each employee is entitled to, you

15

can't tell which one of those, which, if any, of them

16

was injured, and you can't tell how much additional time

17

the employees were entitled to without knowing what the

18

jury did with Dr. Mericle's statistics.

19
20
21

 So that's why I  I don't see how this can
be done in other than a very slapdash fashion.
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, there are two ways,

22

and I would submit that they  neither is slapdash.

23

Ordinarily, we would defer to jury verdicts, and we

24

would say that if the jury evaluated the evidence within

25

the realm of what was presented at trial, that is going

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

30
1

to get special deference in our legal system.

2

 So when those monies get allocated,

3

ordinarily a district judge is going to do so on a basis

4

either of pro rata for all of those  all of those

5

plaintiffs who were found to be injured, and the 212 who

6

were identified by name, by Dr. Fox, Tyson knew about

7

them before trial, did not move for summary judgment as

8

to those 212, could have easily severed them right out

9

before this case went to the jury.

10

 The second way is that Dr. Fox did an

11

analysis using Mericle's averages and then added them to

12

the number of minutes worked by the particular employee,

13

and so based on that, a vast number got above the

14

40hour threshold.

15

 Now, the evidence at trial that it came in

16

by Tyson's own witnesses was that the average worker

17

worked 48 hours per week before you even got to any of

18

the counting of the donning and doffing, and that the

19

plant ran on Saturdays 60 percent of the time, which

20

would be a 6day work week.

21

 And so the evidence as the jury considered

22

it found the vast majority of the class members were

23

already going to be in overtime status, and that's why

24

the fulcrum of the case came down to whether putting on

25

this gear, which was standard sanitary gear for every

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

31
1
2

single worker in the class, was compensable or not.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Counsel, we don't

3

know why the jury reduced the requested damages by 

4

gave less than half.  I mean, it could have been because

5

they thought the evidence on the ones who just put on

6

smocks or whatever as opposed to the ones who had the

7

mesh Armour  you see, I don't believe what you said

8

about the ones who don't put on the mesh Armour, so

9

we're going to give zero dollars on that.

10

 But I believe the  the validity of your 

11

the experts' testimony on the ones who put on the mesh

12

Armour, so we're going to award that.  Or maybe they

13

thought, you know, they would just discount the whole

14

thing, or  you know, we don't know why.

15

 So because they used average statistics over

16

varying jobs with  even your expert admitted varying

17

times, depending upon the classes, there's no way to

18

tell whether everybody who's going to get money was

19

injured or not.

20

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, and Tyson had an

21

opportunity to ask for more specific instructions.  In

22

fact, their instructions were the ones that ended up

23

governing the trial.  So to the extent that they had a

24

complaint 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, if you have 

Official  Subject to Final Review

32
1

you have  I understand that, but you have a

2

substantive answer because it's one thing for us to

3

write an opinion saying this is a horrible problem, but

4

they didn't ask for instructions, so don't worry about

5

it.

6

 MR. FREDERICK: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I don't 
That's another

8

thing.  We need to know whether we should address the 

9

the mechanism by which this was presented to the jury,

10

and then we can deal separately with the waiver issue.

11

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Yeah.  Well, on the

12

substantive part, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say this.

13

That in all these instances where there is a challenge

14

between an aggregation or something where you could ask

15

the jury for a more particularized decision, there's

16

always a tactical and a strategic decision that the

17

counsel on both sides were making and the parties on

18

both sides.

19
20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That sounds like the

same answer you gave before.

21

 MR. FREDERICK: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, but  but 
Is there a

23

substantive?  Yes.  We could say, okay, the problem is

24

they didn't ask for a special verdict.  They didn't

25

divide it between the people who were engaged in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

33
1
2

different functions than the killers, stunners.
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Substantively, the way this

3

is handled typically is that you would do a pro rata

4

distribution of the jury proceeds to the members who are

5

found to have been injured.  That's the substantive

6

answer.  We have it the way 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But I'm actually puzzled by

8

the same thing.  So put yourself in my puzzlement.

9

The  there is a green room, a yellow room, and a blue

10

room, all right?  Now, we discover with our statistical

11

experts that in the green room, doffing and donning,

12

those people on average  some more, some less  but

13

the sampling shows it's half an hour.  In the blue room,

14

it's 20 minutes.  In the yellow room, it's 10 minutes.

15

So, we add those three numbers on to green room, yellow

16

room, and blue room people.  And we get a number.

17

 Now, that number in individual cases will be

18

wrong, but that's what averaging is about.  And if there

19

is no other proof in the case, well, is that good

20

enough?

21

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, let me  let me

22

address that question in this way because I do want

23

to 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Is that the substantive

issue?

 MR. FREDERICK:

9

I  I think it is not.
Okay.
Because we 
Then skip it.

Because we had additional

information testimony.
 And Mr. Chief Justice, on the variations, I
think it's important to take into account what actually

10

is going on with these Dr. Mericle observations about

11

the 30 seconds versus the 10 minutes.  What Dr. Mericle

12

observed using the videotape in the men's locker room

13

was that some of the men put their gear on in the locker

14

room, and then they went down to the line.  That might

15

take them 10 minutes to do.

16

 Some of the men put on part of the

17

equipment, and then they carried the rest.  And they put

18

it on while they were walking to the production line or

19

while they were on the production line itself.  And they

20

were not counted.

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And I suppose some

22

of them like to chat while they're putting on the

23

equipment, and others are more down to, you know, let's

24

get this on as quickly as possible.  And  and some of

25

them have different sorts of jobs that require different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

35
1
2

sorts of equipment.
 MR. FREDERICK: 

And that's what the district

3

court rejected.  The district court said there was not

4

evidence to support that, that the 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, there was not

6

evidence to support that they'd have different equipment

7

that they put on?

8
9

 MR. FREDERICK: 

It was minimal.  What the

district court and what the court of appeals found was

10

that the differences in equipment were  were minimal,

11

and that they would not drive the difference.  And what

12

Dr. Mericle testified  and this is at 340  346 to

13

350 of the Joint Appendix  he explained that the

14

donning and doffing was occurring in different places

15

and that what they argued about this

16

30secondto10minute difference was, in fact, not an

17

accurate depiction of the actual time that it took.

18

Because the time clustered around the average; that was

19

his testimony.  And that if you took into account the

20

fact that they might be doing it in different places,

21

you then see why averaging works.

22

 And the reason averaging works is because

23

the workers were rotating among different assignments.

24

Some of them might start the day in a nonknife

25

capacity, and so putting on all the protective gear

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

36
1

before they started their shift didn't make sense.  They

2

would carry it to the production line.  They would be

3

pulled off the production line, told you're going to be

4

in a knife capacity, get your gear on.  They would put

5

their gear on at that time.

6

 So when Dr. Mericle is observing in the

7

locker room how long it takes for people to put their

8

gear on and take it off, he's not counting, he's not 

9

he's not counting  he's not taking into account the

10

variations in the work style mandated by the company.

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so your 

12

your submission is that, in fact  well, what  what

13

about 18 and 21?  You must have thought there was some

14

difference.

15

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, they were walking to a

16

different part, and they were divided into  they did

17

have additional equipment in that one.  But we divided

18

them by departments, and we can identify the employees

19

in the two different departments.

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so the

21

variation that is  at least troubled some of us, 30

22

seconds, 10 minutes, you're saying it's not because the

23

30second person is actually going to spend 9 1/2

24

minutes at the end of the walk, and the 10minute person

25

spent all the time at the beginning of the walk, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

37
1

there's no difference between the people who clean up

2

and the people who actually slaughter the hogs because

3

the cleanup people are going to slaughter the hogs at

4

four hours at the end of the shift.  And the 

5

 MR. FREDERICK: 

There was rotation among 

6

and their own witness testified to that effect.  That's

7

at JA 236.  He said they rotated quite frequently.  And

8

what he was explaining was that you might start on a

9

particular assignment  and  and Dr. Mericle is

10

taking a twoday snapshot, right?  He's looking at

11

video.  And the  the workers themselves were

12

testifying that the actual donning and doffing basically

13

clustered around the average.  That's what Dr. Mericle

14

observed.

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so we

16

should  again, there's a  a basic issue that's

17

presented, but you're saying in addition to avoiding it

18

because of the objection is their lack of objections at

19

all, we should not be reaching the substantive issue

20

because, in fact, there was no variation in the time?

21

 MR. FREDERICK: 

That's what the  both

22

courts below found.  And  and so when you are based

23

with a factual record here that comes up here with both

24

courts below, the ordinary presumption, particularly in

25

a jury context, is you're going to interpret the facts

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

38
1
2

in the light most supportive 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it an argument that if

3

the employer wants to be quite conscientious about

4

complying with FLSA, the employer has to take some

5

averages.  It has to say, we're going to give X minutes

6

for donning and doffing on this line, X minutes  and

7

the second part of that question is, how much of this

8

case turns on the fact that the employer did not keep

9

adequate records?

10

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, had this  had the

11

employer kept records, this would be a completely easy

12

case for class certification purposes because every

13

single issue would be done by common proof.

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Can the employer be

15

charged with not keeping adequate records by not

16

following every single person every part of that

17

person's day?  You spend four hours on this line, four

18

hours on that line.  You have to  you have to put on a

19

certain kind of doffing.

20
21
22

 Can the employer really keep records for
every single employee?
 MR. FREDERICK: 

It's actually simpler than

23

that, Justice Kennedy.  It's where you place the time

24

clock.  Had they put the punch clock right outside the

25

locker room so that the workers, as soon as they went in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

39
1

the locker room, punched in, this problem would have

2

been eliminated.  Because at that point, when they were

3

putting on the protective gear, the sanitary gear, and

4

then they are walking  and the walking is uniform for

5

all class members.  The sanitary gear is all uniform for

6

all class workers.

7

 So when they're putting on their equipment

8

in the locker room, if they punched in, the company has

9

satisfied the FLSA and this problem goes away.  And then

10

the question is, is the walking and donning and doffing

11

work?  And that's what the trial was all about.

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Many workers put on gear

13

other than sanitary gear.  What you say is true:  The

14

sanitary gear is the same for all workers.  But some of

15

them wear, what, chain mail to protect them from the

16

knives, right?  And  and some of them wear other

17

protective gear.  And that's what is claimed to create

18

the discrepancy.

19

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Right.  But if you take the

20

sanitary  I'm just saying, if you  for the question

21

of commonality and predominance, which I'm trying to

22

address the first question  the sanitary gear is all

23

the same for everybody.  The walking is all the same for

24

everybody.

25

 And then the question is, can you use

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

40
1

averaging because of the peculiarities of the fact that

2

the doffing of this  basically, the same gear was

3

occurring in three different places:  in the locker

4

room, walking down to the production line, and on the

5

production line itself.

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't  I don't think

7

your  your friend will agree that it's basically the

8

same gear.

9
10
11
12
13

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, I wouldn't expect

that.
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think that's his  his

point, that it's quite different gear.
 MR. FREDERICK: 

But the  what the district

14

court found, and they didn't show  look, we're talking

15

about a difference between a Kevlar belly guard and a

16

Plexiglas belly guard or a mesh, metal mesh belly guard.

17

We're talking about the same basic kinds of gear.  We're

18

talking about different kinds of gloves.

19

 But those variations were presented to the

20

jury, found to be minor.  And the district court

21

concluded that they were minor differences.

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, the difference  the

23

question is not whether they're  whether one

24

protective gear is different from another, but it's

25

whether protective gear is different from sanitary gear.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

41

That's the question.

2

 MR. FREDERICK: 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, the question is 
Wasn't there  wasn't

4

there  for all of the workers, there was certain basic

5

equipment.  There was basic sanitary gear, but there was

6

also basic protective gear.  So the only difference

7

comes up with the protective gear for the knife weld.

8
9

 MR. FREDERICK: 

You left boots out.

But  but the knife

Right.  But the point was,

Mr. Chief Justice, that if you were on knife duty at a

10

particular point in time, you were going to rotate

11

frequently during the course of a day or from one day to

12

the next, and so you were charged always to have your

13

gear ready to be put on if you were put in a

14

knifewielding capacity.

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems  it seems to me

16

that you might concede that if this were simply a class

17

action under 23, that these problems might be a barrier

18

to certification, but that under Mt. Clemens you have a

19

special rule; is that 

20

 MR. FREDERICK: 

21

22

 Do you  do you concede that there is a

Is that correct?

23

strong possibility you might not be  have this class

certified under section  under Rule 23, absent

Mt. Clemens?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

43
1

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

2

think Mt. Clemens answers the question in this case.  I

3

think that, given the way the evidence came in, the

4

averages here are reasonable ones.  So even if there was

5

not a special Mt. Clemens rule where there's a

6

burdenshifting framework, the answer should be the

7

same.

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So that's exactly,

perhaps, what I  I read the question, the first

10

question.  I'm taking it literally.  It said, "Whether

11

differences among individual class members may be

12

ignored, liability and damages will be determined with

13

statistical techniques that assume everyone is like the

14

average."

15

 Now, I thought the answer to that question

16

is yes, and it depends, of course; you have to be

17

reasonable.  I mean, that's why you use the four rooms.

18

We don't know everybody in the room.  What we do is we

19

take an average in the room.  If it's a good statistical

20

average, why not?

21

 Now, I want  I don't want you to agree

22

with that if that isn't the law, but I don't see why it

23

isn't.

24
25

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, Justice Breyer, we do

agree with that position, but we also agree with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

44
1

Justice Kennedy that, because of the Mt. Clemens

2

framework overlay for Fair Labor Standards Act, this is

3

an easier case than a case in which there was not that

4

substantive law difference.  Because if you were to take

5

one individual and you were to use the same evidence, it

6

would be representative proof; you'd have the same

7

burdenshifting framework.  That's why all these

8

arguments about Dr. Mericle really are merits questions,

9

they're not classcertifying questions.

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Frederick, I  I'm

11

not sure that you've answered the  the two substantive

12

questions that I see my colleagues asking, okay?

13

 With respect to whether you're a knife

14

wielder or not, if you are assigned to  to bear a

15

knife during the day, you're going to be paid for that

16

time anyway because you're on the starttoend day,

17

okay?  So you're not going to get FSLA for that.  So

18

it's only the people who start out the day being

19

required to don those outfits.

20

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, actually,

21

Justice Sotomayor, that's where I would disagree with

22

you, because 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24

 MR. FREDERICK: 

25

All right.
 if  if the worker,

through habit, convenience, is doffing while walking,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

45
1

our study didn't double count.  Our study only took into

2

account the walking time.  So he's not going to get

3

credit for the fact that he's doing work by putting on

4

the gear while he happens to be walking.

5

 If he is pulled off the line during

6

gangtime while the hogs are going along, he does not

7

get extra minutes because his supervisor says, we need

8

you with knife so go put your gear on.  He's counted as

9

part of gangtime at that point.  And so 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could I just ask you to

11

clarify something before your time runs out, because

12

it  it's unclear to me from what you've said in your

13

argument.

14

 Why did Dr. Mericle come up with one figure

15

for employees on the processing floor and another figure

16

for employees on the slaughter floor if, as I understand

17

you to have said this morning, all of the employees

18

basically do both of those tasks and spend an equal

19

amount of time on them, so they can all be considered

20

together?

21

 MR. FREDERICK: 

22

did, I was  I misspoke.

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

24
25

I didn't say that, and if I

Well, that was the

impression I got from what you said.
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Within the department, they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

46
1

would perform different tasks, some of which would

2

require knife and some which didn't.  And it was within

3

the department that the averages that were being

4

observed we believe are fair averages, in light of the

5

fact that we're looking back in time, and we're trying

6

to recreate what happened in a  in a threeyear period

7

that, you know, was  where there are no records.

8

 And so within the department, what the Court

9

found was that there was consistency, and that the

10

differences were minimal.  The reason why there's a

11

threeminute difference is because one is longer.  It's

12

a longer distance for walking to get to it, and there

13

is, you know, more to be done.  But I want to make clear

14

that we  we broke this down into the two different

15

departments because we could discern those.  But I would

16

submit that the 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let me ask you this:  If

18

the Court is writing an opinion of reaching the result

19

you want, what is the standard we put?  Representative

20

evidence?  Average evidence of injury is sufficient if?

21

What  what do we write?

22

 MR. FREDERICK: 

I think what you write,

23

Justice Kennedy, is that in this context, where there

24

was an expert who said that the averages  they

25

clustered around the averages, and that based on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

47
1

observations where the work activity, the donning and

2

doffing that is contested here is occurring in three

3

different places, it's fair to treat the employees

4

because the FLSA is a remedial statute that is designed

5

to protect workers who can't keep these kinds of

6

records.  That's why 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And that's  that's a

8

little bit too specific for the broad standard that I'm

9

looking for.  An average is possible if what, there's no

10

other way to do it?  If it's an FSLA case and has a

11

special policy?  Neither of those seem quite

12

satisfactory to me.

13

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, I think every case is

14

going to be different, as we would all candidly

15

recognize, that an antitrust case is going to be

16

different from a labor case.  And that will be different

17

from  I think you do have to look at the substantive

18

context in which the averaging is going to occur so that

19

any deviations at least are explicable.  Here 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Don't you also have to say

21

that the jury accepted the averaging?  And that doesn't

22

seem to have happened here.

23

 MR. FREDERICK: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Well 
When the jury comes in

with  with less than half of  of what the averaging

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

48
1

would have produced, how can we say that there has been

2

averaging?

3

 MR. FREDERICK: 

The averaging, I think you

4

should infer from the jury's award of damages to the

5

injured  and it was instructed not to give damages to

6

the uninjured workers, and was faithfully charged with

7

that.  The fact that it awards a lesser amount may be

8

based on its own doubts about the number of minutes or

9

the quantity.

10

 But those kinds of calculations, I submit,

11

Justice Scalia, we have always deferred to juries in the

12

way these kinds of damages are calculated.

13

Thank you, counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELIZABETH B. PRELOGAR

16

 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17
18
19

 SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

 Justice Kennedy, I'd like to begin with your

21

question about the proper standard to apply here.  The

22

government thinks it's the standard that the jury was

23

instructed on, and this appears at JA 471 to 472.

24
25

 The jury was told in this case that they
could only rely on representative evidence if all of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

49
1

employees performed substantially similar activities,

2

and that substantial similarity is what we think is the

3

proper standard to determine whether an inference here

4

would be just and reasonable.

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you think  how

6

do you know they relied on the representative evidence?

7

The number was  was more than 50 percent of what was

8

asked.  The expert was crossexamined.  We don't know,

9

for example  they rejected the 18 minutes but accepted

10

the 21 minutes.  The fact that the jury did not give you

11

the damages sought seems to me to call into question the

12

significance of the statistics.

13

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Well, I think it calls into

14

question whether the jury agreed with the actual time

15

estimates, but I don't think it undermines the

16

conclusion that they found that there was proper

17

representative evidence here because they were

18

instructed that they couldn't award a recovery to the

19

class until all of the nontestifying employees, unless

20

they were convinced that they all performed

21

substantially similar activities.

22

 So I think we have to infer that the jury

23

found that all of these activities were similar, that

24

there were not material differences of the kind that

25

Mr. Phillips has referred to today, because the jury was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

50
1

instructed that that was the only way they could award

2

classwide  find a  a finding here of classwide

3

liability.

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but they 

5

they saw the evidence on which the calculations were

6

based, right?

7

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

That's correct.
They saw the donning

and doffing of the sanitary gear and the protective

10

gear.  Couldn't they have made judgments based on those

11

actual differences to reject some of the representative

12

statistics?

13

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

I don't think they would have

14

had any basis to do so.  And at the end of the jury

15

instruction on representative evidence, which was an

16

instruction that Tyson requested, the jury was told,

17

quote, "The representative evidence, as a whole, must

18

demonstrate that the class is entitled to recover.  And

19

I think that there was an ample evidentiary basis here

20

for the jury to conclude that there weren't

21

substantial  substantial dissimilarity among the tasks

22

that were being performed in these donning and doffing

23

activities.

24

 It's useful, I think, to review that record

25

evidence.  For example, Dr. Mericle testified that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

51
1

times clustered around the averages.  He had 744

2

videotaped observations.  As well, there was the

3

testimony that employees frequently rotated between

4

positions, including between those jobs that used a

5

knife and those that didn't.  The employees who

6

testified at trial had times that came in very close to

7

Dr. Mericle's averages.

8

 And I'll just refer you to Mr. Logan, who

9

testified at JA 260 and 265, 17 to 19 minutes.  Mr.

10

Bulbaris said 18 to 22 minutes.  Mr. Montes said around

11

20 minutes.  As well, Tyson itself didn't think that

12

there were these material variations when it was

13

calculating the KCode time using a study that was very

14

similar to the study that Dr. Mericle employed here and

15

used essentially the same methodology.

16

 In that circumstance, Tyson thought that it

17

would be appropriate to treat all employees in a uniform

18

way.

19

 So I think it's critical here that we have a

20

jury determination upon a proper instruction about

21

representative evidence that there weren't these kinds

22

of dissimilarities that would warrant 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And maybe you don't

24

know because you're the  in an amicus posture, but was

25

the person who normally is, like, hosing down the floor

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

52
1

paid as much as the person who performs the most

2

intricate knifing operation?

3

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

No.  My understanding is that

4

there were differences in what you were paid depending

5

on your position.

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And yet, your 

7

both you and your  your friend are telling me that,

8

well, we shouldn't treat those jobs differently because

9

they often switched back and forth.

10

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Well, the jury concluded here

11

that those jobs didn't require materially different

12

gear.  So I think that the pay rate, which was evident

13

from Tyson's own records here and could be calculated

14

through these kind of mechanical damages calculations,

15

doesn't signal that there was different gear.  It might

16

signal that the work being performed on the job was

17

somewhat different and required different levels of

18

skill.

19

 But I think it's clear, based on the jury

20

verdict in this case, that the plaintiffs were able to

21

prove their claim with classwide evidence.  And at this

22

juncture, it's something of the reverse of what this

23

Court has confronted in other cases, where the Court has

24

recognized that sometimes the certification decision

25

overlaps with the merits of the claim, and you have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

53
1

consider at the outset whether the plaintiffs will be

2

able to prove their claim with classwide proof.

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you concede that if

4

this were a Rule 23 action and the FSLA were not

5

involved that it would be a much closer, much more

6

difficult case?

7

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Yes.  I think it would be

8

much closer.  And  and here, I think that this really

9

gets to the point that the dispute here doesn't turn on

10

a freestanding Rule 23 requirement.  It stands on 

11

it  it turns on the Mt. Clemens standard.  And

12

Mt. Clemens does adopt a special rule tailored to the

13

fact that there is a recordkeeping violation in this

14

case that prevents the employees from being able to

15

prove their claims with more precise evidence.  We

16

think 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You  you agree it

18

would be an extension of Mt. Clemens to apply it at the

19

liability stage as opposed to the damages stage, right?

20

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

I think there's a way to read

21

Mt. Clemens where the  this  where it would not be

22

an extension.  But to the extent that you think it would

23

be, we think it's a perfectly logical one and one that's

24

consistent with the rationale in Mt. Clemens.

25

 Mt. Clemens said that when the recordkeeping

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

54
1

violation prevents a determination of the amount of time

2

spent on these activities, then you should be able to

3

come forward with a just and reasonable inference and

4

not put the burden on the employees to prove that time

5

with precision.

6

 And when that exact same fact is relevant

7

liability insofar as it's necessary to prove that the

8

employee is pushed over the 40hourperweek threshold,

9

then we think that all of the rationales that animated

10

Mt. Clemens would equally apply to the determination of

11

that particular fact in that context.

12

 But we think the Mt. Clemens itself signaled

13

that this might be an appropriate determination at the

14

liability phase because it recognized at the outset that

15

the burden of proving that you have performed work for

16

which you were not properly compensated shouldn't be an

17

impossible burden.  That was the language that was used

18

in the opinion.  And so I think that whether or not

19

Mt. Clemens decided it, certainly it  it's true that

20

it should be applied in this context to the particular

21

fact that was relevant there.

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm  I'm going to try

23

to phrase what I understand the question my colleagues

24

have been posing that I don't think either counsel has

25

sort of gotten at, or maybe it's so obvious that we're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

55
1
2

missing it, okay?
 Clearly, the expert here, Dr. Joy, said 

3

I'm using a hypothetical  there's 10 minutes of

4

overtime.  And the figure that comes out with 10 minutes

5

of overtime is a million dollars.  Now the jury comes

6

back with half a million dollars.

7

 How do you know that what they said is  I

8

half the time  five minutes, or the jury said, I think

9

it's eight minutes or  for slaughterhouse and three

10

for production line people.  So it averages out to five

11

now, okay?

12
13
14
15
16

 How do we know what  how the jury
calculated that half million?
 MS. PRELOGAR: 

The answer is that we don't

know for sure, Justice Sotomayor.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's what my

17

colleagues are saying.  So the question is, your

18

adversary is claiming that there might be some people on

19

the threeminute side who are going to come and collect

20

a pro rata share who really weren't injured because they

21

had worked 39 hours and 57  56 minutes, something like

22

that.  So why is it that it's fair to distribute this 

23

this award pro rata?

24

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

25

Well, I think that it's not

clear yet exactly how the award will be allocated, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

56
1

those will be left to the district court's discretion

2

when the case returns for allocation.

3

 At that point, Tyson can come in and it can

4

make these arguments if it thinks it's unfair.  The

5

district court will be wellpositioned to determine

6

whether Tyson waived the claims by actually asking for a

7

lump sum verdict here and whether Tyson even has a stake

8

in this issue given that its own liability won't

9

increase.

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why would  why would

11

Tyson's care?  They have to pay the same amount of

12

dollars.

13

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Exactly, Justice Ginsburg,

14

and I think that that shows that Tyson might not have

15

the requisite stake here to be able to challenge the

16

allocation.

17

 But I think the overarching point to keep in

18

mind is that the  the issues with allocating this

19

award were not the inevitable result of the class action

20

mechanism.  They don't reveal some defect in that

21

mechanism.

22

 There were any number of ways to account for

23

this problem.  The trial could have been bifurcated

24

between liability and damages, as Justice Kagan noted.

25

That would have solved this problem entirely, but Tyson

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

57
1

opposed it.  Or Tyson could have sought judgment against

2

the 212 class members who had no right to recover under

3

the plaintiffs' evidence.  It didn't do that.

4

 Tyson could have asked for a special verdict

5

that would have allocated the damages by the jury; but

6

instead, it asked for a lump sum verdict.  Or it could

7

have asked for the class definition to be altered in

8

this case to exclude those individuals who weren't

9

working the requisite number of times.

10

 Ultimately, there are any number of

11

mechanisms that could account for this issue, and none

12

of them demonstrate that this class action was improper.

13

They went unutilized only because of Tyson's own

14

litigation strategy here.

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What happened to the 

16

the government's action?  I mean, the government started

17

this against Tyson's or its predecessor and got an

18

injunction.  And then the government said that the

19

solution that the  the K  whatever it was  that

20

Tyson's came up with wasn't good enough.  And then

21

nothing.  What happened to the government's 

22

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Well, ultimately, the

23

government ended up settling the claims in that prior

24

enforcement action.  But then the  the government

25

issued an opinion letter to the industry, saying that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

58
1

was clear that you had to pay for actual time worked.

2

And, of course, the secretary has limited resources and

3

can't conduct enforcement actions for every violation of

4

the FLSA.

5

 But it is the Department of Labor's position

6

here that Tyson was in violation of the FLSA, both by

7

not keeping the actual records and by not fully

8

compensating the employees for the time worked in this

9

case.

10
11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you think an

employer 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No.  Go ahead.

What do you think an

14

employer should do about recordkeeping when the employer

15

believes that certain activities need not be counted

16

under the FLSA?  So is the employer  it may be that

17

the employer is stuck with the choice that it makes, the

18

legal judgment it makes.

19

 But is it supposed to keep two sets of  of

20

records so the amount of time that it thinks the

21

employee is entitled to compensation for, and then this

22

additional amount of time, that it might be argued that

23

the employee is entitled to compensation for?

24
25

 MS. PRELOGAR: 

Well, Mt. Clemens does make

clear that the employer is stuck with its mistake

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

59
1

because it said even when the failure to keep records

2

grows out of a bona fide mistake about whether the time

3

should be compensable whether it was work, that still

4

the burdenshifting framework applies.

5

 But I would also note here that I think

6

there was no legitimate argument here that this wasn't

7

work.  These activities, I think  it was clear with

8

the wake of Alvarez  were required to be compensated.

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, counsel.

10

 Mr. Phillips, you have five minutes.

11

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

12

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

14

 Let me answer Justice Alito's point and

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

the  and the observation where  I mean, the reality

16

is, is that in the Reich litigation, we were told that

17

the  the ordinary sanitary equipment was not  was

18

not within the donning and doffing requirements, and

19

never a problem.  And so as a consequence of that,

20

frankly, we didn't monitor this.

21

 That's not a complete defense, but it at

22

least explains the sort of the equities of the  of the

23

situation.

24
25

 Second, my good friend tells you that the
district court here found that all of these things are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

60
1

very similar.  The reality is, is that at Pet. App. 87A,

2

the first time this issue came up with the class

3

certification, the district court said there are some

4

very big factual differences among all these employees.

5

And the basic  and the only reason the district court

6

didn't agree to certify it at that time was because he

7

thought that the gangtime was somehow the  the tie

8

that binds this all together.

9

 Well, the gangtime was nothing in this 

10

in this litigation, and the reality is he made a mistake

11

then, and every time we came back to decertify this

12

class, based on more and more information about the

13

inadequacies of Mericle's evidence as applied by Fox,

14

who was  who was essentially just wiped away, saying,

15

well, this is distinguishable from the Supreme Court's

16

cases here, and it's distinguishable from the Supreme

17

Court's cases there.

18
19
20

 Justice Kennedy, the answer to your
question 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, but you're  you're

21

saying the district court made a finding that there were

22

great dissimilarities.

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Yes, Your Honor, it did.
Where is that?
That's on page 87A of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

61
1

appendix to the petition.  Justice, that's in the first

2

certification decision.

3

 Justice Kennedy, to answer your question

4

about how do you write an opinion, and when is it close

5

enough?  Averaging is a permissible way of going about

6

it when the evidence is clear that the  that the basic

7

activity is homogenous, and that would have been true

8

for walking time.  There was  there was literally no

9

difference 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

11

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

12

 And here when you're talking about 30

Basic activity is 
Homogenous.

13

seconds and 10 minutes, and we're talking about wildly

14

different activities, what you can't do is just simply

15

say, okay, we're just going to patch over all that and

16

average it.

17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Didn't they standardize

walking time?  That's what I thought they used.

19

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, and that's why 
There's a standardized

21

walking time because some people are faster than others,

22

correct?

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Right.  But my point here is,

24

is that in general, everybody agrees that's a reasonable

25

way to proceed.  That's my point.  Here we're not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

62
1

talking about homogenized because there are vast

2

differences, and the evidence is absolutely unsalable on

3

that.

4

 And with respect to Mt. Clemens, in the

5

first place, I  I don't think Mt. Clemens should be

6

extended to  to make the fair and reasonable inference

7

standard of the presumption apply at the liability

8

phase, and I think the court was extremely clear in not

9

wanting to go down that path.

10

 But second, even if you thought the

11

presumption should be applied here, I would argue that

12

Mericle's evidence, as  as, you know, through

13

crossexamination and examination of others,

14

demonstrates that this is not a fair and reasonable

15

inference.  And on that score, it seems to me there are

16

two quotations I would offer up.

17

 One comes from this Court's decision in

18

WalMart, "when an expert's testimony does nothing to

19

advance a party's case, the Court can safely disregard

20

what he says."

21

 And then what Judge Posner said in a very

22

similar FLSA case, "What cannot support an inference

23

about the work time of thousands of employees is

24

evidence of a small, unrepresentative sample of them,"

25

and that is precisely what we have in this particular

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

63
1
2

case.
 With respect to remand, we would be happy

3

for a remand to  for allocation if that's permissible,

4

but as I read, the final judgment of the district court

5

is judgment of about $6 million to these named

6

plaintiffs, and that was affirmed.  There is nothing in

7

there about how this is going to be allocated under

8

these circumstances.  So if the Court believes there's

9

got to be a separate proceeding of allocation, the Court

10

hopefully would order that, although I think there is a

11

more fundamental decision the Court would have to reach.

12

 And then finally, with respect to who has

13

the burden of dealing with this problem, it is the

14

plaintiffs' burden to sustain the justification for a

15

class all throughout the proceedings until a final

16

judgment is entered.  And we came to the court four

17

times asking them not to certify this.  So to come back

18

in at the end and say, well, since we were able to try

19

this without any ability to put forward any of our

20

individual defenses with respect to any of these

21

individual employees, except for the four who actually

22

testified, is exactly what this Court said in WalMart

23

and Comcast is an impermissible way to define the class.

24
25

 The Court should reverse in this case,
declare the class decertified.
