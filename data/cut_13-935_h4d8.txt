 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

next in Case 13935, Wellness International Network v. 

5

Sharif. 

6

 Ms. Steege. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE STEEGE 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9

 MS. STEEGE: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Stern v. Marshall held that a bankruptcy 

12

judge may, consistent with Article III, enter judgment 

13

in an action that stems from the bankruptcy itself. 

14

 The claim at issue in this case meets that 

15

test.  Wellness asked the bankruptcy court to decide the 

16

first and most fundamental question that arises in every 

17

bankruptcy case, what property became part of the debtor 

18

Sharif's bankruptcy estate under Bankruptcy Code 

19

Section 541 on the day Mr. Sharif filed for bankruptcy. 

20

 As this Court recognized over 100 years ago 

21

in Mueller v. Nugent, it is essential that bankruptcy 

22

judges have that authority.  As long as there have been 

23

bankruptcy laws, there have been debtors like Mr. Sharif 

24

who devised creative ways to keep property in their own 

25

possession and out of the hands of their trustees and

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

creditors.  Here, Mr. Sharif's case is 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But we've already held 

3

that a fraudulent conveyance against a noncreditor is an 

4

Article III violation, is a Stern claim, essentially. 

5

 MS. STEEGE: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7
8
9
10

Yes, Your Honor. 
Or nonStern claim.  So 

why isn't this the same thing? 
 MS. STEEGE: 

Because this action is a 

case 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I mean, it's not the 

11

same thing because he actually possessed this trust, 

12

it's in his name as trustee 

13

 MS. STEEGE: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15
16

Yes. 
 and so it's a little 

bit  it's a lot different, but 
 MS. STEEGE: 

Yes.  But the allegations of 

17

the complaint were that Mr. Sharif owned the property 

18

and to the extent the trust existed, it should be 

19

ignored by virtue of the way he handled his property. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Oh, but  but that's 

21

the same in a fraudulent conveyance.  It was his 

22

property and he was just trying to deny his other 

23

creditors the benefit of that money.  So it's not quite 

24

that. 

25

 MS. STEEGE: 

Well, it's different, Your

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Honor, because in a fraudulent transfer claim, the 

2

debtor actually passes title over to someone, under the 

3

definition of 548 or the 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But here, he's claiming 

that the beneficiary has title. 
 MS. STEEGE: 

Yes, but that's the very 

7

dispute that the Court was asked to decide under 

8

Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum, the issue is not what 

9

the debtor claims his title is, but whether he has 

10

actual possession.  And so here  the assets what we 

11

have here are the condominium that he lives in and he's 

12

lived in for 20 years, a pharmacy business, he's a 

13

pharmacist, that he's been operating for many years and 

14

that in the past, he had reported as his business on his 

15

personal tax return; we have his own personal retirement 

16

account that somehow inexplicably ended up in the 

17

mother's grantor trust and then we have bank accounts 

18

that he owned. 

19

 And so the allegations of the complaint were 

20

that he really owned this and this charade that he put 

21

up in front of the bankruptcy court of saying, this is 

22

owned in a trust, that was the dispute the court had to 

23

consider. 

24
25

 And a way, I think, to think of it as 
differently from a fraudulent transfer action, where

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you're going against a true third party to whom title 

2

has passed, that chosen action, the intangible right to 

3

sue on the fraudulent transfer claim, or as in Stern, 

4

the right to bring the breach of contract or tort claim 

5

in these other cases, that asset, the right to sue 

6

exists in the estate at the time of its creation. 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The ben  who is the 

beneficiary of this trust?  His sister, right? 
 MS. STEEGE: 

Well, that's 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

11

 MS. STEEGE: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's what's claimed. 
That's what's claimed, yes. 
And so what would be the 

13

effect of a declaration by the bankruptcy court that 

14

that Respondent was the alter ego; that it was actually 

15

his property?  The sister  would the sister be bound 

16

by that judgment?  Would the sister have to appear in 

17

the bankruptcy court as if she were a creditor? 

18

 MS. STEEGE: 

Well, yes, she would be bound 

19

because if we accept their characterization, the 

20

trustee, through his litigation conduct, binds the 

21

beneficiary under wellestablished Illinois law, the law 

22

of  of it's just basic trust law.  But more importantly, 

23

she did appear in this action.  She appeared through 

24

counsel.  She, too, was subpoenaed.  She, too, failed to 

25

produce the trust documents in response to requests.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

She was given notice of the case as a creditor,um and could 

2

have filed a claim.  And there was a safety valve for 

3

her and she's, in fact, exercised her ability to  to 

4

have that safety valve.  She could have filed a proof of 

5

claim in the case. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Would the ­would the court, 

7

the bankruptcy court, have had the power to notify her or to 

8

subpoena her to come in as a party? 

9

 MS. STEEGE: 

Yes, because if  if she was a 

10

necessary party to the action, the normal rules of 

11

Federal Civil Procedure apply through the bankruptcy 

12

rules and she would have been required to be brought in. 

13

She's not a necessary party under the construct they 

14

created. 

15
16
17
18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Because she's the 

representative.  Right. 
 MS. STEEGE: 

They  they created this construct 

of this trust 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So am I right about the 

20

basic facts?  Creditor wants some money from debtor, 

21

who's in bankruptcy; creditor says, I look at your list 

22

of assets, it seems to me something's missing.  I have a 

23

piece of paper here that you filed one year ago at the 

24

bank which says you have $5 million more. 

25

 MS. STEEGE: 

Right.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Where is that on the list? 

2

He thinks about it and he says, oh, yeah, there was 

3

5 million more, but that wasn't mine.  That belonged to 

4

Saudi Arabia.  Or that belonged to my cousin.  Or  and 

5

so they say, let's prove it.  And that's what we're at 

6

issue.  That's what's at issue. 

7

 MS. STEEGE: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's correct. 
Can the bankruptcy court, 

9

it happens here, that the claim is not Saudi Arabia, the 

10

claim is not my cousin, the claim is that the $5 million 

11

was a living trust of which there seems to be very 

12

little record, which belonged to his mother.  But in 

13

principle, it's no different, is it, in your view? 

14
15
16

 MS. STEEGE: 

No.  That's exactly what we 

have here. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's a simple claim.  But 

17

we'll hear from the other side, which will say it's very 

18

different. 

19

 MS. STEEGE: 

Right.  And that is the basis 

20

of bankruptcy.  If we  if we think about what 

21

bankruptcy is and what it has historically always has 

22

been, it's been about the in rem jurisdiction of the 

23

court to take control of the debtor's property.  And 

24

this case really is easy because the debtor is in 

25

possession of the property, the nature of this property

he's personally

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

distinguishing Stern? 

4

 MS. STEEGE: 

5

There's a number of 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 MS. STEEGE: 

Is that the only basis for 

No, it's not, Your Honor. 

What else? 
Okay.  This is decided as a 

8

matter of Federal law.  Section 541 determines what 

9

comes into the estate and what doesn't.  It's not 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Whether there's a trust or 

not is not a question of Federal law, is it? 
 MS. STEEGE: 

But the question of whether 

13

something belongs to the bankruptcy estate is a Federal 

14

question, even if State law informs the answer.  This 

15

Court's precedent 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

 MS. STEEGE: 

18
19

Well 
 in other  under other 

statutes.  It's Law v. Siegel last year indicated 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's a question of Federal 

20

law even if State provides the answer. I ­ I don't know 

21

what that means. 

22

 MS. STEEGE: 

Yes, Your Honor, and that's 

23

the Court has Interpreted federal statutes dealing with 

24

property rights, the Paulsen 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And that wasn't the case in 

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Stern?

2

 MS. STEEGE: 

3

The claim there was 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That was not the case in Stern. 

Well, likewise there, what 

5

was in the estate is a question of Federal law, even if 

6

State law provided the answer. 

7

 MS. STEEGE: 

The difference here would be if 

8

there had been a dispute between the debtor and Stern 

9

and her bankruptcy trustee over who got the right to go 

10

sue Pierce, the  the soninlaw, that would have been 

11

this case.  That would have been the 541 question. 

12

 The chosen 

 action is what exists in the 

13

estate at the time of its creation.  And so that chose 

14

of action, when you go out and you seek to go liquidate 

15

that, bring the lawsuit, that's the augmentingtype 

16

claim that the Court has talked about in its precedent 

17

in Stern and in Northern Pipeline. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Suppose that Illinois law, 

19

and suppose that Illinois law governs the  this  the 

20

issue of the trust, and suppose Illinois law says that 

21

when a  when it is held that the trustee is  that 

22

that the trust is the trustee's alter ego, that the 

23

property does not become the  that the  the property 

24

at issue does not become the property of the trustee 

25

until there is a judicial declaration that that  that 

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

occurs.
 MS. STEEGE: 

Well, I don't think that 

3

changes the analysis, because, ultimately, in a 

4

bankruptcy case, if you're going to have to have a 

5

dispute with the debtor 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

7

question of the status of this under Illinois law 

8

 MS. STEEGE: 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

10
11

So that's  that would be a 

Correct. 
 not under Federal law, 

right? 
 MS. STEEGE: 

It would inform the decision. 

12

But, ultimately, whether the property comes into the 

13

estate or not is determined under Section 541.  And so 

14

the  the court of appeals, who have addressed this 

15

issue, and we list a number of those cases in the third 

16

footnote in our brief, all are very uniform.  They are 

17

looking to State law in a variety of different contexts 

18

to figure out what the debtor's rights are in the 

19

property because that's the Butner decision of this 

20

Court. 

21

 But, ultimately, when you make that final 

22

determination that it is property of the estate, you 

23

look to 541.  And Congress would have intended that 

24

disputes over trusts be part of that 541 determination 

25

by its inclusion of Section 541(d), which talks about 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what title the debtor holds, whether it's legal title or

2

equitable title, which is directly, you know, driven 

3

toward trusts because that's when you have a division of 

4

title.  And so it was intended that Federal law would 

5

cover that. 

6

 And I also think that, you know, a  a key 

7

difference between this and Stern in the form of claim 

8

that we have here is this is being brought against the 

9

debtor.  This isn't being brought against a third party 

10

who's been hauled into bankruptcy court against their 

11

will.  The debtor has chosen to file a bankruptcy, 

12

knowing by virtue of the statute that he or she will be 

13

required to turn over their property to the bankruptcy 

14

trustee; that there may be disputes over that.  And 

15

there can be legitimate disputes.  It doesn't 

16

necessarily just have to be a dishonest debtor, like we 

17

would contend we have here.  And that they're going to 

18

be in front of the bankruptcy judge in the first 

19

instance having those disputes determined. 

20

 It's part of the Federal scheme, exactly 

21

what bankruptcy is supposed to accomplish, which is to 

22

get all of the debtor's property put into the bankruptcy 

23

estate for distribution to creditors.  That's the 

24

central key point of every bankruptcy case. 

25

 And if you don't do that, you lose your 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discharge like Mr. Sharif.  It really is  this action

2

really is the flip side of the denial of his discharge, 

3

which no one disputes the bankruptcy judge had the 

4

authority to decide. 

5

 She couldn't decide if he should receive a 

6

discharge if we didn't know what it was he was supposed 

7

to be doing in the case in terms of the property that he 

8

had. 

9

 And the two claims really overlap each 

10

other; they're the flip side of each other.  That's why 

11

I think this is different than a cause of action against 

12

a third party such as you had in Stern or Northern 

13

Pipeline or Granfinanciera and the like. 

14
15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you've not explored 

the consent question completely. 

16

 MS. STEEGE: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sure. 
Basically the argument 

18

that the SG and the  of you and the SG is that you 

19

need express consent  or I guess the other side, 

20

saying you need express consent and they didn't give 

21

express consent.  How do you get around that? 

22

 MS. STEEGE: 

Well, Your Honor, we think that 

23

you don't need it.  The Court has held and ruled that 

24

implied consent is permissible.  The argument is based 

25

upon the bankruptcy rule, Bankruptcy Rule 7012.  And if 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you look at Section 157(c), it uses the term "express

2

consent" and then just the term "consent."  In 

3

connection with Section 157(c)(2), which deals with the 

4

consent of a litigant to proceed to judgment on a 

5

noncore Stern claim, it uses the word "consent."  So if 

6

we assume Congress meant to require express consent in 

7

157(e) dealing with consenting to a jury trial right, 

8

they must not have required express consent, and then we 

9

have a rule that's going beyond what the statute 

10
11

provides.  That's exactly the situation in Roell. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We don't have to reach both 

12

of these questions if we find one of them in  in your 

13

favor, do we? 

14

 MS. STEEGE: 

That's correct.  If you don't 

15

find it to be a Stern claim, then consent would not 

16

matter. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Which one is the better 

18

one?  Which is the prettier question or  or the one 

19

that you think has more real world effect? 

20

 MS. STEEGE: 

Well, I think the first 

21

question has real world effect in the sense that if the 

22

Court were to take away from bankruptcy judges the power 

23

to litigate disputes with the debtor over what they 

24

possess comes in or out of the bankruptcy estate, you'd 

25

see a sea change in how cases were handled.  Because 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's the basic dispute you're going to have with the

2

debtor.  You're going to have three disputes with the 

3

debtor.  It's going to be 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Even  even if consent 

5

were sufficient to confer jurisdiction?  And that's 

6

that's  maybe just to continue Justice Scalia's 

7

question, are the bankruptcy courts more confused by 

8

Question 1 or Question 2? 

9

 MS. STEEGE: 

I think there's a lot of 

10

confusion out there, Your Honor, and I think that 

11

certainly people are also concerned about the consent 

12

question, because the situation that you have today is 

13

that both parties could consent, and the bankruptcy 

14

judge could enter a judgment, and then the party who 

15

loses can turn around and say, well, there's a question 

16

about whether I really consented or not or whether it 

17

was appropriate. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

 MS. STEEGE: 

20

the courts right now. 

21

Can  can 
So both are  are problems for 

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask, you said implied 

22

consent should be sufficient.  How would you go about 

23

implying consent?  When would there be implied consent? 

24

On the basis of what? 

25

 MS. STEEGE: 

Well, I think would you would 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have implied consent where you have  here you have a

2

debtor who moved for summary judgment.  He asked the 

3

bankruptcy judge to enter judgment in his behalf.  He 

4

never sought withdrawal of the reference.  He never 

5

sought to ask the district court to take this matter 

6

away from him. 

7

 We have  I think the act of filing a 

8

bankruptcy puts you in front of the bankruptcy judge for 

9

at least the basic administration of estate, property of 

10

the estate determinations, but I would  would submit 

11

for all matters involving the debtor, because they all 

12

really do relate to that.  It's basically property of 

13

the estate determinations, whether property can be 

14

claimed as exempt and whether debtor gets the discharge. 

15

That's what will involve 99 percent of litigation of the 

16

debtor. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You've  you've said, I 

18

think, that the consent has to be knowing and 

19

intelligent.  Is there something that has to be told to 

20

the debtor to make the consent knowing and intelligent? 

21

 MS. STEEGE: 

Congress didn't require that 

22

here in Section 157, and, you know, it's a maxim of the 

23

law that knowledge  you know, lack of knowledge of the 

24

law is no excuse.  The statute puts you on notice that 

25

there is a list of proceedings, the core proceedings, 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that are like the old summary proceedings under the

2

Bankruptcy Act, that the bankruptcy judge can decide the 

3

final judgment without the consent of the parties. 

4

 And the statute also puts you on notice that 

5

if you don't agree with that, you can ask the bankruptcy 

6

judge to make a determination, you can ask the district 

7

court judge to make a determination for withdrawal of 

8

the reference. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There  there is a problem, 

10

however, here, and that problem is that Stern wasn't 

11

decided until the appeal.  On rebuttal, I want to talk 

12

about the American Colleges' appellate waiver argument.

under Section 541 stems from bankruptcy itself. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that's too broad an 

4

answer, because that would be true of fraudulent 

5

conveyances. 

6

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, and  and it also does 

7

not involve an attempt to augment the estate.  We're 

8

talking about a determination about 

9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How about a simpler 

rule, if you have legal title to something? 

11

 MR. GANNON: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well 
If you  if you possess 

13

it physically or you have legal title to it, then the 

14

bankruptcy court can determine. 

15

 MR. GANNON: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17
18
19
20
21
22

Well, I think 
They  he has  the 

trustee had legal title.  He's just claiming 
 MR. GANNON: 

The trustee had bare legal 

title and you think that that's 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 that there's an 

equitable requirement to hold it for someone else. 
 MR. GANNON: 

And  and under 541(d), if it 

23

is true that the trustee only  only holds bare legal 

24

title, and then ultimately the trust is not looked 

25

through because it's found not to exist or because it's 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

found to be the alter ego of the trustee, then the 

2

then the equitable interest would not have come into 

3

to the estate. 

4
5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yeah.  I'm trying to get 

away from the 

6

 MR. GANNON: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And so that's true. 
I'm trying to get away 

8

from the augmentation argument because it's really 

9

difficult to apply in a case like this.  Anything that's 

10

in the estate augments it or anything that comes into 

11

the estate. 

12

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I  I don't think that 

13

that's true.  I think that when the Court in Stern and 

14

Granfinanciera and Northern Pipeline was talking about 

15

the difference between questions that stem from the 

16

bankruptcy itself and are integral to the restructuring 

17

of the debtor/creditor relationship 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, then 
 they were talking about the 

20

baseline that you have there with the estate is the 

21

property 

22
23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, tell me why my 

rule is not simpler. 

24

 MR. GANNON: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I think 
If you  if you 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

physically possess it at the time you declare bankruptcy

2

or you have legal title to it 

3

 MR. GANNON: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5
6

I think that 
 then the bankruptcy 

 then it's not a Stern claim. 
 MR. GANNON: 

I suppose that  that that 

7

what this is feinting towards is the system that the 

8

parties have talked about that developed under the 1898 

9

Act that ended up being a relatively reticulated system 

10

as described in the TaubelScottKitzmiller case, in 

11

which there are multiple categories in which the 

12

bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction to make these 

13

determinations.  And we agree with Petitioners that on 

14

facts like these where there was possession of the 

15

property, which we think indisputably the trustee had 

16

possession of the trust assets here, and that would be 

17

enough to give the bankruptcy judge the jurisdiction 

18

or the referee under the 1898 Act cases  jurisdiction 

19

to determine who had title.  And then if  if 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

would look to history. 

22

 MR. GANNON: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

In Stern we said we 

Pardon? 

24

would look to history. 

25

 MR. GANNON: 

In Stern we said we 

Portions of the Stern opinion 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

looked to history but it did not indicate that the

2

historical precedents for this were going to be 

3

dispositive and we don't think that  that the 

4

rationale of Stern, Granfinanciera, and Northern 

5

Pipeline requires that as an Article III matter, nor 

6

does the statute here, because the statutory definition 

7

of  of property of the estate refers to property 

8

wherever located and by whomever held.  It still 

9

ultimately has to be property of the debtor. 

10

 And so, if you're going to say that if it's 

11

 if it's  if the debtor holds title to the property, 

12

that is the ultimate determination and if you say that 

13

that's not 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So let's to go  let's 

15

go to the hypothetical.  The sister holds title, but 

16

you're saying that it belonged to him. 

17

 MR. GANNON: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19
20

Well, I 
That she holds legal 

title but, in fact, she  it's really his money. 
 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I  I think  I think 

21

it would  if she held legal title and the property had 

22

already been transferred to her and that's what the 

23

bankruptcy judge determined, then it wouldn't be 

24

property of the estate.  And  but we don't know the 

25

answer to the question of who holds title until the 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

socalled Stern claim or nonStern claim has already

2

been decided, and so I think that that's the trouble 

3

with assuming that the answer to the title question or 

4

the ownership question  because that is the answer to 

5

the property of the estate question, we can't  we 

6

can't wait to know the  the merits determination 

7

before we know whether it's a Stern claim I think is 

8

is the problem with approaching it that way. 

9

 But it is sensible to say that the question 

10

of whether something was property of the estate on day 

11

one such that it was the debtor's property  because 

12

that's the determination here  that that is not like a 

13

Stern claim.  It's not like a fraudulent conveyance or 

14

avoidable transfer where you're attempting to go out, 

15

after the bankruptcy has already been initiated, and 

16

trying to reduce a chosen action to judgment and 

17

liquidate it and therefore increase the size of the 

18

estate after the fact. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Counsel, on the 

20

consent question, is  under your theory, is there 

21

anything wrong with Congress adding a proviso to every 

22

Federal contract saying the contractor hereby agrees to 

23

waive any Article III objections to having disputes with 

24

the government resolved by something we'll call the 

25

congressional courts where the  the individuals serve

the question. 
 MR. GANNON: 

Yes, if for no other reason 

than because 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
 MR. GANNON: 

Yes, it's okay. 
Yes, that that would be a 

11

problem  I'm sorry, that that would not be 

12

permissible.  I've forgotten the question. 

13

 But the reason why this would not be 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

15

unforgettable question. 

16

 (Laughter.)

 MR. GANNON:

I thought it was an 

I promise you I won't forget it 

now. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  Yes, we have no 

bananas. 
 MR. GANNON: 

The reason  the reason why 

22

this would be a problem is  is because of the 

23

structural concerns that you raise there which we don't 

24

think are present here.  When you said that those were 

25

 were congressional courts that would be more subject 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to supervision by Congress, we do not think that that

2

describes the bankruptcy system.  We think the 

3

bankruptcy system is akin to the magistrate judge system 

4

where this Court has repeatedly recognized that the 

5

structural concerns that were at issue in Schor were not 

6

sufficient to create a problem 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8

 MR. GANNON: 

9

You 
There is two things here. 

There is both the consent of the parties but also 

10

adequate judicial control, both in the aggregate over 

11

bankruptcy judges who are appointed by and removable by 

12

Article III judges, and also in every individual case 

13

because they don't get any bankruptcy case 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, there's 

15

judicial control in the sense that you have deferential 

16

appellate review and whatnot, but it still takes out of 

17

the Federal courts our constitutional birthright to 

18

decide cases and controversies under Article III. 

19

 MR. GANNON: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

And I think 
It's hard for me to 

see how 

22

 MR. GANNON: 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But I think 
 sort of vague 

24

vague notions of, oh, well, the judges are involved 

25

there somewhere. 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GANNON: 

But I don't think that this is

2

vague.  We're talking about something different from 

3

just having appellate review after the fact.  We're 

4

talking here about supervision of the bankruptcy judges 

5

just like magistrate judges by Article III judges, 

6

they're appointed and removed by them.  They don't ever 

7

get a case unless the Court agrees to give it to them 

8

and that seems to me the principal difference between 

9

your hypothetical congressional support scheme, which is 

10

that the parties are all not even making a voluntary 

11

choice because Congress  Congress is deeming them to 

12

have made the choice, and then also no court is able to 

13

say, I don't want the transfer to happen. 

14

 And both of those things are not true here 

15

because the parties are able to make the choice and the 

16

courts are able to withdraw the reference.  The parties 

17

are always able to ask for the courts to withdraw the 

18

reference.  This makes it just like the bankruptcy 

19

system with respect to whether it's a consentable 

20

constitutional violation. 

21

 And so we don't think that this is like 

22

subjectmatter jurisdiction, and the Court in Stern said 

23

that, that the division of authority between bankruptcy 

24

judges and district court judges and 157 is not a 

25

question of subject matter jurisdiction.  And we think 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that is why it's one that's waivable.
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You can  go back to your 

3

experience in your office.  I just want to know  it 

4

seems to me by memory, but I'm not positive  it is not 

5

totally unusual and we do have the power to give two 

6

affirmative answers where either answer would be 

7

sufficient.  That is, we could answer both questions. 

8
9

 Now is your  as a representative of the 
solicitor general, is your reaction the same as mine, 

10

that there are cases where a court had  where we had 

11

two questions. 

12

 MR. GANNON: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I 
And you say one would be 

14

enough for the party to win, so would two, but we think 

15

it's important to answer both and we will. 

16

 MR. GANNON: 

I do believe that the Court has 

17

done that.  I don't have any particular cases at the tip 

18

of my 

19
20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

made other mistakes as well, you know? 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's what I wondered.  Is 

there any reason that 

23

 MR. GANNON: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Perhaps so.  Perhaps we 

I 
 strikes you that that 

would be a mistake?  I don't know anything in the

 MR. GANNON:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

Well 

this Court that prohibits it.

 MR. GANNON:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 or in any precedent of 

I 
So I think saying it is a 

mistake does not necessarily make it one. 
 MR. GANNON: 

I think that that's something 

that would be in the discretion of the Court.  I do 

10

think that both of these questions are independently 

11

important.  It is the case that Petitioners can prevail 

12

and you can reverse the judge of the court of appeals on 

13

either ground and without having to reach the other. 

14

 I do think that until a case  there 

15

probably was not confusion in the bankruptcy courts 

16

about whether questions involving the definition of the 

17

property of the estate were Stern claims, and so  but 

18

I do think that there is confusion about that just by 

19

virtue of the fact that this case is here. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

21

 MR. GANNON: 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could I ask you 
The second 
Could I ask you this quick 

23

question before your time runs out.  If Federal 

24

Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) applies to Stern claims because 

25

they're noncore, do you agree with Petitioner that the 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rule is invalid because it requires express consent and

2

the statute does not refer to express consent? 

3

 MR. GANNON: 

I don't think you have to get 

4

to the point of saying that the rule is invalid.  That's 

5

not the way the Court approached the case in Roell where 

6

the situation was, as my friend just said, exactly 

7

parallel.  The statute did not require express consent, 

8

or it did in some places but not in this one, and the 

9

same thing is true if you contrast 157(c)(2) with 

10

157(e), the relevant statutory provision period does not 

11

require express consent. 

12

 The Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that was 

13

applicable in Roell did, and the Court nevertheless said 

14

that it was going to overlook the lack of an express 

15

waiver there because it found that there was 

16

sufficiently implied consent on the record. 

17
18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you agree that there's 



19

 MR. GANNON: 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There is 
Excuse me.  Do you agree 

21

there's implied consent merely by filing a voluntary 

22

bankruptcy petition? 

23

 MR. GANNON: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

Well, I ­ I think that the Court

that that's what the Petitioner said.

When you said, "a voluntarily

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

4

 MR. GANNON: 

Yes. 
The Court didn't grant cert on 

5

that question but we do think that there's lots of other 

6

conduct here but ultimately there's also the forfeiture 

7

after Stern itself was decided that we think would be 

8

adequate to decide that there was consent in this case. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Gannon, I hate to 

10

protract your presentation here.  I wasn't clear about 

11

what your answer to Justice Breyer covered.  Did you say 

12

there are prior cases in which we have decided two 

13

constitutional questions? 

14

 MR. GANNON: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. GANNON: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

I said two different questions. 

I think that 

 MR. GANNON: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

What about two 

constitutional questions given that we're supposed to 

19

21

Ah. 

I think that 
 avoid the determination 

of constitutional questions? 
 MR. GANNON: 

I do realize that that is the 

23

general prudential rule that the Court applies, but I 

24

think that it normally does so in a context of 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I understand 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GANNON: 

 here it would be upholding

2

the statute in both regards and therefore I don't think

that the normal concerns about constitutionality rise to 

4

the same level.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Counsel. 

Justice Kagan. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You were saying that you 

8

wanted to talk about the importance of both questions. 

9

I think you got the first one out.  What, in your view, 

10
11

is the importance of the second? 
 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I do think that the Court 

12

was not able to decide the consent question in executive 

13

benefits last term, and that there is a circuit split on 

14

it.  It would be very useful to know that Stern claims 

15

are the sorts of things to which parties consent or 

16

those claims are waivable as they are in the magistrate 

17

judge context which we think is parallel. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The government agrees 

19

with the Petitioner that the first question, what goes 

20

into this estate, that if we had to choose between the 

21

two, which would you say is the more important? 

22

 MR. GANNON: 

I  I think that  that it 

23

would be good to settle that for the purposes of 

24

bankruptcy courts, but you would still have the 

25

unsettled consent question that has been kicking around

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 

8

 MR. HACKER: 

9

please the Court: 

10

And vice versa. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 We agree with what I understand the 

11

solicitor general's position this morning to be, that 

12

the Stern rule is relatively straightforward, which is 

13

that a common law claim that seeks to augment the estate 

14

with thirdparty property cannot be withdrawn by 

15

Congress from Article III jurisdiction. 

16

 We also know that the alter ego claim 

17

asserted by Wellness was a common law claim seeking to 

18

augment 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That really begs the 

20

question, your client possessed something and he says it 

21

really belonged to someone else.  Don't you have to 

22

decide who it belongs to if there is no clear indication 

23

of it? 

24

 MR. HACKER: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Two  two point 
I mean, there may be a 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

clear one, but it still begs the question.
 MR. HACKER: 

Right.  Two points on that, 

3

Your Honor.  Let me start with where this Court started 

4

and where the law has been for decades, if not 

5

centuries, which is that the trustee of the trust 

6

possesses, if anything at all, no more than bare legal 

7

title.  And so this Court said in the Hardinsburg case, 

8

it said in Whiting Pools, and more import  maybe most 

9

importantly there is no case anywhere to the contrary, 

10

that when a trust  a trustee of a trust declares 

11

personal bankruptcy, the trust assets do not become part 

12

of the estate at the commencement of the bankruptcy. 

13

 So what Wellness had to do was establish 

14

through its common law alter ego claim that the  was 

15

to bring the assets of the trust into the 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So you're just saying that 

17

they didn't decide it correctly, but it's terribly easy 

18

to imagine a different debtor who goes into bankruptcy 

19

and he lists Item 1, 2, 3, and 4.  And the creditors 

20

come in and say, you know, it's awfully surprising, four 

21

or five, six months ago I have a similar list you gave 

22

to the National Bank, and it had 10 items on it.  What 

23

happened to 6 through 10?  Ah, the debtor replies, oh, 

24

they didn't really belong to me.  Why not?  Because 

25

State law gives it to somebody else because State law is 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the source of all property law.  And they say, no.  And

2

now we have a dispute. 

3

 So forget about the trust. 

Maybe I don't 

4

see why that's special.  This is simply a question of 

5

whether a bankruptcy judge can litigate who owns Items 6 

6

through 10, and one party says State law gives them to 

7

my cousin Mary and the other party says State law gives 

8

them right to you. 

9

 Now, if we say, no, and side with you on 

10

that one, what happens to the constitutional grant to 

11

Congress to make uniform laws of bankruptcy?  I imagine 

12

it would still exist, but I can't imagine in what form. 

13
14

 Now you see a pretty hostile argument, so I 
would like to hear your reply. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 MR. HACKER: 

I  I  and I think the 

17

example is a good one because I do think the trust is 

18

very important because we do have decades of law on 

19

that, but the example is not problematic because if in 

20

that situation the trustee says, I see some other 

21

bankruptcy trustee, sees  I see some other property, 

22

and the debtor says, that's not mine, I do think it's 

23

true that there wouldn't be a litigable claim there 

24

unless the third party also asserted ownership to the 

25

property. 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But if that happened, if the third party

2

says, that's not the debtor's, that's all mine, I've had 

3

it for years, that's my car, that's my boat, that's my 

4

house, then I think it's absolutely clear that under 

5

that circumstance the trustee could not extinguish the 

6

third party's rights, the bankruptcy court could not 

7

distinguish the third party's rights by itself.  That's 

8

an Article III claim, a classic private rights claim 

9

where the bankruptcy trustee, the bankruptcy court is 

10

reaching out to take the third party's property on the 

11

trustee's 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And what is the example of 

13

6 through 10 that you could find that wouldn't involve 

14

the issue you have described?  Because if there is a 

15

piece of property and the debtor is saying it isn't 

16

mine, it must be somebody's, and by definition it's not 

17

the creditor's, and so it must be somebody else's.  And 

18

so that other person, if there is a dispute, will say 

19

it's mine. 

20

 And therefore, isn't your answer to say to 

21

my property  to my question, too bad, the bankruptcy 

22

trustee cannot litigate who owns 6 through 10? 

23
24
25

 MR. HACKER: 

So long as the thirdparty 

asserts

Yes.

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. HACKER: 

Yes, that's right, but 

but 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, he can't do it.  All 

4

right.  Then we're back to where are we with bankruptcy 

5

courts, when you have taken from them the power to 

6

litigate what I would think is the most fundamental 

7

thing imaginable:  How much money does the debtor have 

8

in cases where that is in dispute?

 MR. HACKER: 

I don't  I don't think that's 

10

fundamental because you have  what you're talking 

11

about, I mean, this Court already crossed that bridge I 

12

think in Stern in saying when you're augmenting the 

13

estate with thirdparty property, you don't assume at 

14

the beginning of the Article III litigation that the 

15

other side has a claim.  That's the whole point.  The 

16

other side says don't take my property. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You said for thousands of 

18

years  I got that point  for thousands of years this 

19

has been the law.  So can you think of any case  I 

20

find it rather interesting, I'm reading about Henry II, 

21

who, in fact, created many of the laws of England. 

22

 So from the time of Henry II onward, is 

23

there a case that you have found somewhere which said 

24

that the bankruptcy trustee or the bankruptcy judge 

25

cannot litigate who owns property, the bankrupt or 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

someone else, in the state  in the estate.

 MR. HACKER:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Well, a couple of 
I'll read it.  I'll read 

it. 
 MR. HACKER: 

First of all, all of the 

cases 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Besides  besides Stern, 

he means. 
 MR. HACKER: 

Well, Stern  yes, Stern is 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Stern is a case of a third 

11

party and counterclaim, and there never would have been 

12

the money in the estate had it not been for the fact 

13

that the debtor in fact asserted a claim, a counterclaim 

14

against a claim that was being made by an outsider to 

15

the estate.  It's not too hard to distinguish Stern. 

16

 But I am saying other than Stern  I don't 

17

even think Stern  let's go back to Henry II.  Maybe 

18

you have so many you'd have to send them on a list, but 

19

maybe not. 

20

 MR. HACKER: 

I  if you look at all of the 

21

cases cited on both sides' brief, I think the rule is 

22

best stated in the TaubelScottKitzmiller  which is 

23

one word  case that says when there is a bona fide 

24

claim of adverse possession  or excuse me, of 

25

ownership by a third party, that can't be extinguished 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

2

except through plenary proceeding.
 And that's the exact same situation you're 

3

talking about, Your Honor.  There's no difference, and 

4

there's decades of that law, and that law and that rule 

5

was never disputed. 

6

 And so going back now to the trust 

7

proposition, I think it's important to make clear that 

8

Wellness is asserting 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Who is the third party? 

10

You said it's just  it's no different, no different 

11

than a third party coming in and saying that's my vote. 

12

Who is the third party here?  And what 

13

 MR. HACKER: 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The third  go ahead. 
There is only the 

15

trustee.  This is supposed to be his mother's trust, and 

16

his sister is supposed to be the beneficiary, so who is 

17

the third party? 

18

 MR. HACKER: 

So two  there's  well, 

19

three.  There's the trust, but importantly, during her 

20

lifetime, Soad Wattar was the owner, the only owner of 

21

the beneficial interest in the trust assets.  So she's 

22

the third party. 

23
24
25

 So to the extent the bankruptcy court wants 
to decide for itself 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought she was dead. 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HACKER: 

When the bankruptcy was

2

commenced, she was still alive, and she had the  it's 

3

a revocable living trust right.  She has the absolute 

4

right to use all of those assets to revoke the trust. 

5

That's  they're her assets.  If she had declared 

6

bankruptcy, those assets would have been in her estate. 

7

There's 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Did she say, when she was 

alive, did she say, bankruptcy court, wait a minute, 
this belongs to me? 
 MR. HACKER: 

She was in Syria, I think, I'm 

12

not sure at what point.  But the point is the trust 

13

itself was an existing document and  and was an 

14

existing entity. 

15

 And I want to be clear about something. 

16

Wellness doesn't dispute that.  I mean, Exhibit 13 to 

17

Sharif's deposition was the trust amendment in 1996.  It 

18

was an existing trust. 

19

 And, in fact, their first primary argument, 

20

which pervades their reply brief, depends on the 

21

proposition that the trust was a real entity because 

22

what they're saying is a version of what you were 

23

saying, Justice Sotomayor, which is that he had 

24

possession because he was the trustee of the trust.  The 

25

possession only exists because he's a trustee of the 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

trust.  The trust assets aren't listed in his name.  If

2

they're not in the trust, there's no tenable theory that 

3

he is the  on the face of the assets, that they start 

4

in the estate, they're going to have to be gotten 

5

somehow.  So their theory is, well, he's the trustee of 

6

a trust and therefore he has sufficient possession. 

7

 And our answer to that is simple. 

Not one 

8

case ever in the history of western law that anybody has 

9

found says that trust assets go into the personal 

10

bankruptcy estate of a trustee, if and when the trustee 

11

declares bankruptcy, this Court said the opposite in 

12

Hardenburg, it said the opposite in Whiting Pools in 

13

saying that when you have only bare legal title, which 

14

is at most the only thing a trustee has, only bare legal 

15

title goes in and no other beneficial interests go into 

16

the estate. 

17

 So then there's a second question, a second 

18

argument, which is that well, because in 2002, not one 

19

year, Justice Breyer, but seven years before the 

20

bankruptcy, we have discovered these documents that 

21

suggest that he was treating the trust as trustee was 

22

treating the trust assets as his own. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in the cases you just 

24

cited, did the courts say who decides the question of 

25

whether there's bare legal title? 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HACKER: 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Those cases were 
You  you said the case 

3

very clear, only bare legal title goes.  But who  did 

4

it  did it go on to say that the bankruptcy court 

5

cannot decide who has the bare  whether you have only 

6

bare legal title? 

7

 MR. HACKER: 

Right.  Those cases were not 

8

about that proposition.  This  this is about this 

9

this threshold proposition that because he's the trustee 

10

of the trust and in possession of bare legal title, 

11

that's all we need to know.  That's their 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No argue  so  so where 

13

you have brought me so far is these cases say  what 

14

they say is you have to  you can't just grab it; you 

15

have to proceed under Section 23 and have a proceeding. 

16

But the  the  a proceeding  some kind of a 

17

proceeding, I don't know exactly what that kind is, you 

18

probably do, but that doesn't mean the trustee doesn't 

19

get it.  I mean, it's the trustee who litigates it out, 

20

it's the trustee who decides, but I don't know what a 

21

Section 23 proceeding is. 

22

 MR. HACKER: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MR. HACKER: 

25

In the older cases 
Yeah. 
 the rule that would apply, 

Justice Kennedy, would be the Talburg v. Scott 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Kitzmiller rule, you have to have a plenary proceeding

2

to go get it. 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

A plenary proceeding.  But 

where does that take place? 
 MR. HACKER: 

That would have been  it's 

6

sort of the equivalent now the parties are treating, I 

7

think, not incorrectly as equivalent now of an 

8

Article III proceeding.  This would have to be 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10

the bankruptcy judge? 

11

 MR. HACKER: 

It didn't take place before 

Well, at the  most of these 

12

cases at the time, remember, the district court was the 

13

bankruptcy court and the question was whether it's the 

14

exercise of summary jurisdiction versus a plenary 

15

Article III proceeding. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

 MR. HACKER: 

Oh, I see the problem. 
A plenary proceeding.  Now it 

18

would be an adversary proceeding that would have to be 

19

determined finally by the  the Federal court. 

20

 So  but I want to get to the second point, 

21

because it's an important one.  Wellness doesn't just 

22

rest on the proposition that just because the trustee is 

23

a trustee, the trust assets are part of the estate, 

24

which I think is completely unsupportable.  They go on 

25

to say because seven years earlier, as trustee, he 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

treated them as  the trust assets as his own;

2

therefore, we should disregard the trust. 

3

 That argument, I think, as I think 

4

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, is functionally 

5

indistinguishable from a fraudulent transfer claim 

6

because they're saying, based on his alleged misuse of 

7

trust assets at some point in the now distant past, we 

8

should treat them as part of the estate, we should 

9

disregard the trust, which is just like a fraudulent 

10

transfer, which it says because of something the debtor 

11

did before, transferring the assets, we should disregard 

12

the transfer and treat them as part of the estate. 

13

 In that respect, it's  it's 

14

indistinguishable and it is in that respect in the same 

15

way because you augment the estate. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Just to clarify the 

17

record, I asked the question whether they were or 

18

weren't. 

19

 MR. HACKER: 

Fair enough.  And  and I will 

20

try to answer it, which is I think they are in that 

21

respect indistinguishable.  And then if you follow from 

22

what the  all of the lower courts have said, that a 

23

fraudulent transfer action is a Stern claim 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, we've said that, 

too, against 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HACKER: 

Held that it's an Article 

2

basically an Article III claim in Grand Financier.  So I 

3

think for all of these reasons, it is quite clear that 

4

the action to bring these claims into the estate is a 

5

common law action seeking to augment the estate with 

6

somebody else's property.  Property that Soad Wattar 

7

owned during her life and that Ragda Sharif owned upon 

8

Soad's death. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Alright, so give me examples. 

10

The suggested rule that I have for the Solicitor 

11

General , which he would like the broader one, but if at 

12

the time you have legal title to or in physical 

13

possession of something, then it's not a Stern claim, 

14

not an Article III claim because that is the 

15

quintessential question that bankruptcy judges decide 

16

are the things that you possess either by title or by 

17

constructive holding  or by holding. 

18

 MR. HACKER: 

Right.  I think there's two 

19

problems with that analysis.  First is that all the 

20

trustee has is bare legal title as a matter of law, does 

21

not have any property interest, which is what the 

22

current bankruptcy code focuses on, what are the 

23

debtor's interests in property and it's the  the 

24

trustee of a trust does not have any interest, 

25

beneficial or legal interest in the assets, it's only 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

bare legal title.
 So to get more interest as part of the 

3

estate, you have to have some common law way to do that, 

4

some claim for doing that and a classic claim is an 

5

alter ego claim, if that's what you think because of 

6

something the trustee did, then 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but you say that's 

8

always going to be the case, that you need an 

9

Article III proceeding whenever the bankruptcy trustee 

10

determines that something belongs to the debtor and is 

11

in the bankruptcy estate and some other private party 

12

says, no, it belongs to me.  That always has to be 

13

litigated in an Article III court? 

14

 MR. HACKER: 

I don't think this Court needs 

15

to decide that.  That's not quite the question here 

16

because the property interests from the start are 

17

outside the estate.  But I do think 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is that what you're arguing 

here? 
 MR. HACKER: 

I  I  I would not be 

21

surprised if this Court were to hold one day that if a 

22

third party has a claim to property, comes into court 

23

and says, that's my  that's my house, I know the 

24

debtor says it is, that says it's his and the trustee 

25

thinks it's his, that's my house, that that person is 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

entitled to an Article III adjudication 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's exactly 

3

because  it's interesting.  I mean, I've read the page 

4

you have there now with the cases.  And I see you can 

5

the distinction will drive you towards that, not 100 

6

percent, because there will be some instances of 

7

colorable  colorable title and so forth, not 100 

8

percent, but 99 percent, items 6 through 10 go to a 

9

different court. 

10

 But what  the constitutional question is 

11

the deepest one to me, is we do have a constitutional 

12

provision specifically giving to Congress the authority 

13

to create a uniform system of bankruptcy courts which 

14

have served our economy well, I think.  That's what I 

15

read.  Makes us richer.  And on the other hand, we do 

16

have the question, as you point out, that this is 

17

determining a title where there are two people under 

18

State law contesting it.  And so which prevails?  And 

19

until I think Stern, it would have been Congress's 

20

delegation, maybe. 

21

 And what is the strongest argument for not 

22

giving weight?  These are sort of like administrative 

23

agencies defining  you know, deciding things that 

24

never have been done before.  What's the strongest 

25

argument?  No, don't do it, it might gut the bankruptcy 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court, but don't do it.  Or maybe you want to say it

2

won't gut the bankruptcy court. 

3

 MR. HACKER: 

I don't ­ that That was my 

4

answer was I don't think it will gut the bankruptcy court. 

5

We think this is just a straightforward application of 

6

where we already are  where we already are with Stern. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, yes.  I agree with you 

8

to this extent.  It's either Stern marches forward or 

9

it's  I'd say steps in place. 

10

 MR. HACKER: 

Well, and I don't think  I 

11

don't think we're pushing Stern forward.  I do think 

12

we're just applying Stern. 

13

 But I also want to address your point about 

14

uniform bankruptcy code.  I think the fact that this 

15

Court has long said and understood and the lower courts 

16

have accepted that bankruptcy law takes State law and 

17

property rights as defined by State law as they find 

18

them.  That's all we're talking about here.  To the 

19

extent there is a State law property dispute between a 

20

third party and the debtor/bankruptcy trust trustee, 

21

that  that doesn't change the uniformity of the 

22

bankruptcy code. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And I suppose the 

24

constitutional provision authorizing Congress to 

25

establish a uniform law of bankruptcy does not authorize 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress to establish bankruptcy courts that can decide

2

questions which would normally be decided by Article III 

3

courts. 

4

 MR. HACKER: 

That's clearly right.  You 

5

could establish bankruptcy law, but it's going to be an 

6

Article III question, the extent to which the bankruptcy 

7

courts can exercise judicial power. 

8
9

 As to one more point on Justice Sotomayor's 
question, I had two responses.  The second one was that 

10

physical possession is not a great test.  As this case 

11

shows, Sharif as trustee didn't physically possess 

12

anything.  If anybody did, it was the banks where the 

13

trust assets were, so you can't think about it in terms 

14

of physical possession. 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's  let me proceed 

16

with this question one more step.  Every day of the week 

17

administrative agencies change State law.  Every day of 

18

the week they change State law, even involving property. 

19

And in such a case, the question is whether  has this 

20

administrative agency, under authority of Congress, 

21

changed State law affecting people's property rights in 

22

a way that deprives them of due process of law?  Have 

23

they gotten fair procedure? 

24

 And so is a possible answer to your problem: 

25

If the procedures of the bankruptcy court are fair when 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they litigate these questions of property right, the

2

fact that they do affect State law and take property 

3

among persons switching it is not forbidden by the 

4

Constitution where it indeed is authorized as part of a 

5

uniform system of bankruptcy law? 

6

 MR. HACKER: 

I think due process viewed that 

7

way is not sufficient.  I think, again, this Court 

8

answered that question in Stern.  There wasn't a claim 

9

that there wasn't going to be due process for the 

10

disposition of the  of the property rights there.  The 

11

problem was that the bankruptcy court was exercising the 

12

judicial power of the United States in entering a final 

13

judgment.  And if I can turn to that argument, I will. 

14

 Stern itself is based on a structural 

15

separation of powers concerns, that private rights of 

16

this kind are exclusively committed to  by the 

17

Constitution, to Article III.  It's about the exercise 

18

of judicial power, which entails the implementation and 

19

enforcement of judgments of the United States that are 

20

entitled to full faith and credit by courts both in the 

21

United States and elsewhere, pursuant to treaties.  They 

22

are precedential.  They can be law  they are law of 

23

the case in what can be very complicated cases that 

24

stretch around different courts and go on for years. 

25

That's 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

By the way, is  are

2

the arguments you're raising now any different as 

3

applied to magistrate judges?  If we rule in your favor 

4

in this case, are we calling into question our  our 

5

acceptance of magistrate judge positions? 

6

 MR. HACKER: 

Well, a couple of points. 

7

First of all, with respect to magistrate judges, it's 

8

only with respect to final adjudications.  Magistrate 

9

judges can still perform the functions 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So your answer is yes, 

11

because you can do  on express consent, you can do 

12

reports and recommendations. 

13

 MR. HACKER: 

As  as to final adjudications 

14

of private rights matters, magistrate judges can still 

15

do something, can still litigate and resolve public 

16

rights, whatever those kinds of rights and matters are. 

17

But I do think it would be difficult after this case to 

18

say that a magistrate can exercise judicial power of the 

19

United States to enter a final judgment based solely on 

20

consent.  I think this Court answered that question in 

21

Schor, effectively. 

22

 Schor would have been an easy case, an 

23

incredibly easy case, if consent alone were enough, 

24

because that was an issue in Schor, and the parties 

25

there did consent.  But the Court didn't stop with that 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

one sentence:  The parties consented; that's all we need

2

to know.  The Court went on to do an elaborate analysis 

3

of the structural concerns involved and why there were 

4

no structural concerns, such that the consent was 

5

sufficient.  And when you boil it all down, basically 

6

what Schor said, which is what I think the Court 

7

recognized in Stern, was that the structural concerns 

8

exist when you're talking about the adjudication of a 

9

private 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I agree, but we didn't 

say that you couldn't consent in Schor. 
 MR. HACKER: 

I understand that.  I'm just 

13

saying, it would have been a very easy case if consent 

14

were enough.  And the Court nevertheless went on to say 

15

consent is enough here, because we're talking about what 

16

is 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, consent is enough 

for arbitration, and there you give up 
 MR. HACKER: 

I understand that.  And 

20

arbitration is fundamentally different.  Arbitration is 

21

not the exercise of the judicial power of the 

22

United States.  An arbitrator doesn't issue a judgment. 

23

It's not entitled to full faith and credit.  It's a 

24

fundamentally different kind of exercise of authority, 

25

of which 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but it's something

2

which has to be enforced by a court except in very 

3

extraordinary circumstances.  You know, there's much 

4

less supervision over the arbitration system than there 

5

is over a typical bankruptcy court. 

6

 MR. HACKER: 

Right.  But the decision by the 

7

parties to go to an arbitrator  which, by the way, is 

8

their own decision.  What arbitrator they choose is 

9

their own choice.  The arbitrator is not controlled 

10

the salary of the arbitrator is not controlled by 

11

Congress.  The tenure of the arbitrator is not 

12

controlled by Congress.  And when the FFA  excuse me 

13

 the FAA 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There's very little 

difference 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

All those things make it 

17

worse.  You know, this is a proceeding that's totally 

18

divorced from any kind of control by anybody, and yet 

19

Federal courts, under the Arbitration Act, simply have 

20

to rubberstamp it and say it's valid except in 

21

extremely unusual circumstances. 

22

 MR. HACKER: 

But that's pursuant to 

23

Congress's Article I power to say, here is a type of 

24

contract that we're going to say is enforceable under a 

25

particular situation.  That's all arbitration is, is a 

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

private contract.
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's just contract law, 

3

isn't it?  I mean, they're just enforcing the parties' 

4

contracts. 

5

 MR. HACKER: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.  And that 
But 
This is the parties' 

8

contract.  It's  I mean, the entire question is that

the parties are consenting to go to bankruptcy court, 

10

and the question is:  Will that consent be sufficient in 

11

the same way that it is in the arbitration system? 

12

 MR. HACKER: 

I understand.  But it adds the 

13

element that what you're consenting to, by hypothesis, 

14

is the exercise of judicial power by the entry of a 

15

judgment that will be given full faith and credit, the 

16

entry of a judgment by an entity in a 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, because that's what 

18

happens in arbitration.  You're agreeing to the entry of 

19

a judgment, of an award.  Perhaps not even, because you 

20

don't even put that into the contract.  Congress is 

21

saying, we're going to do it anyway. 

22

 MR. HACKER: 

What I'm saying is, you're not 

23

 you're not consenting to the exercise of the judicial 

24

 judicial power, to the dilution of the Article III 

25

court's authority

precedential. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

5

 MR. HACKER: 

6
7

Well, I understand that 

Please.  I'm sorry. 
Well, that's all I was going to 

say. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I  you know, I understand 

8

that formalism matters in many contexts, but the fact 

9

that the arbitrator himself doesn't issue the judgment, 

10

and instead you have to take it across the street and 

11

the Federal court has to issue the judgment, basically 

12

on the arbitrator's sayso, again, seems to me  I 

13

mean, the arbitrator case seems to me much more 

14

threatening to the integrity of the Federal judicial 

15

system than a system of bankruptcy courts which are, 

16

from the very beginning all the way through, supervised 

17

by  by district courts. 

18

 MR. HACKER: 

Well, I mean, the  the key 

19

difference, though, I think, is that, as I said, 

20

bankruptcy courts are exercising judicial power. 

21

Arbitrators aren't.  And then when the district court 

22

in an arbitration proceeding, all the district court is 

23

doing is enforcing a judgment  excuse me  enforcing 

24

an arbitration award, a contractual choice, pursuant to 

25

a Congressional judgment that says, here are the rules, 

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the decision rule for enforcing this particular type of

2

contract.  That's an Article I issue.  It's within 

3

Congress's Article I power to constrain  to establish 

4

the decision rule that the  the part of the  the 

5

entity exercising judicial power will apply. 

6

 In this situation, the party exercising, the 

7

entity exercising the judicial power is a 

8

nonArticle III court.  It's as if you said  you 

9

changed the FAA and added another paragraph to say, an 

10

arbitrator's awards are exercises  they're final 

11

judgments of the United States, entitled to full faith 

12

and credit, subject to appellate review by the  by 

13

appellate courts.  And I think 

14
15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you spend a moment 

just talking about the forfeited argument on appeal? 

16

 MR. HACKER: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

On the  the 
The  the argument that 

18

consent can be presumed from your forfeiture of the 

19

argument on appeal. 

20

 MR. HACKER: 

And I'm glad you put it this 

21

way, Your Honor, because I think they're  they're 

22

different points.  The  the law clearly requires 

23

consent, and I think everybody agrees it requires 

24

knowing and voluntary consent.  You have to have at 

25

least that.  The rule which we think is applicable, and 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

agree with the American College of Bankruptcy, that the

2

rules writers and this Court in implementing the rule 

3

required express consent.  I don't think there's a 

4

credible argument here that there was express consent. 

5

 And I think this Court ought to adopt 

6

express consent as the requirement and hold that there 

7

was not express consent here, precisely for the 

8

constitutional avoidance reasons that Justice Scalia 

9

mentioned earlier, to avoid getting into the whole 

10

discussion we just had, because if there's insufficient 

11

consent here, then we don't need to decide the 

12

circumstances under which consent is sufficient. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But isn't forfeiture quite 

14

different from consent?  It's not a species of consent. 

15

It's different from consent. 

16

 MR. HACKER: 

And I'm sorry I delayed getting 

17

to Justice Sotomayor's question.  The reason there's no 

18

forfeiture here, among the reasons, is that this was a 

19

problem of appellate jurisdiction.  There was no 

20

appellate jurisdiction here because there was no final 

21

judgment in the bankruptcy court.  If our first argument 

22

is right, then the bankruptcy court lacked authority to 

23

issue a final judgment.  So when we went up to "appeal," 

24

quote/unquote, in the district court, there was no  it 

25

wasn't permissible for that court to exercise appellate 

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

jurisdiction 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You think a final judgment 

3

has to be a valid final judgment in order for there to 

4

be an appeal? 

5

 MR. HACKER: 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

7
8
9

I think it has to be 
It can be final and it can 

be invalid. 
 MR. HACKER: 

Well, it's not a question of 

being a defect.  I think the problem here is there's an 

10

absolute lack of any authority to enter a final 

11

judgment.  There wasn't something from which the 

12

district court had any authority to exercise appellate 

13

jurisdiction.  That was the problem.  It wasn't a 

14

question of the date it was entered. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I mean, if a court enters a 

16

judgment against you and you say that court never had 

17

jurisdiction to enter that judgment, you can't take an 

18

appeal because there wasn't a final judgment because the 

19

court below lacked jurisdiction.  That's the argument? 

20

 MR. HACKER: 

Well, no, the argument would 

21

be:  If  at any point on appeal, I can raise the 

22

problem that the court to which I'm appealing lacks 

23

appellate jurisdiction, lacks jurisdiction to resolve 

24

the case, that's the kind of nonwaivable problem.  And 

25

it's  something that cannot be waived also can't be 

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

forfeited.  And  and so that's the reason that there's

2

no forfeiture problem here. 

3

 Beyond that, it's quite clear that 

4

Mr. Sharif made every effort to preserve the issue to 

5

the extent he became aware of it.  It was only 6 weeks 

6

after Stern was decided that he filed his opening brief. 

7

Did not cite Stern, that's true.  But only a month or two 

8

later his sister, Ragda Sharif, files a motion to 

9

withdraw the reference.  And then he immediately 

10

essentially; his lawyer realized what's happened.  As 

11

soon as he's aware of the Stern argument, as soon as the 

12

Seventh Circuit issues its decision in Ortiz actually 

13

applying Stern, then he promptly raises this issue. 

14

 He's not sandbagging. 

There's no 

15

gamesmanship here.  As soon as it's clear that he 

16

understands that his consent was required before what 

17

happened to him could permissibly happen, he 

18

demonstrated that he did not consent to the exercise of 

19

that  of that  of that jurisdiction. 

20

 Now, of course, our primary submission is 

21

the bankruptcy court never had that jurisdiction.  And 

22

to  and we think that's a correct argument, but to 

23

avoid that argument, we think the simpler approach for 

24

this Court is to say that express consent was required; 

25

it wasn't satisfied; or that if implied consent was 

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sufficient, to apply what this Court applied in the

2

Roell case in finding implied consent, which clearly was 

3

not applicable here. 

4

 In Roell, the Court found implied consent 

5

only because, quote, "the litigant or counsel was 

6

made"  "was made aware of the need for consent" 

7

didn't happen here  "and the right to refuse it" 

8

also didn't happen here  "and still voluntarily 

9

appeared to try the case." 

10

 Further, the Court emphasized in Roell, the 

11

party later actually did consent in writing.  That also 

12

didn't happen here. 

13

 So none of the factors that created implied 

14

consent in Roell were sufficient, and for that reason we 

15

think the Court should affirm the judgment below. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

17

 Ms. Steege, you have five minutes left.

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE STEEGE 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MS. STEEGE: 

In response to the test that 

21

Justice Sotomayor proposed about possession, that, in 

22

fact, under the historic cases  the 

23

TaubelScottKitzmiller case, that's the easy situation, 

24

the situation we have here where the debtor has actual 

25

possession of the property. 

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And we don't contend that Mr. Sharif had 

2

had just a legal fiction as a trustee possession.  This 

3

was the house he lived in, the business he ran, his own 

4

retirement accounts, and his own bank accounts.  These 

5

were assets he was enjoying while trying to take 

6

advantage of the bankruptcy system, having, not 

7

incoincidentally, left an Article III court where he was 

8

litigating and where the Article III judge had held him 

9

in contempt and thrown him in jail several times.  So he 

10

made a choice to go to bankruptcy court.  He had actual 

11

possession of these assets.  And that, under the 

12

historic precedent, has always been the easy case for 

13

the bankruptcy judge to decide. 

14

 That case goes the other way. 

But that's 

15

because the litigant was trying to bring a preference 

16

action.  What was happening in that case is the sheriff 

17

had seized some property, and the argument was he had 

18

done it within what was then a fourmonth preference 

19

period, and they were really trying to bring a 

20

preference case under the constructive actual 

21

possession. 

22

 That's different than the situation with a 

23

debtor that has actual possession of the property.  And 

24

so when you look at these cases, whenever it's the 

25

debtor who has possession, going back to the historic 

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

English law, the courts have always allowed the

2

bankruptcy referee or judge to make that determination. 

3

 With respect to the cases that were 

4

discussed, the Whiting Pools and the State Bank of 

5

Hardinsburg cases, neither of those cases actually 

6

involved trustees.  Whiting Pools was decided shortly 

7

after this Court decided Northern Pipeline.  Northern 

8

Pipeline was cited in that case, and that's a case where 

9

the bankruptcy judge's judgment ordering the Internal 

10

Revenue Service to return property back to the 

11

Chapter 11 debtor's estate because it belonged there, 

12

subject to their rights as a secured creditor.  The 

13

Court upheld that.  So I don't think that stands for the 

14

proposition that bankruptcy judges don't have the 

15

authority to decide disputes about where property should 

16

come into the estate. 

17

 With respect to the issue of consent, yes, 

18

this does have an impact.  You know, our  our argument 

19

is very much based upon the fact that the Magistrate Act 

20

has been held  upheld in Roell and Peretz and 

21

Gonzalez.  There is authority in the Fifth Circuit 

22

six of the judges in the  in the Fifth Circuit have 

23

issued a dissent in a bankruptcy case saying that they 

24

see no basis to allow the magistrate system to exist, 

25

given that the Fifth Circuit has held that 157(c)(2) 

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

consent is unconstitutional.
 So you do have a circumstance where the 

3

courts are  the lower courts, anyway  are seeing the 

4

two systems as the same.  And they are the same, because 

5

the Article III judiciary has control over the 

6

bankruptcy process at every step.  It refers the cases 

7

to the bankruptcy judges; it can take them away.  Anyone 

8

who ever has a problem with the bankruptcy judge can 

9

always seek a motion to withdraw the reference.  And 

10

it's the district court judge who decides that. 

11

 There's also macrocontrol over the system, 

12

in the sense that bankruptcy judges are pointed by the 

13

Article III courts, they can be removed for cause by the 

14

Article III courts, and for all of the reasons that the 

15

Courts of Appeals that address this issue unanimously, 

16

across the board and upheld the magistrate system, all 

17

of that rationale in those cases applies to the 

18

bankruptcy system. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MS. STEEGE: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

TaubelScott. 
Yes. 
Burrell, he says that 

22

they say that where possession was assertively held, not 

23

for the bankrupt, but for others prior to bankruptcy, 

24

the party in possession who is not subject to summary 

25

judgment can be divested only if a plenary sued under 

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Section 23.
 By that, I take it he means it's this case. 

3

It's true that he said he was trustee.  His mother says, 

4

no, no, it is my property, or whatever, and  and 

5

therefore that fits within that case; therefore this is 

6

one of the ones that went to a full court and didn't go 

7

to the  a bankruptcy case.  So that's his case. 

8

What's your response to that? 

9

 MS. STEEGE: 

But that's not this case, 

10

because the debtor has possession.  And TaubelScott 

11

sets out five circumstances in which we have plenary or 

12

summary jurisdiction under that statute.  And on the 

13

easy side of the line, on the constitutional side, 

14

postStern, is debtors' possession of that property. 

15

You can't make a claim like we have here. 

16

 And Wellness never conceded that the trust 

17

was valid.  That was the dispute before the court.  You 

18

can't let a debtor  well, you can, but you  it would 

19

be very difficult for the system if a debtor were 

20

allowed to say, I don't really own it.  I'm using it; I 

21

have it; I have possessed it 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, the money here is in 

his bank account.  That's the point. 
 MS. STEEGE: 

Yeah.  I mean, you  you would 

have a circumstance where the bankruptcy judge would 

62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have no authority.  And Mueller v. Nugent, decided back

2

in 1902, recognized that and said you would have courts 

3

that would have no ability to supervise the system that 

4

they're charged with supervising.
