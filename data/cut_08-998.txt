CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 08-998, Hamilton,

5

the Chapter 13 Trustee, v. Lanning.
Mr. Hamilton.

6
7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN HAMILTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HAMILTON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Tenth Circuit and Stephanie Lanning were

11
12

wrong in ignoring the new Chapter 13 means test

13

contained in the 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code.

14

The amendments to the 2005 Bankruptcy Code were intended

15

to reduce judicial discretion by inserting a formula

16

rather than the judicial discretion that had previously

17

been accorded to judges and to the litigants.
Stephanie Lanning fell afoul of the means

18
19

test because during the first 2 months of a 6-month

20

lookback period, which I will explain in a moment, she

21

had more income than what she had in the rest of the

22

6-month lookback period.

23

from her former employer, Payless, and distorted what

24

her income appeared to be during that 6-month period of

25

time.

That income was from a buyout

Because of that, the amount which the means test

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

showed that she would be required to pay to her

2

creditors was more than she could actually pay.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which means -- which

4

means what?

5

concede that on the strict application of the 6 months

6

she -- her income is much too high for her possibly to

7

pay the creditors.

8
9

What is the consequence of that?

You

So what happens to her?

MR. HAMILTON:

What happens to her and what

could have happened to her may be two different

10

propositions, Justice Ginsburg.

11

there are two parts to that 6-month lookback period,

12

which are found in 101(10A) of the United States

13

Bankruptcy Code -- and the statutes, by the way here,

14

are found at pages 83 through 96 of the petition

15

appendix.

16

In the first place,

101(10A) has a first part which defines the

17

6-month lookback period as being 6 months prior to the

18

filing of the date of the petition -- actually, the end

19

of the month prior to the filing of the petition.

20

Congress's thought was, it seems, that that would be

21

more representative of what an individual's actual

22

income would be.

23

There is a second part to that 6-month

24

lookback period which says essentially that the debtor

25

can move that 6-month lookback period by not filing

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certain papers with the court.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's -- can you explain

3

that?

4

she doesn't do what the statute requires her to do.

5

mean, she's supposed to file that schedule.

6

required, the statute says, to file it.

7

advantage if she doesn't do what she's instructed to do?

8
9

It seems very odd.

MR. HAMILTON:

It says she can do that if
I

She's

But she gets an

The part of the statute that

you are referring to is under 523, and it essentially

10

says that debtor shall file -- 521, excuse me -- shall

11

file certain schedules and that would include the income

12

and expense schedules, Schedule I and Schedule J.

13

certainly the court has the ability, under that statute,

14

to extend the time or to excuse the performance of a

15

debtor in that regard.

16

about that wording in the statute.

17

And

So there's nothing incongruous

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do you -- what do

18

you do with the contention that the court is bounded by

19

other requirements such as the timing of the meeting of

20

creditors and the plan confirmation, that that binds the

21

district court from resetting it?

22

MR. HAMILTON:

Certainly all of those time

23

frames can be moved, Justice Sotomayor.

24

again, the actual timing of the confirmation hearing in

25

a Chapter 13 case may be fluid, although there are

5
Alderson Reporting Company

There is -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certain time limits for the first meeting of creditors

2

and for when the first -- when the confirmation hearing

3

is held.

4

hearing would be in a Chapter 12 or in a Chapter 11

5

case.

They can be extended, just as the confirmation

So the idea is the second part of 101(10A)

6
7

allows the debtor to say:

Your Honor, my 6-month time

8

frame immediately prior to the filing of the bankruptcy

9

petition is not representative of my income; I would

10

like to have that time frame moved.

11

would appear to be moveable up to the confirmation

12

hearing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

And that time frame

Moveable to where?

What

14

-- what would be -- you say -- this time period, the

15

statutory -- the 6-month lookback, she has these 2

16

extraordinary months.

17

Court, please change the period.

18

Anything she wants?

So now she's going to say:

MR. HAMILTON:

19

Change it to what?

No, Your Honor.

That would

20

be up to the court.

21

court, as the language suggests in the second part of

22

101(10A).

23

It would be discretionary with the

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't it the case that

24

before the 2005 amendments, bankruptcy courts were

25

recognized as having discretion in calculating projected

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disposable income to take into account changes in the

2

debtor's income after the filing of the plan, and

3

shouldn't we presume that -- that Congress intended to

4

continue essentially the same regime, unless Congress

5

provided some clear indication that they wanted to

6

depart from it?

7

MR. HAMILTON:

Certainly prior to the 2005

8

amendments, your assessment is correct.

The court had

9

the discretion to be able to assess the debtor's

10

situation, use its discretion to determine what income

11

and expenses should be calculated in determining whether

12

or not a debtor was paying his or her best efforts under

13

1325(b)(1).

14

Here, there is a clear formula.

And if you

15

read these -- there are three, three key statutes that

16

form a triangle in order to give me the conclusion that

17

I make and that I suggest to Your Honor.

18

we start with 1325(b)(1), which is the statute that

19

brings into play the disposable income and projected

20

disposable income requirements.

21

now defined as "current monthly income."

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that is,

"Disposable income" is

It is odd that Congress

23

provided this very detailed formula and -- and that they

24

would provide such a detailed formula and then say:

25

the bankruptcy court can modify that based on a

7
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

projection.

2

But still we have the word "projection" -

3

"projected."

4

strange, really absurd results; isn't that true?

5

you have to devise some really elaborate escape

6

strategies in order to allow a debtor to avoid those

7

very strange results.

8
9

And your interpretation leads to very

MR. HAMILTON:

And

Respectfully, Justice Alito,

I don't any agree with the assessment that -- of what

10

you just stated.

Essentially, this formula allows the

11

bankruptcy court to move that 6-month period of time,

12

not to ignore the formula.

The formula's there.

The formula defines "current monthly

13
14

income."

15

subtracted reasonable and necessary expenses.

16

formerly, under the old law, the '78 code, those

17

reasonable and necessary expenses contained a few

18

specifics, but largely it was up to the court to

19

determine them.

20

From the current monthly income then is

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

But you say that that can be

21

done only if the debtor fails to file a form that the

22

debtor is required to file; isn't that right?

23

MR. HAMILTON:

In -- under 101(10A), the

24

second part, yes.

25

some other -- other avenues for the debtor that are

But I think there are -- there are

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

statutory.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you do with the

3

situation in which the change that is projected to occur

4

and in fact may be almost certain to occur is one that

5

causes an increase in the debtor's income?

6

the debtor was unemployed through almost all of the

7

lookback period and then just before the filing of the

8

plan gets a job with a good salary.

9

the -- if you just look at the lookback period, the

10
11
12
13
14
15

Let's say

You would say that

debtor would be required to pay practically nothing.
MR. HAMILTON:

No, Your Honor, I would not

agree with that.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What is a creditor to do in

that situation?
MR. HAMILTON:

Well, there -- there are a

16

couple of avenues.

There is a new statutory provision

17

under 1325(a)(7) that says the plan must be filed in

18

good faith and -- I'm sorry, the petition must be filed

19

in good faith.

20

must be filed in good faith.

21

faith analysis that the debtor's actions may be

22

subjected to even after the plan is filed.

23

would be as trustee the avenue that I would approach is

24

that, even though the schedule formula may have been

25

complied with, that if there had been a drastic increase

1325(a)(3) provides that the petition
So we still have the good

9
Alderson Reporting Company

And that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in income post-petition, then that -- that should need

2

to be accounted for.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, why -- what

4

commends going through all these machinations, all of

5

these alternative ways of avoiding absurd results?

6

Isn't the answer simply that we just narrow the

7

circumstances in which a court can deviate from the

8

statutory formula?

9

I mean, it's not -- even before this change,

10

it wasn't that the district courts could at whim change

11

the projected income.

12

to do so.

13

interests that Congress had in creating this new formula

14

for income and expenses?

They have to have a clear ground

Why is that inadequate to protect the

MR. HAMILTON:

15

My answer, Justice Sotomayor,

16

is that Congress provided the formula, and it's not up

17

to the courts, I suggest, to modify that formula.

18

of the -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

Part

There was a formula

20

before.

21

to the more defined terms for income and expense.

22

that says nothing about changing the court's power to

23

act in a situation where the formula's clearly not going

24

to work.

25

It was somewhat ambiguous, and that's what led

That was the standard before.
MR. HAMILTON:

Two points, Justice

10
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Sotomayor.

One is that there was no formula before.

2

There was some general guidance that was given in the

3

statute.

4

Good faith is almost incapable of definition, yet every

5

circuit in the United States has a laundry list of

6

factors that are taken into account for good faith.

7

Here, reasonable and necessary expenses

It's much like the proposition of good faith.

8

under the old law had a few suggestions as to what

9

needed to be involved with them.

10

Now we have a portion

of another part of the triangle, which is under 707(b).
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

But in a sense that cuts

12

against you.

13

opening brief, it seemed to me the tone was, well, if

14

you accept the Respondent's position Congress did

15

nothing at all.

16

important.

17

The question is, does that formula apply to projected?

18

Can that formula be modified altered or projected for

19

projected?

20

it's not as if the amendment accomplishes nothing even

21

under the Respondent's view.

22

very important.

23

As I was -- when I was reading your

Well, they did do something very

They had a formula for disposable income.

So it's not as if Congress did nothing or

MR. HAMILTON:

It accomplished something

My answer, Justice Kennedy,

24

is that the definition of the word, quote, "projected,"

25

end of quote, has -- there's never has been one in the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

code.

That was a term that was in the 1978 code and is

2

carried over into the present code.

3

How it was applied is vastly different.

The

4

dispute under the prior law was over whether or not the

5

court could take into account changes in circumstances

6

which were likely to occur post-confirmation.

7

had cases like the Anderson v. Satterlee case out of the

8

Ninth Circuit and the Midkiff case out of the Tenth

9

Circuit that disagreed as to how that ought to be

10

And so we

applied.

11

In the Anderson v. Satterlee case the

12

Chapter 13 trustee requested that the debtor sign

13

essentially a pledge that they would devote their excess

14

income to the plan, and the Anderson court said:

15

minute; there is another statute at issue here and that

16

is 1329.

17

after the plan has been confirmed.

18

confirmation of the plan, the debtor still has the

19

ability -- and this ties in with some of the comments

20

made by Justice Alito -- the debtor still has the

21

ability to amend the plan under 1323.

22

Wait a

1329 allows for the modification of the plan
Prior to the

So all of these statutes need to be read

23

together to show what the result is.

24

is not whether or not changes should be taken into

25

account for post-confirmation that may be likely to

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Now the question

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

occur, but whether or not the court may deviate from the

2

statute where Congress has said this is how we want you

3

to determine current monthly income, therefore

4

disposable income and consequently projected disposable

5

income.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

But you already told us

7

that there could be a deviation through this

8

101(10A)(ii).

9

be done, did the trustee recommend, did the trustee say,

And why, if that was all that needed to

10

bankruptcy judge, let's move the period, let's use this

11

provision and we will get another period that doesn't

12

have those 2 months with the extraordinary income?
MR. HAMILTON:

13

No, Justice Ginsburg, and the

14

reason is, is that that privilege is accorded only to

15

the debtor to move that 6-month period.

16

unsecured creditors nor the trustee have the ability to

17

request that that 6-month period be moved.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

suggested to the debtor:

20

want by using this provision.

21
22

MR. HAMILTON:

Neither the

Well, it could have been

You can accomplish what you

The record is silent as to

whether or not that occurred.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

it?

25

as Justice Ginsburg.

What -- where can you move

I don't really -- this is the same line of inquiry
What's the -- what has to be the

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ending date if you move the -- you can't move it any -

2

much beyond the date of what, the hearing?

3

MR. HAMILTON:

It would be up to

4

confirmation, but the confirmation hearing could be

5

continued as the court saw fit.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

The review of the

7

determination or the request to move the period is -- is

8

what?

9

judge?

10
11

Up to the total discretion of the -- of the

MR. HAMILTON:

It appears to be so under the

statute, Chief Justice Roberts.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

So your objection to

13

the fact that the judge has more discretion with respect

14

to defining "projected disposable" -- you don't mind the

15

discretion on the other side.
MR. HAMILTON:

16

No, Your Honor, I don't

17

believe the discretion is not in determining the income,

18

only in determining the time period.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

Right, but the only

20

purpose of moving the time period is to change the

21

income.

22

MR. HAMILTON:

That's true.

And there are

23

other options that the debtor had available in addition

24

to that, that we have referred to as the four options,

25

which would be the debtor could have here just delayed

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

filing the case for a couple of months and these

2

problems would not have occurred.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is another discretion

4

that you don't seem to object to.

You say that one -

5

one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put

6

in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move

7

for a revision of the confirmed plan.

8

MR. HAMILTON:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.
What constrains the judge

10

in allowing or not allowing the revision?

11

have the same kind of discretion with regard to the

12

revision that you're objecting to with regard to his

13

establishing the payments?
MR. HAMILTON:

14

Doesn't he

Justice Scalia, I don't think

15

so.

16

but the argument that we make in our reply brief is that

17

it would be simply necessary to plug in and plug out

18

whatever the change in circumstance is.

19

1329 has been subject to quite a bit of litigation,

So the debtor would be able to say, my

20

wife's income is now gone, so we want to take that out

21

of the formula.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's the same thing

23

that's being argued here, that -- that you start with

24

the fixed calculation based on the 6 months before and

25

then you have to show that there were some extraordinary

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circumstances that justify a change.

2

there's any difference.

3

MR. HAMILTON:

I don't see that

There may not be, except that

4

there is a statutory requirement as to how that is

5

accomplished and that's where the 101(10A)(ii) comes

6

into play.

7

with -

8
9

It's not so much that there is a problem

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What your case comes down

to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do

10

it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the

11

plan initially but by revising it.
MR. HAMILTON:

12
13

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

That certainly is one way.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. HAMILTON:

16

on the facts of the case.

Maybe?
It may be, yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

It depends

Well, that's a good

18

answer, isn't it, because your point would be the

19

statute does not allow that exercise of discretion with

20

respect to projected disposable income, but it does in

21

the other areas.

22
23

MR. HAMILTON:

disagree, Chief Justice Roberts.

24
25

Well, again I respectfully

JUSTICE SCALIA:

1329 -

That was a friendly

question.

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MR. HAMILTON:

I'm sorry?

I'm sorry, I

didn't hear.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, my -- my point

4

and what I thought your point would be is that the fact

5

that there is exercise of discretion in two different

6

areas is not the problem.

7

area the discretion is specifically permitted and in the

8

other area, projected disposable income, it's not.

9

MR. HAMILTON:

10

(Laughter. )

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

The problem is that in one

I agree.

But can the -- can the plan

12

be modified based on -- can the plan be modified based

13

on something that was known before the plan was

14

confirmed?
MR. HAMILTON:

15

That depends on which

16

jurisdiction one would be in, Justice Alito.

17

current example -

18
19

JUSTICE ALITO:

The most

Well, if it can't, then how

is this modification remedy going to work?

20

MR. HAMILTON:

I think it should be.

For

21

example, a good example of this would be debtor is

22

expected 2 years from now to no longer have to repay a

23

401(k) loan.

24

take that into account as of that date and figure those

25

calculations, which becomes extremely unwieldy.

And so one view would be that you ought to

17
Alderson Reporting Company

You are

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

guessing at that point.

2

may be losing that, but I don't know what my actual

3

circumstances are going to be 2 years from now.

4

13 is a fluid process.

5

The debtor may say:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I

Chapter

Your argument is that the

6

Court has to confirm a plan that is really not

7

confirmable because the debtor can't possibly make the

8

payments under the plan, but then can turn around

9

immediately and modify the plan so that it does call for

10

payments to be made.
MR. HAMILTON:

11
12

That is not

my argument.
JUSTICE ALITO:

13
14

No, Your Honor.

Well, I thought that -

explain it, then?
MR. HAMILTON:

15

Well, what we are saying is

16

that this plan cannot be confirmed as it stands because

17

the debtor would have to be able to make those payments

18

and the debtor obviously is not capable of making those

19

payments.

20

If she had chosen the -

21

But it's because she chose the wrong options.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But let me just stop you

22

there, because then the answer you gave to the Chief and

23

to Justice Scalia doesn't fit.

24

the bankruptcy judge is not going to confirm the plan

25

was she has to pay over $1,000 a month, because she

Chief -- you can not -

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could never do that.

2

confirmed plan which could be amended later.

3

So you are not going to get that

MR. HAMILTON:

Well, I agreed with that.

4

may have misunderstood the question that I was asked.

5

But what I'm saying is that the statute needs to be

6

followed and if the debtor had followed the statutes

7

confirmed plan by moving that 6-month time frame.

options.

As I said, she

The second thing that she could have done is
file a Chapter 7, and this is the anomaly between

Chapter 13 and Chapter 7, is that she would have

2

qualified in all likelihood for a discharge under

3

Chapter 7 because she would have met the special

4

circumstances test in 707(b).

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then the creditors

6

would have been a lot worse off, would they not have

been?

MR. HAMILTON:

That's very possible, but

it's a formula that Congress thought to place into
effect and it's not -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why would -- why

12

would the trustee be urging the possibility that it

13

would be okay for her to file under Chapter 7, in which

14

case the unsecured creditors would get very little, but

15

it's not okay for her to use chapter 13 with a plan that

16

would give the unsecured creditors substantial payments?

17

MR. HAMILTON:

Here, Justice Ginsburg, the

18

reason is plain and simple, and that was I sought to

19

enforce the rule of law in order to have the courts

20

determine how the rules were supposed to be interpreted.

21

By my view, it seemed like that had she followed the

rules maybe she would have gotten there, but the way she

did it she can't.

Can I -
And here she didn't turn the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I come back to

5

Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would

6

ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan?

7

Because as you say, the plan here would not have been

8

confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always.

9

mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because

I

10

the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the

11

payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is

12

clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the

13

preceding 6 months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to

14

have that -- that amount of money, there would be the

15

opportunity to adjust.

16

MR. HAMILTON:

Maybe not -- I'm sorry.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In other words, is your

18

response to Justice Ginsburg "always," that it will

19

always be the case that where there would be an

20

adjustment under this theory, there would not have been

21

a confirmation in the first place?

22

MR. HAMILTON:

If the plan is not

23

confirmable by an analysis of Schedules I and J, which

24

are the income and expenses statutes, I am not going to

25

recommend confirmation, and nor do I think any trustee

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would.

Any events that are in the equation before the

2

date of confirmation would likely be then subject to

3

1327, the res judicata provisions of chapter 13.

4

the plan is confirmed, say in Stephanie Lanning's case,

5

with these facts known, then she would not be able to

6

come in afterwards and ask for the court to modify under

7

1329 because that's part of the confirmation order.

So if

8

The other options that were available -- we

9

discussed briefly the ability to file this as a Chapter

10

7.

She also could have converted this case to a Chapter

11

7 post-petition with the same result, or she could have

12

dismissed this case and refiled.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that -- wouldn't

that amount to just a -- a waste of everybody's time, to

dismiss it and then refile it, and then she gets a time

those 2 months that are not representative of her

MR. HAMILTON:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. HAMILTON:

Yes.

That would be the only

10

discretion that the statute would appear to accord to

11

the court.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Where is that, by

13

the way, the provision that allows it to move the

14

6-month period?

15

MR. HAMILTON:

It's in 101(10A) and it

16

provides that the term "current monthly income" means

17

the average monthly income from all sources that the

18

debtor receives, or in a joint case the debtor and the

19

debtor's spouse receive, without regard to whether such

20

income is taxable income derived during the 6-month

21

period ending on -- and then we come to subsections (i),

22

little (i) -- or (ii).

23

disjuncture; it's the 6-month period prior or some other

24

time frame, and the language is important.

25

And those are -- that's the

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you say about cases

23
Alderson Reporting Company

in which moving the 6-month period can't solve the

2

problem?

many years going back, but then slight -- shortly before

the filing of the plan loses his or her job, and there

5

is no prospect that the debtor is going to get another

6

job?

7

for a long period and then right before gets a job.

8

you are not going to be able to cure those problems by

9

moving the 6-month period.

10

For example, if the debtor had good income for

Or it could be the converse, has very low income

MR. HAMILTON:

So

What do you do then?
Well, Justice Alito, I think

11

I would tie in 1323 with respect to the first

12

proposition, and that is if the debtor's circumstances

13

have markedly changed, then the debtor has the ability

14

to file an amended plan; and that amended plan could ask

15

the court to move that time frame forward to a

16

confirmation hearing that would take into account the

17

drop in income.

18

With respect to the second part of your

19

proposition, and that is an increase in income, then I

20

as Chapter 13 trustee would have the ability to object

21

to it on the basis of -- of good faith under either

22

1325(a)(3) or 1325(a)(7), either the plan or the filing

23

of the case itself.

24

1325(a)(3) was the primary way in which all of these

25

disputes were resolved before the 1984 amendments which

And those -- the filing of the

2

concept of disposable income.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you file an

4

amended plan and have the court restart the clock, when

5

101(10A) says only if the debtor has not filed a

6

schedule of current income?

7

confirmed or a plan proposed, then the income schedule

8

had to have been filed.

9

MR. HAMILTON:

15

confirmed, then you are correct; at some point the

16

trustee and the court are going to want to see a

17

Schedule I and J to see what the actual income and

18

expenses are.

19

then the ability to change the plan has to be done under

20

1329, which is -

Those are two different

5

MR. HAMILTON:

The debtor would certainly

6

have the ability to ask the court to be excused from

that requirement given a change in circumstances.

8

again it would be the formula that would be honored,

9

rather than the court substituting judicial discretion.

If there -

Can I ask -- yes, there is

one more question.

13

MR. HAMILTON:

Okay.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I ask whether 1323,

15

which you have now invoked, does not provide the same

16

kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting

17

to?

18

What -- what standards are there for

19

granting or not granting modification of the plan?

20

it pretty much up to the judge?

21

MR. HAMILTON:

No.

Is

I believe again the

22

court is bound, Justice Scalia, by the 101(10A) formula.

23

It's obvious that Congress intended the formula.

24

would not make much sense to read the statute to have

25

some other formula.

26
Alderson Reporting Company

It

it's one way out, or it isn't.

5

Well, then -- then -- okay.

MR. HAMILTON:

Either 1323

Which is it?

I haven't said that it gets

me out of the formula.

It gets me out of the time frame

amendment has to relate to a period -

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Court, I think, has the parties'

4

arguments very well in hand.

I think the -- the one

5

point that I can hopefully address, and it is I think

6

the hardest part of our case, is to address the issue

7

that Justice Alito raised, and that is, is there an

8

anomaly in the fact that in BAPCPA Congress added the

9

6-month period, which would suggest perhaps that

10

Congress was trying to lock in a particular period that

11

we would look at.

12

And the answer to that question is no, and I

13

want to take you to the relevant statutory provisions.

14

Everything is going to be in the cert petition.

15

going to start in the petition appendix at 91, which is

16

1325, which is the operative provision here.

17

1325(b)(1) tells us that if the trustee or a creditor

18

objects, then as of the effective date of the plan it's

19

only going to be confirmed in subsection (b), which is

20

the third full paragraph on page 91 is going to control.

21

I am

And

The plan has to provide that all of the

22

debtor's projected disposable income to be received in

23

the applicable commitment period beginning on the date

24

the first payment is due under the plan will be applied

25

to make payments to unsecured creditors under the plan.

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And the thing to note first about that

2

provision is that it, too, sets a timetable.

It's not

3

just projected disposable income, but it's projected

4

disposable income of a very particular type, to be

5

received in the applicable commitment period.

6

there is something particularly strange about the

7

definition of "disposable income," Congress specified a

8

period that the income is going to be measured in, and

9

that's over the course of the plan; the word "projected"

So unless

10

tells us to get a realistic estimation of what that

11

amount of money's going to be.

12

Now, my friend makes the point that

13

disposable income after BAPCPA is a defined term; the

14

definition comes in the next paragraph; it's subsection

15

(2), 1325(b)(2).

16

term "disposable income" means current monthly income

17

received by the debtor subject to some deductions and

18

then the expenses.

19

definition of "current monthly income."

20

income is in 101; it's at page 83.

21

For purposes of this subsection the

So then we have to go to the
Current monthly

That's where we get the 6-month period.

And

22

it tells us that current monthly income is the average

23

monthly income from all sources, so it's very

24

encompassing, without regard to whether such income is

25

taxable income derived during the 6-month period.

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So, my friend's argument is that, well,

2

Congress said 6 months.

3

couple fold.

4

half-hour, Congress was addressing a very specific

5

problem there.

6

the -- didn't agree on what the baseline was for

7

determining someone's income.

8
9

The answer to that point is a

First, as was suggested in the first

Before BAPCPA courts didn't know what

Some courts would say, all right, you are a
Chapter 13 debtor, right away I'm going to look at the

10

latest month.

Some courts said 6 months.

11

court in our brief that said 4 years.

12

have a starting point to project from.

We have a

So, we have to

But the second point is that this term

13
14

"current monthly income" isn't principally a Chapter 13

15

term at all.

16

stuck this 6-month period into Chapter 13, so it would

17

be very anomalous if we could just -- in effect, he says

18

we are throwing it out, we are giving the district

19

judges discretion.

20

So, my friend's argument is that Congress

It's not quite right.

The place to look is in section 707, which

21

is two pages later.

707 is a Chapter 7 provision.

22

my friend started out by saying the problem with our

23

position is that we were not following the Chapter 7

24

means test.

25

borrowed from Chapter 7.

That's the key.

And

This term is really a -

So 707(b)(2)(A)(i) is at the

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beginning of page 85 of the appendix.

2

And, so, we are in a Chapter 7 case here.

3

And this is the means test.

4

considering under paragraph 1," so we are trying to

5

figure out if there is a presumption of abuse under

6

Chapter 7 -- "whether the granting of relief would be an

7

abuse of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall

8

presume abuse exists if the debtor's current monthly

9

income, reduced by the amounts determined under clauses

It tells us that:

"In

10

2, 3, and 4" -- those are expense clauses -- "and

11

multiplied by 60 is not less than" a certain amount.
So what happened is Congress in BAPCPA

12
13

created this presumption of abuse in Chapter 7 and it

14

then borrowed that concept, as my friend pointed out, in

15

Chapter 13.

16

effect in the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 7.

17

like Congress in Chapter 13 fixed the 6-month period,

18

which would give -- have a sort of a gravitational pull.

19

You wouldn't want to throw that out too lightly.

20

So that 6-month period has real force and
So it's not

Justice Sotomayor, I do agree that we ought

21

to be pretty -- we ought to stick to it.

It indicates

22

Congress is concerned with the 6-month period.

not like Congress added to Chapter 13 this 6-month

24

concept.

25

But it's

It added it to Chapter 7, where it's in full

But

But I do want to point out something very
particular about this language.

Here's the phrase:

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"Current monthly income, reduced by the amounts

2

determined under clauses 2, 3, and 4" -- those are

3

expenses -- "and multiplied by 60."

4

friend says the phrase "projected disposable income to

5

be received over the applicable commitment period" is.

That's what my

Our point is that if Congress intended that

6
7

mechanical formulation, it would have used the exact

8

words that I have just read from you in Chapter 7,

9

because that's mechanical.

24

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

4

A couple OF points about that.

debtor ratchet, right.

The creditor and the trustee, if

As you

expect to get a promotion.

21

that's pretty likely, until you have actually got it we

point about, you know, making it hard.

When it's known or virtually certain, we

10

Let me make one other point.

I wanted to

11

finish off my answer to the Chief Justice about 101.

12

This provision has taken on greater significance in the

13

oral argument and the reply brief of the Petitioner.

14

did want to point out to the Court a provision that is

15

not reproduced in the parties' briefs, but if the Court

16

were to go this route it would want to be aware of, and

17

that's 521(i).

I

And 521(i) tells us that you do have to file

18
19

the forms at the beginning or you have to file them

20

within 45 days, but upon request of the debtor made

21

within 45 days after the date of filing the petition,

22

the court may allow the debtor an additional period of

23

not to exceed 45 days.

24

power of the bankruptcy court to shift this period all

25

around.

So it does seem to constrain the

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So, I have made two points.

One is it's a

2

one-way ratchet for the debtor; second, it's not

3

unlimited.

4

The third is it just doesn't make any sense.

5

Why would Congress design a system that would have all

6

of these machinations.

7

wants -- it seems my friend and I agree that Congress

8

believes that she shouldn't have to make the payments

9

that would be required under the trustee's reading of

If we agree that Congress

"projected disposable income."

11

12

required by the text; I'm sorry, Congress took this

13

option away.

The question is how we

The trustee's answer is that you are

And I think that, as I have explained, the

14
15

term "projected disposable income to be received in the

16

applicable commitment period" really is not language

17

that you would ordinarily construe to ignore changes

18

that -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think -- I

20

think that's exactly right when you look at term

21

"projected disposable income."

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

Yes.

"disposable income" -
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

37
Alderson Reporting Company

But if you look as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- as a defined term

2

and then add "projected," I think it's a different -

3

different -- different argument, different kettle of

4

fish.

5

intended to restrict discretion, it's a way to do it.

6

You look at it in the abstract, "projected disposable

7

income," it doesn't achieve that objective.

I mean, because particularly in a statute

8
9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And that is exactly,

Mr. Chief Justice, why I started with the definition of

10

"current monthly income in the 6-month period."

11

that it is an important point.

12

argument.

I agree

It is their strongest

My only point is that I have explained, I

13
14

think, why Congress put the 6-month period in for

15

purposes of Chapter 7 and also to have the starting

16

point.

17

If we were to define inflation as the amount in the rise

18

in prices over the previous 6 months, if Congress did

19

that in a statute and then told us to look at projected

20

inflation, we would still not ignore things that will

21

tell us that there are going to be -- there has been an

22

oil price spike or an increase in health care costs.

23

would take a pretty firm, firm period that told us to

24

only look into the past and not look into the future,

25

particularly when the whole point of the statute is to

If I -- to give you an example, take inflation.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

make sure that the money goes into the creditor's hands

2

that the debtor is able to pay.

3

On the point of discretion, I should also

4

say BAPCPA as a whole was intended to reduce discretion.

5

And, so, it's kind of odd to say that the answer to our

6

position is to turn to all of these other discretionary

7

provisions -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if you -- you

wanted to achieve your friend's result and you had a

10

definition of disposable income, and you wanted the

11

court to -- you don't want to say project that forward,

12

what -- what word would be more natural than saying

13

projected?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

14

I -- I -- I would use the

15

language that Congress did in 707.

Remember, the

16

current monthly income reduced by the amounts determined

17

under clauses 2, 3, and 4 and multiplied by 60.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, that's altering

19

disposable income -- the definition of disposable

20

income.

21

achieve your friend's result to use projected.

22

other word would you say when you say this is the period

23

you look at and you want to take it forward?

25

I'm asking isn't the most natural word to

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH HARRINGTON

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

14
15
16

MS. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In bankruptcy, as in many areas of the law,

17

Congress has tried to balance on the one hand, doing

18

case-specific justice, and on the other hand, ensuring

19

that the statutory scheme is administrable.

20

Congress certainly could have chosen to elevate

21

simplicity over accuracy by telling bankruptcy courts to

22

take a debtor's current disposable income and multiply

23

that number by the number of months in the plan in

24

assessing whether the plan is confirmable.

25

are several strong signals in the code that that is

actually not what Congress intended courts to do.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you think bankruptcy

3

courts are supposed to be economic forecasters?

4

example, if you -- after calculating the debtor's income

5

during the 6-month period, the 6-month lookback period,

6

should the bankruptcy court said, well -- say:

7

it's -- inflation is projected to be such-and-such over

8

the term of this plan, so I am just going to increase it

9

by the amount of inflation; or:

For

Well,

This person works in a

10

particular industry where historically, over the last

11

five years or ten years, there's been a 3 percent

12

increase in salary per year, so I'm going to multiply it

13

by -- multiply the disposable income figure like that?

14
15
16

MS. HARRINGTON:
Justice Alito.

Certainly not,

Bankruptcy -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why not?

You say that

17

the bankruptcy courts should take into account things

that are likely to occur in the future.

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, bankruptcy courts -

20

we are not saying that bankruptcy courts should ever

21

speculate about what might happen in the future.

22

we are saying is that bankruptcy courts should take into

23

account what they know, in this case, already has

24

happened, but also what they know will happen.

25

to give an example of a change that would benefit

41
Alderson Reporting Company

What

And so

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

creditors, if as -- as I mentioned earlier, if a debtor

2

has secured a higher-paying job just before or just

3

after she filed her petition, a Court should be able to

4

take into account the fact that her income going forward

5

would be greater than would be reflected in the

6

calculation of her current disposable income.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, "know will happen" is

8

quite different from "likely to happen," and I thought

9

your test was likely to happen.

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

11

based on what you know now.

12

suggested a particular burden of proof.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

what you know.

15

know it will happen.

16

Well, likely to happen
I think -- we haven't
I think -

Not -- not likely, based on

Well, that's quite different from you

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

So there is an

17

example mentioned earlier:

18

loan to her 401(k) program, that is the type of loan

19

that can't be extended time-wise.

20

making those payments, which will be deducted as an

21

expense in the calculation of her current disposable

22

income, but -- but you know at a certain point, she is

23

likely to stop making those payments.

24
25

If the debtor is repaying a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so she will keep

Is there a difference

between your test and the Respondent's test?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. HARRINGTON:

2

heard Mr. Goldstein say at the argument.

3

not mean to suggest that a court should use -

4

Not according to what I

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Again, we do

His words were "known to

5

a virtual certainty," which are -- likely to happen is

6

different than likely to happen.

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think, in part, it

8

depends on what type of change you are talking about.

9

Again, we would never say that a court should speculate

10

about what should happen.

11

another example on the expense side, if a debtor when

12

she proposes her plan owns a second home, a vacation

13

home that is secured by a mortgage, then that secured

14

debt payment is an expense that would be deducted from

15

her income in the calculation of her current disposable

16

income.

17

as a condition of her plan, she will no longer have that

18

debt payment going forward.

19

of -- so it will no longer be an expense going forward.

20

Under Petitioner's view, a court would not be able to

21

take into account the fact that that current expense -

22

But, for instance, to take

But if she proposes to surrender that property

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so that's the type

That's -- that's "know will

That is "know will happen."

25

shall not speculate, and then say that the test is

"likely to happen."

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, again, in this -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, to -- you know, to

4

look forward and say:

5

That's speculation.

6

speculation, to tell you the truth.

7

Is it likely or not likely?
I don't know a better definition of

MS. HARRINGTON:

Okay.

But then, we

8

wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of

9

"likely."

And again, in this case the change had

10

already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what

11

her situation is now and what we can project it to be

12

going forward.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

It seems to me that,

14

particularly since you are adopting a fairly broad -

15

well, depending on how broad a theory you are adopting

16

of what's projected and what's not, that you are taking

17

into account a lot of things that are more properly

18

taken into account when it comes to whether the plan

19

should be confirmed or not.

Well, except that if the

creditor or a trustee objects, then the calculation of

3

projected disposable income is one of the conditions of

4

confirmability of the plan.

5

unless it can -

The court can't confirm it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Well, is that -- I

7

mean, let's say your friend wins up to the point and

8

somebody else, when it gets to confirmation, can say:

9

Well, look, you know, there was this big payout before

10

the filing.

So don't confirm it.

We know she has got

11

all this -- all this other money.

That -- it could do

it that way, couldn't it?

Is that what you're

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, whatever the

17

situation is, can't that be taken into account when it

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, it could affect the

20

-- well, one thing that is important to note that hasn't

21

been brought up is under Section 1325(a)(6), the court

22

is actually -- which is the feasibility provision -- the

23

Court is actually required to think about what is going

24

to happen in the future, whether a debtor is going to be

25

able to repay her creditors.

And so it doesn't make

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

very much sense to, on the one hand, require a court to

2

consider what it knows will happen in the future in

3

determining feasibility, and then on the other hand, if

4

there's an objection by the creditor or the trustee and

5

1325(b) comes into play, to prohibit a court from

6

considering the same facts it knows about what is going

7

to happen in the future -

JUSTICE ALITO:

MS. HARRINGTON:

of what the debtor's disposable income will be going

6

forward.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And again, in

How do you deal with the

8

Petitioner's -- the two arguments Petitioner makes?

9

is that on the expense side, Congress provided for

One

10

special circumstances, exceptions, and it didn't on the

11

income side?
MS. HARRINGTON:

12

Well, the special

13

circumstances exception comes in, in the calculation of

14

the debtor's current disposable income, but it doesn't

15

tell you what to do in terms of projecting that

16

disposable income.

17

the current disposable income is based on an expense

18

that isn't accounted for in the standard expenses or an

19

expense that is accounted for, but is higher than is

20

accounted for in those expenses.

21

tell you what to do -- how to project that number going

22

forward.

23

And so you can adjust what you think

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But again, it doesn't

What about the argument

24

that this is a simple thing; she didn't have to file the

25

plan -- she didn't have to file the petition at a time

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

when those two months would be in the 6-month lookback.

2

She could have waited.

3

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, that is certainly

4

true of this debtor, of the Respondent in this case.

5

That is not an option available to all debtors, many of

6

whom are facing foreclosure proceedings or imminent

7

foreclosure proceedings.

Delay is simply not an option.

8

And if I could address Section

9

101(10A)(A)(ii) option that the Petitioner offers -- I

10

mean, one thing to note is it doesn't give the Court the

11

discretion to set any other -- to just pick any other

12

6-month lookback period.

13

months back from whatever that date is.

14

occurs very soon before the filing of the petition, it

15

makes it very hard for a court to use that provision to

16

change the lookback period because you would have to

17

wait 6 months, essentially, after the filing of the

18

petition to set it back.

19

They pick a date and go 6
So if a change

But again, the biggest problem with using

20

that section as a workaround is that that is an option

21

that is available to debtors, but not to creditors.

22

a debtor files a Chapter 13 petition along with all the

23

Schedules that are required under Section 521 of the

24

code, then the debtor has no option for -- excuse me,

25

the creditor has no option and the trustee has no

48
Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

option -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the creditor

3

has the option of objecting the confirmation of the

4

plan.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

They can object to

6

confirmation of the plan, but on what -- what basis?

If

7

the Petitioner argues that the calculation of projected

8

disposable income is merely a mechanical multiplication

9

of the current disposable income times 60 or 36, then

10

they have no way of allowing the court to take account

11

of a change that has happened just before or after the

12

time of the petition that would inure to the creditor's

13

benefit.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They can't say:

15

object because the 6-month period is unrepresentative

16

because of this particular event?

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

They could say that, but

18

it's not clear in the code that that is a basis for

19

refusing to confirm a plan.

20

make the argument that -

21
22
23

I

I think they would have to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does the government

have a position on that?
MS. HARRINGTON:

I think unless there were

24

bad faith it's not clear how that can be a basis for not

25

confirming a plan, and that was the -- the reason that

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

my friend on Petitioner's counsel suggested.

2

it's not clear how that would be bad faith, if a debtor

3

proposes a plan that -- that commits all of her

4

projected disposable income under the trustee's view of

5

what that number is, it's hard to see how you could say

6

that that was a plan that was proposed in bad faith.

7

But again,

So again, I just want to -- just to respond

8

to the -- the argument that the government in

9

Respondent's view reads the 6-month period totally out

10

of the code -

11
12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can finish the

sentence.

13

Okay.

14

a -- a debtor's current disposable income will often be

15

a reliable predictor of her future disposable income and

when that's the case, then a reliable way of projecting

is simply be multiplying.
