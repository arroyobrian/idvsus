ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONNAL M. LACH


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10
11

MS. LACH:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

The question today -- presented today turns on


12

whether Congress intended to include local governments


13

within the meaning of the False Claims Act's undefined


14

term, person, which this Court determined in Stevens has


15

remained unchanged since the original enactment in 1863. 


16

The indications are that Congress did not subject local


17

governments to liability under the 1863 act,


18

As this Court observed in Stevens and in Hubbard


19

versus United States, the 1863 act was enacted as a


20

criminal statute.

21

imprisonment in addition to civil damages and forfeitures. 


22

As this Court noted in Marcus v. Hess, any language that


23

the civil portion shares in common with the criminal


24

portion must be given careful scrutiny lest those not


25

intended are brought within the act's reach.


It imposed criminal fines or


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The word, persons, subject to liability, is


2

shared by both the civil and the criminal provisions of


3

the 1863 act, thus, a person that could be held liable


4

civilly must, under the 1863 act, necessarily be capable


5

of being subject to the criminal provision as well.

6

Court, in City of Newport, noted that municipal


7

corporations were not considered capable of doing a


8

criminal act or a malicious or willful wrong -- excuse me.

The -- the criminal nature of the statute in


9
10

itself is a strong indication that Congress did not


11

include local governments within the purview of the


12

statute.


13

QUESTION:

Ms. Lach, on that point, am I correct


14

in thinking that the Sherman Act does apply to


15

municipalities?


16

This


MS. LACH:

This Court determined that the -- the


17

antitrust statutes, under the antitrust statutes the term,


18

person, does include municipalities, local governments.


19

QUESTION:

And isn't it true that in the


20

original Sherman Act, imprisonment was authorized for


21

every person who violates the act?


22

MS. LACH:

That is true, but we are unaware of


23

any case in which a local government has been prosecuted


24

as a criminal.


25

QUESTION:

But the interpretation of the law on


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the civil side --


2

MS. LACH:

Yes.


3

QUESTION:

-- was not nullified because there


4

was a provision that said, every person is subject to


5

imprisonment.

MS. LACH:

6

That is correct, Your Honor, and this


7

Court in the City of Lafayette and City of Boulder, in


8

analyzing the term, person, and determining that


9

municipalities were included within that term, were also


10

faced with the treble damages of the -- of the Clayton


11

Act, and subsequent to those two decisions, Congress


12

enacted the Local Government Antitrust Act of 1984, in


13

which Congress specifically took local governments out of


14

the range of the treble damages, and now local governments


15

are subject to injunctive or declaratory relief.

QUESTION:

16

My -- my simple point is that by


17

putting a clearly penal provision in the statute, that did


18

not make municipalities out of the act, and I thought


19

that's what you were arguing, that the 1863 act is penal


20

in part --


21

MS. LACH:

Yes.


22

QUESTION:

-- and therefore, it could not have


23

in -- covered municipalities.


24

MS. LACH:

25

Yes, that is -- that is what we're


arguing.

1

3

QUESTION:

But that's not true of the Sherman


MS. LACH:

It does not appear to be true of the


Act.


4

Sherman Act, but again, we are not aware of any case in


5

which a local government was prosecuted under that act.


6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

Any more than this is a case of


prosecution.

MS. LACH:

Any more -- that's true, but now,


ever since 1878, the False Claims Act has been bifurcated. 


10

The criminal provisions are separately codified from the


11

civil provisions.


12

Also, as this Court noted in Stevens in 1863,


13

the False Claims Act was enacted to combat fraud during


14

the Civil War by private contractors, and there is no


15

indication that in 1863 the Federal Government was buying


16

anything from local governments, or that there were any


17

Federal contracts with local governments, and without a


18

practice of Federal funding to local governments, Congress


19

would have no reason to envision a local government


20

submitting a false claim for payment, nor were local


21

governments firmly established as persons in 19 -- excuse


22

me, in 1863.


23

QUESTION:

Well, Ms. Lach, you don't dispute


24

that the word persons extends to some corporations under


25

the act, do you?


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. LACH:

Not at all.

Not at all, and in fact,


2

in -- in 1863, the term, person, presumptively included


3

private corporations, and there is language in the 1863


4

act, and given the context of the act, it is reasonable to


5

assume that private corporations were included in the


6

provisions.

QUESTION:

7

Well, but there -- there are also


8

cases from about that time that say that a -- a


9

municipality is included in the -- in the term,


10

corporation, at any rate.

MS. LACH:

11

The -- the cases at that time were --


12

came from State courts, and the State courts were not


13

consistent throughout -- throughout the Nation as to when


14

local governments could be held liable.

15

held they could be held liable in contract, others in


16

tort, and even when held liable in tort, there was


17

sometimes the distinction between proprietary and


18

governmental function.


19
20
21

Some State courts


QUESTION:

Well, what about Louisville and


MS. LACH:

Louisville and Letson, though, only


Letson?


22

applied to private corporations, and private corporations


23

were established by that 1844 case, but in -- this Court


24

did not extend that principle until the 1869 decision in


25

Cowles, and that was the first time --


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Didn't -- didn't we recognize it in


2

the Amity case in 1826?

3

in including municipal corporations as -- as persons.


4

MS. LACH:

We -- we quoted Sir Edward Cook


Yes, but still, in terms -- this


5

Court, in the Cowles decision in 1869, believed that it


6

still was not a settled issue and -- and settled the issue


7

once and for all.

8

not -- the issue that was before the Court that needed to


9

be decided, whether local governments were persons unlike


10
11

In the Amity case, it was not -- it was


in the Cowles case --

QUESTION:

Oh, we -- we thought otherwise in --


12

in Monell, certainly.

13

it, the Letson principle in 1869 was automatically and


14

without discussion extended to municipal corporations.


15

MS. LACH:

We said in Monell, and I'm quoting


Yes, but by saying that, this Court


16

in Monell dated the presumption as firmly established as


17

of the 1869 Cowles decision, rather --


18
19

QUESTION:

So you think there was a -- a major


change between, when, 1863 and 1869?


20

MS. LACH:

I think that --


21

QUESTION:

In that 6-year period, there was


22

suddenly, whap, it applied to municipal corporations,


23

before that it didn't?

24
25

MS. LACH:

It seems to me most implausible.


Well, it doesn't -- it wasn't an


automatic or a dramatic change, but nonetheless, there was


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a progression.

There was -- there was a transition in law


2

within the States.


3

QUESTION:

In 6 years?


4

MS. LACH:

Those 6 years, of all 6 years in this


5

country's history, of course, were the most significant,


6

but -- but in terms of dating a presumption that one can


7

firmly rely on, there is no firm date, other than 1869, in


8

which acts of Congress were determined to include person


9

as a -- include municipality within the word, person.

QUESTION:

10
11

Ms. Lach, the decision, the opinion


in Cowles was very brief, right?


12

MS. LACH:

Yes, it was.


13

QUESTION:

And it was sort of like, well, of


14

course.

15

been just taken for granted, don't you suppose the Court


16

would have engaged in a little more reasoning?


17

If this was establishing something that hadn't


MS. LACH:

Perhaps, but nonetheless the Court


18

did decide the issue, and made -- made it clear that for


19

once -- once and for all, this issue was being decided,


20

and it was at that point that no ambiguity was left.


21

The first case that ever -- that -- in which a


22

local government was ever brought before this Court was in


23

1861, in the Aspinwall case, and there the issue did not


24

arise, and subsequent to the 1863 act, yes, there were


25

other cases in which local governments were brought before


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court, but the issue never arose.

2

1869 that we can firmly date when, in -- in Federal --


3

in -- in congressional enactments, we can presume that the


4

word person included local governments.


5

It wasn't until


And this Court in Monell observed that it took


6

years of judicial conflict before corporations of all


7

sorts, including municipal corporations, were established


8

as persons that could sue and be sued in Federal court.


9

QUESTION:

Ms. Lach --


10

QUESTION:

Well, if we think that it -- that the


11

word, person, includes municipal corporations, as, indeed,


12

I think I do, based on Cowles and Monell, then what


13

changed it in your view?

14

different view?

15

punitive damages, the treble damages provision?


16
17

Why would we now have a


Just because of the change in the


MS. LACH:

If this Court determines that the


word, person, in 1863 did, in fact --


18

QUESTION:

Yes.


19

MS. LACH:

-- include local government, that --


20

QUESTION:

Yes, on that assumption, then what


21
22

would change that?

MS. LACH:

The -- the -- what would change it is


23

Congress' imposition of treble damages, which this


24

Court has noted --


25

QUESTION:

But without an accompanying change in


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the definition of person, right?

MS. LACH:

Exactly.

Exactly, and the 1986


3

amendments were just that.

4

was not changed in 1986 remained the same.

5

when Congress provided for treble damages, which this


6

Court has determined to be punitive, Congress knew what


7

this Court said in City of Newport.

8

a presumption that local governments are immune from the


9

imposition of punitive damages unless Congress


10
11

They were amendments.

What


Nonetheless,


This Court reiterated


specifically indicates otherwise.

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me you would have a


12

better argument if you simply said, the 1983 change does


13

not impose punitive damages on local corporations, than to


14

say it suddenly proscribes an entire escape hatch from any


15

sort of liability at all.


16

MS. LACH:

Well, under the 1863 act, there were


17

only double damages, which this Court concluded were


18

remedial, and they were not punitive, but there was a big


19

step made in 18 -- 1986, when Congress changed the remedy


20

to mandatory treble damages and, in addition to that,


21

increased the statutory fines.


22

QUESTION:

But it didn't make it clear at that


23

time that the change made them punitive.

24

the Stevens opinion that we decided they were punitive.


25

MS. LACH:

It was only in


But there were indications prior to


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that that -- that -- from which Congress understood that


2

the damages were punitive.

3

Industries, a case that was cited in Stevens, stated that


4

treble damages are meant to punish, and also in 1981, in


5

City of Newport, this Court cited an 1877 a Missouri


6

supreme court case that held that a municipality was not


7

subject to treble damages under a trespass statute,


8

notwithstanding that statute's general authorization for


9

such damages against any person, and the reason was,


10

In 1981, this Court, in Texas


treble damages were exemplary, and --

QUESTION:

11

Ms. Lach, didn't the Court also,


12

I think in the context of the Clayton Act, characterize


13

treble damages as, quote, remedial?

MS. LACH:

14

The Court -- the Court noted both. 


15

The Court said in -- in aspect, they are remedial, but


16

then, also they did have an intent to punish as well, but


17

as I stated, the -- the Clayton Act no longer applies to


18

local governments because Congress took affirmative


19

steps --


20

QUESTION:

Nonetheless, it used the word,


21

remedial to characterize treble damages, and one of the


22

difficulties that your -- your argument that you're now


23

making encounters is that this change in 1986, wasn't it a


24

dramatic expansion of qui tam liability?


25

MS. LACH:

It was a dramatic expansion, but as


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

this Court --

QUESTION:

And then -- then you think that at


3

the same time that Congress expanded it, it also cut back,


4

without any indication at all?


5

MS. LACH:

Well, we believe that Congress did


6

not cut back, that -- that local governments were never


7

subject to the act, but with this dramatic expansion,


8

there was also the dramatic increase in damages, and this


9

Court has made it clear that local governments have an


10

affirmative defense when punitive damages are at stake,


11

and in order to abrogate that immunity from punitive


12

damages, Congress has got to really say that it intends to


13

impose those punitive damages, treble damages in this


14

case, treble damages plus statutory fines in this case on


15

local governments, and there's no indication anywhere on


16

the face of the 1986 amendments that Congress intended to


17

impose such damages on local governments.


18

Local governments are mentioned twice in the


19

1986 amendments.

In one provision, it's the


20

jurisdictional provision, 3732(b), which allows local


21

governments and States to bring State court claims in


22

Federal court when -- when the transaction arises from the


23

same transaction as a False Claims Act action.

24

indicates that Congress was interested in -- in preventing


25

frauds against local governments, not in -- in imposing


That


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

punitive damages on local governments, and the other


2

provision is the CID provision which, as this Court noted


3

in Stevens, has a -- has a definition.

4

includes States and political subdivisions of States, but


5

that is for the purpose of investigation --


6

QUESTION:

That definition


I'm -- I'm sorry, I didn't fully


7

grasp the point you were just making.

Were you suggesting


8

that Congress was worried about fraud against


9

municipalities, but it didn't think that fraud would be


10

engaged in by municipal units?

11

from New York, and I remember Tammany Hall.

12

it was altogether so different in Cook County, was it?


13

(Laughter.)


14

MS. LACH:

I mean, I remember -- I'm

I don't think


But the -- but the point is that


15

where local governments are mentioned in the -- in the


16

False Claims Act in the 1986 amendment, there is no


17

indication that Congress was mentioning them because


18

Congress was intending to abrogate the immunity from


19

punitive damages.


20
21
22

QUESTION:

May I ask whether you think that Cook


County could bring a qui tam action?

MS. LACH:

Well, that's less clear under the


23

False Claims Act.

This Court -- I -- I know that Your


24

Honor, in the dissenting opinion, suggested that the term,


25

person, is different in 30 -- 3730(b) from 3730(a).

It's


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

less clear, I think, perhaps, but that was an issue that


2

this Court expressly declined to address in Stevens


3

because there was no need to discuss it or to decide it at


4

that point.


5

QUESTION:

6

decide it here.

7

position on it.


8
9
10

And there's no -- there's no need to


I -- I was just curious if you did have a


MS. LACH:

I think perhaps local governments


could bring qui tam actions, but -- but it is not clear.

There are also the -- the policy considerations


11

with respect to the imposition of punitive damages on


12

local governments.

13

Federal funds for the benefit of their residents and, as


14

this Court noted in Stevens, in City of Newport, the Court


15

was concerned with the imposition of punitive damages on


16

local taxpayers under any circumstances, and here we have


17

a statute that imposes three times the amount of damages


18

and imposes statutory fines, which get very hefty.


Local governments apply for and use


19

Punitive damages against a local government have


20

got to come from someplace, and there are only two places,


21

reduction in services, or an increase in taxes, and the


22

victims of punitive damages are not the wrongdoers. 


23

They're -- they're the innocent, and some of those


24

innocents are not even taxpayers or voters, such as


25

schoolchildren or homeless medically indigent.


15

1

The United States significantly -- significantly


2

has other means to stop fraud by local governments, and to


3

deter local governments from committing fraud.

4

States has common law causes of action to be made whole,


5

and the most effective deterrent is the threat of


6

debarment from participation in Federal funding.


The United


With no indication that Congress ever intended


7
8

to include local governments in the -- in the 1863 act,


9

and with the Dictionary Act not being enacted until 1871,


10

where Congress for the first time created a statutory


11

presumption that the word, person, includes bodies politic


12

and corporate, this case is in a very different posture


13

from the Monell case.

In Monell, this Court did not just look at the


14
15

word, person.

16

environment in which section 1983 was enacted, it looked


17

at the legislative history, and it also looked at the


18

Dictionary Act, which was enacted just 2 months prior with


19

the same -- by the same Congress that enacted section


20

1983.


21

This Court looked at the historical


A review of the circumstances around the 1863


22

enactment, together with the text and the historical


23

context, leads the other way.

24

presumption.

25

but does that lead -- does that add up to a presumption? 


There was no concrete


There were -- there were indications, yes,


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

There's no concrete presumption until this Court said so


2

in Cowles in 1869, and then we have Congress in 1871. 


3

There were changes.

4

at that point in time.

If there are no further questions, I'll reserve

There were articulations at that --


the remainder of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDSON H. MINER


11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. MINER:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the


Court:

I really can't contribute much more to the


14
15

discussion of what Congress meant by a person in


16

section -- in 1863, other than to point out, as we did in


17

our brief, that in fact, the law in the States prior to


18

Letson -- and -- and indeed, Letson is the origin of


19

the -- of the doctrine, because in Letson, what the Court


20

actually said was, a corporation is a natural person for


21

purposes of the suit where it's incorporated or where it


22

does business, and the Court then goes on and says, and


23

that doctrine also applies to all corporations and body


24

politic.

citizenship of the individual shareholders to decide


2

whether or not there was diversity jurisdiction?

MR. MINER:

3

The -- that's right.

They -- they


4

defined corporations by the -- by the members, and -- and


5

they could have jurisdictions all over.

6

cleared up, and -- and the law was absolutely clear in all


7

of the States as we -- that we could find.

8

dissenting opinions that -- that held, that didn't hold


9

that a local government, whether it was a corporation,


10

whether it was a quasi corporation, a city, a county,


11

wasn't held responsible for any obligations it had,


12

whether by contract, whether by charter, whether --


13

whether by statute, wherever they came from, and they were


14

also responsible for all their wrongful torts.


That then gets


We found no


So that then brings us to really what was


15
16

Ms. Lach's starting point, this whole question of the


17

implications of the criminal provisions and, in fact, not


18

only the Sherman Act, but the Elkins Act also includes


19

criminal provisions, and this Court has recognized that


20

person, in that act, includes municipal corporations, but


21

the -- the question of what is the significance of


22

including criminal penalties in 1863 has to be answered in


23

the context of what was -- what was the -- the view in


24

1863.


25

Unfortunately, this argument really doesn't


18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

surface until the reply, and so we haven't had a chance


2

really to brief it, but the simple reality is, in -- in


3

the period of 18 -- in the era of 1863, indeed in the 19th


4

Century, local governments were treated just like private


5

corporations, and they were, indeed, subject to


6

indictment, and they were subject to criminal punishment


7

on the same terms as local governments, and they were


8

often found liable for acts that involved both fraud and


9

deceit.


10

Since -- since this was -- now, I'd like to read


11

to the Court from Dillon, who is cited repeatedly as -- as


12

one of the -- the scholars of the era, although we -- we


13

have not cited this passage because the issue hadn't come


14

up before, but in his treatise on the law of municipal


15

corporations he states, English law, and in this


16

country -- in the English law and in this country, quote,


17

all corporations, municipal as well as private, which owe


18

duties to the public are liable to indictment for


19

malfeasance as well as nonfeasance in respect to their


20

duties.

21

responsible for palpable omissions, they're responsible


22

for willful and corrupt acts, and in a -- a leading case


23

at the turn of the century called Ludlow versus


24

Commonwealth, 56 S.W. 2d 958, the State supreme court made


25

clear that the purpose of holding cities liable criminally


And, in fact, he goes on to explain that they're


19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

was, indeed, to punish them and to deter future acts.

That really was the law and, in fact, in a


3

leading case from our own State, the Illinois supreme


4

court, in upholding a criminal conviction against the City


5

of Chicago for employing women for more than 10 hours,


6

states in the case of People versus City of Chicago,


7

100 N.E. 194, the municipality is held to the same degree


8

of responsibility as an individual.


9

In securing performance of specific duties


10

imposed upon municipal corporations, the State has the


11

same power of coercion and the same method of redress in


12

the case of individuals or purely private corporations. 


13

That was the law in that era.

14

False Claims Act was passed and, in a battery of cases


15

which I can bring to this Court's attention, a case called


16

Howard versus Crawford County, 12 F cases 637, Chaplain


17

versus The Corporations of the City of New York, 3 Paige,


18

P-a-i-g-e, Chapter 573, or the Town of Plymouth versus the


19

Town of Windsor, 7 Vermont 325, all cases that predate the


20

1863 False Claims Act, local governments were sued in


21

lawsuits for fraudulent and deceitful conduct usually


22

involving bond issues, or trying to avoid bond


23

obligations, often in terms of their responsibilities to


24

take care of their indigent citizens, and they would then


25

engage in schemes to get their indigents into another


That was the law when the

jurisdiction so the other jurisdiction would have to pay


2

for the wrong, sometimes they in fact had paid, gotten


3

paid, but they --

QUESTION:

4

Well, the fact that local governments


5

were sued in these cases under some sort of common law


6

theory, I take it, does not necessarily answer the


7

question of whether statutory language using the word,


8

person includes them.

MR. MINER:

9

Oh, I'm simply using these as


10

examples.

I understand it's part of the argument that was


11

made in the reply briefs by my opponent that local


12

government simply cannot have the mental state of showing


13

either fraud or intent to deceive, and -- and my point is


14

simply, it was not uncommon in those days for local


15

governments to be perceived as doing fraudulent or


16

deceitful acts.

QUESTION:

17

Well, I'm sure that's true, but


18

why -- why do you -- why is it that, in your opinion,


19

nobody apparently with -- just, perhaps no exceptions, or


20

one or two, has ever sued a local government before under


21

this act?

MR. MINER:

22
23

were brought, and we brought --

QUESTION:

Oh, I think -- there were suits that


none.

1

MR. MINER:

I think the answer is two-fold. 


2

Number 1, as this Court recognized in Hess, it's really


3

not until the 1940s that money starts --

QUESTION:

4

Since 1986, that's already 16 years,


5

and there are billions and billions of dollars worth of


6

Federal programs that go to cities, and --


7

MR. MINER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well --

I imagine somewhere in those billions


there are a few false statements being made by people.


10

(Laughter.)


11

MR. MINER:

But I think the answer is that the


12

money doesn't start coming in until 19 -- until the 1940s


13

and thereafter, and in -- in 1943, after this Court's


14

decision in Hess, the False Claims Act gets emasculated,


15

in the sense that it becomes very difficult to bring false


16

claims, particularly qui tam cases.

17

substantially reduced, and there is dramatic fall-off in


18

false claims litigation, and that's the whole purpose of


19

the 1986 amendments, to generate new life into it --

QUESTION:

20
21

Why since 1986 have we seen virtually


no suits brought against municipalities?


22

MR. MINER:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MINER:

25

The damages are


Since 1986?

Oh, there are --


There are lots?

Oh, there are lots of suits since


1986.

QUESTION:

Against 19 -- against municipalities?


2

MR. MINER:

3

QUESTION:

Oh, sure.

See, what I'm worried about in the


4

back of my mind is, if the -- assuming that the history in


5

the 1860s is fairly inconclusive, which is the impression


6

the briefs have left me with, you can make a good argument


7

one way or the other, then I'd be worried about suddenly


8

unleashing potentially billions of dollars of liability as


9

lawyers comb through the vast number of Federal programs


10

that give aid to cities, looking for someone, somewhere,


11

who has made a false statement, and I'm sure there are


12

quite a few, at -- at which point the cities would


13

suddenly discover vast liability for treble damages that


14

their -- their citizens can't avoid.

15

share in a city, and -- and so that's the kind of thing


16

that worries me practically, and I wish you'd talk about


17

it a little.


18

MR. MINER:

You can't sell a


Well, I think there -- there are a


19

couple of answers.

20

Congress' decision that -- that it was important to


21

protect --


22

QUESTION:

Number 1, I think that's -- that was


I grant you, if the history of this


23

is clear, you win.

Just in case, though, I'm left


24

absolutely uncertain about what the right result is on the


25

basis of what happened in 1863, I want to, just in case


23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's relevant, to have in my mind what's likely to occur


2

in the year 2003.


3

MR. MINER:

Oh, I -- I think what is going to --


4

first of all, let's understand that these cases are not


5

now brought on the basis of negligent statements, or


6

slight misrepresentations, but these cases involve -- this


7

is a statute unlike section 1983 or the Sherman Act, that


8

really does not involve itself in imposing any new


9

obligations, any new or unanticipated responsibilities on


10
11

local governments.

It merely says, when you entered into a contract


12

with us, we're going to hold you to the deal that you


13

made, and if you breach that deal in material ways, we're


14

going to try to get our money back, so there is -- there


15

are protections in the sense that it's not any statement


16

that gets litigated here.

17

essential misrepresentation about how that money was used


18

that is at the core of these lawsuits, so that --


19

QUESTION:

It's got to be a serious,


All right.

I mean, if that's the


20

only answer, though, I -- I begin to think -- I don't know


21

how much money is involved, but I was trying to make a


22

guess and say, leaving out social security, food stamps


23

and that kind of thing, which are individuals, my guess is


24

there -- probably it's in the range of hundreds of


25

billions of dollars that go to cities, leaving those


24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

things out, and you have a few bad actors in every program


2

that maybe purposely make a lie in a statement --


3

MR. MINER:

4

QUESTION:

Well, I think --

-- to help preserve their job, I


5

don't know why they do it, and -- and there we have


6

suddenly a huge liability imposed on citizens.


7
8
9

Now, I'm overstating this perhaps, but I want

you to tell me what the true dimension of that problem is.

MR. MINER:

Well, I don't think that -- first,


10

as part of that answer, Congress has made a decision by


11

the -- by increasing damages from double to treble, there


12

will be a deterrent effect, and that one response of this


13

is going to be, in fact, less fraud.

14

be -- the money will be used for the purposes for which it


15

was given to the states, and there will be a deterrent


16

effect in terms of government officials not actually


17

engaging in fraud and -- and a related interest in the act


18

is, in fact, promoting representative, responsive


19

democracy, and by disclosing frauds to the public, you can


20

correct them.

21

lawsuit is only brought if, in fact, there's been an


22

essential misrepresentation, something really basic about


23

what was done by a local government that has actually


24

misused the money.


25

There's going to


But the reality still is the contract, the


Local government has gotten the money, and, in


25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fact, all the local government is giving back is, it's


2

giving back the money it wrongfully got, if it's shown


3

that it got it by -- got it falsely or -- or fraudulently. 


4

It's giving back prejudgment interest and, within the


5

statute of limitations of 10 years, that is always


6

virtually going to exceed the basic laws, and it's going


7

to have to pay back the -- give a share to the relator,


8

which is an important piece of this, because Congress has


9

also recognized that, in this area, where you do have


10

large amounts of fraud out there, there are no private


11

victims.


12

There is nobody who steps forward and says, I


13

was hurt, and therefore I'm going to bring a lawsuit to


14

protect myself and the Government will benefit, and the


15

Government, the Court -- the Congress recognized, doesn't


16

have the research -- the resources to deal with all this,


17

so it desperately needs the -- the private Inspector


18

Generals who are willing to step forward oftentimes, not


19

as bounty hunters, but as -- as really offended citizens


20

who, like Dr. Chandler, who brought it to the attention of


21

the county and said, you're not doing what you're supposed


22

to do, and they took responsibilities from him and he said


23

again, and you're not supposed to -- you're supposed to be


24

providing these services, and suddenly she wasn't


25

responsible for that.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

They need these people to come in and blow the


2

whistle, because otherwise, the Government's not going to


3

find it, and they -- they recognize that oftentimes


4

they're -- they're terminated, so we've got to pay them


5

something for coming forward, so what the Government is


6

really paying in many of the claims is not much more than


7

what, in fact, the government -- what the -- the local


8

government is paying is not much more than what the -- the


9

Federal Government paid in this case --

mean, it may be kind of an academic question if, in 1863,


2

the Federal Government was not giving out money to


3

municipalities.


4

MR. MINER:

It wasn't, but that doesn't mean


5

that, first of all, again going back to Lafayette, this


6

Court recognized the fact that Congress in 1890 was


7

concerned about private corporations didn't preclude


8

including municipal corporations as persons under the


9

Sherman Act, and -- and the fact of the matter is, local


10

governments in that day did commercial activities.

11

built bridges, they took care of the indigent at the


12

request of States, and they were held responsible for


13

their actions and, in fact, when they didn't live up to


14

their responsibilities, they were routinely sued, and they


15

could well have been reached by Federal Government.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM S. STEWART


20

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,


21

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT


22
23
24
25

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

The False Claims Act is the primary mechanism

for addressing deliberate efforts to cheat the Federal


29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government out of money and property.

2

identified no legitimate ground for excluding local


3

governments from the coverage of the act.

4

governments receive very substantial amounts of Federal


5

money, and fraud by local governments causes precisely the


6

same harms as comparable misconduct committed by a private


7

party.

8

encompassed by the term, person, and qui tam suits against


9

local governments raise no constitutional concerns.


10

Petitioner has


Local


Moreover, local governments are presumptively


Now, with respect to the 1863 act, to begin,


11

it's true that as of 1863, there was no square holding of


12

this Court to the effect that a municipal corporation


13

would presumptively be treated as a person for purposes of


14

Federal statutes.

15

at that time, Congress would certainly have reasonably


16

concluded that municipalities were covered.


However, given the materials available


17

As Justice Souter pointed out, as early as 1826,


18

this Court quoted with approval Lord Cook's observation to


19

the effect that the term, person, presumptively includes


20

both municipal and private corporations and, again,


21

because fraud by municipal corporations in the procurement


22

of Federal --


23
24
25

QUESTION:

There -- that -- that case, though,


was dealing with a private corporation, was it not?

MR. STEWART:

That -- that's correct.

There was


30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

no square holding to that effect, but certainly all the 


2

indications in the Court's opinions would have supported


3

Congress in its view that the term, person, would include


4

local governments.

The -- the Court in Monell held that as of 1871


5
6

a clear understanding to that effect had been established,


7

and petitioner has identified no evidence that would


8

suggest that the prevailing consensus changed during the


9

years between 1863 and 1871.

It -- it may also be the case that, as Justice


10
11

Ginsburg suggested, the question would have been a largely


12

academic one in 1863, because local governments wouldn't


13

have received a significant amount of Federal money.

14

Congress deliberately drafted the act in a broad fashion


15

so that it would encompass spending programs that were


16

adopted in the future, even if they were unknown in 1863,


17

and -- and the Court --

QUESTION:

18

The


Now, aren't you gilding the lily a


19

little bit to say that Congress in 1863 contemplated that


20

there would be massive Federal spending programs in the


21

future?


22

MR. STEWART:

Oh, I'm not suggesting that


23

Congress contemplated that.

I'm saying Congress wrote the


24

statute in a way that would cover whatever spending


25

programs came to be adopted in ensuing years, and -- and


31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court addressed essentially that situation in U.S.


2

ex rel. Marcus versus Hess, in which it said the type of


3

financial assistance that we're dealing with here would


4

not have been undertaken in 1863, yet Congress drafted the


5

act broadly, and these funds are in -- as much in need of


6

protection as other Federal money, and Congress did, in


7

some significant, some relatively minor respects, continue


8

to amend the False Claims Act at intervals during the


9

period between 1863 and 1986, and during that period, it


10

became increasingly apparent that local governments were


11

beginning to receive enhanced shares of Federal money.


12

It also became increasingly apparent that the


13

term, person would be construed generally to encompass


14

local governments, yet Congress retained the word, person,


15

even as it amended other features of the act, and I think


16

petitioner's primary argument is that even if the statute


17

included municipalities up to 1986, the 1986 amendments


18

took local governments out of the act's coverage by adding


19

a punitive component to the damages available, and -- and


20

this seems implausible for, essentially for two reasons.


21

First, the whole thrust of the 1986 amendments


22

generally was to make the act more effective, to expand


23

its coverage, to give the Government greater weapons in


24

fighting fraud, so it seems very unlikely that at the same


25

time Congress would have removed from the act's


32

coverage --

QUESTION:

Well, we do have the presumption in


3

the City of Newport situation of not treating punitives as


4

applicable to municipal corporations.


5

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

The City of


6

Newport involved a different sort of statute.

That is,


7

the statute at issue in City of Newport was 42 U.S.C.


8

1983, and it provided an express cause of action, but it


9

said nothing about the remedies that would be available,


10

and essentially this Court's holding was, where the


11

statutory directive is for courts to use their own best


12

judgment as to what remedies are appropriate, punitive


13

damages should generally not be imposed upon


14

municipalities, but here, Congress has spoken precisely to


15

the remedies that will be applied at the end of a


16

successful suit.


17

QUESTION:

Does it give the Government any


18

remedy that -- suppose that you think that the particular


19

qui tam action is causing a lot of trouble in a Medicare


20

area, or Medicaid area, and there are hospital grants,


21

or -- you know, there are vast numbers of grants.

22

do anything about it?


23

MR. STEWART:

MR. STEWART:

The statute does authorize the
