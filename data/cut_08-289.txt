Mr. Starr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In January of 2000 the district court in

12

Arizona concluded that the Nogales school system had

13

failed to provide an equal educational opportunity for

14

its English language learners in that particular

15

district.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -- I thought the

17

determination was that it had failed to provide funds

18

that could reasonably accomplish the -- the -- the plan

19

which the district itself had adopted.

20

MR. STARR:

Well, Your Honor, the specific

21

finding was that there needed to be -- there were very

22

elaborate findings here.

23

remediation to in fact support a plan, and the State -

24
25

There needed in fact to be

JUSTICE SOUTER:
that, I take it.

But the district agreed on

The district said, you've got to do
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

something.

2

This is our plan.
And I thought the district court then

3

said -- the school district did that, and I thought the

4

district court then said, well, the -- the funding that

5

you have come up with, or the funding scheme you have

6

come up with simply is not rationally related to the

7

plan that you, yourself, have adopted.

8

wrong on that?

9

MR. STARR:

Am I -- am I

You are correct.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. STARR:

Okay.

It needs to be a rational plan.

12

But then by the time of the 60(b) hearing, the

13

circumstances had dramatically changed.

14

a failure.

15

occurred in educational policy.

16

Nogales was done away with throughout the State.

18

results are already being shown.

19

There had been

Nogales -

What was the year, Mr.

20

Starr, the year of that change to the SEI from the

21

bilingual education?

22

MR. STARR:

What was the year of that?
The voters voted it in, in

23

November of 2000, and it began feathering in very

24

promptly as soon as the school districts could in fact

25

respond, and Nogales 5

MR. STARR:

That is true.

None -- and

And in fact one

of the grounds of our submission this morning is that

10

the failure to appeal should be in fact a cause for

11

concern.

12

finality, especially when we are dealing with a very

13

quintessential State and local function, namely,

14

education.

15

Indeed, 60(b)(5) is all about exceptions to

And, thus, the court should have been open

16

to consider what the Ninth Circuit had commanded it

17

consider, namely the changed circumstances.

18

were those changed circumstances?

Nogales was doing

19

great.

Superintendent Cooper

20

made tremendous reforms.

21

with a new methodology, but by funding that methodology.

22

And, Your Honor, all of this -

23

A new leadership came in.

And what

The State responded, not only

Nogales was doing great?

Now, I'm sure that progress has been made,
but it doesn't seem to me, looking at that kind of thing

10

-- and the record is filled with that kind of thing -

11

that that -- that you could say that the objectives are

12

achieved.

13

MR. STARR:

Your Honor, first of all, the

14

exam to which you are referring is given in English.

this to teach the children to learn English?
MR. STARR:

that you should look at is the AZELA exam.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

I am not

22

following this exchange because I don't understand

But I would like to know what

I don't.

That's -- that's

But -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Very much true.

Counsel, why don't you try and answer?

13

MR. STARR:

Thank you.

14

I would go, if I would -- if you would, to

15

page 46a of our Pet. Ap, where you -- Petition Appendix,

16

where you, in fact, get the information summarized, and

17

then go to -- and this is the Ninth Circuit's own words

18

that "Nogales is doing substantially better," "the State

19

has developed a significantly improved infrastructure."

20

And then if you go to the superintendent's

21

Petition Appendix, you will see -- this is the relevant

22

information under No Child Left Behind, which is one of

23

the changed circumstances -- the Nogales students are,

24

in fact, doing better than across the State.

25

to measure the progress that has, in fact, been made and

Everyone agrees.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

have an answer to Justice Breyer's -- I guess

4

Justice Scalia's question following up on Justice

5

Breyer's.

6

with respect to the figures Justice Breyer gave you?

7

Well, I still don't

What are the parameters or the -- the data

MR. STARR:

Yes.

The key, I would refer the

8

Court to Appendix 312 of the superintendent's petition

9

and the prior pages.

And that gives the percentage of

10

students making progress under the exams that are

11

administered by the State statewide, and that you will

12

see that throughout, including in the high school, that

13

the students are, in fact, making progress.

14

district court concluded that Nogales had -

So the answer is

16

that Justice Breyer's figures are correct with respect

17

to the appropriate bases of children.

18

saying that you want to use a different test than the

19

one that he was quoting?

20

MR. STARR:

You are just

Well, again, my quarrel with his

21

figures had to do with the nature of the test being

23

There are different tests being administered.

MR. STARR:

That one shouldn't take too

seriously a test that is -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Let's take the

4

one you mentioned. Let's take the one you mention.

The

5

one you mentioned, I take it the student academic

6

achievement in mathematics, which is something called

7

the AYP guidelines test, they are for high school, which

8

you mentioned.

9

2007 -- we have limited English proficient students,

It has -- I think it's 2008, maybe it's

10

this is passing their test, 22.4 percent of the English

11

learners are at students scoring at or above proficient.

12

The overall rate is 68 percent.

13

a third.

14

So it seems like about

Now, if you look at the reading language

arts, the average is 73.5.

to 15.4, in the high schools, on the tests that you have

mentioned.

And that's quite a difference, 75 percent as

So I just say -- my only point is that we

20

have a couple of findings here; you are right, they have

21

made progress, but they are not quite home yet.

would say that, looking at this record, it seems to

23

suggest that.

And that

brings us to -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let's do another one.

What

3

they started out in the year 2000 is they said one

4

problem with this State is we don't know what it costs

5

the average -- the increased program.

6

a good study to tell what it costs.

7

somewhere around $1500, maybe it's $1300, maybe it's

8

$1400 per student.

has to take from other things like English, or -- is

16

pages 22 and 23 of the opening brief.

17

throughout the testimony -- the testimony is absolutely

18

clear, including the plaintiffs', the Respondents', key

witness, Dr. Zumudio, agreed that there has, in fact,

20

been substantial progress, indeed there is an effective

21

program in place.

22

First of all, there has been a substantial

And you will see

And so our fundamental quarrel with the

23

approach of the district court is it blinded itself to

24

the significant changes structurally as well as the

25

progress that had been made and just said it doesn't
11
Alderson Reporting Company

matter because this is all about funding, and that is

2

not true.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Starr, can I take you

4

back to the beginning of the 60(b) motion, because you

5

seem to have shifted ground?

6

presented to the district court said that this new law

7

passed by the Arizona legislature, 2064 -- "2064 creates

8

a plan for adequate funding of programs for the ELL

9

students."

10

The 60(b) motion as

That was the whole basis for the 60(b)

11

motion, whether the new law was supplied adequate

12

funding, and the Speaker of the House and the Senate

13

intervened specifically for the purpose of defending the

14

new law.

15

law.

16

Your current argument is detached from the new

MR. STARR:

It is not detached, but our

17

submission is, in fact, that we look to what the

18

district court had before it in the 60(b)(5) hearing.

19

It had an eight-day evidentiary hearing.

20

simply legal argument over that particular bill.

21

that evidence -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was not

But that was the basis

23

for the 64(b) motion, that 2064 provided adequate

24

funding.

25

MR. STARR:

And

Your Honor, there were a variety

of points made, and the 60(b) submission was not limited

2

to this new bill.

3

circumstances, here are the changed circumstances.

4

That's what the whole eight-day trial was about.

5

eight-day trial was about what are the new funding

6

mechanisms, what is happening on the ground in Nogales.

7

And as I say, even the Respondents' own key witness said

8

that there is an effective ELL program now in place, and

9

that, in fact, progress -

10

Rather, it was a totality of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we -- do we have

11

the -- the intervention application in the papers before

12

us and the 60(b) motion?

13

MR. STARR:

Yes, you do -- you do have it

14

before you.

15

and the President were, in fact, submitting to the

16

district court HB 2064 as part of the submission.

17

And there is no question that the Speaker

My point is the evidentiary hearing went

18

much more broadly and here's the key:

19

all that is required under the Castaneda framework is,

20

in fact, good faith efforts toward compliance.

21

questions that are flowing suggest there has been no

22

good faith effort at compliance, and there has been.

23

That's what the eight-day hearing was all about.

24

one of the things that Superintendent Cooper testified

25

to and discredited.

Under the EEOA,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

had been any good faith attempt at compliance, but

4

whether there were two deficiencies under the scheme,

5

under the -- I forget the statute -- the new bill.

6

deficiency was that it limited the funding for any given

7

student subject to -- to ELL -- to two-year funding

8

when, in fact, the evidence showed that you couldn't get

9

a kid up to par with two years of education.

10

I thought the -- the issue was not whether there

One

The second deficiency was that the -- that

11

the State funds -- strike that, I'm sorry -- that

Federal funds were being used to supplant what should

13

have been a State responsibility rather than merely

14

supplementing.

15

degree, but that was the problem.

16

I take it that is simply a matter of

I thought those were the two problems,

17

two-year funding, supplantation.

Am I -- am I wrong?

18

So there was no -- my point is that there was no denial

19

that some good faith efforts had been made.

20

was that there were two deficiencies and these were the

21

two deficiencies; is that correct?

22

MR. STARR:

The finding

As -- that is correct.

But as

23

to the latter with respect to the Federal funds,

24

supplant versus supplement, all that we have is -- and

25

this is an issue that is entrusted to the Department of
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Education.

It's not trusted to the district courts

2

under No Child Left Behind.

3

Congress has determined there should no longer be -- not

4

that EEOA doesn't -- it has its beachhead, it has its

5

place, but now No Child Left Behind has a very elaborate

6

process including a plan, and Arizona is in compliance

7

with that plan.

This is an apparatus that

8

The point is the HB 2064 points completely

9

blinded the district court to what was actually before

10

him, and we think that that is wrong.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Starr, how do you

12

explain the fact the State of Arizona and the board of

13

education are troubled by the same two points?

14

MR. STARR:

There is no question that there

15

is disagreement within the house with respect to that.

16

But, Your Honor, there is no authority on the part of a

17

Federal court under No Child Left Behind to render this

18

kind of interpretation.

19

ultimately, it is irrelevant.

20

issue -

21

And it has blinded us -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It has blinded us to the

Well, what is it -- No

22

Child Left Behind I thought has a specific saving

23

clause, "Nothing in this part shall be construed in a

24

manner inconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a

25

civil right."

And the EEOA is such a law.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. STARR:

That is correct.

The point that

2

I am making is the interpretation of supplemental versus

3

supplant is in fact one that is entrusted to the

4

Department of Education.

We only have a letter.

5

not final agency action.

But I want to return to what

6

we think is the key in a 60(b)(5) hearing.

7

What is key in 60(b)(5) is to listen to the

8

changed circumstances.

9

circumstances?

10

That's

What are the changed

And the Court blinded itself to these

very important changes in terms of State funding -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the one State

12

funding?

Because I looked at your brief, page 22 to 23,

13

and if I understand it correctly it says that the

14

educational expenditures, that is to say monies,

15

increased in this Nogales and USD -

interested to know if they are wrong -- the numbers that

22

I have is that the only survey they've done across the

23

State, or the most recent one, says that the English

24

language instructional costs range between 1570 and

25

$3300 per pupil.

But that's I take it the entire maintenance and
The numbers I had -- and I am quite

And then if you look at the amount the

State provides outside of the reading, writing and

arithmetic, which they provide, et cetera, for all

3

students, what they provide is -- currently it's $340,

4

and if that law had gone into effect, 2064, it would

have been $450.

6

Now, are those numbers totally wrong?

MR. STARR:

The numbers are not wrong, Your

Honor, but the numbers are in fact not the pivotal

point.

come to the specific point of cost studies.

When the district court issued its initial
judgment in 2000, what the court found was that there

Alderson Reporting Company

was a systemic violation of the EEOA.

2

further found that the program deficiencies were the

result of the lack of funding rationally related to the

programs.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the court

Can I ask whether the

requirements of the EEOA are at all affected

constitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what

doing okay?

answer is no for two fundamental reasons.

a textual point.

doesn't say anywhere that it displaces the standards for

compliance with the EEOA.

10

First is just

The text of No Child Left Behind

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't think that's their

11

argument, counsel.

I don't think that it is their

12

argument that No Child Left Behind supplants the earlier

13

act.

14

informs an interpretation of the language of EEOA, which

15

is that the State is required to take appropriate

16

action, which is a very vague standard.

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It is simply their -- their argument is that it

I think their argument at

18

the end of the day, Justice Scalia, is that if you

19

comply with No Child Left Behind -- and I will get to in

20

a moment what compliance with No Child Left Behind can

21

mean -- then you have necessarily complied with the

22

EEOA.

23

sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.

24
25

That compliance with the No Child Left Behind

And I don't think that is workable

But let's
We had

But it is a very good plan, and it has

As I read the Ninth Circuit's decision, they

13

would not grant relief from the judgment under those

14

circumstances, because they focus exclusively on

15

incremental funding for EEL programs and Arizona's

16

funding model.

17

Isn't that correct?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I -- I don't know

18

that that is a correct interpretation of the EEOA.

19

we would say is that if the State came forward with a

20

showing that completely regardless of funding the

21

programs on the ground work, well, that would be

22

something that the district court would have to take

23

into account.

What

But the state hasn't -

under 60(b) solely with regard to incremental funding

3

and Arizona's funding model?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The Ninth Circuit focused

5

on funding, Justice Alito, because that is the way the

6

case has been litigated from the outset.

way the State has said from the outset that it would

8

achieve compliance with the -

9

And that's the

That's the way it was

litigated originally, but I thought the whole focus of

produce good results without looking at incremental EEL

21

what the district court found there is that the

22

improvements today, although significant, failed to

23

reach the high school; that they were fleeting.

24

and this is particularly significant.

In addition, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

make an assessment of many of the changes, because many

2

of the new standards are still evolving.

3

And the reason the district court said that

4

is that -- is because of the enactment in 2006 of

5

Arizona HB 2064, which changes the framework for

6

administration and funding of ELL programs in a way that

I think fortifies the district court's denial of

complete dissolution of its judgment and -- and ensuing

orders.

10

be for any number of reasons, and say that, you know,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not a question

5

of progress; it's a question of the plan and the

6

approach.

7

looking at page 72a -- it talks about the ELL's specific

8

funding that was based on the prior order.

9

And what I

the superintendent has done in this particular case, and

extraordinary enough thing for a district court to tell

14

a State legislature:

15

Legislature, pass it, and -- I guess -- you, Governor,

16

sign it, or you are not going to be in compliance.

17

if they've come up with a different way with different

funding requirements, I don't know why that's not a

changed circumstance that justifies looking at the

judgment -

Pass this budget, and you,

levels are still in place.

fundamentally different assertions being made by

Petitioners, if I understand it:

3

Justice Scalia alluded to earlier, which is that No

4

Child Left Behind changed the legal landscape in a way

5

such that compliance with No Child Left Behind, such as

6

it is, sets the standard for compliance with the EEOA.

7

One is what

Now, there's a distinct argument that's also

8

being made which is that conditions on the ground have

9

improved as a consequence of management improvements.

10

Regardless of No Child Left Behind, this is a factual

11

argument, that factually things have changed in a way

12

that ought to let us from underneath the district

13

court's supervision.

14

Now, the -- they are different points, and I

15

think the district court addressed both of them.

With

16

respect to the second one, where there is the facts on

17

the ground, what is critical is that, in order to

16

No, I don't think the EEOA

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's all this says.

The majority doesn't -

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- doesn't meet the -- a

19

majority of ELL tenth graders fail to meet the

20

standards, but the majority of native English speakers

21

do.

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, that's part of what

23

it says, and I think what the Ninth Circuit is also

24

alluding to with respect to the high school in

25

particular that, if you look at State survey that
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Petitioners rely on in -- in touting the improvements in

2

certain schools, it also with respect to the high school

3

shows that the two high schools in Nogales was ranked -

4

were ranked at the very bottom of the survey for ELL

5

students.

6

So there's problems on the ground, but what

7

the district court focused on concerns the enactment of

8

2064, which is that no matter was think about the

9

improvements that have -- that have been made to date,

10

the landscape fundamentally shifts upon the enactment of

11

2064 because the administration and funding of ELL plans

12

changes at that point.

13

And it's -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the new plan that

14

we're talking about, is 20 -- there have been references

15

-- well, now they have a new plan.

16

at least that the new plan is 2064?

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Does everybody agree

I -- I think we would agree

18

because that sets the charter for provision of programs

19

to ELL students going forward from its enactment.

20

That's the infrastructure from -- from here on out.

21

And that -- there's three particular

22

features of that that I think are significant and that

23

fortify the district court's conclusion that complete

24

dissolution was unwarranted.

25

The first is the one that was raised by
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Souter, which is that whatever you think of the

2

progress that has been made to date -- and the district

3

court found that, while it was significant, it didn't

4

suffice -- that changes from what can be brought to bear

5

from here on out as half the resources that were

6

available before, because that's the net effect of 2064.

7

That's what the district court found, at pages 107 to

8

108a of the Petition Appendix.

9

resources to work with -- at the very least I think what

And when you have half

10

the district court thought in saying that it was

11

premature to make an assessment is that we have to have

12

some period to assess what happens on the ground as a

13

consequence -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

16
17

Is there any -

-- of this new funding

recipe.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does -- then does

18

that stay true without regard to what is happening

19

economically to the State?

20

court can say:

21

this program, and I don't care what it means for jails,

22

roads, anything else, when there are profound changes in

23

economic circumstances of the sort that everybody's

24

experiencing lately.

25

In other words, the district

You've got to spend this much money on

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, the -- the district -

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the State would have to present that, Your Honor, and I

2

don't believe the State to have done that so far.

3

the State would have to make the argument that funding

4

constraints are inexistence in a way that doesn't allow

5

us to -- to use one example -- to -- to put together an

6

optimal program, and so here's the program that we want

7

to put in place in -

But

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, I -

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- jurisdictions.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I find it bizarre that we

11

are sitting here talking about what the whole State has

12

to do on the basis of one district which is concededly

13

the district that has the most nonnative English

14

speakers and has been a problem district all along.

15

we are saying whatever this district court says for -

16

for this school district applies statewide.

17

is bizarre.

And

Now, that

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the mere fact that the

20

State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind

21

of a system at the outset, does that force us to still

22

accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for

23

Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Scalia, I think

that that issue becomes largely an academic one for the
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

following reason:

that the reason that the State

2

Attorney General made the acknowledgment that he did is

3

that, under the Arizona State Constitution, funding

4

decisions don't vary from district to district.

5

whatever funding menu is put into place in order to

6

achieve compliance with the EEOA with respect to Nogales

7

is going to be the same one that exists throughout the

8

State.

So

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'll let -

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It's -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'll let Arizona worry

12

about that.

13

district court decree that the whole State has to do

14

this thing.

15

not would be a matter for the State courts to determine,

16

instead of for this district judge to determine, right?

17

It's -- it's another matter to have a

And whether -- whether it's done equally or

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it could be, but I

18

don't think there's really much of a dispute that the

19

statewide funding measure doesn't really affect what the

20

State's going to do in this case, because -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it seems to me very

22

odd that -- assume you have a constitutional provision

23

which says funding must be equal in each district.

24

you find one district that's way behind, and that is, we

25

will assume, is -- has been deficient in -- in providing
41

2

orders more money spent for that district, it must

3

automatically order money -- additional money for every

4

other district in the State?

5
6
7

You are saying that if the court

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, absolutely not.

Not -

certainly not in the abstract.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- yes, but that seems

8

to me the necessary conclusion of your argument in the

9

answer you gave Justice Scalia.

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't think it's a

11

necessary conclusion of my argument, Justice Kennedy.

12

think it's a conclusion that rests on we are in this

13

litigation in this particular context, given the Arizona

14

Constitution's uniformity clause.

15

of that clause that this issue even arises.

16

the Attorney General -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I

It's as a consequence
And I think

But, again, what you're -

18

you're saying that any time a district court in a single

19

district orders more money to remedy a constitutional

20

problem, that because of that clause it has to apply to

21

every other district.

That just can't be.

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if the And if -- and if it is,

24

then that is a very good reason for the district court

25

to cede its jurisdiction to the State authorities.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, if the litigation had

2

come up in a different way, Justice Kennedy, such that

3

it had always focused exclusively on what happened in

4

Nogales, including the funding aspect of the case, but I

5

think what would have been appropriate is that the

6

district court would have inquired about what funding

7

resources belong to Nogales in particular.

8

what would have happened by operation of State law would

9

be that, whatever the funding calculus with respect to

10

Nogales, it would automatically apply across the State

11

because of the Arizona Constitution's uniformity clause.

12

And then

Now, in this case, the litigation -- the

13

complaint was assessed against the entire State, and the

14

Attorney General accepted that, and I don't think at

15

this point in time we can revisit that, particularly

16

when it's largely an academic question given the

17

uniformity clause -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I gather it's

19

often the case in institutional litigation of this sort

20

that the political figures, whether it's the Governor or

21

the Attorney General, can't go to the voters say, look,

22

we should spend more money on this.

23

district court judge and say, make us spend more money

24

on this.

25

a non-democratic way, particularly when there's a

So they go to the

And they get the same result they'd wanted in

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

division, such as here the legislature doesn't want to

2

do something, and the Governor or the Attorney General

3

does.

4

So why should we put a lot of weight on what

5

the representation is when we are at least concerned

6

that it might be a -- I don't mean it in a pejorative

7

sense -- but a collusive piece of litigation?

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, two points,

Mr. Chief Justice, and first -- and I don't mean to

10

quibble, but the Attorney General did contest the

11

litigation at the outset.

12

judgment was issued against the State, then I think

13

there was an acquiescence in the -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What happened is, after a

Well, it's hard for

15

the Attorney General to get funding from the legislature

16

for all he wants to do, and this is a way for him to get

17

it, to go to the legislature and say look, you don't

18

have a choice.

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, sure,

20

Mr. Chief Justice, but I think what the Court did in

21

both Rufo and Frew is it accommodated those concerns,

22

and it accommodated the interest in finality that comes

23

from judgments, and the interests in allowing a

24

different set of State officials to suggest new programs

25

to make that suggestion to the district court.
44
Alderson Reporting Company

And it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

accommodated those in a way that requires a showing at

2

the outset that there has been a significant change in

3

facts or a significant change in law.

And on -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

question that was confusing to me?

6

changed circumstances do you understand the Ninth

7

Circuit to have applied?

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

What standard for

by this Court in Rufo.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

12

Can I ask just a

Which is?

A significant change of

facts or a significant change of law.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the -

I am looking at page

14

72a of the Ninth Circuit opinion, and the standard they

15

use there is radically changed, not significantly

16

changed.

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, on page 49a they

18

invoke the precise wording of this Court, cite Rufo for

19

that proposition, and also -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, if we have a -

21

if we are confused as to which standard they applied,

22

because at one point they say significantly changed and

23

at another point they say radically changed, what should

24

we do?

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I -- I would give

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effect to the articulation of the standard in the

2

standard review question section of the opinion.

3

course you could remand if you felt that it was

4

necessary, but I think the reason why the Ninth Circuit

5

uses the language such as Your Honor found in 72a is

6

that it has to be considered in the context of the

7

nature of the violation and the nature of the relief

8

sought.

9

Of

The violation was a systematic one; the

10

relief sought is a complete dissolution of the judgment

11

and ensuing order, and in that context I think it is

12

fair to say that what is significant is more significant

13

than what would be the case in -- for example, in Rufo,

14

where what was sought was a relatively modest

15

modification of the consent order concerning whether you

16

would have single bunking or double bunking.

17

Now on the question of whether there is in

18

fact a significant change or significant change of facts

19

or significant change in law, on No Child Left Behind,

20

Justice Scalia, to return to the question that you

21

asked, the reason that No Child Left Behind in our view

22

doesn't displace the standard for EEOA is that

23

Petitioner's standard is that as long as the State has

24

an approved No Child Left Behind plan, which is true of

25

all 50 States, that they necessarily satisfy the EEOA;
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and what that would mean is that even if a State didn't

2

implement that plan, even if the State didn't -- didn't

3

-- didn't have accountability measures that it in fact

4

followed, that required school districts to achieve the

5

annual measurement of progress that would be laid out in

6

the plan -- notwithstanding all of that, a plaintiff

7

would lack authority to come into the court and litigate

8

his private cause of action under the EEOA and get a

9

court order that requires the State to take appropriate

10

action -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right but -

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- simply because the State

13

will have had an approved plan.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that.

You

15

could get the plan approved and then not fund it.

16

at least the additional funding demanded by the district

17

court should be whatever additional funding is necessary

18

to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act.

19
20
21

But

Right?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I -- I don't think so.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then -- then it's not

Because -

22

as simple as you made it.

Of course, I agree with the

23

fact that if you get approved under the No Child Left

24

Behind Act and then don't fund it, of course that -

25

that won't satisfy your obligation.
47
Alderson Reporting Company

But if you have

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

your obligation should be how much money would it cost

3

to implement the program that you have gotten approved

4

under the No Child Left Behind Act.

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The -- the No Child Left

6

Behind Act doesn't -- it doesn't approve a particular

7

program.

funding conditions, and that includes -

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

What No Child Left Behind

concerns is, is there a testing program in place that

20

calls for certain improvements in testing over time.

long as the plan describes the tests that will be taken

22

and the progress that will be achieved or sought to be

OF BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE,
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It's important to recognize what Petitioners

5

asked for here at the rule 60(b)(5) stage.

That was

6

complete dissolution of the court's immediate orders.

7

It was not to just limit those orders just to Nogales;

8

it was not to improve -- or to approve improvements in

9

Nogales as an interim measure.

As a result, the burden

10

was on them to show either full compliance with the

11

orders the district court had entered or material

12

changed circumstances that made compliance unnecessary.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But couldn't the district

14

court give them the relief to which they were entitled

15

even if it was less than what they sought?

16

MS. SAHARSKY:

Certainly.

But they didn't

17

demonstrate that -- entitlement to that relief either.

18

To the extended we are talking about the question of

19

whether conditions had changed in Nogales that there was

20

no longer an ongoing violation of Federal law, the

21

district court held an 8-day evidentiary hearing, and it

22

made factual findings showing that the problems had not

23

ceased in Nogales.

24

this changed circumstances argument that is now heavily

25

relied upon by Petitioners was not the primary thrust of

And as you noted, Justice Ginsburg,

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

their argument before the district court.

2

The primary thrust of their argument was

3

that HB 2064, which is the State's scheme for ELL

4

education, had some serious -- would -- would satisfy

5

the judgment; and their other argument was that No Child

6

Left Behind completely preempts -- that was the language

7

they use -- completely preempts and renders obsolete the

8

EEOA.

15

What is your

16

significant change, which, I don't see significant and

17

material as being all that different.

18

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that

Well, I don't either

20

but I see both of them being different from radically

21

changed.

22

MS. SAHARSKY:

Again, I think if you look at

23

the Ninth Circuit's opinion, particularly where it

24

starts out with the standard of review, it cites this

25

Court's precedents in Rufo and Agostini; it talks about
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the need for significant changed circumstances.

2

understand that there are portions of the Ninth

3

Circuit's opinion that say -- that have the radical

4

change language, and again, I -- I think that that

5

language is -- just reflects the arguments that

6

Petitioners were making, that they wanted complete

7

relief from these remedial orders and that, you know,

8

the underlying judgment here was a systemic violation.

9

I mean, it's -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I

Did the district court on

11

the 8-day hearing on remand make a finding that its

12

incremental funding determinations that it had made

13

earlier were an accurate way to measure compliance and

14

to insist on compliance under the new immersion program?

15

MS. SAHARSKY:

If I understand your question

16

correctly, and please correct me if I don't, but the

17

district court considered two different arguments.

18

first was under House Bill 2064 which considered to have

19

-- which continued to have this incremental funding.

20

It's that we have two problems with House Bill 2064,

21

which were the two-year cutoff and Federal funding

22

problem.

23

The

On the second question which -- the second

24

argument Petitioners made which said, everything is fine

25

in Nogales because we have money from other funds, the
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

district court said no, there's -- there's been an

ongoing violation of Federal.

burden of showing me that violation ceased because

4

things aren't better in Nogales.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do -

Why does it matter that

6

there is -- why focus on incremental funding for ELL

7

programs exclusively?

8

where the money comes from -- where it comes from,

9

putting aside federal money that can't be supplanted?

10
11

What difference does it make

I

just don't understand that.
MS. SAHARSKY:

I think the reason the

12

district court was focused on that because that was

13

always the State's position that, in terms of the

14

statewide scheme, that that is how they were going to

15

fund ELL education.

16

always, from 2000 up to the time of the district court's

17

rule 60(b) hearing, going down this path whereby it

18

would put in place an ELL program and then give this

19

amount of funding -

20

Now it -- and so the State was

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that may have been

21

their -- that may have been their position originally,

22

but at the time of the 60(b) hearing, what difference

23

does it make whether the money came from funds that were

24

designated for ELL program, or from general State funds,

25

or from county funds?

What difference does it make
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether the money was taken from some other program that

2

the school was operating?

3

Suppose they fund -- they take the money for

4

the ELL programs from money that was previously used for

5

music instruction, or art, or gym, or teaching German or

6

anything else.

7

what does that have to be with the EEOA?

8
9

Now those may all be bad things, but

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, the district court

could have found that the plan had changed and that

10

funding could come from -- from different places.

11

That's right, if the State had changed its plans or that

12

Nogales otherwise would have sufficient funding from

13

circumstances that -- or from other source, that would

14

be one thing.

15

doesn't have that funding from other sources.

17

funding that it -- that the Petitioners claim could be

18

used to solve its problem under the EEOA.

19

specific conditions on federal grant programs that

20

forbid that.

21

There are

It also could not raise any significant

22

amounts of funding through county tax overrides, which

23

was another source the Petitioners had said would -

24

would provide sufficient funding.

25

district court had to ask is, there has been an ongoing

So the question the

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

violation of federal law, has that violation of

2

federal -- federal law ceased because the State has put

3

in place, Nogales has put in place programs that are

4

reasonably calculated to help these kids learn English?

5

And the district court said Nogales has

6

cobbled together these sources of funding.

7

doing the best they can.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it is

But the fact that you keep

9

talking about the district court emphasizes my concern

10

about the decision of the Ninth Circuit, which is what

11

we are reviewing.

12

Ninth Circuit, they focused exclusively on incremental

13

costs associated with ELL programs and the educational

14

funding model that the State had at that time.

And as I read the decision of the

15

MS. SAHARSKY:

16

that that was their exclusive focus.

17

it was a primary focus of that decision, and the reason

18

for that was because the primary argument -

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

With respect, I don't think
I understand that

Well, they say.

They were

20

required -- the Petitioners were required to demonstrate

21

either that there are no longer incremental costs

22

associated with ELL programs in Arizona or that

23

Arizona's funding model was so altered as to make

24

incremental costs issue relevant.

25

explanation of the holding, 60 -- 63A of the Speaker's

That was their

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appendix.

2

MS. SAHARSKY:

That's right.

And what I

3

understand that to mean is that they were required to

4

either show compliance with the judgment which was that

5

they would put together a plan that funded ELL education

6

based on incremental costs or that the State was going

7

to go down a different path and come up with the funding

8

some other way, and that would result in a program

9

reasonably calculated to help ELL students earn English.

10

And the district court found there were

11

neither and the court of appeals found there were

12

neither.

13

alleged changed circumstances, and Nogales had issued a

14

91-page opinion that talked about the significant

15

resource constraints that still exist in Nogales and the

16

persistent achievement gaps that still exist in Nogales.

17

And the court of appeals did go through the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I still have trouble

18

with the idea of district courts ordering State

19

legislatures to fund it.

20

for the district court to say you have a violation, you

21

have to fix it, and I'm going check to see if you fixed

22

it at particular intervals?

23

State, to determine how you are going to fix it.

24

And the State might change its mind.

25

Isn't the preferable approach

And it's up to you, the

They

may start out by saying we have got all of this extra
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

money and that's how we will fix it.

2

budget crisis, the kind that we are familiar with, and

3

he says we can't the money, we are going to do it some

4

other way, and here's the way.

5
6

Then there is a

But that's kind of the judgment of the
State, not for the district court.

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

And I think the district

8

court was appropriately differential to the State

9

throughout this litigation.

You will note at the time

10

of the 2000 judgment that the district court didn't put

11

any remedial order in place.

12

time of trial the State said, look, we are going to put

13

in place an ELL program that everyone in the State can

14

use and figure out how much it costs, what works and

15

what doesn't.

16

please let us do the cost study and we will come back to

17

the court.

18
19
20

And that's because at the

We are going to do a cost study, so

And the district court said fine.

And ten

months later that didn't happen.
Now, there was a change, as Petitioners

21

note, to a different theory of ELL education, structured

22

English immersion and the court said, okay, do your

23

program based on structured English immersion and just

24

tell me how much it costs, tell me how you rationally

25

fund it, and that will be fine.

The district court here

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did not want to be in the business of micromanaging

2

State education.

3

district court was -

4

Through this entire litigation the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why does it order

5

then -- why did its order specify and be linked to the

6

termination of the legislative session, and say you have

7

12 days left in the session and that's how many days you

8

have to enact this budget?

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think it's because the

10

State kept coming back to the district court and saying

11

that the legislature had asked for this cost study,

12

there was an interim bill, House Bill 2010, where the

13

legislature said we put in place another study that we

14

are going to perform.

15

said -- constantly said the legislature is going to do

16

this cost study, figure out how much good programs cost,

17

the school -- the State board will be involved,

18

et cetera, that the district court entered its orders

19

looking to the time period in which it expected action

20

to occur.

21

And it's because the State

I mean, this happened over a nine-year

22

period.

The district court, to be clear -- I think this

23

is a very important point -- never said you need to do

24

any special kind of ELL program, bilingual, structured

25

English immersion, you need to have any certain number
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of teachers, nothing like that.

2

need to put this certain amount of funding in place,

3

$200, $300 per student, anything like that.

4

And it never said you

And Petitioners at the rule 60(b)(5) stage

5

faced a heavy burden to show if what they wanted to show

6

was that the State was now going to go down this new and

7

different path, because even at the time of the rule

8

60(b)(5) hearing, the state Was on the same path.

9

had just passed House Bill 2064, which just like at the

It

10

time of the 2000 judgment said we are going to put a

11

statewide program in place for ELL education -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the district -- the

13

district judge said that that 2064 did not have enough,

14

it raised it to 450 or whatever.

15

said there are three things wrong with it, the two

16

years, using the federal funds to -- to supplant not

17

supplement, and that the $450 figure wasn't enough.

18
19
20

And the district court

And the only way that $450 figure was going
to get changed was through legislation, right?
MS. SAHARSKY:

Could I answer that?

I think

21

the problem with the $450 figure is that the district

22

court was never told what the State was planning to buy

23

with that, what that $450 was for.

24

district court just said to the State, please tell me

25

what your programs are going to do and approximately how
59
Alderson Reporting Company

The State -- the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

much it costs to fund them.

2

any particular ELL programs.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that 450 wasn't tied to
That was the problem.
Ms. Saharsky, I have one

4

late arriving question.

Do you think that the

5

constitutional -- State constitutional provision at

6

least there has to be equivalent funding in districts,

7

do you think that would be called into play if the

8

Federal Government under a federal program gave

9

additional funds to a particular district?

Which I am

10

sure it does, those districts that have federal

11

facilities probably get additional -- additional money,

12

would all the rest -- under this constitutional

13

provision, would all the rest of the State have to belly

14

up to that -- to that same level?

15

MS. SAHARSKY:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

18

No, as I understand it I doubt it.
-- when it's talking about a

uniform -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yeah.
-- and equal amount, it's

21

talking about the amount that the State gives to the

22

school districts.

23

funding from other sources.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

It's not with respect to any federal

Well, if federal funding

doesn't count, why would a federal decree applicable
60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only to a particular school district count?

2

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think that the idea was

3

that there needed to be -- the State determined that

4

there needed to be -- it was going to solve the problem

5

statewide not only because of the concern under the

6

State constitutions, that it would provide for all ELL

7

students.

8

amount to each school district, but just the same amount

9

per ELL student.

And it was not that it would provide the same

That the State had decided that it was

10

going to fill that responsibility because -- both

11

because of the Constitution and because it's responsible

12

for supervising education statewide.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

17

MR. STARR:

Thank you.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me, Mr. Starr,

19

based on this last argument, that it actually is in your

20

favor if the order of the court as to one district

21

automatically requires additional expenditure for every

22

other district, that is simply one more measure that the

23

Court should use in finding an alternate remedy.

24

MR. STARR:

Yes, Your Honor.

The state

funding remedy here is extraordinarily intrusive and
61

under the EEOA ever, and certainly the No Child Left

not pay heed to the incredibly intrusive nature of a

It said it ten times to the fact that the
