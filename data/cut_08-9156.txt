We will hear

Mr. Scanlon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KERRY A. SCANLON

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCANLON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Holly Wood was sentenced to death after his

11

lawyers failed to investigate or present to the jury

12

evidence of his undisputed mental deficiencies.

13

evidence was readily available to any reasonably

14

competent attorney, and it offered powerful mitigation

15

which had a reasonable probability of changing the

16

sentence from death to life without parole.

17

That

No one on the sentencing jury had any idea

18

that Mr. Wood had any mental deficiency, much less that

19

he had an IQ between 59 and 64, which means he ranks in

20

the lowest one percent of the total population.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, if they had

22

introduced that evidence on behalf of the defendant,

23

there would have come in the report they had gotten

24

from -- who was it, Dr. Kirkland?

25

MR. SCANLON:

Was that his name?

That's correct, Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which said that, although

3

he -- he indeed was in the lower range of mental

4

agility, this did not affect his ability to discern

5

right from wrong.

6

MR. SCANLON:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

Well He was not -- the Kirkland

report was not a favorable report for the defendant.
MR. SCANLON:

Well, the Kirkland report was

10

not -- first of all, was only about his mental

11

competency and whether he had a mental disease or defect

12

that prevented him from knowing right from wrong.

13

was an incompetency and insanity report.

14

It

This Court has made it clear in Atkins and

15

other cases that mentally retarded persons often know

16

the difference between right and wrong and are competent

17

to stand trial.

18

strong lead that he had a borderline intellectual

19

functioning.

20

is able to go to trial or whether he -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What that report did have is a very

That is different from whether or not he

Well, but it didn't just

22

say borderline intellectual function.

23

that did not affect his ability to perceive that he

24

was -- he was doing something wrong here.

25

MR. SCANLON:

It went on to say

Each of the statements 4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, if it had not

2

added that I would have said, oh, yeah, let's -- let's

3

pursue this further.

4

made an intelligent decision There was nothing here that

5

was going to help them and there might be stuff that

6

would hurt them.

7

But they -- it seems to me they

MR. SCANLON:

Justice Scalia, everything in

8

the Kirkland report that talked about his ability was

9

his ability to go to trial, that he was competent and

10

that he knew the difference between right and wrong.

11

Those findings in the Kirkland report that talk about

12

that relate only to that issue.

13

different issue, which the courts have made clear,

14

whether someone has significant mental deficiencies that

15

will -- will -- is the kind of evidence that garners

16

sympathy from the jury.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's an entirely

Why is this question

18

properly before us in this case?

19

seem to be making, and it's an argument to which you

20

devote a lot of your brief, seems to be that the -- the

21

State courts unreasonably applied Strickland to the

22

performance of the attorneys at the penalty phase.

23

The argument that you

Now, that is a, a (d)(1) argument,

24

2254(d)(1).

But the two questions on which cert were

25

granted have to do with findings of fact.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

So they have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to do with (d)(2) and (e)(1) and not (d)(1) at all.

2

MR. SCANLON:

Justice Alito, our primary

3

argument is a (d)(2) argument, and that is that there

4

was no strategic decision here, that in fact it was a

5

failure to investigate in violation of this Court.

6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Was (d)(2) raised in

your habeas petition?

8

MR. SCANLON:

Yes.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could you give me a

10

citation for that, where in the habeas petition you made

11

a (d)(2) claim as opposed to a (d)(1) claim?

12

MR. SCANLON:

Well, our habeas -- I -- I can

13

get a cite for that, but our habeas petition was all

14

about failing to do an investigation in the State

15

court's findings that there had been a reasonable

16

investigation.

17

Justice, is at page 201a and 202a of the petition

18

appendix.

The State court finding, Mr. Chief

19

And at that point the State courts talk

20

about eight historical facts and they conclude that

21

there was a reasonable investigation of the facts.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That factual

23

determination that you say is unreasonable under (d)(2),

24

that went to deficient performance?

25

MR. SCANLON:

That went to deficient
6


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4

performance, of course.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did the -- did the

State court make a ruling on prejudice under Strickland?
MR. SCANLON:

The State court did make a

5

ruling on prejudice.

6

found that he was not mentally retarded, which, of

7

course, is -- is -- is clearly unreasonable, because you

8

don't have to be mentally retarded to have it be

9

valuable evidence to present to the jury.

10

And it made it on two grounds:

It

Secondly, they -- they found that the crime

11

was brutal in its nature, even though the trial court

12

had -- had -- had declined to give the instruction that

13

it was cruel and heinous.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you agree that we

15

have to find that it was an unreasonable determination

16

both with respect to performance and with respect to

17

prejudice to get you through the (d)(2) hurdle?

18

MR. SCANLON:

Yes, of course, and I think we

19

can do that, and for the same reason, Mr. Chief Justice,

20

that it was not reasonable in the first place for

21

counsel to decide to stop their investigation.

22

because the evidence is so powerful.

23

powerful kind of mitigating evidence you can have in

24

this type of case.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's

This is the most

Could I take you back to

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Alito's question?

As I read the lower court

2

decision, it was saying counsel made a strategic choice

3

not to pursue any further investigation with respect to

4

mental health, correct?

5

MR. SCANLON:

Correct.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

And they

7

made it on the basis of a number of factors, including

8

the fact that there was testimony that the two senior

9

attorneys said:

It's not going to help us if we do or

10

not.

You may disagree with whether or not a strategic

11

decision was made or not, but if one can view the

12

evidence in any way as the attorney having made the

13

decision, isn't your argument that that decision was

14

unreasonable?

15

MR. SCANLON:

Of course.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't that what

17

Justice Alito asked you?

That's not a dispute with the

18

factual finding that it was a strategic decision.

19

That's a dispute with the legal -- the legal -- whether

20

that strategic decision met the legal standard of

21

Strickland.

22

MR. SCANLON:

That's correct.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So we're

24

back to Justice Alito's question, which is, isn't that a

25

(d)(1) instead of a (d)(2) argument, and we -- the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question presented only addressed the strategic

2

decision.

3

the Strickland question of whether that would have been

4

a reasonable strategic decision.

5

It didn't address or present the question of

MR. SCANLON:

6

alternative argument.

7

(d)(2) argument.

8
9
10
11

Your Honor, that is our

Our -- our main argument is a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It might be your

alternative argument, but it's not the question
presented.
MR. SCANLON:

No, I'm saying the fact

12

question is our primary argument.

13

in the Eleventh Circuit.

14

determination that it was not unreasonable to find that

15

there had been an adequate investigation by these

16

lawyers of a mental health defense.

17

Eleventh Circuit found.

18

That is how we lost

The Eleventh Circuit made a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's what the

When did that come up?

I

19

thought that the facts as the Eleventh Circuit presented

20

them is that the senior lawyer first said:

21

Dr. Kirkland's report not simply on the question of

22

insanity and incompetence to stand trial, but also to

23

give us leads to mitigating evidence.

24
25

We want

So mitigation is in his mind about looking
into this mental question.

He reads Kirkland's report
9


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and, for whatever reason, decides this isn't worth

2

pursuing; this is not going to help us.

3

I thought that that's what the Eleventh

4

Circuit said was the picture, that whether it was an

5

incompetent, ineffective decision is a separate

6

question, but as to what happened, why did the

7

investigation stop, because the senior lawyer said:

8

Yes, it's relevant to mitigation, but I looked at the

9

report and I think it's not wise for us to pursue

10

mitigation.

11

MR. SCANLON:

Justice Ginsburg, that is what

12

the State argues.

That is not what the Eleventh Circuit

13

found.

14

the Eleventh Circuit clearly makes a finding that there

15

had been a reasonable investigation done of this.

On pages 56 and 57a of the petition appendix,

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

MR. SCANLON:

Where is that?

56?

Page 56a and page 57a of the

18

petition appendix, which is the Eleventh Circuit

19

decision.

20

Eleventh Circuit framed the issue correctly.

21

Here the issue becomes, did counsel, before deciding not

22

to present evidence of Wood's borderline intellectual

23

function make reasonable investigation or a reasonable

24

decision that made particular investigations

25

unnecessary?

And if you look at page 56a, for example, the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

They say:

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And they go on right after that on page 56

2

and 57 to say that they did a reasonable investigation.

3

They cite eight historical facts about that

4

investigation.

5

Those facts are objectively -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm sorry that I don't

6

have that appendix with me now, but as I recall the

7

Eleventh Circuit was not making any independent

8

determination of its own, but it was reporting what the

9

senior lawyer -- his view of it.

10
11

They were not making a

fact-finding as a tribunal.
MR. SCANLON:

With all due respect, Justice

12

Ginsburg, if you look at the Eleventh Circuit decision

13

at this critical point, there is no reference to Mr.

14

Dozier, who is the senior lawyer.

15

to are the State court findings, which they say at 57a

16

are amply supported by the record.

17

that they did an investigation, that it was adequate,

18

and in fact, the State has now abandoned that position.

19

What the reference is

Those findings were

The State no longer claims that these

20

lawyers did any investigation at all.

21

they looked at the Kirkland report and made a decision

22

then and there to terminate any investigation, and that

23

-- that of course would be a violation under (d)(1).

24

But you first have to get to the fact issue, whether

25

they did an investigation in the first place.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. SCANLON:

You don't have the cite
It's in

I'm sorry, I don't have the

F.2d cite.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could you clarify one -

could you clarify one thing for me?
I understand that you can understand the

10

record as indicating that they made a reasonable

11

strategic decision not to let that report come in or

12

make these arguments at the guilt stage, but the

13

separate question is whether, did they also decide, make

14

the same decision with respect to the penalty phase?

15

And if they did, were they assuming that the Kirkland

16

report would become a part of the record at the penalty

17

stage as it would have at the guilt stage if it came in?

18

MR. SCANLON:

Well, I think your question is

19

-- is right on point, because what Mr. Dozier was

20

thinking about when he said it didn't merit further

21

inquiry was the guilt phase.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

MR. SCANLON:

Right.

That's what he was focused on.

24

He -- he designated to Mr. Trotter, the junior lawyer,

25

the penalty phase, and therefore the fact that they
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't make that decision is clear, because two months

2

later Mr. Dozier himself is going to the trial court

3

with Mr. Trotter and asking for psychological

4

evaluations and other reports.

5

Mr. Trotter, before the trial, says:

Your

6

Honor, we have not investigated this; it needs further

7

assessment.

8
9

So clearly JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That, what you said so

far, leaves out one thing; that is, I thought that

10

Dozier had said:

11

report, and it's of interest to us for three purposes,

12

the two that were relevant to the guilt phase and the

13

one, mitigation, that was relevant to the penalty phase.

14

We need, we have to get this Kirkland

That suggests that in his mind, in Dozier's

15

mind from the start, was both phases, the guilt phase

16

and with respect to mitigation.

17

the report and, having said, we should see if there's

18

any leads to mitigation, then he next says, we're not

19

going forward with this.

20

MR. SCANLON:

And then he looked in

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -

21

what Mr. Dozier said at that time was in response to a

22

leading question:

23

mind?

24
25

And he said:

Did you have the penalty phase in
Of course.

Now, what he actually did when he requested
the Kirkland report was to limit it specifically to
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

competency and insanity, and so -- but even if Mr.

2

Dozier had that in mind, which I don't think the record

3

supports -- let's assume that he had that in mind.

4

he got the Kirkland report, it's obvious the State

5

agrees with it.

6

what's in the Kirkland report is an extremely strong

7

lead.

8

counsel were not able to simply not follow that lead.

9

Reasonable counsel would have seen that as a green

10
11

When

This Court's precedents show that

He has borderline mental functioning.

And

light, not a red light.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now this case, for me at

12

least, is terribly confusing, because I thought, reading

13

the cert position, that the Court granted cert to deal

14

with a legal question that has confused the lower

15

courts, that is, what is the relationship between (d)(2)

16

and (e)(1) of AEDPA?

17

MR. SCANLON:

Right.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now I read your brief and

19

I hear what you're saying so far.

20

you have a solid case under (d)(1); that is, that these

21

counsel were ineffective because they did not pursue

22

mental state mitigation.

23

It seems to be that

But that would be a much different -- that

24

would be a fact-bound case tied to this record, as apart

25

from the legal question:

What does unreasonable -- the
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(d)(2) unreasonableness, how does it relate to the

2

(e)(1) presumed correct, clear and convincing evidence?

3

I thought that that legal question was why we granted

4

cert.

5

MR. SCANLON:

And that is very central to

6

this case, and the reason it's central is because the

7

Eleventh Circuit got it wrong when they focused on

8

individual fact-findings, many of which were immaterial

9

to the claim, instead of looking at the entire State

10
11

court record, and so we JUSTICE ALITO:

But that's an entirely

12

different question.

13

the validity of the -- the conclusion made by the State

14

courts that there was a strategic decision not to

15

present this evidence until the -- the final judge stage

16

of the -- of the proceeding, and not whether there was a

17

reasonable investigation or whether they -- there was

18

reasonable performance overall at the penalty phase.

19

I think that's the question.

Did

It's purely this question of the validity of

20

a finding of historical fact and how that is to be

21

evaluated under -- under (d), under (d)(2) and (e)(1).

22

MR. SCANLON:

Right, and, if you look at

23

Eleventh Circuit's opinion, the majority opinion in this

24

case, what they did is, rather than look at the entire

25

record for reasonableness to see if the Petitioner had
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

shown that it was not reasonable, what they did was they

2

looked at individual fact-findings.

3

And -- and they said that those are not

4

rebutted by clear and convincing evidence; therefore,

5

it's reasonable.

6

And that's the mistake.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But let's just talk

7

about the -- the finding of -- by the district court

8

that there was no strategic reason and the -- and the

9

disagreement with that in the Federal circuit, and let's

10

talk about it just under (d)(1) -- just under (d)(1).

11

MR. SCANLON:

Okay.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you say that the

13

test is whether or not the -- that finding was clearly

14

erroneous?

15

MR. SCANLON:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

Is that -- is that another

way?

18
19

No.

MR. SCANLON:

No.

much more difficult than that.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think the standard is
I think the standard Why -- why is

21

"unreasonable application" different from "clearly

22

erroneous"?

23

MR. SCANLON:

I think it's -- I think

24

something could be incorrect, but it wouldn't be

25

unreasonable.

I think something could be erroneous, but
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4
5

it wouldn't be unreasonable.
I think that Congress made it clear that
(d)(2) was a deferential standard.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It has teeth in it.

Well, I'm -- I'm talking

about (d)(1).

6

MR. SCANLON:

Okay.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under (d)(1) -

I-- I beg your -- (d)( 2),

8

unreasonable determination of facts.

9

MR. SCANLON:

Right.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MR. SCANLON:

Yes.

Right.

And that is that

12

Congress said that a Petitioner has to show, before they

13

can go anywhere in their case, that that is objectively

14

unreasonable.

15
16
17

In the prior version of this statute, it was
much easier JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you -- you think there

18

can be findings that are clearly erroneous, but not an

19

unreasonable determination of facts?

20

MR. SCANLON:

I think that this Court,

21

certainly, in the context of (d)(1) has said, in

22

Miller-El, that there is a difference between something

23

being erroneous and something being unreasonable.

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

MR. SCANLON:

I'm talking about (d)(2).

I think it would -- I think it
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would apply there, too.

2

I think -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because the problem, as

3

Justice Ginsburg indicated, is that the courts of

4

appeals are looking for guidance as -- as to when we can

5

go into -- into these findings and set them aside.

6

MR. SCANLON:

Right.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

And it really is very

8

difficult for me to wear a "clearly erroneous" hat or an

9

"unreasonable determination of fact."

10

I -- I just can't

sense any difference there.

11

MR. SCANLON:

I -- I think the key

12

difference is this, Justice Kennedy, and that is that

13

when you have a "clearly erroneous" test -- or under -

14

under (e)(1), you're not looking at the entire factual

15

record.

16

And that's where the Court got it wrong in this case.

17

And what this Court needs to do is clarify several

18

things.

19

not mean that you have to show unreasonableness by clear

20

and convincing evidence.

21

this case, and the Eleventh Circuit has done that in

22

other cases.

23

You're looking at independent fact-findings.

One, that (e)(1) does not mean and (d)(2) does

That's what the Court did in

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do I have it right, in your

24

opinion, so far?

I'm just interested in the

25

relationship between (d) and (e), and as I read it, just
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to look at the language, it seems to me, in the (d)

2

case, we're talking about something that was decided on

3

a record in a State court.

4

And you -- you're the lawyer, trying to get

5

the Federal judge to say, that's all wrong.

6

going to say their facts are wrong, their fact-finding.

7

So you say:

8

light of the record.

9

Judge, that was unreasonable, you know, in
That's what you do under (d)(2)?

MR. SCANLON:

10

You're

Correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, (e) is a different

11

situation.

12

other -- and there are a few -- you are having a new

13

hearing in the Federal court.

14

(E) is a situation where, for some reason or

One reason for having such a hearing could

15

be that there was a factual predicate that couldn't have

16

been discovered and it's very important.

17

into that Federal court hearing.

18

in the Federal court hearing it turns out that in the

19

earlier State court hearing there was a fact-finding

20

that has something to do with this.

21

important, but it's over there and you want to get the

22

judge to ignore it.

23

So you're get

And now, when you're

It may be not so

So there you have to show what (d)(2) says.

24

You have the burden of saying that that was an

25

unreasonable fact-finding.

That's what it says.
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Those

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different words make -- seem sensible to me because the

2

proceeding is different, and the way we talk about the

3

proceedings is a little bit different.

4

practical reality, I guess they come to about the same

5

thing.

6
7

All right.

Now, forgetting my last comment,

have I got the first part right as you understand it?

8
9

But as a

MR. SCANLON:

I think that's right.

there's different evidence that's extrinsic to the State

10

court record, that is looked at in the Federal

11

evidentiary proceeding under -

12
13

If

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's -- that's what

the Ninth Circuit position developed by Judge Kozinski.

14

MR. SCANLON:

That -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The only problem with

16

that, it would shrink the province of (e)(1) very

17

considerably, because overwhelmingly Federal habeas

18

petitioners do not get evidentiary hearings in Federal

19

court.

20

So, if we accept the Ninth Circuit's view of

21

it, then (e) -- (e)(1) applies to a rather small

22

category of cases; i.e., cases in which there is an

23

evidentiary hearing in the Federal habeas proceeding.

24
25

MR. SCANLON:

But, Justice Ginsburg, (d)(2)

requires just as much deference, we believe, because of
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the -- the need to show that it's objectively

2

unreasonable, so -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm -- I'm not talking

4

about (d)(2) now.

We're talking about two provisions,

5

trying to make sense how do they relate to each other.

6

MR. SCANLON:

Right.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And one very

8

well-presented position is the Ninth Circuit's in Judge

9

Kozinski's opinion.

My only question is am I right to

10

say that his view, which is your view, would leave very

11

little work for (e)(1) to do if (e)(1) applies only when

12

there's new evidence coming in; it's not just the -- the

13

record that was made in the State court, but new

14

evidence coming in in the Federal habeas.

15

MR. SCANLON:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

There's There are not -- not many

cases.
MR. SCANLON:

There's less -- there's less

19

work to do, of course.

20

so, but no deference is lost because (e)(1) does not

21

apply to the other 90 percent of the cases, because

22

(d)(2), that standard itself -

23

It's ten percent of the cases or

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What you're saying is

24

(d)(2) is a vigorous standard, but, yes, your

25

description, unlike the opposing description of the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

relationship between these two -

2

MR. SCANLON:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Right.
-- does leave for (e)(1)

this maybe 10 percent of the cases, not more.

5

MR. SCANLON:

And -

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I go back to -

7

just to -- so that we're on the same page in my own

8

mind, what constitutes the State record?

9

the State amici posited situations in which the record

Because one of

10

before the State court on the issue that it made its

11

determination would be one subset of evidence, and that,

12

perhaps as the State process developed on another issue

13

there was another record developed, and you're pointing

14

to that evidence in your argument of unreasonableness as

15

a reason for the lower court's decision being wrong.

16

So your use of that other evidence, does

17
18

that go under (d)(2) or (d)(1)?
MR. SCANLON:

The other evidence -- if it -

19

if it's intrinsic to the State court record, then it

20

would be looked at under (d)(2), and the Petitioner

21

would have to show that, looking at all of that

22

evidence, the determination of fact was objectively

23

unreasonable only if the evidence is outside of that.

24

And -- and I think we agree, it's about ten percent of

25

the cases, but that's not insignificant for the role
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that (e)(1) plays.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does that seem -- does

3

that seem reasonable, meaning the State court is making

4

a decision based on what's before it.

5

foretell unknown evidence and bring it into its

6

equation.

7

on the evidence before it is correct.

Can't -- it can't

So one has to presume that its finding based

8

If there's additional evidence, whether it's

9

part of a record that's developed elsewhere, not part of

10

what it based its decision on, and if you look at the

11

language of (d)(2), it talks about the record on the

12

fact determined.

13

It doesn't talk about on the -

MR. SCANLON:

Yes.

And any new evidence

14

would be looked at under the clear and convincing

15

standard, whether that -

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're changing your

17

earlier answer to me?

18

amici were suggesting, which is that record has to be

19

defined narrowly, it has to be the facts before the

20

court?

21

You're going closer to what the

MR. SCANLON:

No.

I -- I understood your

22

question to mean that the facts were part of a State

23

court determination.

24

There were two different determinations, but they were

25

both in the State court proceeding.

It just wasn't the first one.

23
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure I

understand that, meaning often a trial court is

And if I may reserve the remainder of my
time?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could I ask a question?

Maybe you need a little extra time.

I want to be sure I

understand one thing.

17

unreasonable determination of facts was in this case,

18

either the decision not to go forward with further

19

investigation or that the results of the investigation

20

would not have been -- would have been -- would have

21

been prejudicial?

What is your view of what the

22

MR. SCANLON:

Well, those are both

23

unreasonable determinations of fact.

24

that they did an investigation, is what the Eleventh

Circuit ruled.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF COREY L. MAZE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10
11

MR. MAZE:

We made a

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Based on the Court's questioning so far, I

13

believe that I, as did every amicus, believe the

14

questions presented in this case are the actual

15

questions listed in the petition.

16

has an objection, I'm going to focus on the (d)(2)

17

question and how it interplays with (e)(1).

18

like to start with Justice Ginsburg's point about why

19

the Ninth Circuit opinion is wrong.

20

plain language, which was what we've discussed in the

21

brief -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. MAZE:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

So unless this Court

And I would

And other than the

I -- I didn't -

I I just want -- I just

described the Ninth Circuit decision.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

I didn't say it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was wrong.

2

MR. MAZE:

3

would say it's wrong.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. MAZE:

I apologize.

You're correct.

I

Because not only does it ignore

6

the plain language and, the point you made that it would

7

be 90 to 99 percent of the time it would cut it out, the

8

problem is is that position misses the bigger picture.

9

(E)(1) doesn't only apply when we're looking at (d)(2)

10

claims.

In fact, (d)(2) claims are a very, very small

11

percentage of what the States deal with in habeas work.

12

Typically what we're dealing with are (d)(1) claims or

13

claims that weren't even adjudicated on the merits in

14

the State court.

15

in the State court and we're looking at the procedural

16

default rule.

Let's say it was procedurally barred

17

If you're looking at applying the rule that

18

Judge Kozinski has forwarded in the Ninth Circuit, they

19

would say that (e)(1) is completely eviscerated if there

20

is no extrinsic evidence, even if we're looking at a

21

(d)(1) claim and even if we're looking at a procedurally

22

barred claim.

23

So -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't it -

24

isn't it the case that under (d)(1) or (d)(2) that's a

25

threshold determination, and once you get over that
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(e)(1) would have work to do in determining whether

2

there was a violation of the Constitution or laws in the

3

first place?

4

MR. MAZE:

Yes, (e)(1) is always going to

5

have an application.

We would say that it has an

6

application at the moment the petition is filed.

7

is, every single subsidiary finding of fact is presumed

8

to be true.

9

v. Taylor.

That

Let's take a (d)(1) example, Terry Williams
This Court said that you could overcome the

10

(d)(1) bar in Terry Williams because they had applied

11

the wrong law, they had applied Lockhart to Strickland's

12

prejudice inquiry.

13

So you jumped over the (d)(1) bar.

At that point you look at the claim de novo.

14

But (e)(1) still has application.

15

is every finding of fact that the State court made that

16

goes towards the prejudice determination is presumed to

17

be correct.

18

Its application is -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's under -

19

you've given yourself an easier case because you're

20

going -- you're getting over the threshold under (d)(1).

21

MR. MAZE:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Correct.
The problem is

(d)(2) refers to determination of facts -

24

MR. MAZE:

Yes.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
27
Alderson Reporting Company

-- and asks whether

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's unreasonable.

2

whole different test, and I -- I guess the difficulty

3

I've had is -- is reconciling the two.

4

you can articulate their differences, why would you do

5

both?

6

(E)(1) talks about facts and has a

MR. MAZE:

To the extent

And that is the difficulty.

7

Again, (d)(2) is very limited, the times we use it.

8

yes, it is tough because you see both a "clear and

9

convincing" and an "objectively unreasonable" standard.

10

But the way to fix the problem is not to cut (e)(1) out

11

altogether for every type of claim.

12

a way to be able to work (e)(1) and the (d)(2) standard

13

together.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. MAZE:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

It's to try to find

Well, what's an example?

Let's take this case I can't think of any -

give me an example -

18

MR. MAZE:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
-- where you're trying to

20

proceed under (d)(2), and (e)(1) is somehow relevant.

21

Couldn't think of one.

22

But

MR. MAZE:

Let's take -- let's take this

23

case, for example.

Let's switch the facts just a little

24

bit and let's say that the State court had made four

25

findings of fact.

The first one is all three counsel
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

read the Kirkland report.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. MAZE:

Uh-huh.

The second fact is that all three

4

counsel talk to each other for 4 days about the Kirkland

5

report.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. MAZE:

Uh-huh.

The third fact is Carey Dozier,

8

lead counsel, made the decision not to seek another

9

evaluation; and the fourth fact is is that Carey Dozier,

10

lead counsel, decided not to present the Kirkland report

11

or similar evidence to the jury.

12

facts that are presumed correct under (e)(1).

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

Those are your four

You just look at them,

14

and you look under (d)(2), and you say this is an

15

unreasonable determination of fact, period.

16

reason to go into (e)(1).

17

unreasonable determination of fact, he wins.

I mean, if it is an

18

MR. MAZE:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. MAZE:

21
22

There's no

The reason And if it isn't, you win.

The reason that you go under

(e)(1) is because Congress has said that you have to.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It didn't say that.

What

23

it says in (e)(1) is (e)(1) is talking about in a

24

proceeding instituted by an application by a person in

25

custody, the factual issue is presumed correct.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

But if

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you fail to develop -- - you know, in a proceeding, it's

2

presumed correct.

3

You're right it doesn't say it literally.

4

But I can't figure out an application for it unless

5

they're talking about where there is a new hearing.

6

Otherwise there is just no need for it, it is just

7

repetitive and it gets people mixed up, and (d)(2) does

8

all the work.

9

MR. MAZE:

Again, the problem is, is because

10

we're looking at an (e)(1)-(d)(2) situation, but that's

11

not the only situation.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me give you an

13

example involving exactly those two provisions and facts

14

very similar to the facts here.

15

that a strategic decision was made, and that raises a

16

question under (d)(2):

17

of the Strickland claim the result of a decision that

18

was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts

19

in light of the evidence presented in the State court

20

proceeding?

21

The State court finds

Was the State court's rejection

There are also a host of subsidiary findings

22

of historical fact because the attorneys testify and

23

documents are produced, and there are conflicts in the

24

testimony.

25

Dozier and Ralph talk about this on a particular day?

And so there's a question of did -- did

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Did Trotter write a letter to so-and-so?

2

So you've got all these subsidiary -- all these findings

3

of historical fact, and they are to be reviewed under

4

(e)(1), under the plain language of (e)(1).

5

MR. MAZE:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so forth.

Right.
And then after they're

7

reviewed under the plain language of (e)(1), you turn to

8

the question under (d)(2), which is whether the decision

9

about whether there was a strategic decision was based

10

on -- based on an unreasonable determination of facts.

11

MR. MAZE:

Correct.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

So there's no conflict.

13

MR. MAZE:

And Justice Alito, if -- the

No.

And Justice -

14

way you said it is exactly where I was going with my

15

hypothetical.

But -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. MAZE:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

I see that, I see that.

The fourth That's a possible way to

look at it.

20

MR. MAZE:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the problem I see with

22

that -- now I see why it's controverted, but the problem

23

with these standards of review, it just -- it mixes

24

people up, and it sounds as if you're bringing in a

25

hammer after you've brought in a saw, and the hammer
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

looks a little tougher than the saw, and -- but why get

2

into all this business?

3

MR. MAZE:

Because I would come back with

4

the saying that this is almost like having, because

5

(d)(2) is so limited in what we do, you have a toe ache

6

but you're asking us to cut the leg completely off.

7

mean, there's a much broader use of (e)(1) -

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

I don't understand that.

I thought that your -- your position in this case or at

10

least one of your positions is there was no unreasonable

11

determination of fact.

Period.

12

MR. MAZE:

Correct.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you're right about

14

that then you win, and there's no reason in the world to

15

go on to (e)(1), that this case in your view should be

16

totally governed by (d)(2), that is, the determinations

17

of fact were reasonable.

18

MR. MAZE:

End of case.

That is not the position we took.

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, we have one here, and

2

my real objection, I guess -- and it's interesting, I

3

now see the conflict, with Justice Alito's clear

4

explanation of it.

5

I would ask you then is, look, my objection to it,

6

hypothetically, is it's too complicated.

7

enough trouble trying to figure this out.

And I -- I suppose the -- the thing

8

MR. MAZE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Lawyers have

I agree.
Is there any reason we need

10

to interpret it that way?

11

be.

12

they're unreasonable, the State loses, and if they're

13

not unreasonable, the State wins.

14

simple.

15

The language doesn't have to

Why not have just a simple, clear thing?

Da-da.

If -- if

That's too

But why not use it?
MR. MAZE:

If the Court would come back and

16

say that (e)(1) applies when the petition is filed and

17

that if you're outside the (d)(2) claim -- (e)(1) is not

18

tethered to the introduction of extrinsic evidence, it

19

simply applies.

20

But then you came back and said in the

21

limited circumstances in which we have a (d)(2) claim -

22

not a (d)(1) or a procedurally barred claim, but a

23

(d)(2) claim -- if the Court came back and said we're

24

going to treat objectionably unreasonable as the

25

equivalent of clear and convincing evidence -- that
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

means if you can prove that something is objectively

2

unreasonable, it also proves by clear and convincing

3

evidence it's wrong -- then that would not be a problem.

4

But again, what we're saying to the Court

5

is, is if you say that, you need to also say that (e)(1)

6

is still not tethered to extrinsic evidence -

7

evidentiary hearings, because (e)(1) applies in a much

8

broader scope that just the (d)(2) question.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you don't

10

really want us to say that, because unreasonable, as

11

we've defined it in (d)(1), means it could be wrong, but

12

still not unreasonable.

13

MR. MAZE:

Correct.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if we say that proof

15

of a -- by clear and convincing evidence that a decision

16

by the State court was incorrect, you can't equate -

17

you don't really want us equating that with (d)(2), do

18

you?

19

MR. MAZE:

No.

Let me -- let me be clear.

20

I was asking Justice Breyer's question about how he

21

could write it.

22
23

I agree that our -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's why he -- that's

why he starting -

24

MR. MAZE:

-- right.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- from, I think what

34
Alderson Reporting Company

he's saying is, what your adversary responded to Justice

2

Ginsburg, unreasonable really is much broader than clear

3

and convincing -

4

MR. MAZE:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- evidence on

6

correctness.

decision is right or wrong is not the issue.

8

it's wrong, it could still be reasonably wrong.

9

You don't need it because whether the

MR. MAZE:

10

Even if

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, one could

11

quarrel with that proposition, but that's the state of

12

the law.

13

Justice Breyer's question, as I understand it.

14

So, why do you need (e)(1)?

MR. MAZE:

I agree.

That's -- that's

And, again, my position

15

is just what Justice Alito had said earlier, that's the

16

step-by-step way that we would approach it.

17

way -

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. MAZE:

Work it out in theory.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Work it out in theory.

22

There are -- you see, the difficulty with this case

23

is -

24

MR. MAZE:

I did.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- one factual matter,

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was a strategic decision made?

2

MR. MAZE:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

Right.
There are a bunch of

subsidiary facts that -- that were made.

5

MR. MAZE:

Right.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you're applying

7

(d)(2), the Court would look at all the subsidiary facts

8

and decide not whether they were correct or not, but

9

whether they were unreasonably incorrect, okay?

If they

10

weren't unreasonably incorrect?

So you don't have to

11

get to the correctness question by clear and convincing

12

evidence.

13

incorrect, the four subsidiary facts would then support

14

the fifth general question, correct?

If they're -- if they're not unreasonably

15

MR. MAZE:

Correct.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Either we agree it does

17

or it doesn't, but -- I -- I -- I don't understand why

18

you need (e)(1) because you never need to get to the

19

correctness of the finding.

20

MR. MAZE:

If I could finish the

21

hypothetical earlier, I think I can show how (e)(1) and

22

(d)(2) can both have effect in the same case.

23

Again, we talked about the four facts that

24

might lead to the strategic decision.

25

the State court record proves by clear and convincing
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Let's say that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence that the three counsel never spoke to each

2

other at all about the Kirkland report, and that has

3

been proved wrong by clear and convincing evidence, but

4

you have the other three subsidiary findings of fact.

5

Then you go to (d)(2).

You ask is an

6

objectionably unreasonable determination of the facts,

7

facts plural, which is how (d)(2) works, to say that a

8

strategic decision was made?

9

no, it's not objectionably unreasonable, because we

Well, the answer would be,

10

still know it's presumed correct that Mr. Dozier read

11

the report and he made the decision.

So -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

because I am trying to follow this here.

14

you have described would -- would support a conclusion

15

that it was not unreasonable to make a strategic

16

17

But what if one believes that it would have been

18

unreasonable not to pursue the investigation and -

19

and -- and to find out more facts for the penalty phase

20

trial, and the -- the -- the State court said, no, those

21

facts have answered the case.

MR. MAZE:

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would that violate (d)(1)

3

if even -- even if every one of the subsidiary facts was

4

correctly filed and the conclusion drawn by the court

5

was also correct, that it was a reasonable strategic

6

decision at the guilt phase but unreasonable at the

7

penalty phase?

8
9

How did -- what is the answer there?

MR. MAZE:

The answer would than under 2254

10

11

of Strickland to the facts that we have shown to be

12

correct.

13

presented, but the (d)(2) question is whether a

14

strategic decision was factually made.

15

Again, we don't believe that's the question

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It also has to involve

16

what the strategic decision was?

17

MR. MAZE:

Yes.

And if I may -

And -- and in this case,

18

the factual finding, the strategic decision was twofold.

19

The strategic decision was not to seek a further mental

20

health evaluation after reading and conferring about the

21

Kirkland report and not to introduce the Kirkland report

22

or similar evidence to the penalty phase jury.

23

the question of historical fact that you're making under

24

(d)(2).

25

can show by the record is not objectively unreasonable.

That's

And that determination of historical fact we

And if I may, I would like to move to

2

Justice Ginsburg's questions earlier about what in the

3

record or her point about what in the record shows that

4

Mr. Dozier was actually thinking about the penalty phase

5

when he made the decision.

6

the record that show he specifically had the penalty

7

phase in mind when he made the decision.

8
9

And there are four parts of

The first is what Justice Ginsburg had
pointed out, is that when he sought the penalty phase

10

about the -- the competency report, the Kirkland report,

11

on page 150 of the Joint Appendix he testified that one

12

reason was the fact he wanted mitigating evidence.

13

The second piece of evidence -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

Somebody said it was put

in his mouth, the question was on cross-examination.

16

MR. MAZE:

Well, point two was not put in

17

his mouth.

18

He was specifically asked, do you -- did you call any

19

witnesses in mitigation?

20

recall.

21

and so forth.

22

Point two is page 140 of the Joint Appendix.

And his answer was, I don't

I know that we talked a lot to psychologists

The specific question was, do you remember

23

talking to any witnesses for mitigation purposes.

24

the first thing that Mr. Dozier remembered was we did

25

talk to psychologists for mitigation purposes.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The clearest piece of evidence is page 283

2

of the Joint Appendix, and that is quote where Trotter

3

is asked about the Kilby -- I mean the Taylor Harden

4

report from Dr. Kirkland, and the part we keep quoting

5

is the fact he said that Cary Dozier came and told me

6

that we didn't need a further evaluation.

7

But what we haven't put in the brief and

8

brought up until now is the rest of the quote.

9

it's on page 283 of the Joint Appendix.

Again,

And he starts

10

off right after the dash saying he, meaning Cary Dozier,

11

determined that we didn't need any further evaluators

12

and no further recall because in the course of my

13

preparation, "my" being Trotter, in course of my

14

preparation for the penalty phase I would read things

15

about different psychological evaluations and had raised

16

that to him.

17

thought that that wouldn't be needed.

18

And again he looked at the report and

So at the moment Cary Dozier made the

19

decision and told to it Trotter, it was specifically

20

because Trotter had come to him and said, I am getting

21

ready for the penalty phase, just as I was told.

22

been reading things about having mental health

23

evaluations.

I have

On the page before, 282, he has just said

25

that, I could see issues, but because I was the young
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

attorney, I relied on the senior attorneys to resolve

2

them.

3

So he goes to Cary Dozier and says I have

4

read all of these things about mental health evaluations

5

for the penalty phase, should we do another one?

6

Cary Dozier, lead counsel of 22 years, criminal

7

experience on both sides, says, I have read the Kirkland

8

report, we do not need a further evaluation.

9

And

It was the very next month that counsel

10

filed a motion to exclude all psychological evidence,

11

and the reason was, as Mr. Trotter told the trial court

12

in the trial court record on pages 2 -- of 72 and 73, we

13

don't want the State to introduce evidence that he is

14

prone to violent behavior, prone to violent behavior

15

being the quote.

16

what evidence do you have that the State will do that?

17

He said the report that was done at Taylor Harden, that

18

being Dr. Kirkland's report.

19

And the trial court asked Mr. Trotter

So, here we are six weeks before trial they

20

are fighting to exclude evidence that he is prone to

21

violent behavior and specifically referring to the

22

Kirkland report.

23

Cary Dozier had told Trotter we will not have another

24

evaluation done because I have read the Kirkland report

25

and we are not going to do it any further.

think that was Justice Stevens' question, which was,

what was the strategic basis of a decision not to pursue

mental health information when everything you wanted to

19

keep out of the penalty phase would be coming at the

20

sentencing phase anyway?

21

MR. MAZE:

Let me see if I'm understanding

22

the question correctly.

You're saying that let's assume

23

that it was strategic not to allow the jury that gives

24

the advisory verdict that can turn into a mitigating

25

circumstance the ability to find out about the previous
43
Alderson Reporting Company

assault and all of his other prior assaults, but not to

seek a further evaluation in time for the judge, who

3

makes the ultimate sentence, that's your question?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. MAZE:

That's the question.

All right.

Under Alabama law,

you have one trial.

22

statute doesn't give you the opportunity, doesn't allow

23

for it.

24
25

All that the sentencing hearing in front of
the judge is for is for the judge to allow counsel to
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

give a final argument after the presentence

that it's correct.

4

We have had a Federal district court say

that, I believe that's unconstitutional, I don't think

6

you should be allowed to prevent counsel from presenting

7

new evidence in front of the judge, in the way you're

8

suggesting; but, again, that's open -- it's an open

9

question.

10

The point here is, though, that's not the

11

claim that was adjudicated in front of the state court,

12

and, again, this is AEDPA 2254(d).

13

determination made by the State court and, thus, the

14

only thing this court can hold the State court in error

15

for, is whether or not there was a strategic decision to

withhold it from the jury and whether that question is

17

prejudicial because what you would have to do -

the point of beginning.

summary form, your best interpretation of both (d) and

22

that the Federal courts should pay to State

23

determinations?

It seems to me that, if you use -- if you
reserve (e)(1) for cases in which there's a hearing in

the District Court, then it's somewhat counterintuitive

because the strongest standard applies to the accused.

He has the greatest burden, when the State hearing was

the least effective.

5

On the other hand, if they overlap, there -

then (d)(2) is often superfluous, so I have a choice of

something that is counterintuitive or superfluous, and I

don't know which one to take.

into the problem that Mr. Chief Justice had mentioned

earlier, about how (e)(1) applies to (d)(2).

And we ran

Here's how we believe (e)(1) works

of fact are presumed correct under (e)(1).

The next

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question you should answer should be will extrinsic

2

evidence come in, either under Rule 7 through

3

affidavits, et cetera, under Rule 8 in evidentiary

4

hearing.

5

If the answer to the question is, yes, we

6

will accept extrinsic evidence, then you accept the

7

extrinsic evidence, and you have the question this Court

8

couldn't answer last year in Bell v. Kelly.

9

10

How does

Now, let's say that you answer the question,

11

no, you will not have extrinsic evidence, which is the

12

case you have here, and you move over the 2251(d) bars.

13

If they're only arguing (d)(1), you don't have a problem

14

because you simply look at the application.

15

The problem runs in when you have a (d)(2)

16

claim with new extrinsic evidence -- with no extrinsic

17

evidence.

18

work and the way it will work all the way down the line,

19

no matter how the Court comes to it, is to say that the

until, in this case, the record evidence shows that

they're clear and convincingly wrong.

a (d)(2) violation because it's objectively

5

unreasonable.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

it doesn't seem to me there's any -- any contradiction

between the two.

(E)(1) addresses a factual finding.

10

Court, which was based on, sometimes, just one factual

11

finding, but, sometimes, many.

12

So you -- you proceed, first, with (e)(1),

13

and you -- you ask whether each factual finding on which

14

the decision was based was shown by the defendant,

15

either in the record, or if -- if you have an additional

16

hearings, by new evidence, to be incorrect by clear and

17

convincing evidence.

18

You do that fact-by-fact.

Having found, let's say, two of the five

19

facts.

20

say, okay, in light of the fact that two of the facts -

21

in light of the fact -- since two of the facts that the

22

court relied on were false, was the decision vitiated by

23

that reason, or was it nonetheless a reasonable

24

determination?

25

To fail that test, you then go up to (d)(2) and

I mean, once you focus on the fact that
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. MAZE:

I think that, in two minutes,

you've said it better than I did JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's so, why would we

7

not soon have what I call the habeas corpus

8

jurisprudence of what is a subsidiary and what is a

9

major fact and what is a finding?

10

And what's wonderful about that is no habeas

11

corpus proceeding will ever end because, throughout the

country, people will make mistakes about what is the -

13

what is the subsidiary and the subsidiary to the

14

subsidiary, and then what is the more general, and

pretty soon, we'll have all -- everybody will be arguing

about that, and there will only be four professors in

what's a subsidiary finding, and Justice Scalia, the

points you made, it's actually very difficult, because

MR. SCANLON:

Yes, there is.

But in this

2

case, I want to make it clear that whatever the standard

3

the Court adopts in this case, the Petitioner has

4

clearly made its case, because there was evidence.

5

never did any investigation when they had this strong

6

lead.

7

anything, means that you have to make an informed

8

decision after an investigation.

9

was no investigation.

They

And Strickland and Wiggins, if they mean

10

And in this case there

They now concede that, and there was no

11

reasonable decision made that the investigation should

12

be limited.

13

They simply found the wrong facts.

14

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

18

And the Eleventh Circuit got that right.

Thank you, Counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:04 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
