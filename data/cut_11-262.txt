ORAL ARGUMENT OF SEAN R. GALLAGHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GALLAGHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The issue before the Court today is whether

11

Secret Service agents who are prepared to take a bullet

12

for the Vice President must also be prepared to take a

13

retaliatory arrest lawsuit, even when they have probable

14

cause to make an arrest.

personal money damages against two U.S. Secret Service

16

agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory

motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched

MR. GALLAGHER:

-- U.S. Secret Service

2

agents who arrested him, allegedly with a retaliatory

3

motive, after he lied to them about whether he touched

4

Vice President Cheney.

5

these agents should not be held personally liable.

6

There are three reasons why

First, the absence of probable cause should

7

be a required element of a retaliatory arrest claim.

8

Thus, this Court is called upon to answer the question

9

that it left open in Hartman v. Moore.

10

Second, U.S. Secret Service agents acting in

11

their protective capacity should be entitled to a

12

qualified immunity when they make an arrest with

13

probable cause.

14

be to subject Secret Service agents to the potential of

15

retaliatory arrest claims based upon a mere allegation

16

of retaliatory animus, something this Court has

17

steadfastly refused to do, and for good reason:

18

retaliatory animus is easy to allege and hard to

19

disprove.

20

Indeed, to view it any other way would

Because

And, third, regardless of whether this Court

21

decides to extend the Hartman rule, the law in 2006, at

22

the time of the arrest was not clearly established, thus

23

entitling the agents to qualified immunity.

What was the probable cause for the arrest?

4

MR. GALLAGHER:

Justice Ginsburg, the Tenth

5

Circuit found that the probable cause that -- that

6

underlies its opinion was a 10001 -- a 1001 violation,

7

lying to a Federal agent.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Explain that to me.

that's not the reason -- 1001 wasn't the reason that

13

that the charge that eventually was made in the State

court was harassment.

They -- there was a

That's an

objective -JUSTICE BREYER:

That -- we've never held

19

that in respect to a claim that the real reason the

20

police arrested was retaliation against, for example, a

21

picket sign having an unpopular point of view or a

22

statement having an unpopular point of view.

23

this Court has never held that it overcomes an arrest

24

where there's a claim of retaliatory First Amendment

25

action; is that right?

Alderson Reporting Company

That is,

Official

7
1

MR. GALLAGHER:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right, and -All right.

And what you're

3

saying is your first reason is that we should say that.

4

And the -- the question I wanted to ask you there is,

5

you make a very strong case where the President and Vice

6

President are involved, the need to protect them, but

7

the rule that you there adopt is a rule that will apply

8

to every police officer, anyone who arrests anyone

9

anywhere in the country, and no matter how clear it is

10

that the motive was retaliation against a point of view,

11

that individual will be protected from a Bivens action.

12

So, it sounds as if your first claim -- the

13

remedy sweeps well beyond the need that you sketch.

14

so, I'd like your response to that.

15

MR. GALLAGHER:

And

Justice Breyer, I think it

16

has to do with the determination in the Tenth Circuit

17

and the fact that the -- the Tenth Circuit's decision to

18

extend Devenpeck to these facts was not the subject of a

19

cross-appeal.

20

not an issue that's before the Court.

21

So, the issue that you -- you posit is

JUSTICE BREYER:

It was --

I understand that.

I'm

22

just saying if I agree with you on your first that if

23

there is a probable cause for an arrest, then wouldn't I

11

your case, or should I do that?

12

So, therefore, is there another way you might win

MR. GALLAGHER:

Well, let me answer both of

13

those questions.

What you've outlined is essentially

14

footnote 10 from the Hartman case.

15

that says what do you do if the -- if the person that

16

initiated the prosecution says, I did it for a -- a

retaliatory reason?

That's the footnote

And the Court side-stepped that

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. GALLAGHER:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And, of course, Hartman

22

dealt with prosecutions.

But people all the time don't

23

arrest others.

24

for everything they might arrest them for.

25

Policemen frequently don't arrest people

I don't know that it's any less frequent than --

And Justice --

20

Justice Breyer, I think that the difficulty with your

21

hypothetical is, especially with regard to Secret

22

Service agents, who perform -- when they're engaging in

23

their protective functions, they're essentially --

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. GALLAGHER:

Counsel, that --

-- in the public eye.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's exactly what

2

Justice Breyer is saying.

Okay?

Which is, as I

3

understand it -- and there's some literature that talks

4

about should we be treating misdemeanor arrests

5

different than felony arrests, because there's less

6

discretion that an officer would have with respect to

7

arresting someone for a felony than for misdemeanors or

8

criminal fines, because like jaywalking, policemen don't

9

arrest you for jaywalking unless they're either on a

10

ticket binge or because there's something about you that

11

they don't like.

12

MR. GALLAGHER:

Sure.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, if that something

14

about you they don't like is that you're wearing an

15

antiwar armband, are we going to let that plaintiff not

16

recover, because somehow we need to protect police

17

officers so much, in the discretionary use of this vast

18

power they have to arrest that we're going to permit

19

them to trample the First Amendment, essentially?

20

Or are we going to say, in the normal

21

situation there is a First Amendment claim, even with

22

probable cause, if you can prove that it's the

23

motivating factor for the arrest; but we treat Secret

24

Service differently?

25

And I think that was the point

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

Justice Breyer's getting to, and the one I'm most

2

interested in.

3

MR. GALLAGHER:

Okay.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we don't extend.

5

Hartman, how do we in a principled way deal with the

6

unique needs of the Secret Service?

7

MR. GALLAGHER:

Let me -- let me briefly

8

address the first half of the question, and then I'll

9

address the second half.

The first half, when --

10

Justice Sotomayor, when you suggest that police officers

11

could trample on the First Amendment, it's important to

12

remember we still have probable cause as the -- as the

13

principal picture here.

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you're jaywalking,

there's probable cause.

16

MR. GALLAGHER:

But probable cause is the

17

Fourth Amendment standard specified by the Framers of

18

the Constitution.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- but what does it

20

have to do with violating the First Amendment?

21

if police officers have discretion and they would not

22

otherwise arrest you except for their dislike of your

23

speech, that's a violation of your right to free speech,

24

isn't it?

25

MR. GALLAGHER:

Meaning,

Well, I'm not sure that that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

is exactly the case.

2

footnote 10 in Hartman, which -- which, there -- Hartman

3

can be read two different ways.

4

saying that the elements of the constitutional tort

5

itself require the absence of probable cause, or it can

6

be read as saying the elements of the cause of action.

7

But let me -- let me address the second question.

8
9

Again it gets back to this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It can be read as

We can go to that

question later.

10

MR. GALLAGHER:

Yes.

And the second

11

question has to do with Secret Service agents, because

12

Secret Service agents, unlike police officers performing

13

law enforcement functions, when Secret Service agents are

14

acting in a protective capacity, they are protecting our

15

Nation's leaders and they are doing so in a very public

16

way, and they are also doing so in a way that is

17

essentially a free speech zone.

18

Virtually everyone that a Secret Service

19

agent encounters when he's protecting the President or

20

the Vice President can allege that they're engaged in

21

free speech.

22

particular, they -- they can legitimately evaluate what

23

someone is saying in order to determine a particular

24

threat level.

25

agents have a similar sort of complexity of causation to

So, for Secret Service agents in

And because of that, Secret Service

Alderson Reporting Company

13
1
2

the -- the situation addressed in the Hartman case.
Now, in Hartman, clearly it was a one -- it

3

was a two-individual causation situation, but with

4

regard to Secret Service agents, the causation is

5

similarly complex because Secret Service agents can

6

legitimately take into account what someone is saying in

7

order to determine a threat level.

8
9

Regardless of whether the Court decides to
extend the Hartman case, it's absolutely clear that the

10

law in 2006, in June of 2006 when the agents made this

11

arrest, was not clearly established.

12

was handed down in early 2006.

13

books about 3 months when the arrest was made.

14

reason, Secret Service agents should be entitled to a

15

qualified immunity in this case because the law was not

16

clearly established.

17

The Hartman case

It had only been on the
For that

With regard to the -- the formulation of

18

qualified immunity that we are asking for, we believe

19

that it is important for Secret Service agents acting in

20

this protective capacity to have the requisite breathing

21

room in order to make decisions in life-or-death or

22

imminent-threat situations.

23

immunity that we're advocating is particularly important

24

at the margins, particularly important in situations

25

where it's not clear what a Secret Service agent can do

In fact, the qualified

2

snap decision in order to determine whether someone's a

3

4

The Court in the Atwater case noted that the

5

object of -- of the Court's cases has been to draw

6

standards sufficiently clear and simple to be applied

of qualified immunity?

16

MR. GALLAGHER:

It's certainly different

17

from the Harlow type of qualified immunity.

18

immunity that is contingent upon having -- contingent

19

upon the Secret Service agent being -- acting in a

20

protective capacity and having probable cause to make

21

the arrest.

22

it would be -- it would be full immunity from a claim.

23

It is an

3

situation in which Secret Service agents made very --

4

very difficult decisions on the spot, and they should

5

not be second-guessed by the Court.

6

We think that this case aptly demonstrates a

Finally, with regard to the -- whether

7

qualified immunity is -- was clearly established in June

8

of 2006, the Ninth Circuit -- the primary case relied

9

upon by the Tenth Circuit was the Skoog case.

The Skoog

10

case was the case that the Tenth Circuit relied upon in

11

holding that Hartman should not be extended.

12

It's important, though, when you review the

13

Skoog case to -- to read the entire case, because the

14

Skoog court, after concluding that -- that Hartman

15

should not be extended, still proceeded with the

16

qualified immunity analysis to determine whether the law

17

was clearly established at the time of the incident.

18

And what the Skoog case concluded was -- it looked at --

19

it looked at the nature of the right.

20

And, you know, we know from the

21

Anderson v. Creighton case that this Court has said it's

22

important when focusing on constitutional rights not to

23

look at the 30,000-foot level, not to look at the high

24

level, but to look at the contours of the right.

that's what the Skoog case did.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, counsel.

All right.

Thank you.

Mr. Srinivasan.

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

I'd like to start off addressing the Secret

Service in particular because that's the principal

focus, although I take the point that there are

12

questions about applying the rule in a broader context.

13

But I think understanding why the rule makes sense in

14

the context of Secret Service agents and law enforcement

15

officers who are performing similar protective functions

16

would help inform why it makes sense to broaden the rule

17

as well.

18

What the Secret Service -I'll pick up on the point that Petitioners'

counsel was making, which is that it's legitimate in

this context for Secret Service agents to take into

21

account expressive activity in determining whether the

circumstances warrant a discretionary exercise of the

power to arrest.

3

you're talking about protective details.

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's correct.

So,

And that's

5

why I wouldn't limit it to the Secret Service in

6

particular.

7

contexts is that it's natural for these individuals to

8

encounter First Amendment activity by the public, and

9

it's legitimate for them to react to First Amendment

I think what happens in a lot of these

10

activity in deciding whether the circumstances warrant

11

an arrest.

12

And the problem arises because it's very

13

difficult to distinguish between, on one hand, a

14

legitimate consideration of expressive activity as

15

evidencing the sort of threat that warrants a response

16

from an illegitimate consideration of expressive

17

activity borne of a motive to suppress a viewpoint.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does your rule apply

19

regardless of the degree of animus that the agent is

20

alleged to have had as to the particular view being

21

expressed?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I think it would,

23

Justice Kennedy, because we would have an

24

across-the-board, no-probable-cause requirement of the

25

kind that the Court applied in the retaliatory

Alderson Reporting Company

18

prosecution context in Hartman.

2

Now, I think your -- the question of the

3

degree of animus asserted by the agent on the scene is

4

exactly why these are complicated factual questions.

5

Those kinds of allegations can be made, and then you're

6

going to have a trial where the agent is on the stand,

7

and the jury is going to have a very difficult time, and

8

the agent is going to have a difficult time explaining

9

why it is that he acted legitimately based on expressive

10

activity because he felt that there was a threat to the

11

person he was trying to protect, as opposed to

12

explaining that he didn't act in order to suppress the

viewpoint that was being asserted.

These kinds of allegations can often be

made.

16

the scene by an intelligent person who's going to be the

subject of an arrest.

18

question of causation is exactly why it makes sense to

apply this rule in the context of officers who engage in

12

this sort of critical public protective functions of the

13

Secret Service, I think we understand why it also makes

14

sense to apply it in other situations, because law

15

enforcement can legitimately take into account

expressive activity when they're engaged in functions

You say

To jaywalking, to

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Right, and I can understand

8

the basis for the nervousness.

I guess the question for

the Court is whether the benefits of having an

10

administrable across-the-board rule outweigh the costs

11

of trying to forge some sort exceptions to deal with

12

extreme hypotheticals.

13

And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you have a sense of

how many of these First Amendment retaliatory claims in

MR. SRINIVASAN:

We do.

We've done an unscientific

the Court used in Hartman, which is looking back

22

25 years, if you do a sort of standard Westlaw search,

23

what you'll see is there's roughly a hundred court of

24

appeals cases and 450 or so district court cases

25

where --

I'm sure it's in the millions.

It's -- a non-felony.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It's -- the -- I'm sure

7

there are scores and scores of arrests.

8

And, of course, all we're talking about is the cases

9

that get to the point where you have an opinion that can

That's correct.

10

be -- that can be found.

11

that, depending on what the Court does here, you may see

12

a proliferation of -- of those claims.

13

hope that wouldn't be the case.

14

And there's the obvious point

And we certainly

But I think on -- in -- on the question of

15

whether it makes sense to have an across-the-board rule,

16

I guess I would echo what Petitioners' counsel was

17

suggesting, which is you can have the same set of

18

considerations in the retaliatory prosecution context

19

because prosecutors do act with -- by hypothesis, with

20

illicit motives in some situations.

21

And the Court considered whether the

22

benefits of having an across-the-board rule outweigh the

23

costs of forging an exception to deal with extreme

24

circumstances.

25

have a rule that's designed to deal with the mine run of

And what the Court said was:

Alderson Reporting Company

We want to

Official

23
1

cases; we don't want to have a rule that has an

2

exceptional-circumstances exception because in that --

3

at that point, there will be a great deal of litigation

4

concerning what cases fit within of the exception and

5

what cases don't.

6

And what the Court said was that's rather

7

like designing a retirement plan to deal with the

8

possibility that someone might win the lottery.

9

in footnote 10 of Hartman.

That's

And I think similar

10

considerations would weigh -- counsel in favor of

11

applying an across-the-board objective,

12

no-probable-cause screen in this context as well.

13

think it's important to understand that --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I

Even though this -- I

15

think in Hartman, Justice Souter gave two specific

16

reasons, neither of which apply in this context.

mean, this is -- it's the prosecutor who institutes the

18

charges, but the suit is not against the prosecutor, who

would be absolutely immune.

20

picture.

I

So, that is not in this

Here we have one officer.

21

So, it would certainly be an extension of

22

Hartman because the reason that Hartman gave for the

23

rule was tied to -- very much tied to prosecution rather

24

than arrest.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I -- with respect,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

Justice Ginsburg, I think this case is of a piece with

2

Hartman in two relevant respects.

3

correct that Justice Souter's opinion focused on the

4

fact that you have two individuals in play.

5

have that situation here, but we don't base it on that.

6

Your Honor is quite

You can

What the opinion was getting to was that

7

that creates complex issues of causation in the

8

prosecution context.

9

causation that really drove the need to have an

10
11

And I think it was the complex

objective across-the-board rule.
You have the same kind of complex causation

12

problem here, for the reasons that I've explained, which

13

is that it's extremely difficult to disentangle a

14

legitimate desire to act -- to suppress danger, of which

15

speech is evidence, from an illegitimate desire to

16

suppress a viewpoint.

17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You might apply the same

immunity for selective enforcement based on race?

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The same immunity?
Yes.
No.

The -- they -- I think

22

the Court's decision in Whren, for example, supposes

23

that even though you have probable cause, you can have

24

an equal protection claim if the proof could be made --

25

and this is very important.

In the equal protection

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

context, including for race, there is a different

2

objective screen in place, and it's a stringent

3

objective screen that this Court announced in Armstrong,

4

which is that --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm aware of the

6

reservation in Whren.

7

in the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and First

8

Amendment speech?

9

Why should there be a difference

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think part -- part

10

of the reason is this, that in -- with the First

11

Amendment, expressive activity can legitimately be taken

12

into account precisely because it can manifest a danger,

13

whereas with race in the ordinary case, I think the

14

reason why we have these principles in the race context

15

is it's ordinarily not a relevant consideration.

16

And the Armstrong rule is designed to

17

distinguish between circumstances in -- in which race

18

was the motivation and in which race wasn't the

19

motivation.

20

doesn't work so well in this context, because here First

21

Amendment activity can legitimately be taken into

22

account; when, as in this case, a Secret Service agent

23

overhears an individual say that he's going to ask the

24

Vice President how many babies he's killed, it makes all

25

the sense in the world for the Secret Service to focus

And it serves that purpose well.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

crowd control?

4

as well.

5

there?

6

What -- what about for

You want to extend it to crowd control

What difference does the First Amendment make

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think it's -- the

7

nature, intensity, and vehemence with which the First

8

Amendment activity is being engaged in can inform an

9

officer on whether the circumstances present the kind of

10

danger that warrants a law enforcement response.

11

So, I -- and when a law enforcement officer

12

does that, he's going to be subject to potential

13

liability if an individual says:

14

reacting against me because of the way I was expressing

15

my views; you were acting -- reacting against me because

16

you disagree with my views and you wanted to suppress

17

them.

Look, you weren't

18

And that's a very hard thing to disentangle.

19

And it not only has that problem at the back end, but it

20

results in a problem at the front end as well, because

21

what happens at the front end is that officers at the

22

very outer margins might have in the back of their mind

23

a concern that if they acted based on their best

24

intuitions about what kind of law enforcement response

25

is warranted, they might later be subject to suit based

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27

on a mistaken assumption and potentially an ability to

2

convince a jury that they were acting based on an

3

illegitimate desire to suppress a viewpoint rather than

4

on a legitimate desire --

JUSTICE BREYER:

How many cases -- you might

19

we know that these kinds of interactions arise with some

20

frequency.

21

the --

22

I think there was some publicity surrounding

JUSTICE BREYER:

But when you looked up your

23

research for this, did you find any other case in which

24

anyone had ever asserted a First Amendment claim of

25

retaliation for an arrest?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

In --

Against a Federal

5

protective official.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I -- candidly, I didn't

7

-- we didn't conduct a search with that object in mind.

8

So, I can't give you an answer one way -- one way or the

9

other.

10

I did want to make one additional point,

11

Justice Ginsburg, in response to the question you posed

12

about the applicability of Hartman, which is that at one

13

level it applies, the rule should apply, because the

14

same concern with complex causation is at issue here at

15

well -- as well.

16

But the other way to think about the

17

applicability of Hartman is to -- is to put these cases

18

on a spectrum.

19

Hartman identified as a standard retaliation case, of

20

which the Court identified public employment as the

21

archetypal example.

22

retaliatory prosecution, where the Court thought that

23

there were sufficient concerns about complicated

24

causation that it made sense to have an across-the-board

25

objective rule.

On one end, you have what the Court in

And on the other end, you have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

Now, the question could be where does

2

retaliatory arrest fit within that spectrum?

3

the retaliatory prosecution side or is it on the public

4

employment side?

5

it fits decidedly within the retaliatory prosecution

6

side.

7

Is it on

And for a couple of reasons, I think

One is the one I've given, which is that

8

speech can legitimately be taken into account.

9

it creates complex causation.

And so,

But the other one is in

10

some sense the flip side of that, which is that in the

11

-- in public employment context, the standard fact

12

pattern is going to involve a long-term relationship

13

between an employer and an employee, during which time

14

there's been no adverse action; the employee then

15

engages in some sort of expressive activity, in the

16

aftermath of which the employer undertakes some adverse

17

action such as a termination.

18

Now, in that context it makes sense to infer

19

that there may well be an illegitimate speech --

20

speech-suppressive motivation at work, because you have

21

in some sense a control period in the interactions

22

between the employer and the employee that pre-dated the

23

expressive activity.

24
25

That's not the case when you're dealing with
law enforcement.

In the law enforcement context in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

main, this is a one-time interaction between an officer

2

and a suspect, the arrestee.

3

relationship that acts as a control.

4

to ask the question whether, based on that one-time

5

relationship, is there a basis for inferring that a

6

speech-suppressive motivation was at work?

7

You don't have the prior
And so, you have

And here, because it can be legitimate for

8

an officer to take into account speech in deciding

9

whether this situation is the kind of one in which a law

10

enforcement response is warranted, it makes sense,

11

unlike in the public employment context, to apply the

12

same objective across-the-board screen in the form of a

13

no-probable-cause requirement that you have in

14

prosecutions.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I go back to the

16

probable cause, the question I asked before?

17

like the taillight.

18

situation may well have warranted probable cause for

19

assault, probable cause for harassment.

20

-- but the 1001 was not the -- was in no one's mind.

21

does seem quite strange.

22

1001 came up in court.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

23

course, that's exactly what happens in the Fourth

24

Amendment context.

the Court in Devenpeck, and the Court explained in

It

Of

That's -- that was the issue before

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

Devenpeck why it makes sense to have an objective

2

probable cause inquiry rather than a subjective one.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But doesn't it matter

4

that it's something that comes up only in court; it's

5

not something that -- I mean, why wasn't the natural --

6

well, one would expect probable cause to arrest because

7

it was an assault or harassment -- the actual charges

8

that were made?

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't know the reason

10

that a -- I don't know the precise contours of the

11

harassment charges in State court that were made.

12

think that they mapped on in some measure to the

13

assault, the assault that was suspected by the -- by

14

Officer Reichle, who effected the arrest.

15

I

Now, I think the concern with importing some

16

sort of subjective probable cause dimension into the

17

inquiry -- if you asked, you know, what offense did the

18

officer in fact have in mind, it's the same concerns

19

that drove the Court to apply an objective rule in

20

Devenpeck, including, for example, that you would have

21

dis-uniformity, in that similarly situated individuals

22

would be treated differently based purely on what

happens to have been in an officer's mind.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. LANE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I think what we have here is a solution

being offered by the Government, and now we have to go

8

find the problem.

9

Justice Breyer's question was directed at here.

And I think that's what

I have done, not a scientific search, but I

11

can take credit for a little bit of science involved in

12

determining how many such cases arise.

13

of our brief, we cite in footnote 8 that a search with

14

no time limitations whatsoever going back in LEXIS with

15

the words "Bivens" or "1983," "retaliatory arrest," not

MR. LANE:

What's the animus?

Well, there were discrete First

case.

8

deposition, that when he first of all was approached by

9

Agent Reichle, Agent Reichle said, "I want to talk to

10

11

the invitation to talk to Agent Reichle.

20

legitimately take into account First Amendment activity

21

by someone who is in the vicinity of the President or

That didn't have anything to do -- that

is the Tenth Circuit's post hoc rationale under

10

there's any objective probable cause that the Tenth

5

Could it be side-stepped, by -- you know,

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One thing about your

7

analysis that concerns me is that you seem to have a

8

very black-and-white view of what's going on in the

9

officer's mind:

Did you stop -- did you arrest him

10

because of retaliation or was it because of legitimate

11

security?

12

And I suspect that the people engaged in

13

this type of thing have intuition.

14

sit there and say, well, let's see; is it because he

15

says he didn't like the war in Iraq, or is because he's

16

wandering around, looks like he's looking for something,

with a -- with a bag?

is that -- and, again, I know this is not an answer that

23

you're probably going to like, because this means a

trial is involved, but this is what juries do on a daily

25

basis throughout this country, in every criminal case.

Alderson Reporting Company

9

and Mr. Howards, none of whom saw any evidence of any

10

criminal activity by Mr. Howards, all of whom let Mr.

11

Howards walk away from the scene, that's good evidence

12

that --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One reason that I,

14

in fact, don't like the answer is because what the agent

15

is now going to have to factor -- in addition to the

16

hostility of the views, the touching of the Vice

17

President, the lying about it, the wandering around with

18

the bag -- is in the back of his mind, you know, if I'm

19

wrong, I may be held personally liable in damages for

20

taking some action that some jury somewhere is going to

21

say was based on retaliation rather than my obligation

22

to protect the Vice President.

23

MR. LANE:

Well, I mean, theoretically yes,

24

that could be a problem.

And I am quite certain that

25

certain civil litigants -- just as in criminal cases,

The only way I know to look for

search like that.

21

dug down into those cases.

23

That's not scientific, but that's the best I've got for

24

you at this point.

25

And Mr. Srinivasan
We did a

And there is no reason to put some different rule down

But this -- and I

The Secret Service has adequately

Presidents, didn't we?

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. LANE:

Well, they're doing the best they

11

can.

12

it is a serious, serious issue to curtail the First

13

Amendment.

14

I mean, that's -- I understand that.

But it is --

Consider the situation where you actually

15

do -- and I believe this is that case -- you have Secret

16

Service agents who deserve to be taken to a trial

17

because they have gone out of their way to punish

18

someone for their free speech.

19

What do you do about those guys?

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's ambivalent.

21

mean, suppose it turns out you have this trial.

22

what words were spoken.

23

Reichle is a strong opponent of the war in Vietnam.

24

Then, end of trial, right?

25

MR. LANE:

I

We know

we go back, if we get a trial.

what jury trials are all about, Justice Ginsburg.

I could lose this trial when

12

officers ostensibly enforcing litter laws and jaywalking

laws and blocking-the-sidewalk laws, and First Amendment

14

is essentially evaded.

15

And you'll have

A hundred years of jurisprudence, courageous

16

jurisprudence, many times by this Court, goes by the

boards because somebody is a litterbug.

see that as the solution to this problem, and I also

19

don't see that the Secret Service needs some enhanced

I just don't

The status quo is Mount Healthy.

It has

the job of law enforcement or these agents in any way.

3

And I don't denigrate

I'm simply saying that when the First

4

Amendment is at stake, I think -- and the law has been

5

working just fine throughout decades, to extend the no

6

probable cause in Hartman to on-street encounters where

7

there is no complex causation chain, where the main

8

actor in Hartman was immune completely from lawsuit --

9

the prosecutor in Hartman could not be sued under any

10

circumstances, nor could the prosecutor in Hartman be

11

questioned in deposition under our traditions.

12

question prosecutors in depositions about why they made

13

decisions to go ahead and prosecute.

14

stepped back in Hartman and said that's a different

15

story.

16

We don't

So, this Court

But on-street encounters -- if you extend

17

the no-probable-cause requirement to on-street

18

encounters, any rogue police officer, or Secret Service

19

agent, who wants to can ostensibly enforce any number of

20

legal violations -- 1 mile an hour over the speed limit,

21

you're going to jail allegedly for going 1 mile an hour

22

over the speed limit; or under Atwater, for not wearing

23

a seat belt -- when the real reason is your bumper

24

sticker.

25

If you can prove that, they should go to

Absent any further questions, I'll sit down.
