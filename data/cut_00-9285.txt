Mr. Wagner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. WAGNER


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10

MR. WAGNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


11

On April 3rd of 1992, Judge Foster dismissed


12

criminal charges against Timothy Hall.

13

docket, case removed from docket, defendant deceased, and


14

then signed her name.

15

that docket sheet was the name, Bryan Saunders, in big


16

letters, court appointed counsel for Timothy Hall.


17

She noted on the


3 inches above that reference on


On April 6th of 1992, warrants charging Walter


18

Mickens with the capital murder of Timothy Hall came


19

before Judge Foster.

20

Saunders and asked if he would receive the appointment on


21

that case.

Judge Foster telephoned Bryan


He accepted that appointment. 


22

This case presents this Court with the


23

extraordinary circumstances of a judge appointing a lawyer


24

to a death penalty case when that judge knew or reasonably


25

should have known that the lawyer represented the victim

1

at the time of the victim's death.

2

Walter Mickens has been deprived his constitutional rights


3

under the Sixth Amendment to conflict-free representation.


4

QUESTION:

As a consequence,


In the U.S. -- in the Public


5

Defender's Office, couldn't this situation arise fairly


6

frequently?

7

office would have represented a victim many years before


8

on a totally different matter. 


9

MR. WAGNER:

10

Sometimes in a small office, somebody in the


QUESTION:

Yes, it could.

All right.

Well, if it arises fairly


11

often, then what kind of a rule would you suggest?

12

mean, does it mean that they have to -- public defenders


13

have a hard time.

14

they -- they can't have a thousand people in their office,


15

and sure enough, some members of the people -- sometimes


16

this will happen.

17

suggest?


18

I


I mean, they -- they can't -- you know,


So, what kind of rule would you


MR. WAGNER:

Well, the rule that's in place


19

here, the rule from Holloway v. Arkansas, the rule from


20

Cuyler v. Sullivan, the rule from Wood v. Georgia, is an


21

appropriate rule, and it's appropriate because it requires


22

that the trial judge or the -- or the judge in the case


23

knows or reasonably should know that there is, in fact, a


24

particular conflict.

25

QUESTION:

So --

But, Mr. Wagner, what difference

1

should it make from the point of view of the defendant


2

whether the judge knew or the judge didn't know?

3

a sharp distinction between this case where the judge


4

knew.

5

didn't know.

6

cases he doesn't know. 


You make


But suppose Mickens didn't know and the judge


7

Why should Mickens be worse off?

MR. WAGNER:

In both


Well, in Holloway v. Arkansas, this


8

Court announced a rule which if a defense attorney


9

presents to the court an objection on the basis of a


10

conflict of interest, and the court fails to inquire into


11

that conflict, then prejudice is presumed.

12

of the Holloway decision was on the court's responsibility


13

to inquire into that conflict.


14

QUESTION:

And the focus


But I was asking you what the rule


15

should be, not the rule -- I probably wasn't specific


16

enough.

17

if we were starting from scratch and you had a lawyer in a


18

-- in a public defender's office who many years before had


19

represented a victim, what should the rule be about


20

whether he can represent this person before him? 


21

I can't necessarily reconcile all the cases.

MR. WAGNER:

Well, the rule should be, first of


22

all, if the -- if the court knows or reasonably should


23

know --


24
25

QUESTION:

So,


Forget whether the court knows or


doesn't know.

QUESTION:

That doesn't help me.

If the facts

are that many years before the person represented the


9

victim on a different matter.

10

Now, what kind of a


standard is the judge supposed to apply? 


11

MR. WAGNER:

If the -- the attorney is compelled


12

to refrain from doing something because of his ethical


13

obligations to the victim, if there's that compulsion by

that defense attorney where he can't do certain things for

his --

QUESTION:

Fine.

I got it.

That's helpful.


17

Then why not just say, and that's what you have


18

to do here?

19

your client was significantly harmed in the way you just


20

said because his lawyer couldn't do a proper job given the


21

preceding representation.

22

would take care of all these cases just as you say.


23

The judge should look into whether or not

in this case had conducted that inquiry properly and had

QUESTION:

lose; if there isn't that prejudice, you don't.


10

MR. WAGNER:

Well, because this Court has -- has


11

provided that there's a fundamental right to conflict-


12

free representation.

QUESTION:

Didn't -- didn't the district court

find against you on the -- on the point of whether there

was an adverse effect?

MR. WAGNER:

But that's not what the question before the

Court is.

They did in fact, Your Honor.

whether, in addition to a Sixth Amendment violation, you

have to show an adverse effect.

MR. WAGNER:

3

All we need to show here is an actual


QUESTION:

But your answer to Justice Breyer --


4

correct me if I'm wrong -- was that there had to be some,


5

at least strong possibility of adverse effect in the


6

instance where he represented the victim years before.


7

MR. WAGNER:

And that's exactly what


8

distinguishes actual conflict from adverse effect.

With

an actual conflict, there's a compulsion to refrain from


10

doing something.

11

lapse in representation, and -- and that's a significant


12

difference --

Well, I would suggest --

And -- and that's quite different


19

from a case where there's multiple representation over the

defendant's -- over the counsel's objection.

could say that in that line of cases, prejudice is

apparent from the record.

MR. WAGNER:

This is an astounding

Yes, but Holloway and Cuyler were


16

both multiple representation cases where the trial court

could see the whole thing right before him at that time. 


18

This was not a multiple representation case.

MR. WAGNER:

2

QUESTION:

May I ask if -- if in your view would


3

everything have been satisfactory, as a constitutional law


4

matter, if the judge had said, go ask your client if the


5

client has any objection, and the client had said, no, I


6

have no objection?

7

Would that have taken care of it?


MR. WAGNER:

Well, I believe that the court


8

should have indulged in some inquiry of the client


9

himself.

The court should have asked the client if he


10

understood everything that was involved in waiving that


11

conflict.

12

And in this situation --

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

You're -- you're

presuming a conflict.

argument for that -- whether the judge had an obligation


15

to inquire into a conflict about which he knew or should


16

have known.

existence of a conflict, but simply that this defendant --


18

that the deceased had previously been represented by


19

counsel who's representing this defendant.

constitute a conflict. 


21

I -- I really don't follow your


What he should have known was -- was not the


That does not


The -- what follows from that -- from that


22

relationship?

Does anything follow other than the fact


23

that the lawyer cannot, in -- in a subsequent


24

representation, disclose any confidential information


25

which he learned in the prior representation.

Right? 


1

Isn't that the only thing that follows? 


2

MR. WAGNER:

Well, it is that, but there's also


3

ethical consideration 4-5 of the Virginia Code of


4

Professional Responsibility which states that anything


5

obtained by Mr. Saunders through his representation of


6

Hall could not be used to Hall's disadvantage. 


7

QUESTION:

That's fine, but that doesn't show a


8

conflict.

That shows at most the potential of a conflict,


9

and -- and you're representing it here as though there is


10

a conflict and -- and the judge had an obligation to


11

inquire into it.

12

there was a conflict.

13

all.


14

But the whole issue is -- is whether


MR. WAGNER:

That hasn't been established at


Well, I believe it has, Your Honor,


15

and it's been established because Mr. Saunders in this


16

case obtained confidential information from Mr. Hall. 


17

That's clear from the record.

18

that.

19

was precluded from doing certain things. 


20

The district court found


And in preserving those confidences of Mr. Hall, he


QUESTION:

Would you -- would you say what they


21

were?

Because it seemed to me that some of the things you


22

listed were just matters of record and not at all -- there


23

was one conversation between this lawyer and the client. 


24

We know it took place for 15 to 30 minutes, and that was


25

it.

And a number of your recitations do involve matters

of public record that would not involve betraying any


2

client confidence if Saunders brought them out.

3

was it that Saunders knew that was not available to the


4

public? 


5

MR. WAGNER:

So, what


First of all, all of this happened


6

in -- in juvenile domestic relations court, and under


7

Virginia law, all of those files, all of that information


8

from that case was confidential and couldn't be revealed


9

to the public. 


10

But nonetheless, even if it was public, under


11

ethical consideration 4-4 of the Virginia Code of


12

Professional Responsibility, which governed Mr. Saunders


13

at that time, he was absolutely required to preserve the


14

confidences and secrets of Mr. Hall regardless of the


15

source or nature of those confidences --


16

QUESTION:

So what?

So what?

Why does that


17

constitute a conflict?

18

confidential information which he knew with something that


19

was relevant to the defense of his new client, there's no


20

conflict. 


21

MR. WAGNER:

Unless you connect up that


I want to get to that point, and


22

the point is that in death penalty cases, it's absolutely


23

essential that the attorney looks into the background of


24

the client.

I believe --


Well, they why do you -- why do you


stress the fact this a death penalty case? 


5

MR. WAGNER:

Well, I also stress the fact that


6

this is a sex case, Judge.

7

sodomy, and also in that type of case, it's absolutely


8

essential for the attorney to look into the background of


9

the defendant --


10

QUESTION:

This is a case of forcible


Well, isn't -- wouldn't that be true


in most criminal cases? 


12

MR. WAGNER:

It would be true that the -- the


13

attorney should look into the -- the background of the


14

victim.

15

true because of the sentencing phase in a death penalty


16

case.

17

the attorney needs to -- or the team of attorneys need to


18

look into the background of the victim, need to engage in


19

a -- in brainstorming about the background and an


20

investigation about the background.

21

couldn't engage in that brainstorming, couldn't engage in


22

that investigation because he had to preserve those

confidences, and he had a duty of loyalty to Mr. Hall.

argument, insofar as this case is concerned, pretty much


2

undercut by the fact, number one -- let's take an example. 


3

Let's take the issue that you -- you rightly stress about


4

the response to the victim impact evidence, the -- the

mother's testimony.

6

here by the fact that the information, on the basis of


7

which defense counsel could have responded to the mother's

testimony, had already been published in a newspaper? 


9

Isn't your case pretty much undercut


And isn't it also undercut by the fact that


10

there was co-counsel here and there is no claim that co


11

counsel had any conflict, actual or potential.

12

-- even if we accept your -- your premise that proof of


13

conflict would be enough in this situation, don't you lose


14

anyway?

MR. WAGNER:

So, if we

that that's contrary to what is -- is provided in the

MR. WAGNER:

I


So --


The district court, in fact, found


no prejudice, Your Honor. 


12

And -- and what we're saying in this case is,


13

first of all, to adopt the rule of Wood v. Georgia, the


14

rule where if we show an actual conflict --

QUESTION:

Mr. Wagner, may I stop you there? 


16

Because it seems to me, reading the Wood v. Georgia case


17

and those facts, in those -- in that case the actual


18

conflict and the adverse effect coincided.

in setting up a test case, then that very conflict would,

at one and the same time, establish the adverse effect.

Therefore, I could not take from the Wood case what you

are urging this Court to take.

25

If the lawyer


And if that's so, then the Wood case is in no

different category.

MR. WAGNER:

I understand, Your Honor.

And --


3

and if you look to the Cuyler v. Sullivan case, Cuyler v.


4

Sullivan very specifically draws out a test in which you

must show both actual conflict and adverse effect.

20

MR. WAGNER:

I don't believe that you

conflict situation, it's really the potential of a lapse

So --


Well, you are making a nice statement

in the abstract.

6

the Wood case, and I said, well -- you answered both


7

questions if the employer has a conflict -- if the lawyer


8

has a conflict because the employer's interest diverges


9

from the employee's. 


10

I'm trying to bring it down to earth in


MR. WAGNER:

Yes.

And in that case, the Court


11

did actually find -- in Wood v. Georgia, did find an


12

actual conflict, found that there were competing


13

interests, and sent it back to the trial court to

determine whether or not there was an adverse effect.

That's correct, but -- but it is

Are you -- are you arguing that we

should adopt that rule?

8

that would answer the point that has just been raised.


9

MR. WAGNER:

I mean, if we did, that would --


No.

I -- I believe that the


10

Holloway rule was extended in Cuyler v. Sullivan, but the


11

Holloway rule focuses on the court's failure to inquire.


12

QUESTION:

No.

But you started -- at least, as

I recall back in your brief, you started out by arguing


14

that what puts the court on notice doesn't matter so long

as the court is on notice.

16

raised it before the court, and you're saying in this

case, under the -- at least the rule that the court should

have known of the -- of the potential conflict, that was

the functional equivalent to counsel's raising it in

Holloway, and therefore the result should be the same.

You said in Holloway counsel

of the component of Holloway v. Arkansas that deals with

conflict and -- and the importance that that --

QUESTION:

So, you're -- you're -- maybe I -- I

MR. WAGNER:

QUESTION:

Well, but we're taking the case on

the assumption there's been a hearing and there's been

2

QUESTION:

So, I thought the key to your case


3

was the fact that the judge had a duty, when advised or on

notice of a potential conflict of interest, of making an

inquiry as to find out whether in fact there was such a

conflict.

7

I thought that's your whole case.

Now you're changing your position?

Well, I don't mean to change my

position, Your Honor, but a potential conflict in the

context of where we have it in the brief would -- would


7

essentially equal a particular conflict.

8

potential conflict --


9

QUESTION:

So, it is a


Well, but -- a very different


10

question.

You mean whenever there's a potential conflict,


11

if the -- if defense counsel had -- had represented the


12

victim 20 years ago on a totally unrelated matter, there


13

-- there's always some confidential information he might

have obtained.

The judge always has to inquire into that?


15

MR. WAGNER:

16

No.

17

QUESTION:

18
19

That's true, Your Honor. 


If -- but if the judge knows --

Well, how potential does potential


have to be then? 

MR. WAGNER:

Potential has to be, as Cuyler

describes, a particular conflict.

knows that there's some information that that attorney may

MR. HARRIS:

What the Court said in Holloway is


2

that relying on the representations of counsel that there


3

was a conflict of interest and that he would be unable to


4

examine his multiple clients, the failure to inquire into


5

that was itself error. 


6

And I think if you -- you can put Holloway into


7

the exact same terms of the Sullivan over-arching


8

standard.

9

advising the court that he sees a conflict of interest,


10

the fact that counsel tells the court, when they get to


11

trial, that he is not able to examine his several clients

because of the confidences he knows, that is, as -- as

do you think -- again, not necessarily a matter of

practice for the judge to inquire of the lawyer whether he

13

I think that is part and parcel of what Sullivan was

inquiries even on facts that may not be based on the

objection of counsel or the defendant. 


17

Certainly it would be a good practice. 


QUESTION:

Would you say it was unethical for

the lawyer not to have revealed to the court and his

in fact, a violation of the ethical constraints for the

Does the lawyer have a duty to advise

would want to know, as far as matters that may affect the

himself or his client.

lawyer who's represented the man that I'm accused of

would the judge have a duty to give him a different lawyer


19

as a constitutional matter? 


20

I would like a different lawyer.

MR. HARRIS:

No.

Would the --


I would say this, as this


21

Court pointed out in Wheat, the judge certainly has the


22

discretion, a very broad discretion at that point in time,


23

to anticipate the possibility of conflicts and to

substitute counsel on the risk, on the possible danger of


25

a conflict appearing later on.

QUESTION:

Going back to the earlier questions

about the counsel's ethical duty, as you understand it,

confidentiality?

MR. HARRIS:

After the close of the

representation of a former client, I -- I believe that the


18

general duty of loyalty devolves down to that duty of


19

maintaining the confidences of your former client.

20

is how the duty of loyalty is represented.

21

think we can impose a -- even an ethical obligation on


22

counsel to continue to have good feelings about a former

client or -- or this general notion of having once

represented an individual, he is forever subject to the

the lawyer doesn't normally tell him, just like any other

No, and that's not what I'm

QUESTION:

I think what

Justice Scalia was -- in any case, what I've been assuming

is what Justice Kennedy said a moment ago, that when

counsel in a multiple representation situation says,

that the conflict is so obvious that we'll take it as a

MR. HARRIS:

Expected prejudice basically.

If the


Well, we are giving a great deal of


weight to trial counsel's ability to know because he is


10

the only person that has the access to the confidences of


11

multiple clients who will know for certain, or at least


12

with a high degree of certainty, that there is going to be

a conflict and that it will affect the representations of

the various clients.

there is a difference, I think, in the circumstance where

QUESTION:

MR. HARRIS:

No. 

Why -- why not equate them? 

I think it is -- it is fair to say

that the trial judge's notice of facts that would cause


6

him to -- to perceive a -- the language that the Court


7

used was a particular conflict.

8

certainly imposes an obligation upon him to inquire into


9

it.

But the notice of that


But I don't think you can then say that having


10

knowledge of facts that would suggest an actual conflict


11

or even suggest a particular conflict can be equated with


12

the attorney's representation that it exists. 


13

QUESTION:

Okay.

The trouble -- the trouble is


14

if you follow -- I mean, I think I follow your -- your

argument.

16

nothing is really added to the law by saying the trial

judge has an obligation to inquire into it because when we

-- when we come at the -- at the question after the fact,

the trial judge hasn't inquired, there's been a trial,

there's been a conviction, then the issue of conflict gets

litigated.
