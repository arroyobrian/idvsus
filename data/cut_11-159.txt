CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 11-159, Astrue v. Capato.
Mr. Miller.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Social Security Administration has

11

reasonably interpreted the Social Security Act to

12

provide that, as a general rule, a person seeking to

13

establish eligibility for child survivor benefits must

14

show that he or she would have been able to inherit

15

personal property from the decedent under applicable

16

State intestacy law.

17

by the text, structure, and history of the Act, and it

18

comports with principles of federalism because it defers

19

to State law on the determination of family status,

20

which is a traditional subject of State regulation.

21

It's reasonable and entitled to deference under Chevron.

22

That interpretation is supported

Now, the textual arguments in this case

23

involve the interaction of three provisions of the Act.

24

And the first is section 402(d)(1), which is the basic

25

benefits-granting provision.

And that says that under

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

certain conditions, the child of a wage earner is

2

entitled to benefits.

3

cross-reference to a definition of "child" in section

4

416(e) of the Act.

5

page 4a of the appendix to our brief, says that the term

6

"child" means (1) the child or legally adopted child of

7

an individual, (2) a stepchild under certain cases, and

8

(3) a person who is the grandchild or stepgrandchild of

9

an individual.

10

And that provision has a

And 416(e), which is reprinted at

Now, I think the one thing that's

11

immediately apparent from looking at that provision is

12

that under anyone's reading, it's a little bit confusing

13

because it uses the word "child" twice to mean two

14

different things.

15

than the second, because the first one includes the

16

second as well as adopted child, stepchild, and so

17

forth.

18

That is, the first "child" is broader

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose a State legislature

19

got the crazy idea that children born to married people

20

during the time of the marriage shouldn't inherit under

21

State intestacy law.

22

ineligible for survivors' benefits?

23

MR. MILLER:

Would that mean that they would be

Not necessarily, because if

24

somebody doesn't qualify under -- and I should say at

25

the outset that that is unlike the law of any State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1
2
3
4

either in 1939 or today.
JUSTICE ALITO:

But what if they did -- what

if they did that?
MR. MILLER:

There -- there are two

5

alternative mechanisms that Congress added to the

6

statute in the 1960s to allow children who lack

7

intestacy rights to establish their eligibility.

8

are 416(h)(2)(B) and 416(h)(3).

9

an applicant who is the son or daughter of an insured

Those

And 416(h)(3) says that

10

individual but is not a child under -- under paragraph

11

(A), which is the reference to State intestacy law,

12

shall nevertheless be deemed to be a child if there was

13

an acknowledgment in writing that the child was -- that

14

the applicant was the son or daughter, or there was a

15

court decree for support.

16

So, I think --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Those are -- those are

17

obviously meant to deal with -- with children whose

18

parents are not married.

19

MR. MILLER:

That's right.

And the reason

20

for that is that, in fact, under the law of every State,

21

both in 1939 and today, children whose parents are

22

married do have State -- do have intestacy rights.

23

I think what the provision I just referred to

24

illustrates is that the term "child" in this statute is

25

a legal term of art, because if you were just looking at

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

6
1

the ordinary meaning of the word "child," the concept of

2

an applicant who is a son or daughter but is not a

3

child, would be completely nonsensical.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Maybe it means something

5

else.

Maybe it means that to the Congress that

6

initially enacted the predecessor of this provision a

7

child was a child.

8

type of child that I mentioned earlier was a child.

9

There wasn't a need for any definition of that.

They knew what a child was.

And the

And

10

they -- they never had any inkling about the situation

11

that has arisen in this case, just as they had no

12

inkling that any State would go off and take away

13

intestacy rights for children born to married people

14

during the course of their marriage.

15

MR. MILLER:

Well, I mean, I think -- I

16

think those are probably accurate factual claims about

17

what Congress was thinking, but had Congress wanted --

18

the way that Congress chose to make sure that the

19

children of married parents could establish their

20

eligibility was by looking to State intestacy law,

21

because Congress knew that under State intestacy law,

22

those children had such rights.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Isn't there something

24

sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in

25

the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

stepchildren and grandchildren and even

2

stepgrandchildren in which State intestacy law is not

3

referenced?

4

category, the category in which 90 percent of people are

5

going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to

6

State law.

7

But you're saying that as to the largest

MR. MILLER:

8

what section 416(h) says.

9

rule --

10

Well, it -- that's -- that's
Section 416(h) sets out a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose I'm not so

11

convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is,

12

because there are two sentences of -- of section (h).

13

I'm just asking you to provide a reason why Congress

14

would have specified everything about what -- how you

15

get benefits for stepchildren and grandchildren and

16

stepchildren, but not for the main category of people at

17

issue.

18

MR. MILLER:

Well, I think -- I think it's

19

because with respect to the main category of people at

20

issue, the question Congress was asking is:

21

class of people who are likely to have a sufficiently

22

close relationship to the insured person such that it

23

would be appropriate to provide benefits to replace the

24

loss of support that they would likely be getting during

25

the person's life?

What is the

And if you look at what is the body

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

of law that defines that class of people who have a

2

close relationship with someone, it's State intestacy

3

law.

4

easy-to-apply rules for the distribution of estates.

And State intestacy law sets out sort of clear,

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they don't

always do --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Miller, there's one

8

provision in (h) that's puzzling, and maybe you can tell

9

me what it means.

10

sentence of (A).

11

State law would have the same status relative to taking

12

intestate personal property as a child ... shall be

13

deemed such."

14

Someone who is not a child but has the same status as a

15

child?

16

It's at (h)(2)(A), and it's the last
It says:

"Applicants who according to

What person is that referring to?

MR. MILLER:

That -- that's right.

The

17

first sentence sets out the general rule that you look

18

to State law for the definition of "child."

19

second sentence says that people who do not have the

20

status of children but nonetheless have the inheritance

21

rights of children shall be deemed children.

22

practical matter, the people that that applies to are

23

people who have been equitably adopted.

24
25

And the

And as a

There's a doctrine in the law of many States
where you have an adoption -- or you have an agreement

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

to adopt, but not yet a completed legal adoption.

2

that circumstance, the would-be adoptee does not have

3

the status of a child for all purposes or even

4

necessarily for all inheritance law purposes, but can

5

take property from the adopting parents.

6

would be covered by that sentence, and that's now

7

addressed in the regulations at --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, that's who

Anyone else or just that

category?

10
11

In

MR. MILLER:

I think -- I think that is

the -- the most likely category that it would apply to.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel --

I'm sorry.

Go ahead.

You said earlier

15

that the State intestacy law provides clear rules, but I

16

assume that's not always the case, particularly with all

17

this new technological advancement.

18

situations where you can't tell what State intestacy law

19

provides.

20

Administration do in that case?

21
22
23

There must be

And what does the Social Security

MR. MILLER:

The Social Security

Administration tries to apply State law.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

And -My hypothetical

24

is that there's no clear answer.

I mean, let's take a

25

situation where this type of reproduction is -- is new,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

and the State legislatures haven't had a chance to

2

decide whether they want to recognize the offspring for

3

State intestacy law or not.

4

MR. MILLER:

What would SSA do?

Well, the SSA does the best

5

that it can to figure out what the State law is, and

6

then on review in the district court, you know, the

7

district court is able to review that.

8

been cases in which district courts have certified

9

questions to State courts.

And there have

And I think actually the

10

fact that there are those difficult questions that can

11

come up in some of the cases, particularly involving

12

assisted reproductive technology, really illustrates one

13

of the virtues of leaving it to the States rather than,

14

as Respondent would have it, effectively forcing SSA and

15

then the Federal courts on review of its decisions to

16

create a sort of Federal common law of parentage to

17

resolve all of those very difficult questions.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There was in my memory,

19

and it's been a while, that some States, if not all --

20

and that's what I was going to ask you -- basically deem

21

any child born during the marriage to be a child of the

22

marriage, whether it's a biological child or not, so

23

that if a mother has had a relationship outside of

24

marriage, the married parent's still responsible for

25

that child.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

That would take care of, I think, a great

2

number, wouldn't it, of the new technology births that

3

occur without perhaps the input of one of -- the

4

biological input of one of the parents?

5

MR. MILLER:

That -- that's right.

6

fact, there are statutes in a number of States

7

addressing the question of when a -- yes.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

do all States have similar rulings?

And, in

My question was,
And for those that

10

don't, what happens to a child that's been born with, as

11

Justice Roberts said, as the Chief said, with new

12

technology?

13

their definition -- of whether they'll be considered a

14

child for Social Security purposes?

15

MR. MILLER:

What happens to that child in terms of

I -- I can't speak with

16

certainty to all of the States, but I believe that that

17

is the -- the general rule.

18

any States where, when you have a married couple using

19

donor -- donor sperm, that the child would not be

20

deemed the child of the husband.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, I'm not aware of any --

My impression is that, I'm

22

not sure it's by statute, but just by judicial decision,

23

a child born in the marriage is a child of the marriage

24

unless -- unless the child is repudiated by -- by the

25

father.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

MR. MILLER:

I believe that is -- that is

2

the general rule.

3

illustrates, of course, is that Respondents' definition,

4

which is also the court of appeals' definition, of what

5

a child is and the definition that they urge the Court

6

to apply in 416 is the biological child of married

7

parents.

8
9

And I think one thing that that

And not only is the -- does the "married"
part of that not comport with the ordinary understanding

10

of "child," because of course in ordinary usage whether

11

somebody is a child doesn't depend on whether their

12

parents are married, but the biological part also does

13

not comport with legal usage because, both in 1939 and

14

today, there are many cases in which biological

15

parentage is not determinative of legal parentage, both

16

for the reason that we were just talking about and then

17

also for -- another example is when you have an

18

adoption; a child who has been adopted by somebody else

19

is no longer legally the child of his biological

20

parents.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would you tell me if -- if

22

the Capato twins are both found to be -- be children

23

within the meaning of the Act, will they meet the

24

dependency or the deemed dependency requirements?

25

that a back-up argument that you have?

Alderson Reporting Company

Or --

Or is

Official

13
1

MR. MILLER:

We -- that -- that would be a

2

question for the agency to address in the first

3

instance.

4

the administrative process here.

5
6
7

The agency has not addressed that question in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, we are not --

It -- it was addressed in

the Ninth -- in the Ninth Circuit decision, wasn't it?
MR. MILLER:

That's right.

And the Ninth

8

Circuit read the dependency provision of the Act to say

9

that any legitimate child is deemed to be dependent, and

10

it then conducted an examination of legitimacy under

11

California law.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

on that here?

14

by the agency?

15

You don't have a position

Or -- you want that to be elaborated more

MR. MILLER:

That -- that's right.

I mean,

16

I -- what I will say is, just speaking in general terms

17

about dependency, the statute creates a number of

18

presumptions that allow basically any -- any natural

19

child, any child under the -- that first -- that second

20

child in 416(e)(1), anyone who fits into that category

21

is deemed to be dependent.

22

turn on -- on factual dependency, which is obviously not

23

present in --

24
25

So, it doesn't necessarily

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Rebuttable presumption

or irrebuttable?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1
2

MR. MILLER:

dependency for anyone who qualifies is irrebuttable.

3
4

The presumption in favor of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you rely only on that

-- on that definition.

5

The section is entitled "Old-age and

6

survivors insurance benefit payments," and it also

7

provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits

8

if, among other things, (C) was dependent upon such

9

individual, (i) if such individual is living at the time

10

that the application was filed, (ii) if such individual

11

has died at the time of death, or (iii) if such

12

individual had a period of disability, et cetera, et

13

cetera.

14

It seems to me -- is the word "survivor"

15

used anywhere in the text of this statute except in

16

the -- in the heading of this section?

17

MR. MILLER:

I don't -- it doesn't appear in

18

any of the -- the operative definitional provisions, but

19

I would certainly agree with you that it is --

20
21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We use titles to determine

the meaning of ambiguous provisions later, don't we?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, and I certainly would --

23

would agree with the -- the idea that it is difficult to

24

describe someone as a survivor who was not alive at the

25

time that -- or not --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

meet the requirements of (C), would he?

3

any of the requirements of (C)?

4

MR. MILLER:

Nor would -- nor would he
Would he meet

Of (d)(1)(C).

The dependency requirement is

5

defined in 402(d)(3) and -- which unfortunately is not

6

reproduced in the appendix, but which has the effect of

7

making anyone who qualifies under 416(h) be deemed

8

dependent.

9

this case qualify under 416(h).

10

Now, we don't think that the children in

even any need to reach the dependency question there.

11
12

So, there's no -- not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then what does -- what does

(d)(1)(C) do if it's all washed out by --

13

MR. MILLER:

Well, the dependency

14

requirement is something that people who don't qualify

15

under 416(h), people who are adopted children or

16

stepchildren or grandchildren, may in some cases have to

17

make an individualized determination of actual

18

dependency.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it doesn's say ­ it

20

says every child as defined in 416(e) has to meet that

21

requirement.

22

If such -- such child, the one defined in (e).
MR. MILLER:

Right, but then -- but then

23

402(d)(3) says a child shall be deemed dependent under

24

certain circumstances that effectively track the 416(h)

25

analysis.

And I -- I would refer you on that point to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

the agency's regulations defining dependency, which are

2

404.361, which say that any natural child -- which is

3

the term the agency uses for that second child in

4

416(e) -- any natural child is deemed dependent.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now --

Can I ask --

6

Justice Scalia said that the statute is ambiguous.

Is

7

that your position?

8

definition of "child" is ambiguous and that we have to

9

give the agency deference, or is it your position that,

Is it your position that the

10

in context, it's unambiguous and even if the Social

11

Security Administration wanted to extend benefits, it

12

couldn't, in the circumstances of this case?

13

MR. MILLER:

I think that when the statute

14

was initially enacted in 1939 with more or less the same

15

structure of these provisions as we have now, it might

16

at that time have been ambiguous.

17

adopted an interpretation that is, again, in structure

18

materially identical to its current interpretation in

19

1940, and it has adhered to it ever since.

20

has amended the statute with the understanding that that

21

was the interpretation, that everybody had to go through

22

State law to qualify.

23

But the agency

And Congress

And I think in light of that history, at

24

this point -- and Congress's ratification of that

25

understanding, at this point the best view is that it is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

unambiguous and clearly resolves the question in favor

2

of the interpretation set out in the agency's

3

regulations.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Miller, could I take you

5

back to 416(e)?

6

for purposes of deciding the -- which stepchildren get

7

benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we're

8

just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State

9

law on those questions; is that correct?

10

I take it that you don't contest that

MR. MILLER:

Yes, because those terms do not

11

appear in 416(h).

12

the statute that those terms be defined by reference to

13

State law, as there is with respect to "child."

14

There's -- there's no instruction in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, you know, I'm looking

15

at some of these, the grandchildren one, for example.

16

It says a person who is the grandchild, but only if,

17

blah, blah, blah.

18

understanding of what a grandchild is.

19

it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's

20

limiting a class of grandchildren with a pre-existing

21

understanding of what a grandchild is.

22

wondering, if that's true of grandchildren, why isn't it

23

also true of children?

24
25

It seems to have just sort of an

MR. MILLER:
about that, then.

In other words,

And so, I'm

Well, I should say two things

The first is, specifically with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

respect to grandchildren, the agency's -- the agency

2

defines a grandchild as the child, within the meaning of

3

the statute, of a child.

4

regulations at 404.358.

5
6
7

And that's set out in the

JUSTICE KAGAN:
child.

I'm sorry, the child of a

The child -- what kind of child?
MR. MILLER:

Well, somebody -- somebody who

8

would qualify under 416(h) as a child.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10
11

Oh, so, for grandchildren,

the agency is also looking to State law?
MR. MILLER:

Indirectly.

I mean, a

12

grandchild is not expressly defined in the Act, but

13

somebody who qualifies either under State law or you can

14

also qualify as a stepchild or adopted child of someone

15

who qualifies as a child in that same sense.

16

But -- I mean, again, the lack of a -- what's

17

significant, I think, is the lack of any other provision

18

in the statute that tells you how to define

19

"grandchild."

20

Congress was concerned about involved children, and for

21

-- in explaining to the agency how to deal with those

22

cases, Congress gave explicit guidance, and that's to

23

look to State law, in 416(h).

I mean, the -- the run of cases that

24

Now, Respondent makes much of the fact that

25

the benefits-granting provision, 402(d), has an express

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

cross-reference to the definition in 416(e) but doesn't

2

cross-reference the definition in 416(h).

3

And I think there are two problems with that

4

argument, the first of which is that 416(h) by its own

5

terms says that it applies for purposes of this

6

subchapter, that is throughout all of the parts of the

7

Act that we're talking about here.

8

416(h) incorporates itself into the 416(e) definition,

9

and there's no need for an express cross-reference.

10

The second point about that is that the

So, effectively

11

structure of the definitions here is very similar to the

12

structure of the definitions used in defining other

13

family relationships that are eligible for benefits.

14

So, under 402, some of the other subsections of 402,

15

there are benefits for the wife or husband or widow or

16

widower of an insured person.

17

benefits for a wife as an example, in 402(b) the statute

18

says that the "wife (as defined in section 416(b) of

19

this title)" under certain circumstances can get

20

benefits.

21

And just to take the

If you look at the definition in 416(b) of

22

"wife," it's very much like the definition in 416(e).

24

So -- and in the 1939 Act, all of those

25

to the support of such child and the child is neither

2

3

is deemed dependent under 402(d)(3).

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So,

Well, unless such

individual was not living with or contributing to the

6

support of such child -- which is certainly the case

qualifications.

14

The principal condition does not exist.

MR. MILLER:

How does

Well, because the child is

15

deemed dependent unless he was -- I mean, again,

16

since -- to be clear, we -- we think that the children

17

in this case do not -- are not eligible for child status

18

because they don't meet the requirements of 416(h).

MR. MILLER:

I referred a minute ago to the 1939 Act and

the structure of that Act, and I think that that's very

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

3

If I can, I'll start with a question that

4

Justice Sotomayor asked about the ambiguity or not of the

5

statute, and we think that in fact the statute is not

6

ambiguous at all.

7

dictates the reading that we advance.

8

I think, in addressing the case to recognize that it

9

presents essentially two issues.

We think that it unambiguously
And it's useful,

One is whether all of

10

the categories of applicants for child survivor benefits

11

that are defined to be children in the statutory

12

definition of "child," section 416, qualify for child

13

benefits without reference to State law, as we submit.

14

If they do, then the second question is

15

whether the children in this case, the Capato twins,

16

fall within one of the categories of children so

17

defined.

18

And we think that they very clearly do.
Congress said expressly that every child as

19

defined by 416(e) shall receive benefits so long as they

20

satisfy certain criteria that are not at issue in this

21

case.

22

directed us in determining who is a child eligible for

these benefits, defines a child to be (1) a child or

So, what's the purpose of (h)?
MR. ROTHFELD:

And our understanding of who

falls within section 416(e), (e)(1), definition of

12

"child," is the natural child, the biological child of

13

married parents.

14

21

That's a

Well, that's -- you see,

14

a situation like that is what is making me uncomfortable

15

because I don't see the words "biological" in the

16

statute.

18

I draw them from?

19

I don't see the word "marriage" directly
So, where do

Where do I come --

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, let me answer both of

20

those questions.

As to where marriage comes from, I

21

think from a number of sources.

22

was raised by Justice Alito and Justice Kagan, that at

23

the time Congress enacted the statute in 1939, the

24

overwhelming majority of children in the United States,

25

more than 90 percent -- it was actually more than 95

One is the point that

Alderson Reporting Company

26

percent -- were the children of married parents.

2

so, when Congress --

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

That would be true

under State intestate law.

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, simply as to what

6

Congress had in mind when it said a child is a child --

7

and you asked where marriage comes from in the

8

statute -- I think when Congress said a child is a

9

child, as I think Justice Alito's question suggested, it

10

would have had in mind the paradigm of a child at that

11

time, which was the children --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the words -- you say

13

this is plain meaning.

14

earner, an individual; a child -- it seems to me you are

15

importing the term "married," because someone can be the

16

undisputed child of a wage earner who is unmarried.

17

it's not a question of disputed versus undisputed.

18

wage earner can have a child, undisputed that the wage

19

earner is the parent, but the wage earner is not married.

20

It says the child of a wage

MR. ROTHFELD:

So,
A

Well, let me say two things

21

about that.

And, first, to continue the question of

22

where marriage comes from, there is a textual reference

23

to marriage which appears in section 416(h)(2)(B), the

24

companion to the intestacy provision upon which the

25

Government relies.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought we weren't

2

supposed to look to (h) at all.

3

(e) covers it --

4

MR. ROTHFELD:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6
7

I mean, your thesis is

But --- and there's no reason

to refer to (h).
MR. ROTHFELD:

But I think (h) reflects what

8

Congress had in mind in the statutory definition,

9

because in the provision that I'm referring to, Congress

10

said that if the parents went through a form of marriage

11

that was defective in some sense, nevertheless the child

12

would be deemed to be a child, which tells us that

13

marriage (a) was a significant part of what constitutes

14

childness as defined --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- I don't -- look,

16

when Congress says "child," "child" means child, and the

17

mere fact that Congress wrote that at an age when most

18

children were indeed children of married people doesn't

19

change the word "child."

20

say -- Congress often uses words that go beyond what --

21

what their immediate concern is, and here they used the

22

word "child."

I mean, we don't go back and

23

MR. ROTHFELD:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

But -You want us to probe their

mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children

2

have meant by "child."

3

at all.

4

I just don't think that follows

"Child" means child.
MR. ROTHFELD:

If I may, Your Honor,

5

Congress wrote a Federal definition of "child," and as

6

Mr. Miller acknowledged in his opening argument, when

7

Congress defined "child," it defined "child" to include

8

a number of things.

9

a child is a child or adopted child and stepchild,

The first thing that it defined was

10

grandchild, stepgrandchild.

11

"child" to have a particular meaning, because it said a

12

child is a child and other things.

13

that it mentioned were --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The other things

But, Mr. Rothfeld, I guess

23

And we know that Congress knew how to

It talks about the legitimate
Well, here it didn't add that

It just said "the child."
MR. ROTHFELD:

But -- and I think the reason

24

it did that, I mean, as -- again, as Mr. Miller said,

25

Congress used the "child" in two senses.

Alderson Reporting Company

It used the

word "child" in the generic sense:

3

"child" is, in that sense, a child, adopted child,

4

5

Everyone who
So, it said

In the dependency section, Congress is

referring to all children, all children in that -- in

7

the generic sense, everybody who qualifies for benefits

8

as a child.

9

between what we say it meant when it said a child is a

And, therefore, Congress had to distinguish

child, natural child of married parents --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Are there any other statutes

12

that you can point to around this time which support the

13

notion that when people said "child" they meant child

14

within a legal marriage?

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

I can't point to specifically

16

that, because I think it was clear when Congress used

17

the word "child" that that's what they had in mind as a

18

generic matter.

19
20

As I suggested, when --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

You can't point

to anything because it's so clear?

21

MR. ROTHFELD:

In a sense, that's right.

If

22

everyone knew what the word meant -- the word "child" was

23

used to define, I think, the category that people would

24

have had in mind when they thought of a child in the legal

25

sense.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rothfeld, don't you

2

run into a problem?

3

this Court has had a number of decisions that deal with

4

the distinction between children born in and out of

5

wedlock, and in some of those cases, it has held that

6

the distinction between the two is unconstitutional,

7

that there are no illegitimate children.

8

are legitimate, whatever their parents may be.

9

Perhaps not in 1939, but since then

MR. ROTHFELD:

That is true.

All children

But I think

10

the question is, what was the intent of Congress when it

11

wrote this statute in 1939?

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but if we are going

13

to apply those equal protection decisions to this

14

statute --

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that -- that may

16

suggest that an unfavorable application of the statute

17

to children born out of wedlock would be

18

unconstitutional.

19

Congress intended to provide benefits to these

20

children --

21

But the question of whether or not

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I suppose the question

22

is aren't you at the very least getting us into a

23

situation where we should interpret the statute the

24

Government's way because of constitutional avoidance

25

concerns?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think that the contrary is

2

true.

I think that you should interpret it our way

because the Government's application sort of disfavors

4

children who are born through, you know -- through

5

assisted means by its incorporation of State law in

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, it disfavors children

who are born after the father has died, which is in

accord with the title of the statute:

benefits.

11

MR. ROTHFELD:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -What's issue here -- what's

13

at issue here is not whether children that have been

born through artificial insemination get benefits.

15

whether children who are born after the father's death

get -- get benefits.

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

It's

But I think -- I suspect the

18

reason that Mr. Miller was resisting your questions on

Is it just a

We think -If there is a sperm

No, we -- we think not,

because what we think what Congress had in mind when it said

in the first part of clause (1) of the definition of

18

child is the child, the natural child -- and I use

19

natural as distinct from adopted child or stepchild who

20

are dealt with separately in the statute, which is why

21

we think it is clear that Congress was there talking

22

about natural children, biological children -- the

23

natural children of married parents, which we -- as I

24

say, the reason we think --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, a mother who is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

unmarried who bears a child, this child is not

2

automatically covered.

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

We think that as Congress

4

wrote the statute in 1939, that's correct, and that

5

child would then have been referred to the intestacy

6

provision upon which the Government relies, and --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, so there are

8

situations in which you think those provisions should

9

govern.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Yes.

Absolutely.

We think

11

that those provisions were added as an additive

12

provision as a mechanism for children who do not qualify

13

for the definition to be deemed a child.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This is what was not

15

clear to me.

16

"child" has just one natural meaning.

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

18
19
20
21

So, you're -- you're not arguing that

We -- we argue that Congress

used the word "child" -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In whatever meaning you

could give it.
MR. ROTHFELD:

We -- I wouldn't say that.

I

22

think that when Congress said a child is a child, which

23

is the provision of the statute we were referring to,

24

it was distinguishing the child from the adopted child and

25

stepchild, and we think they were doing it in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

context of marriage because (a) that was the paradigm of

2

family relationships at the time; (b) we think the

3

reason -- what Congress was very concerned with

4

accomplishing in the statute was guaranteeing certainty

5

in the -- in parentage and the parental relationship.

6

And it set up a system of -- because in 1939

7

there were no genetic paternity tests, there was no --

8

it was impossible to be absolutely, scientifically

9

certain as to who the -- at least as to who the father was,

10

Congress set up a series of proxies to establish whether

11

or not the applicant for child benefits was in fact the

12

child.

13

The principal one of those was the marital

14

relationship because in 1939, as I think

15

Justice Scalia's question suggested, there was a very

16

strong, virtually per se conclusive presumption that a

17

child born in marriage was the biological natural child

18

of both the father and mother, of the married couple.

19

And so, the existence of the marriage was a way of

20

establishing in 1939 dispositively that the child was

21

the child of the parents, the child of the survivor --

22

of the insured whose eligibility for benefits are being

23

invoked here.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious

why you didn't argue a different theory, which is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

(e) refers to all biological children whether in

2

marriage or outside of marriage, and then (h) is set up

3

for cases in which biological status is contested.

4

I mean, what would you think of that theory?

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

6

embrace it if the Court were --

7
8

Well, I -- we would certainly

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why didn't you argue

it?

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think -- we think that we

10

are arguing essentially a -- sort of a subset of that

11

theory.

12

it wanted to assure certainty, as I just said in

13

response to the previous question, in establishing

14

parentage.

15

could do that was by (a) invoking existence of a

16

parental relationship which established sort of as a per

17

se matter that the children born within the marriage

18

were the children of each of the married -- each member

19

of the married couple.

20

Our sense of what Congress was up to was that

And the principal way in 1939 that Congress

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that the

3

question that the Court has to confront here is,

4

Congress wrote a Federal definition of the word "child."

5

And it was -- sort of the first question in the case, I

6

think, is whether we are correct in our understanding

7

that, when Congress wrote this definition, all

8

applicants for child survivor benefits who fall within

9

that category, those defined categories, qualify.

10

And then we have -- if the answer to that is

11

"yes," and so children as defined in clause (1) of the

12

definition, which we think that the Capato children do,

13

whether or not all children so defined qualify for

14

benefits without regard to State intestacy law.

are right about that, then that raises the question what

16

is the meaning of "child" in the -- in the statute?

of the statutory text to those new developments.

19

New developments require application

If our reading of the statute is correct --

20

if what we think that Congress had in mind when it wrote

21

this statute was that it wanted to set in place

22

categories of applicants for child benefits as to whom

23

parentage in a relevant sense could be determined with

24

certainty, and it did that by focusing on the status of

25

the marital relationship between the parents, and it did

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

it by providing an alternative basis in section (h) --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that would be fine

3

if the statute said what you claim it says.

It says a

4

child is a child of a wage earner.

5

import these things that Congress didn't say to get to

6

what you claim is the plain meaning.

7

with the sentence in (h)(2)(A) that says "in determining

8

whether an applicant is a child of an insured individual

9

for purposes of this subchapter"?

And you'd have to

But what do you do

The subchapter is not

10

for purposes of (h), but for purposes of the entire

11

subchapter, which would include (e).

12

MR. ROTHFELD:

Right.

And I think actually

13

that is a helpful point for us, Justice Ginsburg,

14

because in determining whether an applicant is a child

15

for purposes of the subchapter, it's referring to the

16

use of the word "child" in the generic sense, in the

17

sense -- when -- when Congress said a child is defined

18

to include people who fall in these various categories

19

of children.

20

So, everybody -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how could it do that

21

when the rest of the sentence says, "to determine

22

whether an applicant is a child for purposes of this

23

subchapter, the Commissioner shall apply the State law

24

of intestacy"?

25

MR. ROTHFELD:

But I -- I think that -- that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

these two sentences have to be read together as

2

accomplishing the same thing.

3

it's saying that in making the determination whether or

4

not a child qualifies for child benefits, that the

5

Commissioner -- applicants who according to such law

6

would have the same status relative to taking intestate

7

personal property as a child shall be deemed such.

8
9

What I think what the --

I think one can't apply the statute without
knowing who a child is, because it -- it is directing

10

the Commissioner to engage in a comparison.

11

directing the Commissioner to say:

12

have the same status as a child?

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's

Does this applicant

Well, that's exactly right,

14

Mr. Rothfeld.

But you have two choices.

In the second

15

sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be

16

compared to the other, which is children.

17

is, are children described by the first sentence of

18

that, or are children described by the (e) section?

The question

19

So, you're just reading the first sentence

20

out of the statute and saying that the second sentence

21

totally subsumes the first sentence, and we have to go

22

back to (e).

23

But the first sentence exists.

24

Who are children?

25

law.

And it says:

Children are who they are under State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

MR. ROTHFELD:

No, and I -- I think that

2

what it's telling the Commissioner to do is to determine

3

whether or not -- when an applicant who does not fall

4

within one of the defined categories in section (e)

5

applies for benefits, the Commissioner is to determine

6

whether or not that child has the same status relative

7

to State law as the child as defined in the definitional

8

section.

9

The Congress -- as I say, Congress said

10

expressly that a child as defined in section 416(e) of

11

the statute qualifies for benefits.

12

establishes a Federal standard as to what -- what a

13

child is for purposes of the Act.

And so, I think it

14

The Court has to determine what that

15

standard means to apply to any particular child.

I think the problem is that

we are dealing with new technologies that Congress

48

didn't -- wasn't anticipating at the time.

I think --

2

one of the questions that was suggested to my friend,

3

Mr. Miller, by Justice Alito, I think, that if the child

4

who is the -- in 1939, who is the child of married

5

parents, natural child of married parents, sought

6

benefits under this statute and they were denied because

7

some State developed an aberrant law of intestacy and

8

said that such child would not qualify, would not be

9

deemed to be the child of their parents, I think that

10

that would have been regarded as a clear misreading of

11

the statute.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How -- do you think that

13

Congress thought of either of these situations as real

14

possibilities?

15

Congress, or even the one that passed the later statute,

16

ever thought that a State would disinherit a naturally

17

born -- all naturally born children -- or that children

18

could be born 18 months, 4 years, 50 years later?

Do you really think that the 1939

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

Well -They weren't thinking of

either.
So, the question becomes, given the language

23

of (h) that says define "child" this way throughout the

24

subchapter, why shouldn't we give that directive its

25

plain meaning?

Alderson Reporting Company

That's really the argument that you have to
convince us of.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, if we have to convince

4

you not to give the statute its plain reading, then we

5

will -- not going to prevail.

6

that -- that plain meaning has to control.

7

suggested at the outset, the reason we think we prevail

8

is that the plain meaning of this statute as was written

9

in 1939, as it would have been understood by the 1939

I certainly recognize
And as I

10

Congress that adopted it, was that the natural children

11

of married parents, the paradigm of the situation of the

12

child at that time, would fall into this category.

13

it is certainly true, as you say --

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now,

But that's because every

State law recognized them as such as well, correct?
MR. ROTHFELD:

And every State law -- and I

17

would put it the other way:

Every State law recognized

18

them as such because that was the way in which children

19

were understood -- the meaning of the term "child" was

20

understood at the time.

And --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, if we're going back

23

to 1939 understanding, wasn't it also understood that

24

the marriage ends when a parent dies?

25

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, there wouldn't be --

2

a child that's born 18 months after the father died

3

wouldn't be considered a child of a marriage because the

4

marriage would have ended.

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think that one has to

6

look at what Congress at the time -- I guess I would put

7

it this way:

8

that Congress had in mind the children of married

9

parents, the question is whether any particular child

11

12

Situations like this simply could not have

13

arisen in 1939.

curiosity, how -- how can this child satisfy the

20

requirements of (d)(1)(C), with regard to dependency

21

upon the father?

that.

MR. ROTHFELD:

The answer -- the answer why

we think -- and if I may, Mr. Chief Justice, answer.

6

The reason that we think we would prevail on

7

that question is because, as Mr. Miller said, Congress

8

created a -- an irrebuttable presumption that the child

of -- the legitimate child of -- of a parent is deemed

10

to have been dependent upon that parent at the time of

11

the parent's death.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. MILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

Since 1940, the Social Security

21

Administration has consistently interpreted the Act to

22

require all natural children to establish their

23

eligibility under 416(h), either by establishing that

24

they can inherit under State law or by showing that they

25

qualify under one of the express exceptions --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Miller, what do you

2

think is wrong with the alternative theory that -- that

3

I suggested, that (e) is all biological children in a

4

marriage, not in a marriage, doesn't matter; and that

5

(h) is designed to deal with situations in which

6

biological status is contested?

7

MR. MILLER:

Well, I -- the principal

8

problem with that, I think, is that it lacks -- it's not

9

supported by the text of what 416(h) says.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why do you think that?

11

What would you point to in (h) that is inconsistent with

12

the theory that I just gave you?

13

MR. MILLER:

I would point to (h)(2)(B) and

14

(h)(3), both of which are -- are the exceptions to allow

15

people to qualify when they can't establish State

16

intestacy rights, and both of which refer to someone who

17

is the son or daughter of the insured person but is not,

18

and is not deemed to be, the child.

19

So, if biological parentage were -- were

20

what was determinative under (e), and if you only looked

21

at (h) when there was some question about biological

22

parentage, it would -- the idea of someone who is a son

23

or daughter but isn't a child would make no sense.

24
25

And so, to give effect to those meanings -to give effect to those provisions, to give them

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

meaning, 416(h) has to have broader application than

2

just in cases of disputed biological parentage.

3

in fact the gateway through which everyone has to pass,

4

and that's how the -- the agency has -- has so regarded

5

it.

6

It is

The final point I would make is simply that,

7

even if the statute were silent on whether to look to

8

State law, it would be appropriate for the Court to

9

hesitate, I think, before creating what in effect is a

10

body of Federal common law about parental status.

11

of course, there's an express textual command the

12

other way.

13

to create, as Respondents are urging, a Federal rule

14

that goes well beyond what any State would allow in the

15

context of --

16

Here,

And it would be particularly inappropriate

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why doesn't the last

17

sentence of -- what is it -- (h)(2)(A) show that

18

Congress had in mind a certain idea of a category of

19

people who were indisputably children?

20

you can get around that, because it says what you're

21

looking for under State law is to determine whether

22

someone has the same status relative to taking intestate

23

personal property as a child.

24
