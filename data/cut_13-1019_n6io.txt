 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

first this morning in Case 131019, Mach Mining, LLC v. 

5

the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 

6

 Mr. Goldstein. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 
 Title VII prohibits the EEOC from suing a 

12

private employer unless it first attempts to resolve the 

13

claim of discrimination through conciliation.  We ask 

14

the Court to hold that a court may conduct a modest 

15

inquiry into whether the EEOC violated that statute.  If 

16

it did, then the remedy generally is to require 

17

conciliation, not to dismiss the suit with prejudice. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

At  at first, I thought 

19

this was an Overton Park case committed by law to agency 

20

discretion.  But then I couldn't find many cases in the 

21

government's brief to support that, so they have a 

22

different theory, and that's more their problem than 

23

yours. 

24
25

 On the other hand, it seems to me that Judge 
Hamilton in the Seventh Circuit said it's hard to

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

imagine more discretionary language than Congress used 

2

here, "Shall endeavor to eliminate the unemployment 

3

practice by informal methods of conference conciliation 

4

and persuasion."  That seems to me that those are very 

5

difficult words for your position. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Sure.  So let me, 

7

Mr. Justice Kennedy, divide that question into two 

8

parts.  What's the analytical framework?  Is it Overton 

9

Park?  Is it an APA case?  Is it an implied private 

10

right of action case, which is what Judge Hamilton 

11

thought, and then turn to the words of the statute and 

12

what it means, if we were even to concede, that these 

13

are kind of unusual words for a court to administer. 

14

 So the first is the doctrinal question. 

The 

15

government agrees that Judge Hamilton got it wrong in 

16

putting the burden on us to prove that there was an 

17

implied private right of action.  As a precondition to 

18

suit under Title VII, everyone agrees that there doesn't 

19

have to be a special statutory provision.  We say that 

20

this is a case, like St. Cyr, that it's a case in which 

21

the government has to prove, because there is compelled 

22

agency action here, the conciliation by the EEOC, that 

23

there is clear and convincing evidence that Congress 

24

intended to withdraw the ordinary presumption that there 

25

is judicial review.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So then the government's view, just to put 

2

out the third doctrinal framework, the government says, 

3

look, we think this is kind of an ordinary statutory 

4

construction case, and you should see whether it is that 

5

the three provisions of the statute on which they're 

6

relying are more consistent or less consistent with 

7

judicial review. 

8
9

 We think that this is clearly a case  we 
cite Bowen, for example, in our brief.  We cite a series 

10

of cases about Congress having to give very clear 

11

evidence of intent to pull the courts out of the job of 

12

reviewing the agency action. 

13

 Now, to take your point that this  and 

14

Judge Hamilton's point, that is, this kind of language 

15

is both deferential in that it's informal, you just have 

16

to endeavor.  And this is arguably something that's a 

17

little bit unusual for courts to undertake.  So first, 

18

doctrinally, the fact that Congress has given the courts 

19

an unusual job is not an excuse or reason for the 

20

Executive Branch to tell you that you cannot do the job. 

21

That would turn Chevron on its head.  Remember, the 

22

principle of Chevron 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, it's kind of an odd 

24

conciliation, isn't it?  This is  EEOC is supposed to 

25

try to settle the matter.  But there is no mutual

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

obligation on the other side.  There's no obligation at 

2

all on the part of the employer to cooperate to do 

3

anything. 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  And 

5

I think this has to be a point in our favor, the fact 

6

that it is unusual.  Let me tell you how unusual it is; 

7

and that is, the EEOC is required to do this with 

8

respect to four different statutes.  The Housing and 

9

Urban Development Department has to do it and the 

10

Federal  the Federal Election Commission has to do it. 

11

So Congress has laid this out in a series of statutes 

12

where it wanted to impose on the agency this special 

13

obligation.  Even with respect to Title VII, the private 

14

employee doesn't have to conciliate, the attorney 

15

general doesn't have to conciliate, the EEOC doesn't 

16

have to conciliate if it's an urgent problem under the 

17

statute. 

18

 But Congress thought, and this Court has 

19

said many times, that it was especially important that 

20

the EEOC try and resolve these cases through 

21

conciliation.  And it would be passing strange to say 

22

that the entire design of the statute is that the EEOC 

23

will work this out through conciliation, if it possible, 

24

but that's the one provision of the statute that is not 

25

enforceable.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but at the same time, 

2

Mr. Goldstein, and this really follows up on 

3

Justice Kennedy's question, the statute makes entirely 

4

clear that the EEOC has the prerogative to decide what 

5

kind of offer by the employer is acceptable or not.  And 

6

there's nothing to suggest that the EEOC even has to be 

7

reasonable in determining what sort of offer by the 

8

employer is acceptable. 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Could I agree with the first 

10

part, but not the second?  Let me just take you to the 

11

statute, if I might.  It's in the blue brief at page 2. 

12

And it's the block quote at the bottom.  And it has a 

13

timing provision that's kind of irrelevant.  And then it 

14

says the following:  "The Commission has been"  this 

15

is, "If the Commission has been unable to secure from 

16

the respondent a conciliation agreement acceptable to 

17

the Commission," which is the point you just made, Your 

18

Honor, "the Commission may bring a civil action against 

19

any respondent, not a government." 

20
21
22

 Now, I think it's a helpful point to us that 
Congress 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Let's not skip over the 

23

time provision as irrelevant so quickly.  Because it's 

24

the 30 days  30 days  EEOC can sue within 30 days of 

25

the charge; isn't that right?

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It can if it cannot reach a 

conciliation agreement.  This Court has 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So Congress couldn't 

4

think that this was any kind of an onerous requirement 

5

if all they have is 30  within 30 days they can say, 

6

okay, we told them that  that what  what the 

7

complaint is, they didn't come up with anything and so 

8

end of conciliation. 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, we 

10

just, I suppose, disagree about the substance of the 

11

conciliation requirement is in that point.  The EEOC 

12

concedes that it cannot file the suit within 30 days or 

13

after 30 days unless the  it determines that there has 

14

been a conciliation process that has failed. 

15

 Now, what I think the helpful point for us 

16

is that this language acceptable to the Commission is 

17

there with respect to the substance, but not the 

18

process.  If you'd look at the procedural obligation, 

19

which is the one we're trying to enforce here, which it 

20

appears earlier in the page, "If the Commission 

21

determines after such investigation that there is 

22

reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the 

23

Commission shall endeavor to eliminate"  which is 

24

expansive language, Justice Kennedy, to be sure  "any 

25

such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion." 

2

 And our point is that Congress knew how to 

3

write into the statute something like a method of 

4

conciliation that is acceptable to the Commission. 

5
6
7

 Also, to the extent this provision remains 
vague, and it has been enforceable 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Goldstein, if I 

8

understand your argument, you're saying that there is an 

9

obligation to conciliate, but that obligation does not 

10
11
12
13

have to be pursued in good faith. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, Justice Scalia.  We 

think 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So that the  even if the 

14

Commission enters upon a conciliation process, you think 

15

that the outcome of that is reviewable? 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, Justice Scalia.  This is 

17

the difference between substance and process.  It is not 

18

too fine a point.  Let me just explain our provision 

19

our position.  That is, as Justice Kagan indicates, the 

20

EEOC can declare what the finish line is, but Congress 

21

said they're going to have to go through a process. 

22

They're going to have to run the race 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That was my question. 
Yes. 
It can declare when the

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

finish line is, but it can do that in bad faith. 

2

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

can do that in bad faith. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No.  I apologize. 
Yes.  You're saying yes, it 

It can  it can say we 

6

didn't get to the finish line if it went through the 

7

motions, yes. 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And it can say that in bad 

faith. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I don't believe that's 

11

correct, Justice Scalia.  I'll give you an example of 

12

what I mean.  Can I  can I illustrate the point? 

13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
correct? 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18

Well, is it correct or not 

It is not correct. 
Because I don't understand 

your argument. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Let me give you an 

19

illustration of my point.  And that is, let's assume 

20

that the EEOC brings a charge with respect to an 

21

individual's claim.  It says to the employer:  We'll 

22

conciliate this if you give us $5 million.  Now, $5 

23

million is not an amount of money that they legally 

24

could even get in the case if they litigated it to the 

25

teeth.  Now, we think that that would be an  not a

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fair application of the statute, for them to say we 

2

declare conciliation failed.  So that's an illustration 

3



4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So fair application of the 

5

statute is reviewable, so that the proper  I mean, 

6

we're just quibbling over, you know, how bad it is, 

7

that's right. 

8
9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Justice Scalia, here's 

their  their view of judicial review is that it is 

10

available, but it is limited to one thing, which is to 

11

say, did we send the employer a letter that said give us 

12

a call?  Now, our point is that that's got to be an 

13

argument in our favor, because they're conceding that 

14

Congress did contemplate some form of judicial review. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it is true that you 

16

you do not  I think I'm correct in this  reach out 

17

and try to incorporate the existing law on good faith 

18

bargaining in the labor context or there are many 

19

contracts which have good faith clauses and that the 

20

courts have tremendous difficulty with that.  And if you 

21

had argued that, we would have said, oh, well, this is a 

22

morass. 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

that's you're safest harbor.

Right.  So 
But it seems to me that 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, Justice 
But you've already  you 

3

recognized in  in the prior exchange that there 

4

this is nothing like bargaining.  Bargaining is 

5

reciprocal.  Both sides have a duty to bargain in good 

6

faith. 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9

Yes. 
Here there is no duty at 

all on the part of the employer.  It just says EEOC 

10

tried to conciliate. 

11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's right.  Justice 

12

Ginsburg, Justice Kennedy, we are not asking you to 

13

import the good faith bargaining case law and 

14

regulations from the NLRA.  Our point is different; and 

15

that is, it is commonplace for the courts to review this 

16

sort of thing.  There are five statutes.  This statute 

17

has been enforced by 40  for 40 years and courts have 

18

looked into notions like bargaining or whether parties 

19

complied with the court's order to mediate.  So this 

20

isn't notionally something that is so unusual that 

21



22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, it's unusual 

23

enough that there's a huge split among the circuits as 

24

to how to define what they're reviewing.  I can't find 

25

any consistency among more than about two of them.  And

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

so I go back to  I know you say you've cited cases 

2

about the imperative of judicial review, but on the 

3

administrative level, it's after a final action.  This 

4

is not a final action. 

5
6
7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Sotomayor, this is 

not an APA case.  This is 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Oh, well, I agree with 

8

you.  But I'm trying to find something analogous and 

9

there isn't.  But I don't know how you make something 

10

that's designated by Congress as informal into a formal 

11

proceeding. 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Sotomayor, I think 

13

when Congress said informal methods of conference, 

14

conciliation, and persuasion, it was contrasting 

15

bringing a lawsuit.  There's no indication in the 

16

statutory structure or in the legislative history that 

17

what Congress was trying to do is say to the EEOC, do 

18

whatever you like.  To the contrary, the EEOC uniquely 

19

was constrained.  Take the Department of Labor, take 

20

any  almost any other enforce 

21
22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 
this case? 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

Well, can we take  take 

Yes. 
The EEOC did send a 

letter saying 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Give us a call. 
 give us a call.  And 

3

the charge here is the employer violated Title VII 

4

because he outright refused to hire women.  And there is 

5

lots of evidence of that.  There are no women working 

6

there.  They build a new facility; they don't have a 

7

women's bathroom in it.  They hire people that are 

8

recommended to them by the current employees and the 

9

current employees are all male and recommend all men. 

10
11

 Now, what  what was the EEOC to conciliate 
about? 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, this 
Wouldn't the employer 

14

have to come up and say something like, okay, we'll 

15

we'll agree that we'll hire women? 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Justice Ginsburg, a 

17

couple preliminary points.  Just factually, we are 

18

talking about the difference between  the company does 

19

have female employees.  We're talking about in the mine, 

20

which is a serious concern under Title VII, but just to 

21

be clear. 

22

 Now, in terms of the conciliation process, 

23

here are the basic things that seem  they ought to be 

24

uncontroversial and that the EEOC over the course of the 

25

past 40 years should have and could have used its

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rulemaking authority to make clear.  So the statute 


2


requires that you're going to conference.  Now, the 


3


EEOC's position is we can say, give us a call.  But what 

4

ought  there ought to be a rule that says if the 


5


employer contacts you back, you are willing to 

6

conference with them.  You are willing to meet and have 

7

a discussion. 

8

 The statute says that you have to attempt to 

9

persuade the employer.  And so that  what that should 

10

mean is simply that you're going to give the basics of 

11

your demand in conciliation to the employer so it can 

12

evaluate it. 

13

 Justice Ginsburg, the problem is that 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

Can I ask something about 

this? 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
Conciliation I thought 

18

would be conciliation between the complaining parties 

19

and the employer. 

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

21

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

23
24
25

It's between  sorry. 
But  and that's wrong? 
It is the EEOC and the 

employer. 
JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Between the EEOC and the 

employer?

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right.  It is an important 

point 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So even if the complaining 

4

party is willing to accept $500,000 rather than a 

5

million, if the EEOC says a million, the EEOC is 

6

conciliated. 

7
8
9
10
11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The EEOC says it's 

conciliating. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, no.  Under the law, 

you tell me it is conciliated. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right.  The EEOC's 

12

position  that is correct, yes, full stop.  And this 

13

is a problem.  The EEOC has an enormous incentive, 

14

because it does bring about 130 cases a year, to pick 

15

out the cases that it wants to be very high profile.  It 

16

wants to send a message to employers.  Justice Ginsburg, 

17

you articulated they are concerned with this employer. 

18

The difficulty for them is if they conciliate, Congress 

19

required that that remain entirely confidential.  And so 

20

the problem is that we have an agency that has an 

21

enormous incentive in the cases that it picks out to 

22

bypass the mandatory process that Congress imposed. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Goldstein, could we talk 

24

about that confidentiality provision?  Because in 

25

addition to just the enormous discretion that this

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute gives to the EEOC, the other thing that tends to 

2

work against you is this thing:  Nothing said or done as 

3

part of these informal endeavors can be used as evidence 

4

in a subsequent proceeding. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And your entire position 

7

would have all the stuff about this conciliation come in 

8

as evidence in a subsequent proceeding, which is to say, 

9

come in as evidence in the litigation of the lawsuit. 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Just to pause briefly 

11

on the premise that there is enormous discretion, that 

12

is the premise of Chevron deference, not courts not 

13

enforcing a statute. 

14
15
16
17

 But to turn to the confidentiality 
provision, remember that the EEOC 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm just saying as a matter 

of fact 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 there is discretion in 

20

the sense that the statute clearly gives it to the EEOC 

21

to decide what's acceptable in the end. 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Absolutely, Justice Kagan. 

23

But that is true across a range of statutes that impose 

24

a procedural obligation. 

25

 Now, confidentiality. 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Let's start from the

Official

1

point that the EEOC didn't read the statute this way 

2

until four decades after it was enacted.  And there's a 

3

good reason for that.  It read it our way.  The reason 

4

is that when Congress enacted the statute, the reference 

5

to a "subsequent proceeding" in the text unquestionably 

6

was the merits of the case, because the EEOC  there 

7

was never this fight because the EEOC didn't have that 

8

enforcement power. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  But you yourself are 

10

making this part of the case.  You're essentially saying 

11

that the EEOC has to come in and prove that it 

12

conciliated in good faith or whatever term you want.  So 

13

it's become now, by virtue of your own argument, part of 

14

the case.  And how is that to be part of the case and 

15

how is all this to happen unless the informal  what's 

16

said and done in the informal endeavors come in. 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  So "subsequent 

18

proceeding" can be read their way or it can be read as a 

19

reference to the merits.  I concede it can be read their 

20

way.  The question we think is that clear and convincing 

21

evidence 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I don't even understand that 

distinction.  You're making it a part of the merits. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Because the subsequent 

proceeding is not  is about the merits of the

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

subsequent  the substantive claim.  Let me give you 

2

three examples where we have to be right that a 

3

collateral inquiry into the EEOC's burden or our burden 

4

is not a subsequent proceeding.  That's referred to in 

5

the statute, that would be subject to the 

6

confidentiality proceeding. 

7

 This Court held in Ford Motor Company that 

8

if an employer makes an offer of back pay to the 

9

employee, and that would include in the conciliation 

10

process, then that cuts off their right to damages.  You 

11

can't do that unless you can say what happened in the 

12

conciliation process. 

13

 Number two, the statute says that you can 

14

ask the judge for 60 days more of conciliation.  It is 

15

implausible that a court would make that judgment 

16

without knowing whether conciliation has been going 

17

completely worthlessly. 

18

 Number three, what if the employer lies to 

19

the court and says, look, we never got this conciliation 

20

letter.  And the EEOC knows that it was discussed in the 

21

conciliation meeting.  Could we really say that this 

22

statute bars the court from enforcing a contempt 

23

proceeding against the lawyer? 

24
25

 The point of the statute is to make sure 
that what happens in the conciliation process doesn't

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prejudice the merits of the case.  This isn't a secrecy 

2

provision.  Under this provision, the employer can 

3

publish what happened in conciliation in the New York 

4

Times. 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I would have thought that 

6

the point of the provision is very clear.  It's the same 

7

point as anything which says when you're involved in 

8

settlement negotiations those stay in settlement 

9

negotiations, and it's to protect the settle  the 

10
11

integrity of the negotiations. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, I just gave you three 

12

examples where I think plainly it can't be read that 

13

broadly.  We think it serves 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You left out one person. 
Yes. 
The complainant.  As I 

17

understand it, to break the confidentiality all the 

18

participants have to agree.  And the employer might 

19

agree, but the employee hasn't been heard from. 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

This  this, again, I think 

21

has to be a point in our favor.  Let me just take you to 

22

the statutory text involved.  And that says that you 

23

have to have permission of the persons concerned.  Now, 

24

the commission is not a person.  Justice Ginsburg, you 

25

are right that the persons concerned under this statute

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are the individual complainant and the employer. 

2

 Now, the complainant is not involved in this 

3

inquiry at all.  It's about whether the EEOC responded 

4

to our request to meet, whether it gave us an 

5

explanation of what it is that they were demanding. 

6

 How does it make any sense that Congress 

7

would have said that the choice whether the evidence 

8

comes in is to the complainant, who wasn't even involved 

9

in this part of the process.  We think that our reading 

10

of the statute, which is their reading of the statute 

11

for the first four decades is 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if it is 

confidential, that is plain in the statute. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

But it's not confidential in 

15

that sense, Justice Ginsburg.  Remember, the employer, 

16

as I said, is free to tell CNN, the New York Times, and 

17

the Washington Post everything that happened here. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So it's your position that 

19

the courts that have held that the proceedings are under 

20

seal or they're secret proceedings are just irrelevant; 

21

we don't need to be concerned with that? 

22
23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Kennedy, there 

aren't such courts.  Every court 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

There are or there aren't? 
Are not.  Every court  on

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the question of administrability, it's very frequent for 

2

an agency to come to you and say, look, this would work 

3

so much better if the courts weren't involved; we would 

4

do a great job.  And for 40 years, courts have enforced 

5

this provision and have never understood, before a 

6

decision in 2011, the confidentiality provision to apply 

7

this way.  And the EEOC argued that we were right. 

8

There's no indication that the statute was 

9

malfunctioning in some way. 

10

 We think, respectfully, that you cannot have 

11

agencies come in front of you and say, look, Congress 

12

gave us a lot of discretion; that doesn't mean we should 

13

issue regulations.  They have the authority to issue 

14

procedural regulations that would elaborate on what 

15

conciliation means, what  what persuasion means.  But 

16

they've refused to do it.  And then they come to you and 

17

say, well, look, you know, it's entirely vague. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Because they consider it 

19

 and I think you can't quarrel with it; this is what 

20

Congress intended  as a highly informal proceeding. 

21

They don't want a  a bunch of procedural regulations. 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's not quite right. 

23

Remember, that they admit that there are firm 

24

requirements.  They have to send a letter.  They can 

25

only conciliate with respect to the claim that's in the

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable cause determination.  We think there are 

2

other very simple, modest things that the courts have 

3

had no trouble enforcing 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what about that? 

5

That's what I  I mean, in my mind, of course, there 

6

should be judicial review.  There is of everything just 

7

about.  But the issue is how much. 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
All right.  Now, what's 

10

your view on that?  Because as I  we just had a case 

11

where when an IRS official wants to subpoena some 

12

material, all he has to do is say it's in good faith. 

13

Ah.  But there could be an unusual case where we want to 

14

get more than that affidavit. 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
So we wrote an opinion, and 

17

probably you've read it, and we said, well, judge, yeah, 

18

if it's unusual and you really have some thought here 

19

that the IRS is in bad faith, you can go a little 

20

further.  Well, that seems to me to be the kind of thing 

21

that would apply here. 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Sure. 
And then  okay.  So 

24

you're perfectly satisfied.  I take it the closest to this 

25

is the Fourth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuit, a minimal

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

showing of good faith, that's the end of it, but you're 

2

never going to say never. 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

Yes.  Now, those courts 
That's what your  well, 

maybe there will be agreement on this. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

7

 The  Justice  Justice Breyer, that is 

8

exactly right.  We think that the agency here, if it 

9

claims the expertise and the flexibility and to know 

I doubt it. 

10

what's going on, ought to issue further elaborating 

11

regulations.  But we think that minimum good faith does 

12

have some very easy, simple things to know.  If I'm 

13

going to 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Aha.  You're going a bit 

further now. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I'm doing so to try and be 

17

helpful.  Here's what I had in my mind, Justice Breyer. 

18

Look, if I'm going to conciliate something with you, if 

19

we're going to work it out and I get to decide, I've got 

20

to tell you the minimum of what I'll take.  How is it 

21

that we're supposed to work it out 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Maybe that's confidential. 

23

I don't know.  Minimal good faith?  Hey, I have an 

24

affidavit, I'm in the agency, I sign it.  We called him, 

25

he came in, we discussed the matter, I tried to persuade

24

him

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That is 

 and he's not persuaded. 

4

Thank you very much.  In the absence of some  in the 


5


absence of some showing that there is something like we 

6

tried to get a bribe or something, goodbye. 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No.  Justice Breyer, that is 

8

not  I believe that is not what those courts have in 

9

mind.  So there's nothing confidential 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

have in mind.  So what  what is it 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

13

 (Laughter.) 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's at the moment what I 

All right. 

I  I think your response 

is persuade him about what?

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Persuade 
He tried to persuade him 

18

about what?  If you didn't even make an offer, there was 

19

nothing to  what, persuade him not to commit suicide? 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right.  Persuade 
No, we didn't persuade him 

22

about not to commit suicide.  What we did is we tried to 

23

persuade him that our suggestion that you reinstate the 

24

individual, whatever it was, is a sensible way to go.

And it'll be good for him 

Yes. 
 at  at the

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  At the hearing or the 

conciliation? 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

At the conciliation.  I 

misspoke. 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Thank you. 
Okay.  It seems to me, 

20

though, that that may be what you're arguing now, but if 

21

we look at the record below, first you didn't want to 

22

waive confidentiality.  You then put in a set of 

23

interrogatories that demands to know what the EEOC 

24

who the EEOC contacted, how they measured their damages, 

25

and a bunch of other stuff, still not waiving

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

confidentiality. 
 This new thing of yours that says if you 

3

challenge it when I make a motion, then I can disclose 

4

it.  I think what Justice Breyer's getting to is, you 

5

know whether someone conciliated or not.  You can say 

6

exactly what the EEOC did or didn't do or failed to do. 

7

But instead, you want a whole discovery process attached 

8

to this.  And that's my problem here 

9
10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 which is it's very 

11

simple for you to come in and say, we called, we asked 

12

to meet, they wouldn't meet with us. 

13

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Here are the things that we 

14

want and I do want to talk about what's in the record 

15

and why 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no, no, no.  I don't 

17

want to know what you want.  I want to know what happens 

18

because that's the only way I can judge whether there 

19

was good faith. 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Justice 
So if you walked in and 

22

said, I'm not going to listen to you until you give me 

23

A, B, and C, I might say you weren't acting in good 

24

faith. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  Well, Justice

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Sotomayor, they  they say a court doesn't have that 

2

power.  Now, with respect to what happened in this case, 

3

we  the government has put us in an unbelievable bind 

4

here, and that is, we issued these interrogatories and 

5

then we attempted to explain to the court why we thought 

6

the interrogatories were necessary in light of the 

7

conciliation process, and they threatened to sanction 

8

our counsel personally.  So the record is empty for a 

9

reason that owes entirely to them. 

10

 I will tell you that there are cases in 

11

which the EEOC attempts to conciliate and says we are 

12

suing  we're going to sue you on behalf of a class of 

13

people, and we want some X amount of money, and it may 

14

be an awful lot of money.  And the employer will say 

15

back, look, how many people are we talking about over 

16

what period of time?  And the EEOC's interpretation of 

17

this provision is it could say we're not going to tell 

18

you; we've just got a class of people and we want this 

19

amount of money.  And interrogatories like this would be 

20

out there conceivably to illustrate to the court that we 

21

had no way of conciliating this case.  If we're  if 

22

it's going to say we're in an endeavor to work it out, 

23

you've got to tell me what you want and the basics 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you'd have all of the 

discovery and the conciliation process in 30 days.

28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

what you want to  to have. 

4

Your Honor 
That  that's basically 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No.  Congress contemplated 

5

that conciliation could conclude within 30 days.  It 

6

doesn't  remember, this case is very old because they 

7

got this charge in 2008 and it was years later, even 

8

before they brought the case, and the case has dragged 

9

on this long because they have steadfastly infused 

10

refused, in the face of eight courts of appeals' 

11

rulings, no court ever indicating that the standard was 

12

inadministrable, no court ever finding that an employer 

13

acted in good faith  in bad faith in raising this 

14

objection. 

15

 And it has dragged on unnecessarily. 

We 

16

want a modest inquiry that should be administrable, and 

17

that the EEOC can elaborate on in its own regulations. 

18

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE A. SAHARSKY 

22
23
24
25

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 I think the Seventh Circuit was correct when

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it reviewed what has been happening in the courts of 

2

appeals and concluded that, in fact, what is happening 

3

is not a modest inquiry and it's just not one that has a 

4

basis in the text of the statute.  And I think it's 

5

useful to go back to the text of the statute and look 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Ms. Saharsky, let me 

7

just ask you a simple question.  You send a letter, they 

8

call you, and you say, don't want to talk to you, hang 

9

up.  30 days later, you send the letter that you send 

10

routinely that says conciliation failed.  How do they 

11

get a court to review that under your theory of the 

12

case?  Because you say the only thing the court can 

13

review is whether conciliation was offered and whether 

14

it ended.  So here it was offered, but we're not even 

15

talking about good faith.  You just say I'm not going 

16

to. 

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
"You" meaning the 

19

government.  So how do you review that if you're a 

20

court? 

21

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

You don't review it.  We 

22

think that this is a matter that is entrusted to the 

23

agency, that is not for court review.  And I 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

sorry.  Continue.  No, I'm sorry.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

And what  I'm 

Official

1

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

2

 I think that it helps to look at the 

That's okay. 

3

obligations that the Congress put on the commission in 

4

the statute in two parts.  There's the  and I'll make 

5

this brief.  There's the obligation in part B, which is 

6

the commission should endeavor to eliminate the 

7

employment discrimination, everything is supposed to be 

8

kept confidential.  We understand that to put a good 

9

faith obligation on the commission to try to get this 

10

resolved.  We don't think that it is judicially 

11

reviewable because of the language that Congress used 

12

and because by analogy, it is the type of agency action 

13

that's committed to the agency's discretion.  There's no 

14

standards.  But 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But what if you 

16

have  you sent a letter that says a representative of 

17

this office will be in contact with you to begin the 

18

conciliation process.  What if the employer says, nobody 

19

contacted me; it never happened.  Can you get judicial 

20

review of that claim? 

21

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, the obligation of the 

22

agency is to say that it has been unable to secure a 

23

conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission.  So 

24

that 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

No.  Is it their

Official

1

obligation to say that or is it their obligation to do 

2

that? 

3

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, if it is challenged, it 

4

has to put the document into court that is the notice 

5

that it was unable to do that. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And they say here 

7

your document is signed by, you know, John Rowe.  What 

8

if they say, I'm sorry, it's just not true, he's lying? 

9

We got nothing, nobody ever called us. 

10

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, if the  if the 

11

document which says that the commission was unable to 

12

to secure an agreement acceptable to it 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no, no.  You're 

14

making it too easy on yourself, I'm talking about the 

15

document that says, we will be in contact with you. 

16

Right? 

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19
20

Yes. 
They said nobody 

contacted me. 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think the answer is that it 

21

is the process by which the  there was an attempt at 

22

conciliation is not reviewable.  We do not  we think 

23

that the agency 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

judicial review of that question?

32

Is, in my case,

No. 
Nobody contacted me;

5

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

No, but we do not think that 

6

there are any situations in which that will arise. 

7

There are not situations in which that has arisen and 

8

that is not the argument that

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's just assuming 

you're always right. 

11

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's 
I mean, I don't 

13

understand why you can't have a court at least say, 

14

okay, there's a direct conflict.  You say you're 

15

supposed to 

16

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

Right, okay. 

says it never got off the ground, and you can have 

19

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21
22

 consume  and he 

Right. 
 Mr. Rowe file an 

affidavit and he can file an affidavit and 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You know, this is a  this 

23

is Hornbook law, I thought, use it till this point.  But 

24

everything is reviewable.  Now, that isn't quite true, 

25

but if you want to apply for a visa at a foreign embassy

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

abroad, at our embassy is not reviewable.  Okay, and 

2

maybe there's a military thing, but even the  even 

3

the  even the things like the Panama Canal toll, where 

4

they said it wasn't reviewable, Davis says it should 

5

have been. 

6

 And the answer to your problem is it's not 

7

 it's not reviewable, the three cases or so where we 

8

said it wasn't.  The answer is the agency has broad 

9

discretion, and because they have such broad discretion, 

10

the court can review it, but unless it's very unusual, 

11

they have to decide for the agency. 

12

 Now, eight circuits have roughly followed 

13

that; three, more detailed than others.  And I haven't 

14

found anything in your brief that says in the last 40 

15

years, the EEOC has, as a result, found its functioning 

16

seriously hampered.  And  and so why  what's 

17

that's why I'm  I'm wondering. 

18

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, a couple of points.  First 

19

of all, I'm afraid that I may have misunderstood the 

20

Chief Justice's question.  If there was no attempt at 

21

conciliation at all, then, you know, these letters would 

22

not exist and we think that that potentially would be a 

23

problem, but that 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You're saying if the 

agency  the agency couldn't possibly have violated the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law?  They wouldn't say we have attempted to  we will 

2

contact you, and then not contacted you? 

3

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I agree that that would be a 

4

problem, but that is not what Petitioner is arguing for. 

5

He has not identified case 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, it's not a 

7

question of what he's arguing for, it's a question of 

8

what you are arguing for.  You are arguing that there is 

9

no judicial review, full stop.  And I'm trying to pose a 

10

question where it seems to me that it would be utterly 

11

unreasonable for you to say you don't get judicial 

12

review of that basic question. 

13

 I am very troubled by the idea that the 

14

government can do something and we can't even look at 

15

whether they've complied with the law.  I'm not terribly 

16

troubled by the idea that the scope of our judicial 

17

review is limited.  And I just wanted you to tell me 

18

which it is, is it that there's no authority for a court 

19

to review government action alleged to be in violation 

20

of law, or is it that the scope of judicial review for 

21

various reasons is sharply circumscribed? 

22

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

It's the second one, and I'm 

23

sorry if I misunderstood your question earlier.  The 

24

scope of judicial review depends on the condition that 

25

the court  that Congress put in for the commission to

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

meet, and that is in subsection (f)(1) of this  this 

2

provision, which is that there has to be  the 

3

commission unable to obtain an agreement acceptable to 

4

it. 

5

 What Petitioner seeks judicial review of is 

6

the process behind it and puts in place these factors 

7

for reviewing the process behind it.  And Justice 

8

Breyer 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What  what  what can 

10

you tell us about what the proper function of the court 

11

is in a case like the Chief Justice put?  They said 

12

there was no attempt to conciliate and when we attempted 

13

to conciliate, they  they wouldn't answer our calls. 

14

 Now, it  it seems to me as I read your 

15

brief that you did indicate that there was some very 

16

bare bones requirements that the agency had  had to 

17

meet and it could be reviewed.  I can't find any  any 

18

other context where the court has essentially declined 

19

to review a statutory precondition to  to suit at all. 

20

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, what we're saying, 

21

Justice Kennedy, is that if it were controverted, if the 

22

other side said that there was not conciliation at 

23

all  which is not what this side is saying, they are 

24

just saying it wasn't enough effort  but if there was 

25

none at all, that we would put in place the letters that

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

showed that we conciliated.  Those would  the agency's 

2

activities, its daytoday workings, would be entitled 

3

to a presumption of regularity and it would take really 

4

something extraordinary to look behind that. 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that's the 

difference 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What's 

8

extraordinary  what's extraordinary is that counsel 

9

for the other side files an affidavit saying it never 

10

happened, I know you've got this letter, but we normally 

11

don't take the government's sayso when it comes to a 

12

dispute about whether  whether something happened. 

13

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right. 
So he can say 

15

say, okay, here's the affidavit, we never got it.  We 

16

checked our mailroom 

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19
20

Right. 
Nothing ever came 

in.  We checked our phone logs, nobody ever called. 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  And I'm telling you 

21

that if it were a situation of it nothing never 

22

happened, that that could be a situation in which the 

23

court would put in place a stay to permit conciliation 

24

efforts.  But that's not the argument that 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, let's go back to the

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

language you quoted.  The commission is unable to obtain 

2

an agreement acceptable to it.  To obtain an  do you 

3

acknowledge that it is obliged to try to obtain an 

4

agreement acceptable to it 

5

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Acceptable to it, yes. 
Yes.  Now, is it possible 

7

that you are trying to obtain an agreement acceptable to 

8

you when you do not tell the other side what that might 

9

be? 

10

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, I think that 
You just say, you know 
I think that there's a real 

13

difference between what the EEOC is doing in its 

14

daytoday activities and court review of the EEOC 

15

activities.  The EEOC has in place procedures and it has 

16

training in order to go through all of these steps in 

17

conciliation, but what we're talking about is the 

18

problems that have been caused by this afterthefact 

19

secondguessing by courts, 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You have to make me an 

21

offer.  That's not  that's not difficult to find out. 

22

Did you make an offer or not. 

23

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  But that just leads 

24

the courts into questions about how much detail was in 

25

the offer and is it sufficient and if the 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4
5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, not necessarily.  I 

mean, you could 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, that's what has 

happened in the 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 draw a line somewhere, 

6

but  but if the other side says the EEOC never made me 

7

an offer, I had no idea  no notion of what I had to 

8

agree to. 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

But that is not what's 

10

happening and that is not the argument that they're 

11

making, is that 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So that's what  that's 

13

where we are.  I'm trying to  what I'd like you to do, 

14

I'm going to get you to focus on just what you want to 

15

say, that the framework in which I'm putting it is of 

16

course there is review, but of course at the same time, 

17

there is very broad discretion given to the EEOC.  So 

18

courts do not intervene; be careful, it's an unusual 

19

case. 

20

 Now, that's what you want. 

21

 Now, I want to know how to say that. 

And 

22

the case that comes to me the closest was the case that 

23

we had with the IRS where, in fact, of course the IRS 

24

says, we're in good faith.  And the court says, that's 

25

just fine, unless of course there is an unusual

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

situation. 
 Now, one can write those words. 

In that 

3

kind of opinion, I've noticed it works best if you also 

4

give an example through the use of the case. 

5

 Now, that's where I am. 

And since I think 

6

that's what you want  something like that is what you 

7

want to argue, I'm asking you for help how to write 

8

that. 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  And what I'm saying 

10

is that there is  the way not to write that is by 

11

relying on a goodfaith standard, because I think you 

12

have a misimpression about the courts of appeals, and 

13

how it has been working in the courts of appeals, which 

14

is some of the courts have adopted a goodfaith 

15

standard, but they are putting very onerous requirements 

16

on the EEOC in terms of looking at 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We don't have adopt a 

18

good  we don't have to adopt a goodfaith standard. 

19

We  we could simply say that if you are really trying 

20

to conciliate, there are a few things that you got to 

21

do.  And one of them is to make an offer.  Is that 

22

difficult to figure out? 

23

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

There are several problems 

24

with that.  The first of all is that the statute says 

25

that the process is supposed to be informal and this is

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adding a level of formality to it.  The second thing is 

2

that 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

We're looking  we're 

4

looking for a safety net, we said, please, tell us 

5

what the minimum rule is.  You don't  you have not 

6

articulated a minimum rule.  All you say is I can't 

7

think of one. 

8

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, I'm saying that 
And that doesn't answer 

10

Justice Breyer's question, and our general question, how 

11

do you want us to write what you want to hold in this 

12

case? 

13

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15
16

What I'd like the Court 
All I hear is no review, 

period, goodbye. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, I don't want to 

17

hear we sent letters.  I  I'm positing the 

18

hypothetical:  You sent letters, but when they called 

19

you said, we're going to trial.  You didn't make  no 

20

discussion whatsoever.  You sent the letter, they called 

21

and said, let's sit down, and you  and the government 

22

says, no.  Okay? 

23

 Tell me how we  how we write a decision 

24

that avoid  that addresses that kind of case. 

25

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, we do think that the

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision that the Court should write should focus on 

2

what the obligation is that's on the EEOC, the 

3

particular text that Congress enacted.  And the 

4

obligation that's on the EEOC is that before it can sue, 

5

it has to have been unable to secure from the respondent 

6

a conciliation agreement acceptable to the commission. 

7

So if that's 

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Fine, then what is the 

Court supposed to do to determine whether that 

10

obligation is met?  So far, I think your answer is 

11

nothing. 

12

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think what the Court is 

13

supposed to do is if it's controverted, look at the 

14

letters indicating that there was an effort that was 

15

made by the EEOC and, as a general matter, not look 

16

behind those.  I mean, there was 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So trust you? 

 a yearlong process 
Just trust you? 

Well 
The other side is 

22

challenging with whatever evidence it has.  Maybe it's 

23

voluminous  affidavits, records  and you say, trust 

24

us.  Here's a letter saying we did it.  That's the end 

25

of the case.

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

There's significant 

2

incentives that operate on agencies even when there's 

3

not judicial review.  In this case, for example, the 

4

EEOC has substantial resource that don't allow it to 

5

sue 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But there are 

7

incentives on most people to tell the truth most of the 

8

time, but that doesn't mean that's the end of it. 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

There is also review by the 

10

President and by Congress, Congressional committees. 

11

There are actually reports that are required every year 

12

to Congress in the statute itself. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Ms. Saharsky, I don't even 

14

agree with you about the incentives.  I think, as the 

15

other side points out, there is considerable incentive 

16

on the EEOC to fail in conciliation so that it can bring 

17

a bigdeal lawsuit and get a lot of press and put a lot 

18

of pressure on this employer and on other employers. 

19

There are real incentives to have conciliation fail. 

20

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I don't think that that's 

21

true in most cases; and even in highprofile cases where 

22

the EEOC may believe that there's a very serious, 

23

substantial claim of employment discrimination, it is 

24

always easier to come to an agreement then to have to go 

25

through the burdens of litigation.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The EEOC finds reasonable cause in 

2

approximately 3500 charges every year.  It only has the 

3

resources to litigate in about 130 of them.  That's as 

4

of 2013.  So there are 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Alright. I know what your 

6

position is, but assume ours is just the hypothetical. 

7

It doesn't mean you've lost, but ours is that we have to 

8

give some teeth to judicial review greater than what 

9

you're suggesting. 

10

 Justice Kennedy asked you once. 

I'm asking 

11

you  or I asked you once before, he's asked again, and 

12

I'm asking again. 

13

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

Right.  And that's 
Give us  give us what 

you don't want. 

16

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right.  And the reason 
Give us a way to write 

18

it that gives you the least  the less intrusion  the 

19

least intrusion but more than what you want to do. 

20

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes.  And to be frank, the 

21

reason that this is a struggle is because the courts of 

22

appeals, even those that have tried to put a minimum 

23

good faith standard in place, have seen these standards 

24

spiral out of control and lead to significant collateral 

25

litigation.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So I don't mean  I understand the effort 

2

that you're looking for, Justice Sotomayor, and I will 

3

do my best to provide that guidance; but I'm telling you 

4

that even in the three circuits that have tried to use a 

5

minimal goodfaith standard, they have been scrutinizing 

6

everything that the EEOC has been doing, all of the 

7

letters back and forth. 

8
9

 You've gotten into situations where you're 
even deposing EEOC investigators in district courts, and 

10

that's one thing that  if I could just back up, 

11

because I think this is a really important point, is 

12

that there are four various, serious problems that this 

13

has led to in the district courts and in the courts of 

14

appeals. 

15

 We're talking about mini trials on a 

16

collateral issue that's not the merits of the 

17

discrimination but on this question of whether the EEOC 

18

tried hard enough, and it is not the case that the EEOC 

19

is failing to conciliate.  The EEOC is attempting 

20

conciliation in these cases.  Petitioner can't identify 

21

cases in which it has not conciliated at all.  What 

22

they're saying is that we didn't try hard enough, and 

23

that requires these mini trials. 

24
25

 The second very serious problem with all the 
standards the courts of appeals have adopted is that

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they have to make up standards that appear nowhere in 

2

the statute, and they have struggled.  These five 

3

guidelines that Petitioner now proposes appeared for the 

4

first time in their Supreme Court brief.  These are not 

5

the standards they were urging to the district court. 

6

And they're not 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8

with that IRS case? 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

What about that analogy 

I think that that is a good 

10

analogy because the Court recognized that it would not 

11

be appropriate to secondguess 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So could we copy that, you 

13

know, copy that, making appropriate changes, and 

14

say, look, Judge, you have to see  you have their 

15

affidavit.  As long as you think that affidavit really 

16

was the bottom line, we did conciliate it unless you 

17

have good reason to think that isn't so.  That's the end 

18

of it, unless there is evidence of an abuse of process 

19

that we'll allow you to go further because conciliation, 

20

mediation is really a matter that Congress intended to 

21

leave up to the agency. 

22

 And even what sounds minimal, minimal, at 

23

least the agency has to make an offer.  Maybe they 

24

don't.  Maybe the best way to conciliate it is you sit 

25

there and say, well, you know, that can be in some 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

circumstance.
 So you  you  what about some? 

Is that 

not possible? 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes.  I take your point, 

5

Justice Breyer.  I think there are some modifications 

6

that I would make to it, but I think 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

9

What? 
 towards the end of your 

question, you actually raise a really important 

10

ancillary point, which is that the process of trying to 

11

come to a negotiation and conclusion with someone often 

12

requires an element of strategy, that you might wait for 

13

them to make the first offer or you might find someone 

14

who says, we're never going to come to an agreement on 

15

this.  And that's happened in some cases; and, yet, 

16

those folks still come into court and say, The EEOC 

17

didn't try hard enough.  Well, you told us you were 

18

never going to come to an agreement. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what has been going 

20

on, in fact, in these cases now with some courts having 

21

just general good faith, others having a three factor 

22

test? 

23
24
25

 You raised a problem here that the EEOC was 
hit with a bunch of interrogatories. 
 Has that been going on? 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes.  The EEOC is really


2


faced with  you know, is really between a rock and a 


3


hard place.  It does its best to conciliate and it never 

4

knows whether some court is going to find it to be 


5


insufficient later.  The EEOC is attempting to maintain 

6

the confidentiality of these proceedings.  When 

7

employers are in conciliation, of course they want it to 

8

be confidential, but then when this gets to court, they 

9

say, oh, we don't care about confidentiality anymore. 

10

Let's all put it before the court, but the problem is 

11

that has effects for later cases.  Once employers know 

12

and the commission knows that this is all going to come 

13

out and what Petitioner proposes, it really destroys the 

14

 the conciliation process.  It's really a bedrock 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you disagree that they 

can publish it in the New York Times if they want? 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, partially, the  the 

18

confidentiality provision has two portions to it.  The 

19

first says that the EEOC can't make public what 

20

happened. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

MS. SAHARSKY: 

23

Right. 

So that does not apply to 


employers. 

24

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right. 

But the second part says that 


48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

it can't be used as evidence in a court proceeding 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Because that isn't 

credible. 

4

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

the New York Times, is it? 

7

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

 and that does apply. 
That's not publishing it in 

Right, but I think in most of 

8

these cases, the employers have not wanted this 

9

information while they've been in conciliation to become 

10
11

public because they would 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That only cuts your own 

12

argument.  I mean, you're  you're worrying about 

13

their  their publishing it, and then you say they have 

14

no incentive to publish it.  But if they want it 

15

published, they can publish it in the New York Times. 

16

They don't have to bring a lawsuit to do it. 

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right, but what they can't do 

18

is use the evidence in court.  And we think that when 

19

you look at the statute and the text that Congress 

20

enacted, it reflects a recognition that what Congress 

21

was defining, an informal endeavor to settle a case, is 

22

the kind of thing that shouldn't be public and that 

23

shouldn't be the subject of court proceedings. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You say that, but it didn't 

say that it shouldn't be public.  They said it shouldn't 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be use in court proceedings.  That's quite different

2

from saying it shouldn't be public. 

3
4
5
6
7

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Fine, and I'll focus on the 

fact 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So why do you say the 

opposite? 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I'm sorry.  I spoke with a 

8

shorthand, that it can't be made public by the 

9

commission; but you're right, it also can't be used in 

10

court proceedings.  And that's really a bar on the type 

11

of farreaching judicial review that is sought in this 

12

case. 

13

 I mean, Petitioner's view essentially 

14

destroys the benefits of informal settlement processes 

15

because the benefits of them are that they can be 

16

informal, that they can be cheap, that they can be 

17

quick, and that they stay confidential. 

18

 Now, nothing's going to stay confidential. 

19

Employers don't have an incentive to conciliate, and 

20

that courts have to expend this massive effort on 

21

something  and I think this is an important point 

22

that's really ancillary to the main event. 

23

 What this statute is about, Title VII, is 

24

eliminating employment discrimination; and it has a 

25

number of steps that the agency goes through in order to 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

get that to happen.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You said a moment 

ago that employees have no incentive to conciliate. 

4

 Why is that? 

5

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think that when employers 

6

know that they have a potential defense that would get 

7

the lawsuit dismissed on the merits, they start to treat 

8

the conciliation as an opportunity 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

10

assuming bad faith on their part. 

11

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You're kind of 

I'm not assuming 
We're supposed to 

13

assume complete good faith on the Government's part and 

14

bad faith on this employer's part. 

15

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

That's not true.  I direct 

16

the Court to Footnote 13 in our brief, which is where 

17

lawyers for these employers are directing them to treat 

18

the conciliation effort as one to set up a defense for 

19

trial. 

20

 So I'm not suggesting that there is just 

21

necessarily bad faith.  What I'm saying to the Court is 

22

that this is happening, the results of what has happened 

23

in the courts of appeals, trying to come up with these 

24

standards is that there's been a real problem with folks 

25

not using conciliation to try to come to an agreement,

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 MS. SAHARSKY:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

All this stuff is in 

footnotes, that's where all the important stuff is. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's a rule of S.G. brief 

writing, right? 

14

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, you would know. 
Exactly.  It does  I mean, 

16

here are two preconditions to endeavoring to conciliate 

17

a claim, right?  One is we actually told them what we 

18

were objecting to, and the second is we talked. 

19

 So could we just have the EEOC come in with 

20

an affidavit saying, we told them what we were objecting 

21

to and we talked and it didn't work? 

22

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes.  Although, for your 

23

second point, just to  not to be too picky about it, 

24

but sometimes these communications happen over letter 

25

and email, so it might not be talking.

point out to the Court, though, in terms of the

notice of what

that; is that right? 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

But you would not object to 

Well, not that the EEOC would

to the extent 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

There wasn't enough 

information. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 that  so this goes back 

to the Chief Justice's first question. 
 To the extent that somebody comes in and 

20

says either they never told me what this case was 

21

about  that is, they never told me what the claim 

22

was  or they never communicated with me, that that 

23

would be a fair thing to review that doesn't get into 

24

your sort of spiraling out of control, what  you know, 

25

how hard did you try, and what positions did you take 

53

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

3
4

Right, I mean 
But just we told them what 

the claim is, and we talked about the claim. 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Right.  And two points to 

5

make about that.  The first is, I think there is a 

6

concern about the spiralling out of control.  You didn't 

7

tell us enough; that's essentially what Petitioner is 

8

saying in this case.  We want more information, we want 

9

more information, et cetera.  So I put that on the 

10

table. 

11

 But the second point, and this goes to the 

12

first thing you suggested, is that the commission is 

13

required to make a reasonable cause determination, and 

14

that does provide notice to the employer about what has 

15

been found through the investigation.  So in this case 

16

it said:  We have determined that  that there is 

17

reasonable cause to support that in your  in your 

18

mining facilities, you have failed to hire a class of 

19

women for mining  for mining jobs, and that's what the 

20

problem was.  So I think to some extent what you're 

21

saying in terms of identifying the problem already 

22

happens through the reasonable cause determination. 

23

 And one point, if I could, I would just like 

24

to make sure that the Court gets is in terms of the 

25

the real problems with trying to come up with a standard 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and the problems that the courts of appeals have seen.

2

I mentioned the minitrials that are collateral to the 

3

main event, the fact that the Court has to make up 

4

standards.  You know, I can see the difficulties with 

5

making up standards just from our discussion today.  But 

6

then there's also needing to jury rig the 

7

confidentiality provisions.  They do say not to use in 

8

court and that's what Petitioner is talking about, is 

9

really a full court review of everything said and done 

10

during conciliation.  And if the Court has any doubt 

11

about what that is, I would point the Court to the 

12

footnotes again and the discussion in our brief that 

13

talks about, even when a court said it's just good faith 

14

review, those courts disagreed about what does that mean 

15

and what do we have to do, et cetera, et cetera. 

16

 And if the Court today announced five 

17

factors or something like that, the Court would no doubt 

18

be faced with future cases about, what does this factor 

19

mean and what does this factor mean, and whatever else. 

20

That's  I mean, aside from the fact that the standard 

21

is completely made up. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's the world.  That's 

23

the world.  There's always litigation over  over 

24

stuff.  I mean, you  you want to be exempt from any 

25

litigation over whether a particular standard has been 

55

met or not?

2

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4
5

I think the problem 
That's extraordinary.  That 

does not exist in this world. 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

What I think is 

6

extraordinary, Justice Scalia, is reading something into 

7

a statute that doesn't exist, which is 

8

standards in the statute. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

there are no 

That's fine.  And if you 

10

don't like that, if you're worried  number one, this 

11

Court could set forth standards one, two, three, four, 

12

five; you have to do this, this, this, this, and this.  I 

13

would prefer not to do that.  And if you leave it to the 

14

lower courts to do it, each lower court is going to have 

15

a different  a different set of things. 

16

 But the remedy for that is  is at your 

17

hands.  As the other side said, you could issue rules 

18

which say, this is an informal process, but what it 

19

consists of is, number one, we give you notice of what 

20

the  what the offense is; we sit down with you to 

21

discuss settlement of that; number three, we make 

22

apparent to you what our offer is for settling the 

23

matter, and whatever other rudiments of conciliation the 

24

agency believes in. 

25

 What's wrong with that? 

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, the  the agency has

2

not done that because it needs flexibility in these 

3

processes and because it doesn't believe that this is 

4

judicially reviewable.  I think the idea about putting 

5

regulations in place assumes that there is going to be 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So if we tell you it's 

7

it's judicially reviewable  suppose we just decide 

8

it's judicially reviewable and remand for the agency to 

9

issue rules? 

10

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes, then the agency would do 

11

that.  But the agency hasn't done it up to this point 

12

because what it does instead of setting out regulations, 

13

because it doesn't believe that this gives a private 

14

right to  to employers to enforce, is it has its own 

15

training procedures about good ways to do conciliation 

16

and the steps to be taken. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I  I'm not a conciliator 

18

or a mediator, but those I know who are might be able to 

19

create such rules.  On the other hand, they might not. 

20

It might be that conciliation is a process that in part 

21

is intuitive.  So to require the agency to set forth 

22

rules of consideration is to invite judicial review of 

23

compliance with those rules. 

24

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think that's 
And that is, I think, your

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

point.  And I don't think it's a minor point.  I think 

2

it's rather important.  If the conciliation process is 

3

actually to work, let it go. 

4

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think you're right, that to 

5

a significant extent the conciliation is more an art 

6

than a science.  It depends on the facts of the case and 

7

it depends on the relationship with an employer.  If the 

8

employer said, we're never going to come to an 

9

agreement, that would change how much information the 

10

conciliation, the  how far along the conciliation 

11

might go or how many offers the commission might make. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But I thought Justice 

13

Breyer said you have to make the phone call if your 

14

letter says it's going to make the phone call.  I 

15

thought Justice Breyer believed that there are some 

16

rudiments. 

17

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19
20

I think that 
We're just talking about 

what the rudiments are.

conciliation  what are the three words? Conference,

Conference, conciliation, and

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think  I think it's

2

helpful to focus back on that language that Congress put 

3

in place, because we think that it did not intend and 

4

did not show any intention to put any kind of specific 

5

requirements like that on the commission.  It said 

6

endeavor to eliminate the employment discrimination.  I 

7

think 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why does it  in 

terms of additionally saying, yes, we called them, how 

10

can you conciliate  this question has been asked; I 

11

don't know that we've gotten an answer  without 

12

telling them what you want?  I want  we think there's 

13

a class; we think it's this many; we think their damages 

14

claims are, you know, 15 million.  What do you think 

15

about that? 

16

 You don't have to  then that's the end of 

17

it.  You don't have to say, we'll take ten, or anything 

18

else.  They need to know at least what you want. 

19
20
21

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, two thoughts about 

that.  Three thoughts. 
 First, the reasonable cause determination 

22

gives them notice about what the discrimination 

23

alleged discrimination is. 

24
25

 Two, the commission does as a general rule 
provide this information about what it is interested in 

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

getting.
 Third, though, there are tactics in 

3

conciliations where one side might wait for the other 

4

side to make an offer, et cetera, et cetera.  And it's 

5

really that kind of secondguessing that we think is a 

6

serious problem. 

7

 One thing that I think is useful is to step 

8

back and look at what would happen under our view of the 

9

world as opposed to Petitioner's view of the world. 

10

Under our view of the world, we believe that the EEOC is 

11

conciliating and has significant incentives to 

12

conciliate.  But if we're wrong about that, the worst 

13

case is a trial about the employment discrimination on 

14

the merits, that we actually move on to the main event 

15

and answer the question, which is  that the EEOC has 

16

been investigating:  Was there discrimination here?  And 

17

we typically see that as a good thing in our American 

18

society. 

19

 But what is the downside of Petitioner's 

20

position is really this long  minitrials that are 

21

collateral to the merits that happen to have  that 

22

have to happen and are happening in a majority of cases. 

23

They take up significant court resources, and they're 

24

not supposed to happen because of the confidentiality 

25

requirements.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You want to go 

2

you want to go to  Congress wanted you to try to 

3

conciliate. 

4

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
So to say that it's 

6

a good thing to get to the merits it seems to me is not 

7

 doesn't take account of what Congress said, which is, 

8

before you go to the merits, try to conciliate. 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

What I'm trying to say, Mr. 

10

Chief Justice, is that the point of Title VII is to stop 

11

employment discrimination, and that's what we're trying 

12

to do. 

13

 And so getting to the main event, which is, 

14

has there been employment discrimination, as opposed to 

15

giving employers this private right that Congress never 

16

intended, we do think is a good thing.  We think that 

17

this has gone too far in the courts of appeals, it's not 

18

what Congress intended, it's led to significant 

19

consequences for the courts and for the agency, and it's 

20

hurting conciliation. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, we'll just say 

22

I'm going to say one more time, I think there's 

23

substantial merit to your position that the courts have 

24

gone too far.  But you have given us no midway, no  no 

25

alternative. 

61

Alderson Reporting Company

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well 
Other than to say, no 

3

judicial review.  And I think that's a serious  it's a 

4

serious suggestion to make. 

5

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think that there are some 

6

options that Justice Kagan laid out, along with Justice 

7

Breyer, in terms of some minimal requirements for the 

8

agency.  But the point that I would just like to make 

9

clear to the Court is that they're nothing like what's 

10

happening in the court of appeals.  And some of those 

11

courts of appeals start at the same place where some 

12

members of the Court are today, which just  which is, 

13

let's just ask for a minimal level of good faith review, 

14

and it is nonetheless the case that it has devolved into 

15

really searching review that can't be justified on the 

16

statute's text.

 Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24

 I'm going to work on the assumption that the 

25

Court is going to find that there needs to be some 

Thank you. 

62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

judicial review.  Then the Court is going to face the

2

following question:  Should it announce the rudiments, 

3

or should it simply reverse the court of appeals? 

4

Because all the court of appeals said is that there is 

5

no judicial review after the letter.  The ordinary 

6

practice of the Court would be decide what the court of 

7

appeals did, and you've been assured by the agency that 

8

if you do do that the agency will promulgate the 

9

rudiments, and so there's a good reason to do that. 

10

 But you have been interested in what the 

11

rudiments would be.  Here's what they are.  They're 

12

taken directly from the cases and from the statute.  The 

13

first obligation is to conference.  We think the 

14

rudiment of conference is you tell the employer:  Get in 

15

touch.  If you want to conciliate, the employer says, I 

16

want to talk.  You are willing to talk, if it's by 

17

letter, if it's by phone, if it's in person.  That's the 

18

rudiment of conferencing. 

19

 Conciliation. 

If we're going to endeavor to 

20

resolve this by conciliation, I have to tell you what 

21

the minimum will be.  The reasonable cause determination 

22

doesn't say that.  It says, we're going to sue you; it 

23

doesn't say what it would take to resolve the case.  So 

24

I've got to tell you what it would be at a minimum, and 

25

that has to be 

63

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Do

you want them to put their minimum offer on the table? 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, no, no. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That's a necessary part of 

5
6

conciliation? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Kagan, not their 

7

minimum, the following:  That is, if I'm the 

8

employer and I say, I want to talk, here's my offer, the 

9

EEOC can't steadfastly refuse to say what would be an 

10

acceptable conciliation, their  their absolute last 

11

best offer.  If that's their position, then they have no 

12

intention to conciliate. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That's just good faith 

14

bargaining.  Then all you're doing is referring us to a 

15

body of law in both labor and contracts for good faith 

16

bargaining. 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

20
21

The only 
And that is a morass. 
Justice Kennedy, I'm giving 

some  a few basic things. 
 I will say about that that that is the 

22

statutory scheme that Congress enacted in the NLRA, and 

23

the board has issued regulations about that. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Now, we just started with 

a tremendous difference. 

64

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 A mutual obligation to bargain and the

2

subjects of bargaining are wellknown.  You're can 

3

bargain about wages.  You can bargain about hours, about 

4

working conditions.  This is quite different. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Ginsburg, could I 

6

just briefly get out the rudiments, because I think 

7

there's been significant interest in that.  The offer 

8

that they say, what will be acceptable to us, has to be 

9

something they could legally get.  That is to say it's a 

10

claim that's in the reasonable cause determination and 

11

it's something that they could get in court. 

12

 And persuasion is just to provide the basics 

13

of where that comes from.  You can't expect the employer 

14

or the employer's insurer to say, okay, I'll give you a 

15

million dollars, if the EEOC won't even say where  the 

16

basics of where the million dollars came from.  That is 

17

to say, we've got about 20 employees; we think that 

18

their damages are roughly $50,000. 

19
20

 This is not an intrusive inquiry into the 
details of 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why is it satisfactory 
That is intrusive.  I mean, 

23

you're doing your best job of proving Ms. Saharsky's 

24

point here, because you're saying they have to put all 

25

the reasons on the table, they have to say why it is 

65

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that they're asking for what it is that they're asking

2

for, they have to say, you know, what they would be 

3

the only  the last thing that they would find 

4

acceptable.

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Justice Kagan 
In the context, just 

7

to  where we're not supposed to look at any of that 

8

stuff at all? 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

We disagree with that, 

10

obviously, Mr. Chief Justice.  I am trying to illustrate 

11

for the Court that, despite the rhetoric of the EEOC, 

12

this is a statute that has been administered for 4 

13

decades 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you have any other 

rudiments?  Because you're running out of time. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, I don't have any other 

17

rudiments.  Those are all my rudiments.  But I think the 

18

better course here is:  They say they have training and 

19

guidelines.  They say they know how to do this.  But the 

20

game here is for them to say, but we don't want to 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Shouldn't the game be on 

22

you?  They come in and say, we conciliated.  Shouldn't 

23

you have to waive confidentiality and set forth

circumstances?  I'm going back to Justice Breyer's point

Yes, yes, yes, yes. 
 to set forth the 

circumstances.  All right?  But you didn't do that here. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Justice Sotomayor, 

10

what happened is, we've stated an affirmative defense, 

11

and they moved to dismiss as a matter of law on the 

12

ground that the statute was unenforceable.  The case 

13

never went anywhere.  We never had an opportunity to do 

14

any of those things. 

15

 We think that there is a presumption of 

16

regularity, but it's called the presumption of 

17

regularity because then you can disprove it.  We don't 

18

assume that agencies follow the law.  We don't have a 

19

administrative law gets upended if you announce a rule 

20

that says, this is a broad statute that gives a lot of 

21

 the agency a lot of flexibility; we won't enforce it.
