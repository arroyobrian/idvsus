CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We’ll hear

4

argument this morning in Case 09-559, John Doe v. Reed,

5

Washington Secretary of State.

Mr. Bopp.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. BOPP:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
No person should suffer harassment for

12

participating in our political system, and the First

13

Amendment protects citizens from intimidation resulting

14

from compelled disclosure of their identity and beliefs

15

and their private associations.

16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

requiring disclosure of campaign contributions?

18

MR. BOPP:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

What -- what about

Well, the -Do you think that is

unconstitutional?
MR. BOPP:

This Court has upheld the

22

disclosure in Buckley v. Valeo in 1976.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

Now, why doesn't

24

that fall within your principle that no person should be

25

exposed to criticism for --

MR. BOPP:

Well, it could --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. BOPP:

-- his political beliefs?

It could potentially, and -- but

4

this Court subjected those requirements to the

5

appropriate constitutional First Amendment analysis,

6

found that there was sufficiently important governmental

7

interest, some of which are not present when we’re

8

talking about a referendum or initiative, and then also

9

created an exception from even a generally valid statute

10

where there is a reasonable probability of harassment of

11

that particular individual or -- or group.
So the First Amendment analysis regarding

12
13

the privacy of association, the privacy of identity and

14

beliefs, the potential of -- of intimidation are all

15

elements of the analysis that was employed by the Court

16

in Buckley.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I’m -- I'm trying to separate

18

out the harassment aspects of this case from the working

19

proposition that there’s some sort of freedom of

20

association, of privacy.

21

Your theory, putting harassment aside, would

22

invalidate all of the State laws that require disclosure

23

of voter registration lists, correct?

24

States like New York that permit public review of voter

25

registration lists and party affiliations, et cetera --

4
Alderson Reporting Company

All of those

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's illegal?

2

MR. BOPP:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. BOPP:

No.

No.

That's unconstitutional?

We believe they would not.

5

They would certainly be subject to First Amendment

6

analysis.

7

voter registration, there are other governmental

8

interests that are not present in petition signings for

9

referendums.

10

But in -- in those -- in the instance of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Explain to me the

11

difference.

12

legislative -- I can only work from New York because I

13

know it intimately, but it is a State that also permits

14

or requires that petitions for candidate listing on the

15

ballot be public as well.

16

this State does, on the public reviewing those

17

petitions.

18

candidate's running?

19

And -- well, one other aspect of State

New York relies in part, as

Would that be invalid as well, for a

MR. BOPP:

Well, we believe it would be

20

subject to First Amendment analysis.

21

are different governmental interests when you have

22

candidates involved.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, again, there

So explain to me what

the difference is in those three situations.
MR. BOPP:

Well, one is you have candidates

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

involved --

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

With -- with the State's

interest.

4

MR. BOPP:

One is you have candidates

5

involved.

And this Court recognized in Buckley that

6

there were disclosure interests that related

7

specifically, and actually only, to candidates.

8

instance, people who contribute to a candidate, that

9

information, to the voter, can signal the interests that

For

10

the candidate, once he or she takes office, will be

11

responsive to.

12

When we have an initiative, we know what the

13

law is that is being voted upon.

14

of -- of electing a representative.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's not a matter

You don't think that --

16

putting aside this kind of referendum, just a

17

hypothetical referendum having to do with a certain tax

18

scheme -- you don't think the voters would be interested

19

in knowing what kinds of people in what occupations are

20

interested in that particular tax benefit or not?

21

MR. BOPP:

Well, a few -- few might be, but

22

we think this is marginal information.

First, they are

23

adopting a law.

24

and while it might be marginal information for a few

25

people, once the measure qualifies for the ballot, this

And so we know what the law is.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

And --

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is only -- the petition signature and distribution is

2

only for a very limited governmental interest.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. BOPP:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Counsel --

And that -- and that -I'm sorry, go ahead

and finish your answer.

7

MR. BOPP:

And that limited governmental

8

interest is to preserve State money, to not conduct an

9

election on the matter unless there is sufficient public

10

support.

So -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

Now, counsel, the

12

responses you have given to a couple of the questions

13

has been that the First Amendment analysis would apply.

14

But given you have a facial challenge, is that enough?

15

Don't you have to indicate that the First Amendment

16

analysis would prevail in either all of the other cases,

17

most of the other cases, a significant portion?
This is a facial challenge.

18

And if the

19

challenge is going to fail in some of those other cases,

20

I think your facial challenge fails as well.

21

MR. BOPP:

Well, we’re only challenging the

22

application of the Public Records Act to petitions and

23

referendum petitions.

24

would be applied to petitions to put people on the

25

ballot.

We're not challenging it as it

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we have to decide,

2

in assessing your claim that, no matter what the

3

referendum issue was, that there's a significant

4

intrusion on First Amendment rights?

5

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that if, for

7

example, the referendum involves a bond issue as to

8

which people may have particular views, but they’re not

9

going to get terribly excited about it, we’d still have to

10

say that that’s protected under the First Amendment?
MR. BOPP:

11

Well, actually, under -- with

12

modern technology, it only takes a few dedicated

13

supporters, and a computer, who are willing to map -- to

14

put this information on the Internet, MapQuest it, as

15

they did with respect to the contributors of

16

Proposition 8, which resulted in -- and then encourage

17

people to harass and intimidate them, which resulted in

18

hundreds of examples of harassment --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, my point is,

20

though, you’re not likely to get that with respect to,

21

you know, a debt issue, raising the debt ceiling from

22

0.8 percent to 0.9 percent.

23

crowd outside your house because you signed that

24

petition.

25

MR. BOPP:

You’re not going to get a

Well, it may not manifest itself

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in -- in any particular initiative.

2

but we think the potential is there, and there is

3

usually a group of supporters of any measure that, you

4

know, are passionate about that particular issue.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We agree with that,

But -- but don't you

6

have -- I thought we were dealing with count 1 of the

7

complaint.

8

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Count 2 would be the

10

counterpart to the exception that’s made from the

11

disclosure requirement with regard to contributions with

12

certain organizations whose members might be harassed.

13

MR. BOPP:

Well, with this --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's -- that's not --

15

that would still be open if you lose the first part of

16

this case.

17

So going back to the question you were

18

asked, how does this differ -- that Justice Scalia

19

asked -- how does this differ from the contributor who

20

says, well, I might be harassed?

21

would have an opportunity to show that.
MR. BOPP:

22

The contributor

Buckley dealt with that exact

23

question.

And first -- the first step of the analysis

24

is whether or not the law is -- is valid under the First

25

Amendment.

And then there is an exception to even a

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

valid constitutional -- a constitutionally valid law.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

So, that's why I’m asking

3

you why, on the first part, should it be any different,

4

as long as you have the door open to show that if you

5

were going to suffer reprisals, harassment, that an

6

exception would have to be made?

7

MR. BOPP:

Well, we don't think that the exception

8

is a substitute for considering the initial validity of

9

the law, which -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

May I -- may I ask you

11

one -- something that was not in your brief, but was in

12

the Secretary's brief.

13

Project Marriage?

14

Secretary Reed's brief, the statement is made that the

15

sponsoring organizations sometimes sell or trade these

16

18

side.

19

these lists?

They use them for fundraising purposes.

So that

Is that true, that the initiative sponsor uses

20

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. BOPP:

Yes?

Yes, this is an act of private

23

association.

The petition signers are associating with

24

the referendum committee for purposes of placing this

25

measure on the ballot --

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They don't say:

Now, I

2

agree you can use my name for fundraising purposes.

3

that's -- it's implicit, you say, in their signing the

4

petition that the --

5

MR. BOPP:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what --- signature collector

7

can sell the names, use them for its own fundraising

8

purposes?

9

MR. BOPP:

But

What is implicit is they are

10

associating with this group for a purpose, and that is

11

support for, in this case, Referendum 71.

12

use those names for valid purposes.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so they

But --

Mr. Bopp, do you have any

14

case in which we have held that the First Amendment

15

applies to activity that consists of the process of

16

legislation, of legislating --

17

MR. BOPP:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19
20

Yes, Buckley II.
-- or of adopting legislation?

What is that?
MR. BOPP:

Buckley II.

You struck down the

21

requirement that the person who is soliciting signatures

22

self-identify.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

MR. BOPP:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is --

That is a process -Soliciting signatures is not

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taking part in the process of legislating.

2

MR. BOPP:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -The person who requests a

4

referendum is taking -- when there's a certain number of

5

signatures required to achieve it, is taking part in

6

that.

7

And in light of the fact that for the first

8

century of our existence, even voting was public -- you

9

either did it raising your hand or by voice, or later,

10

you had a ballot that was very visibly red or blue so

11

that people knew which party you were voting for -- the

12

fact is that running a democracy takes a certain amount

13

of civic courage.

14

protect you from criticism or even nasty phone calls

15

when you exercise your political rights to legislate or

16

to take part in the legislative process.

And the First Amendment does not

MR. BOPP:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Well, the -You are asking us to enter

into a whole new field where we’ve never gone before.
MR. BOPP:

20

Well, with all due respect, you

21

have already opined in Buckley II that the person on the

22

other side of the clipboard is protected by the First

23

Amendment.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
that's true of Buckley II.

I don't think that's --

What was -- what this Court

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

said could not be done is that the solicitor could not

2

be made to wear a badge that says "I am a paid

3

solicitor," but that the solicitor's name had to be

4

identified for the State.

5

there was an affidavit, and there was the filings with

6

whatever was the State agency.

7

Certainly, the solicitor --

So what was -- what this Court said could

8

not be done was this kind of in-your-face big button

9

that says "I am a paid solicitor," but the solicitor's

10

name and address certainly had to be disclosed.

11

MR. BOPP:

That is true.

12

described Buckley II.

13

this case, the public disclosure of the petition names

14

in this case -- there was a planned harassment and

15

intimidation of these voters by --

But as we can see in the facts of

MR. BOPP:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

Under the -Well, if that's so,

then under Claiborne Hardware, which I -- I notice you

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't cite in your brief, but if -- if that's so,

2

then it seems to me that the State's -- or

3

that -- that the signers' interest in keeping their

4

names private is somewhat diminished.

5

MR. BOPP:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

It's a First Amendment

activity.

8
9

Yes.

MR. BOPP:

But what we're -- but what is

involved here that is not involved there is the

10

requirement by the government that you publicly disclose

11

your identity and beliefs on a matter that then --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- just --

13

MR. BOPP -- subjects you to the boycott.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let me stop you there,

15

because I think your -- your own brief, I think you said

16

twice that you cannot tell anything about the signer's

17

belief from the mere signature.

18

support for -- for the proposition or it could be just

19

support for letting the people decide.

MR. BOPP:

That is -Or it could even be, you

22

say, that this solicitor is pesky, and in order to

23

placate the solicitor, to get rid of the solicitor, we’ll

the signing itself is ambiguous.

The highlighted box at the top, you know,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I call your attention

11

to page 20 of your reply brief?

Because I don't think

12

that your response was correct.

You say:

13

signers support the repeal, simply indicate they would

14

like public election to be held, or simply sign to avoid

15

any further discussion with the petition circulator?
MR. BOPP:

16

Do petition

I acknowledge that we said that,

17

Justice Ginsburg.

18

is -- and which I think is the dominant statement and

19

certainly sufficient -- and that is that we want a measure

20

to be placed on the ballot in order for the people to

21

vote.

22

And, of course, the second statement

That is one of the central -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Bopp, if a voter --

23

if the legislature passes a statute and someone is -- is

24

satisfied with that statute, how likely is it that that

25

person is going to sign a petition to have a referendum

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

to see whether the statute should be blocked?
MR. BOPP:

I think it's very unlikely.

But

3

it -- we acknowledge it's possible, but we think it's

4

very unlikely.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's possible --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But --- but if you were in the

8

real world, if you were to poll the people who sign a

9

referendum petition with respect to a statute that was

10

passed by the State legislature, what percentage do you

11

think would be opposed to that legislation?

12

MR. BOPP:

Very few.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so Justice Alito's

14

question points out that this would be a very slim basis

15

upon which to rest a holding in your favor.

16

And just to go back to the line of questions

17

of the first, the State of California has very

18

complicated referendum and initiative matters.

19

you think it's relevant for the public to know that,

20

say, a public employees union had paid solicitors to put

21

those signatures on the ballot, or that the Chamber of

22

Commerce or the National Association of Manufacturers had

23

paid solicitors to put this on the ballot?

24
25

Don't

Isn't that part of assessing the -- the
reasons why this initiative was proposed?

16
Alderson Reporting Company

And isn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that vital to the voters -- to the voter in making an

2

informed decision?
MR. BOPP:

3

Well, actually, after your

4

Buckley II decision, the Ninth Circuit struck down the

5

requirement of disclosing the paid circulators.

6

course, in California, petitions are not public.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They did that.

And, of

It wasn't

8

due to Buckley II, because as you just acknowledged,

9

under Buckley II, the solicitor is disclosed.

10
11

MR. BOPP:

Well, the Ninth Circuit thought

it was Buckley.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Correct me, but the point is,

13

isn't -- isn’t there an interest in knowing this

14

information?

Not -- not that it's paid.

15

MR. BOPP:

There is no evidence --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We'll leave that out.

17

But -- but to know that -- that -- the persons that

18

supported the amendment.

19

MR. BOPP:

There’s no evidence in the

20

record that that is pertinent information, and, at most,

21

we think it is marginal information.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, if we create

23

this right of -- this constitutional right of

24

association in the manner that you are describing it,

25

why is it limited to the voting area?

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Would we be inviting review if a group of

2

citizens get together and send a letter to an agency

3

that says please pass X regulation, or rescind Y

4

regulation?

5

that letter public?

6

Would the agency be prohibited from making

MR. BOPP:

Well, potentially.

And -- and

7

this Court -- I -- because it would be required to be

8

subject to a First Amendment analysis.

9

that created, in the NAACP case --

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're -- you're

suggesting -MR. BOPP:

12
13

It's this Court

-- the right of private

association.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

-- that when a

15

petitioner or a person engages in political discourse

16

with the government, that they -- when they choose to do

17

it, because the government is not compelling them to

18

write to it; it’s not compelling them to sign the

19

referendum.

20

It's just -MR. BOPP:

And they’re not compelling

21

Ms. McIntyre to distribute her brochure, either.

22

this Court held that --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

But it's -- but

24

Ms. McIntyre wasn't asking the government to engage its

25

process in her favor.

She was asking for political

For instance, they don't have to

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if

Well, to follow up on

10

Justice Sotomayor's question, do you think an agency

11

could say, if you want to comment on proposed -- on a

12

proposed rule, you have to disclose to us your name and

13

your address and your telephone number and your

14

political affiliation, and all sorts of -- your marital

15

status and your income level and all sorts of other

16

demographic information?

18

MR. BOPP:

And your employer, as in this

case here.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. BOPP:

21
22

Could they do that?

No -- no, because there is no

sufficient governmental interest that would justify it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not even just your name, so

23

they can check that this thing isn't phony and that all

24

the names on it aren't -- aren't made up by one person?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL ROBERT M. McKENNA

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. McKENNA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

6

I’d like to begin with the question of

7

how the public can bring to the attention of the

8

government that errors and fraud have been discovered.

9

First of all, it's important to understand

10

that the petitions do not become public records after

11

the verification process but, in fact, are made available

12

as public records before the verification process even

13

begins.

14

This is because the Secretary of State's

15

first step after receiving submitted petitions is to

16

take them to his archiving section and to have them

17

digitized.

18

available on disks for anyone who requests them.

19

the verification process begins.

22
23

21

As soon as they’re digitized, they’re

possible -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

talking about in those processes?
MR. McKENNA:

The verification process,

Justice Sotomayor?

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. McKENNA:

Yes.

The verification process

3

will depend on how many signatures have been

4

submitted --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, no.

I'm trying

6

to get the relationship between the disks being made

7

available and the verification process.

8

So is there a time for the public to look

9

through the disks before the people who are sent into

10

the room are sent into the room?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11
12

That's what you’ve just

said --

13

MR. McKENNA:

Yes, they’re --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- that they're --

15

that they are immediately available on the disk, and

16

so while the checking is going on by the Secretary,

17

the public has the list.

18

MR. McKENNA:

Is that what you’ve just said?
Yes, that's correct.

For

19

example, in the case of Referendum 71, the proponents of

20

the referendum submitted the petition sheets on

21

Saturday, July 25, 2009, and on Tuesday, July 28, a

22

17

MR. McKENNA:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- in

Yes, that's correct.
So there was a judgment at

19

one time by the State of Washington that it didn't --

20

that it didn't need the public records disclosure?

21

MR. McKENNA:

Well, when the initiative

22

and referendum processes were created by public vote on

23

a constitutional amendment of 1912, there was no

24

Public Records Act at all.

25

an Act of general applicability, was adopted by the

2

enacted comprehensive campaign finance reform.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, if the

4

State had a law that you could disclose voters and for

5

whom they voted, would that implicate First Amendment

6

interests?

7

MR. McKENNA:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, we

8

would -- we do believe that First Amendment interests

9

would be implicated by revealing how people voted, and

10

we don't see a legitimate State interest in knowing how

11

people voted, only in who voted.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

interest in how you vote?

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. McKENNA:

Yes.

You know, it might be

7

implicated by a potential chill from voting, if you know

8

your vote is going to be revealed.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think having

10

your name revealed on a petition of this sort might have

11

a chilling effect on whether you sign it?

12

MR. McKENNA:

Mr. Chief Justice, some

13

chill may result, just as some chill may result from

14

having your campaign contributions disclosed or the

15

fact that you have registered to vote and provided your

16

name, address, your voting history is being disclosed.

17

So some chill might be -- might result, but we do not

18

think that it is significant enough.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't think

20

revealing that you’re a voter has the same chilling

21

effect as revealing how you voted, do you?

22

MR. McKENNA:

No, I do not.

I think how

23

you voted would have a much greater chilling effect than

4

to put down not just the person's name and address, but

5

also telephone number, so that they could be engaged in

6

a conversation about what they had done?

7

MR. McKENNA:

It -- it would depend on

8

the strength of the State interest in having the

9

telephone number.

The State does not have an interest

10

in the telephone number on the petition form, because

the State has -- only needs to know from the petition

No.

The evidence in the record

is about people who were out circulating petitions,

people who were out, you know, campaigning for the

none of the evidence in the record speaks to petition

in the record that anyone who signed any of those

thinking of circulating a petition on a sensitive

subject and fears that people may be dissuaded from

could they bring this as-applied challenge?

At what point

Do they have to -- could they do it before

they even begin to circulate the petition, arguing that

5

revealed to the public on the Internet, they’re not

6

going to sign this?

7

MR. McKENNA:

Justice Alito, it would be

possible procedurally for them to bring the motion for

an injunction even before collecting the signatures --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MR. McKENNA:

13

And how would they --- if they had sufficient

evidence.
JUSTICE ALITO:

How would they prove that

14

there’s -- that there’s a -- a threat, a sufficient

15

threat of harassment in that particular case, before the

16

petition is even signed?

17

MR. McKENNA:

I believe that the

18

sponsors of the measure would bring to the court

19

evidence, if they have any, of -- because of the

20

controversial nature of that particular measure, that is

21

based on what's happened to some of the people who were

22

planning to put the measure on the ballot.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but you -- you’ve

rejected that here.

You’ve said there’s no evidence here

MR. McKENNA:

Justice Scalia, I didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

say it couldn't be acceptable.

I'm saying this is a

2

hypothetical, so I don't know what the evidence would

3

look like in the hypothetical example.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the -- the

5

hypothetical is that before this petition is circulated,

6

the supporters came into court, and they said:

7

8

Don't disclose -- enter an order prohibiting the public

9

disclosure of the names and addresses here.

10

Would that be sufficient?

11

MR. McKENNA:

Look what

Justice Alito, I think

12

that the evidence would have to be very strong.

13

would have to rise above criticism.

14

have to rise to the level of threatened violence.

15

would have to rise to the level of the Socialist Workers

MR. McKENNA:

20

In Washington State.

21

Mr. Chief Justice, we have had measures on assisted

22

suicide, for example, which was very controversial,

23

and -- and there’s no evidence involving that set of

24

petitions.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Was the referendum

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in favor or opposed to assisted suicide?

2

MR. McKENNA:

It was -- well, the

3

referendum challenges the assisted suicide law.

So if

4

you vote for the referendum, you vote to uphold the

5

legislature's adoption of that law, which -- which

6

allowed assisted suicide.

7

So there have been controversial measures.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10

This case will likely be

controlled by our First Amendment precedents, because
that's the most fully developed.
Did you look at the Petition Clause at all?

11
12

In the early days of the republic, the petitions were

13

the way in which you communicated with your legislator.

14

MR. McKENNA:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I tried to look it up.

16

I have a recollection, but I'm not sure, that those

17

petitions were sometimes put in the Congressional

18

Record.

19

Clause?

20

But did you look at the history of the Petition

MR. McKENNA:

Justice Kennedy, we have

21

considered the history of the Petition Clause, and we

22

see a basic difference between the kinds of petitions

23

under the Petition Clause and the petitions at issue

24

here because, essentially, petitioning the government

25

under the Petition Clause is asking the government to do

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

something.

2

something.

You’re petitioning them:

Please do

The petitions for a referendum or an

3
4

initiative are telling the government to do something.

5

The petition form says that I, the signer, am directing

6

the Secretary of State to conduct an election.

7

submitting these petitions in a referendum, I am

8

suspending the law which the legislature has already

9

approved until the election has taken place.

10
11

Tell versus ask.

And by

I think that's a pretty

big -- a significant difference.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

But, of course, that can

13

cut the other way, too, because then it's more like a

14

vote.

15

the -- the vote private.

16

MR. McKENNA:

And there -- there is strong interest in keeping

And, Justice Kennedy, I’d

17

like to speak to that question, because several

18

Justices asked:

19

20

to vote.

21

Well, what can we tell from what, you
Do we know how they’re going

I -- I agree that many people signing a

22

petition are going to vote in favor of -- in the case of

23

an initiative, in favor of the law the initiative would

put on the ballot.

But also we know from the social

Direct Democracy Scholars green brief, that many people

2

sign simply because they believe it's important for

3

the -- for the public to have an opportunity to vote.

4

And, of course, as the Petitioners have acknowledged and

5

we also point out, some people vote just to get around the

6

circulator and get into the store.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What percentage --

8

what percentage of the people who signed this petition

9

to put this law on the referendum do you think signed it

10

because they think these sort of things should be

11

generally put to a public vote as opposed to because

12

they opposed the law?

13

MR. McKENNA:

The percentage of people

14

who believe simply that there should be a vote held has

15

not been quantified by the research, except that several

16

scholars indicate that it is significant.

17

it's 20 percent or 40 percent, I -- I really can't say

18

within a certain --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, whether

You think as much as

20

20 percent of the people who signed this petition are

21

actually in favor of the law that it's aimed to repeal?

22

MR. McKENNA:

It is possible.

But it's

23

also possible some of those 20 percent don't have an

24

opinion on the law, Mr. Chief Justice.

25

think that there should be a vote held, and they’ll

And you mentioned that the records

And maybe you can correct my impression

be very simple to set up a Web site where the person

could put in a little bit of identifying information and

see whether that person's name is on the list?

23

the -- the purpose is to see whether a particular person

cross-reference by means of a computer program the

3

So if you've got John Jones who lives at 10

4

Main Street, you see whether there really is a

5

registered voter John Jones who lives at 10 Main Street?

6

Why does this all have to be put out on the Internet?

7

MR. McKENNA:

Justice Alito, the -- just

8

to be clear, you are right.

They do use computer --

9

computers because when -- in the verification process,

10

the Secretary of State’s staff, with the observers looking

11

over their shoulder, will look at the petition and look

12

up that voter in an -- in an electronic voter

13

registration database.

14

This is exactly why the information is so

15

useful to the public as well.

They have access to

16

electronic online voter registration history as well,

17

and they can also check.

18

In -- in Massachusetts, under their public

19

records law in 2006, petition forms obtained by public

20

records requests were put online, and over 2,000 people,

21

as has been documented in the Lambda amicus brief,

22

discovered that they -- their names are on petitions

23

that they claimed did not sign, and discovered that they

24

had been, in some cases, misled.

somebody signed your name to the petition?

MR. McKENNA:

records and chooses them to put online.

MR. McKENNA:

What we know,

2

Justice Kennedy, is that in dozens of States around

3

the -- around the country, as recently as 2009 in

4

Maryland, 2006 in Massachusetts, and so on, it was

5

the -- it was the public who requested ballot petitions

by public records request who found significant fraud

7

and error.

8

important -- it's also about finding plain old mistakes

9

which the State, Secretary of State, or auditor has

10

This isn't just about fraud -- fraud is very

missed.
That -- that does happen with regularity in

this country, and we cite cases in our brief where error

is not fraud, but errors in Washington State have been

discovered by people who look at these public records.

In --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

in regulating the non-speech component?

15

when you talk about the vote cast by an elected

representative, of course, there's a strong interest in

17

knowing how an elected representative voted, because the

18

representative is answerable to the voters.

19

somebody who signs a petition isn’t answerable to

20

anybody -- any other citizen.

MR. McKENNA:

And what's the State's interest
When you --

But

So what’s your interest?

The interest, Justice

Alito, is knowing, first of all, that there were a

JUSTICE ALITO:

It’s the fraud interest?

with just the name and address, that a large number of people

18

from a company signed it?

19

MR. McKENNA:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

Well -You don't have to

put on who you work for, do you?
MR. McKENNA:

No, you do not.

I'm

23

saying intermediaries might discover this, for example,

24

by taking a close look at who’s paying for the

25

signature gathering.

If it's paid signature gathering,

they might be aware of prominent sponsors.

2

the -- the importance of knowing who the sponsors is, is

3

demonstrated --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In fact,

I'm sorry.

I'm still

5

on the companies.

6

sponsors are tell you how many people from a particular

7

company signed the petition?

8
9

How -- how does knowing who the

MR. McKENNA:

Well, a voter who -- who

works at that same company or does business with that

10

same company might know that, gosh, I know these

11

employees, and they've -- they have all signed this

12

petition.

13

find that out.

The press might be able to do the research to
Intermediaries do play an important role.

14

The last point, if I may, I wanted to make

15

about -- about Buckley II is that the Petitioners have

16

stressed that Buckley II struck down the requirement to wear

17

the name badge.

18

upheld the requirement by Colorado that affidavits

19

signed by the petition circulators, including the

20

petition circulator's name and address, can be disclosed

21

as public records.

But in that same decision this Court

22

And the Court ruled that -- found that and

23

compared it favorably to the badge requirement because

24

the disclosures of public record occurred after the heat

25

of the moment, after the moment of interactive discussion.

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

It happened later on.

And we believe, of all the Court's

2

rulings, that -- that approval of the disclosure requirement

3

of the -- of the affidavit, in contrast to the badges, is the

4

most similar to requiring after the fact or allowing

5

after the fact for petitions to be disclosed under the

6

Public Records Act.
JUSTICE ALITO:

7

You know, if somebody called

8

your office and said I'd like the -- the home

9

address of all the attorneys who work in the Attorney

10

General’s Office because we want to -- we want to go to

11

their homes and have uncomfortable conversations with

12

them --

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

-- which is what has been

alleged here, would you release that information?
MR. McKENNA:

16

We would not, Justice

17

Alito.

We would not release it because they can come to

18

the office and have uncomfortable conversations with

19

them --

MR. McKENNA:

attest happens with some regularity.

-- which I can personally

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that information, at

least the names of those people -- isn't it probably

public information anyway?

MR. McKENNA:
Justice Scalia.

4
5

Yes, it is,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can it be obtained under

the Freedom of Information Act in this case?

6

MR. McKENNA:

Yes, it can.

Their names,

7

their office locations, their office phone numbers,

8

their office e-mails is all a matter of public record in

9

our State.

Thank you very much.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES BOPP, JR.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. BOPP:

Thank you.

First a clarification

of what we sought in the preliminary injunction.

18

were -- we sought to base our preliminary injunction on

both count 1 and count 2.

21

case -- reach count 2.

We

Secondly, with respect to whether or not

23

there’s any conduct here, I don't think signing a

24

written statement is conduct.

the statement, the person is adopting the statement on

that the matter goes on the ballot.

no legal effect unless 122,000 make the same political

5

statement.

And, of course, it has

Third, evidence of harassment comes in,

7

as in Citizens United, because the weight of the

8

interest that is required depends upon the burden of the

9

First Amendment -- to the First Amendment speech

10

involved; and this Court specifically referred in

11

Citizens United to the lack of evidence of harassment of

12

the donors that might occur if they were disclosed

13

through the reports which Citizens United upheld.
Here we do have evidence of harassment, and

14
15

we believe that that requires a greater burden in the

16

First Amendment analysis --

Many is the case --

So everybody agrees

that that's still in the case.
MR. BOPP:

23

Yes, but it is relevant to count

24

1.

Bates, for instance, looked to the evidence of

25

harassment in protecting the membership list of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The court did not rule on

whether there was a risk of harassment here.

4

MR. BOPP:

Well, that --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. BOPP:

It dealt only with count 1.

That is -- that is true, Your Honor.

7

There are -- there were several First Amendment claims

8

made -- made under count 1, and this decision was --

9

was based on other claims.
Thank you.

I see my time is up.
