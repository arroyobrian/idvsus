CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument next

in Ayers versus Belmontes.
Mr. Johnson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case concerns the constitutional

11

sufficiency of California's catchall factor (k)

12

instruction, which was given in the penalty-phase portion

13

of California capital cases, and which directed the jurors

14

to consider any other circumstance that extenuates the

15

gravity of the crime, even though it is not a legal excuse

16

for the crime.

17

In this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

18

held that this instruction violates the Eighth Amendment

19

because it allegedly misled the jurors to believe they

20

could not consider so-called forward-looking evidence that

21

did not relate directly to the defendant's actual

22

culpability for the crime itself.

23

In the State's view, the Ninth Circuit's

24

conclusion is fundamentally flawed, because it rests on an

25

illusory distinction between different forms of character
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence in a way that is inconsistent with this Court's

2

prior decisions in California -- or Boyde versus

3

California and Brown versus Payton.

4

In Boyde, this Court addressed, and rejected, a

5

virtually identical challenge to the factor (k), and

6

concluded that this instruction did, in fact, allow jurors

7

to consider non-crime-related evidence; specifically, it

8

allowed the jurors to consider evidence of the defendant's

9

background and character.

There was nothing in the Boyde

10

decision to support the Ninth Circuit's distinction

11

between different forms of character evidence.

12

Boyde implicitly acknowledged that the factor (k) would,

13

in fact, be understood to encompass Belmontes' good

14

character evidence, in this case, because, for all

15

practical purposes, there is no meaningful distinction

16

between the nature of the background and character offered

17

in Boyde and the nature of the background --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In fact,

Mr. Johnson, would you comment

19

on the footnote on the -- on the -- drawing the

20

distinction with regard to the dance contest that the

21

defendant won in that case, between -- it's over here; I'm

22

asking the question -- between facts that occurred before

23

the crime and facts that might have occurred after.

24
25

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

In footnote 5,

this Court addressed a contention, raised for the first
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

time in argument, that Boyde's evidence might be

2

admissible under Skipper versus South Carolina, and this

3

Court distinguished Boyde from Skipper, for a couple of

4

reasons.

5

evidence in this case related to good-character evidence,

6

events that occurred before the crime itself, unlike in

7

Skipper, which dealt with post-crime events.

8

also pointed out that the evidence in Boyde -- his dancing

9

achievement, his good character evidence in that case -

First, as the -- as Your Honor pointed out, the

The Court

10

was not offered for the specific inference that the

11

evidence in Skipper was offered.

12

-- and in the opinion, in general, in Boyde -- nonetheless

13

found that this evidence did, in fact, constitute good-

14

character evidence of the -- of the defendant's present

15

good character, because it showed that his crime was an

16

aberration from otherwise good character.

17

Marshall put it in his dissenting opinion, that Boyde had

18

redeeming qualities, which is a decidedly forward-looking

19

consideration.

20
21
22

The Court, in footnote 5

Or, as Justice

And, as I was saying, the evidence in this case,
and in Boyde JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't have to be forward-

23

looking, does it?

I mean, I thought we've said "so long

24

as it can be taken into account in any manner," whether

25

backward-looking or forward-looking.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Haven't we said

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

that, explicitly?
MR. JOHNSON:

Yes Your Honor.

The -- and, in

3

fact, the Court has, in Franklin versus Linite, said that

4

they have not distinguished between different forms of

5

character evidence.

6

we've always discussed background and character evidence

7

as sort of the same thing.

8

Ninth Circuit's conclusion does, in fact, rest on a

9

distinction between different forms of backward-looking

10

And I understand that, in the past,

In this case, however, the

and forward-looking character --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. JOHNSON:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well it was -

-- evidence.
-- it was addressing itself to

14

the fact -- to the words of the factor (k) instruction.

15

How does post-crime prison conduct reduce the seriousness

16

of a previous crime?

17

MR. JOHNSON:

It does not -- it does not relate

18

to the seriousness of the -- of the crime at all.

19

Boyde's dancing --

20

The --

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Well, I mean, it has to relate

21

to the gravity of the crime, under the words of factor

22

(k), doesn't it?

23

MR. JOHNSON:

It would relate to the gravity -

24

to circumstances that extenuate the gravity of the crime,

25

for purposes of a jury's sentencing determination.

the point I'd like to make on that point is this, Your

2

Honor.

3

task is at a sentencing determination.

4

guilt and the death eligibility determinations are made

5

during the guilt-phase trial and the jurors are expressly

6

told, during the penalty-phase trial, that their lone

7

determination, their one concern, is to decide between a

8

sentence of death or a sentence of life without the

9

possibility of parole.

In California, jurors are well aware what their
In California, the

And, in that light, the jurors are

10

very well aware that their only determination in a

11

California case is to make a moral, normative

12

determination, a single normal -- moral normative

13

determination, as to whether this man, this defendant

14

standing before them in this Court today, deserves death

15

or life without possibility -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. JOHNSON:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, now, do you -

-- of parole.
-- do you have an instruction

19

that supports what you've just told us, that the jury is

20

told they have to make a single moral determination?

21

that what the court instructed the jury?

22

MR. JOHNSON:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

No, that's -- instructed in items of

factor (k)?
MR. JOHNSON:

Or was --

The 7


Alderson Reporting Company

Is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I think you have to rest

2

on your argument, that what we are talking about is the

3

gravity of his crime "for purposes of sentencing."

4

understand that argument.

5

make the argument you just made, the jury understands it

6

is a single moral judgment, what -- is there some specific

7

instruction you can point to, other than the factor (k)

8

instruction itself?

9

MR. JOHNSON:

I

But then, when you go on to

No, they are -- and I may have

10

been misleading.

The jurors are expressly instructed that

11

is -- that it is their duty to determine, and their only

12

duty to determine, whether the defendant should receive

13

life or death and parole, and -- or life without the

14

possibility of parole -- and in -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. JOHNSON:

Well -

-- light of that determination,

17

jurors, naturally, would understand that they could take

18

into account anything that extenuated the gravity of the

19

crime.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's what they

21

were told, right?

They're instructed that the mitigating

22

circumstances, including factor (k), are merely examples,

23

right?

24

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In this -- yes.

In --

May I ask you about that?
8


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

This case is unusual, because it has that separate

2

instruction that, "The mitigating circumstances are merely

3

examples, and you should pay careful attention to those,

4

but you may -- but you may rely on other mitigating

5

circumstances."

6

May I ask you, would it have been constitutional

7

if the judge had added a sentence at the end of that

8

instruction which said, "However, you may not consider

9

anything mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of

10
11

the crime"?
MR. JOHNSON:

It would have been constitutional,

12

to the extent that it would have allowed the jurors to

13

give some use whatsoever to Belmontes' proffered evidence

14

in mitigation, and that's what this Court's prior cases

15

has -- and, particularly, the various Texas cases have

16

said that jurors must be given an avenue to make use of

17

the evidence.

18

In California --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not sure you've answered

19

my question.

20

to that instruction to say, "But I want to -- you to

21

clearly understand that it is not to be considered

22

mitigating unless it extenuates the gravity of the crime"?

23

Would that have been permissible?

24
25

Would it have been a constitutional addition

MR. JOHNSON:

It would appear to -- no.

would appear not to be, because -9

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because that would have

2

foreclosed consideration of the Skipper-type evidence,

3

right?

4

MR. JOHNSON:

It would have -- well, it would

5

foreclose consideration of all present good-character

6

evidence, I believe.

7

the consideration of Boyde's evidence, of Payton's

8

evidence.

9

It would -- it would have foreclosed

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So, then the question in this

10

case is whether the jury might have understood factor (k)

11

to limit them to the consideration of factors that

12

extenuate the gravity of the crime.

13

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, the -- yes, the question is

14

whether the jurors would reasonably understand the

15

instruction to preclude the consideration of

16

constitutionally -- of relevant evidence.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This Court, in Payton,

18

said that it was not unreasonable to conclude that

19

evidence of remorse extenuated the gravity of the crime.

20

So, why wouldn't an instruction to the jury along the

21

lines of Justice Stevens's hypothetical have been

22

perfectly constitutional as extenuate the gravity of the

23

crime that's interpreted in Brown versus Payton?

24
25

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, to the -- to the extent -

the jurors would have likely understood that, it -- that
10

Alderson Reporting Company

1

instruction in Belmontes and in Payton, to extenuate the

2

gravity of the crime for purposes of their sentencing

3

determination --

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:
your position was.

Well, that's what I thought

And -

6

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- then you back off of it, and

8

you say, "extenuate the gravity" of the crime doesn't

9

relate to anything that's after the crime.

I would have

10

-- I would have interpreted the phrase to mean "anything

11

that justifies you in giving a lesser punishment for the

12

crime."

13

MR. JOHNSON:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16
17

That's precisely my argument.
Well, then your answer to

Justice Stevens should have been different.
MR. JOHNSON:
was misunderstood.

Well, if -- and I apologize if I

My --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. JOHNSON:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21
22

Do you think -

-- question --- that the jury in this very

case understood that, given the questions that were asked?
MR. JOHNSON:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

In this -

23

in this case, I -- there is certainly no reasonable

24

likelihood that the jurors felt precluded, because, as was

25

previously discussed, first there was this additional
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

instruction that supplemented the other instructions in

2

this case that made it very clear that the aggravating

3

factors, the various factors listed in the standard

4

instruction A through G, that those were the -- they could

5

only rely on those two for aggravating factors, but their

6

understanding of mitigating factors was not limited.

7

fact, they were expressly told that the previous factors

8

were merely examples.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In

What about the -- what

10

actually went on?

11

said, "What if we can't decide?

12

majority?"

13

to indicate the jurors' understanding, that we take all

14

those factors that you told us about, and we just take

15

those factors into account.

16

instructions asked by the defense that were not given.

17

I mean, the jury first came in and
Can we decide by

And then the question was asked, that seemed

MR. JOHNSON:

And there were clarifying

Well, there -- to answer your

18

questions, Your Honor, first, there was no indication at

19

this conference that the jurors were, in fact, confused

20

about whether they could consider any particular evidence

21

as being mitigating.

22

address, as you mentioned, the jurors' concern -- or the

23

jurors' inquiry about the result -- what would happen if

24

they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict in this case.

25

The conference itself was called to

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that may be why they had
12


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the conference, but they got into the colloquy that

2

Justice Ginsburg described.

3

the last reference to "factors," whether aggravating or

4

mitigating, was simply in terms of the list, or "the

5

listing," I guess the term was, so that the -- it seems to

6

me at least, there's a fair argument on the other side of

7

this case, that the last reference that the -- that the

8

judge made to the jurors with respect to aggravation or

9

mitigation was to refer to a listing.

And the last -- as I recall,

The listing itself

10

didn't have anything to do, as I understand it, with the

11

instruction that you are not limited to the listed

12

mitigating factors.

13

So, the concern is that, because the last

14

reference was to the list, that the list included factor

15

(k), without embellishment, and that jurors tend to give

16

-- we have held that the jurors tend to give the greatest

17

emphasis to clarifying instructions or later instructions

18

in response to questions.

19

that, in this case, there is -- there's a reasonable

20

likelihood that the jurors went back to their task

21

thinking that they were limited to the list?

22
23
24
25

MR. JOHNSON:

Isn't it a pretty good argument

Respectfully, no, Your Honor.

And

the reason why is -JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I -- I'm not necessarily

saying that's my position, so you don't have to be
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respectful to me about it.

2
3

MR. JOHNSON:

Just -

I'll be respectful anyhow, Your

Honor.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- knock it down if you can.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Be respectful anyway.

6

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

The point is, with this

7

instruction conference, there -- the -- an argument that

8

this reference to "the listing" reflected some

9

unconstitutional -- or constitutionally restrictive view

10

presupposes that the jurors reasonably would have

11

misinterpreted the meaning of the factor (k); and there is

12

nothing in there -- in any of these questions to put

13

anybody on notice that that -- that they had any such

14

concerns.

15

And first -JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, except for the language

16

of factor (k) itself.

17

embellishment, isn't it a bit of a stretch to think that

18

factor (k) goes as far as Skipper evidence?

19

MR. JOHNSON:

And if -- without some

No, Your Honor, it's not a stretch

20

at all, because any evidence relating to the defendant's

21

background and character, his present character in court,

22

could be seen as extenuating the gravity of the crime for

23

sentencing purposes.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

MR. JOHNSON:

Well -

And the jurors -14


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- California itself

2

recognized that there was a problem here of jury

3

confusion.

4

that it would be clear to any juror.

5

And now they have amended the provision so

MR. JOHNSON:

That's correct, Your Honor, in

6

People v. Easley the California --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or maybe they thought that was

8

a problem of Ninth Circuit confusion rather than jury

9

confusion.

10

[Laughter.]

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, having that opinion in

12

front of them, you would think they would amend it, of

13

course, to prevent that kind of decision again.

14

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, they -- what they were doing

15

was certainly a prophylactic measure here, to -- they

16

recognized that perhaps there might be some concern of

17

confusion, and so they wanted to forestall any chance of

18

that happening.

19

and no other California Supreme Court case, has found that

20

the factor (k) instruction, the pre-Easley version of it,

21

by itself, did mislead the jurors.

22

Court, in this case, came down 7-0 in support of the

23

conclusion that the jurors were properly told about the --

24
25

But notably, this case and -- this case,

In fact, the Supreme

Where does this factor (k)

What was the source of it?
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. JOHNSON:

The factor (k), as the entire

2

standard instruction given in these cases, recites

3

verbatim the language of the California statute, which is

4

California penal code section 190.3.

5

enough, the -- not only the California Supreme Court, but

6

this Court, implicitly has -- have both said that not only

7

the California statute, but the instruction -- this

8

standard instruction, upon -- which is based on the

9

statute, do allow consideration of all relevant mitigating

And, interestingly

10

factors.

11

California v. Ramos decision, this Court stated, albeit in

12

dicta, that the factor (k) -- or that the standard

13

instruction would allow consideration of background and

14

character evidence; and, in fact, the Court stated, in

15

footnote 20 --

16

In fact, as far back as 1983, in this Court's

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Johnson, I don't mean

17

to interrupt you, but I want to be sure you answered your

18

-- you stick to your answer on -- to my question, earlier,

19

--

20

MR. JOHNSON:

Okay.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- because you -- I think you

22

changed your answer after Justice -- the Chief Justice and

23

Justice Scalia suggested you might have made a mistake.

24
25

Are you -- is it your position that it would be
constitutional to instruct the jury that, "You may not
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consider any evidence mitigating, unless it extenuates the

2

gravity of the crime"?

3

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor, because the

4

jurors would -- even if that instruction were given, the

5

jurors would understand that an instruction that

6

extenuates the gravity of the crime would encompass any

7

relevant character evidence.

8

these determinations all the time.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

MR. JOHNSON:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And this Court has made

Is -

That -- that answer consistent with

12

the position of defense counsel, who said he would not

13

insult the intelligence of the jury by suggesting to them

14

that the religious conversion of the defendant did not

15

extenuate the gravity of the crime?

16

MR. JOHNSON:

No, Your Honor.

What the -- what

17

the counsel actually said was that the defendant's

18

religious conversion did not provide an excuse for the

19

crime itself.

20

echoing the language of the factor (k) instruction, which

21

of course -

And, in fact, that argument was, itself,

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

MR. JOHNSON:

That's right.

-- directs the jurors to consider

24

any other circumstance that extenuates the gravity of the

25

crime, even though it's not a legal excuse for the crime.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And so, counsel was dovetailing his very effective

2

argument with the -- with the instruction itself.

3

what's significant here is that, like in Payton, like in

4

Boyde, this case involved virtually all of Belmontes'

5

penalty-phase evidence.

6

argument to the jury was that he could not make it on the

7

outside, but he could fit in the system and contribute to

8

society in the future, if given a chance on the inside.

9

And again, as was true in Boyde and Payton --

10

And

And the entire main thrust of his

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If that were true would that

11

have extenuated the gravity of the crime, if he could get

12

along in prison?

13

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, for purposes of jurors -- at

14

jury's sentencing determination, absolutely, because it

15

would be viewed as good-character evidence, precisely -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you think juries would

17

clearly understand that what he did in the future in

18

prison would extenuate the gravity of the crime.

19

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes, Your Honor, because, in light

20

of everything that's been said and done in this trial, as

21

the Boyde Court noted, jurors do not parse instructions

22

for subtle shades of meaning; they understand instructions

23

in a commonsense manner, and in --

what we have --

10
11

And, in fact, the prosecutor, in closing

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, in this case

Well, the prosecutor's

closing was schizophrenic, because he said, "But really
this shouldn't matter."
MR. JOHNSON:

He acknowledged it was something

12

that -- this argument was something that was proper for

13

consideration, but -- however, he argued that the evidence

14

of Belmontes' religious conversion, which happens -- you

15

know, and then lapsed immediately before he committed the

16

murder, in this case -- was very weak evidence.

17

did, nonetheless, tell the jurors that they could consider

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, the prosecutor, I take it,

3

would have answered Justice Stevens's question the other

way.

5

probably would not be understood by the jurors to refer to

the gravity of the offense."

7

The prosecutor would have said, "Well, no, this

MR. JOHNSON:

No, Your Honor, because in the -

in the previous page, the prosecutor did State that it was

a catchall, you know, which, by implication, incorporates

everything, but -- and the prosecutor's argument, that,

something that's proper for you to consider."

The prosecutor followed

case, the argument by counsel, the additional instruction

here, clarified that to the point that there is certainly

no reasonable likelihood that the jurors felt that they

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC S. MULTHAUP

25

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MR. MULTHAUP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

Here is Respondent's 60-second nutshell summary

4

of our core position.

5

constitutional factor (k) standing alone.

6

turns on a straightforward application of the Boyde test,

7

to the unusual, unique circumstances that occurred during

8

the arguments, instructions to deliberations at the

9

penalty trial of this case.

10

This case does not turn on the
Rather, it

Here are the two key components of our claim.

11

During arguments to the jury, both counsel conveyed to the

12

jury that Belmontes' evidence of Youth Authority religious

13

experience was not covered by factor (k).

14

counsel suggested to the jury that it should be considered

15

anyway.

16

the things that the district attorney and the defense

17

counsel disagreed on, this was one that they did agree on,

18

and it's likely that the jury would have taken note of

19

that.

20

However, both

Now, this is unusual, because, of all -- of all

The case then proceeded to instructions and

21

deliberations.

The jury came back to court, announced

22

that they were deeply divided, perhaps with a majority

23

favoring life.

24

Juror Hern, requested judicial confirmation that the

25

specific list of factors previously given was the only

The turning point occurred when one juror,

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

base -- was the only framework within which the penalty

2

decision could be made.

3

had a constitutional obligation to disabuse Juror Hern and

4

the rest of the assembled jurors of that misapprehension

5

and, at the very least, to reinstruct the jurors that the

6

enumerated factors were merely illustrative and not

7

exhaustive, and instruct the jurors that the jury had to

8

consider all of the mitigating evidence.

9

At that point, the trial court

The trial court did neither, with the result

10

that the jury all too likely returned to its deliberations

11

with the belief that the only factors -- the only matters

12

they considered -- could consider were those encompassed

13

within the enumerated factors, and believing -- based on

14

counsel's prior arguments -- that factor (k) did not

15

include the Youth Authority religious-experience evidence.

16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

When did the defense counsel say

that this evidence did not fit within factor (k)?

18

MR. MULTHAUP:

Your Honor, it occurred in

19

argument.

And my counsel -- esteemed co-counsel will give

20

me the exact page -- but it occurred in the context -- the

21

context -- during the prosecutor's argument, the

22

prosecutor said to the jury that, "I suspect" -- and then

23

he, for emphasis, said, "I can't imagine that you won't be

24

told that the religious-conversion evidence doesn't fit

25

within factor (k)."

And, at that point, he expressed
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reservations, doubts, as to whether it did fit in factor

2

(k) or --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. MULTHAUP:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why does that --

-- any other factor.
Why does that matter?

6

Because the jury was told that the factors were merely

7

examples of the mitigating evidence they could consider.

8

MR. MULTHAUP:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

I'm more than -It probably didn't fit

into factor (h), either, but it doesn't matter.
MR. MULTHAUP:

Well, it has -- if it -- oh, Your

12

Honor, the -- calling your -- or you've called my

13

attention to the instruction that said that the set -- in

14

the prior set of -- or in the general set of instructions,

15

that the enumerated factors were merely illustrative.

16

Now, that instruction had a cloud of confusion surrounding

17

it, because the way it was phrased was, the Court said,

18

"The mitigating factors that I have expressed to you are

19

illustrative."

20

There was only a single list, unitary list, of factors

21

that could be either aggravating or mitigating, depending

22

on a jury's decision.

23

There was no list of mitigating factors.

The instruction that you're referring to, Your

24

Honor, was a -- was the result of the trial court denying

25

some, and granting some, parts of the special instructions
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requested by the defense.

2

said to the jury, "The list of mitigating factors is

3

illustrative only," I -- we, who know the background of

4

this, understand what -- the point he was trying to make,

5

but the jury, hearing it, they would think, very

6

reasonably, "There's no list of mitigating factors."

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so, when the trial court

You said this case is different

8

because both counsel told the jury that the evidence that

9

you're relying on did not fit within factor (k).

10

And I'm

not sure what you're referring to.

11

MR. MULTHAUP:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.
Now, as to defense counsel, are

13

you referring to what you quoted on page 9 of your brief,

14

where he says, "I'm not going to insult you" -- what you

15

highlighted on page 9 -- "I'm not going to insult you by

16

telling you I think it excuses, in any way, what happened

17

here"?

18

to?

19

That's what you -- is that what you're referring

MR. MULTHAUP:

That's one of the passages that I

20

am referring to, and it came as a direct response to the

21

District Attorney, in effect, calling out the defense

22

attorney, "I can't imagine that you won't be told that

23

this fits within factor (k)."

24

defense counsel had to make a decision, "Okay, either I

25

have to argue that my Skipper evidence is -- my square peg

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

MR. MULTHAUP:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you had been -- in Payton with --- if you were arguing this to

16

the jury, would you have said, "You know, my client earned

17

a position of responsibility on the fire crew that

patrolled the Sierra Foothills, and, therefore, that

MR. MULTHAUP:

as -- says, "You take it -- this is an example" -- he

says, "It's an example in factor (k)."

but they certainly likely think they can consider it.

Mr. Schick doesn't say it's not in factor (k).

20

I don't see it.

2

MR. MULTHAUP:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
-- he didn't say it, that I've

4

made every effort to get from you the place where -- that

5

this -- where the defense counsel says, "Jury, I agree,

6

you cannot put this into factor (k)."

7

MR. MULTHAUP:

Okay.

And, Your Honor, looking

8

at it in context, given the district attorney's argument,

9

the district attorney says, "I can't imagine you won't be

10

told that it doesn't -- that it -- that it doesn't fit

11

within factor (k)."

12

says, "I'm -- I am going to tell you that it doesn't

25

kind of mitigating evidence under this factor," he would
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have put that in there.

2

context here, is that defense counsel was not trying to

3

sell the jury a position that was, on its face, untenable,

4

but, rather, to acknowledge that it did not fit within the

5

"excuse the gravity of the crime" factor, which --

6

The clear import, from the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Only if you think that excusing

7

the crime and extenuating its gravity are one and the same

8

thing, which I don't really think.

9

MR. MULTHAUP:

Well, Your Honor, there's two -

10

I'd like to make two responses to that.

First of all,

11

this Court has used those terms interchangeably, in Boyde

12

and Payton, with respect to mitigating evidence.

13

of all, let's -- as a -- as a practical matter, we have a

14

defense attorney arguing a case to a jury in a Central

15

Valley California county.

16

a choice between two synonyms, one which is used in common

17

parlance, "excuse," and one which is not used in common

18

parlance, "extenuate," it hardly constitutes an -- a

19

defect or concession on his part if he were to say, "This

20

does not excuse the crime in any way."

21

speaking to a jury, that -- and what he -- what he -

22

counsel -

Second

And if the defense attorney has

That's plain

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't a jury think all

he was a prisoner before.

4

I mean, the bulk of the evidence at the

MR. MULTHAUP:

Your Honor, not -- that's not

5

exactly what happened at penalty phase here.

This is not

6

a case like Boyde, where all the evidence was background

7

and character evidence, and it's not a case like Payton,

8

where the only evidence was a post-crime conversion.

MR. MULTHAUP:

33


Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the jury must have

2

thought there's some reason why the judge allowed that

evidence in.

show that, if he is given life, he will be a good

6

And what reason could it be, other than to

MR. MULTHAUP:

Your Honor, that's a very

7

logical, sensible thing for the jury to have thought.

And

8

now I'd like to drop the second shoe of the key components

9

of our claim.

The first shoe was the arguments of counsel

10

that we've discussed the various permutations on.

11

most likely -- so, the jury began deliberating based on

12

the instructions and the arguments that they had -- that

13

they had had.

14

was favoring a life verdict during the first part of their

15

deliberations, Belmontes' prospects for good behavior in

16

prison and contributions were part of the debate.

17

The

And it's entirely likely that when the jury

When Juror Hern asked for judicial clarification

18

-- not clarification, confirmation -- of a very specific

19

view that only the enumerated factors could be considered

20

in the penalty-phase deliberations, the jury -- and the

21

trial court assented without qualification to that -- at

22

that point, the jury would have very likely thought, "The

23

trial court who holds a position of great deference to us,

24

much more than most other authority figures we have in our

25

life, just told us what the marching orders are here.
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

This is the framework for decision."

2

Now, what happened during the -- during the

3

trial is the defense -- and I'm suggesting what the jury

4

might have thought, in relation to your question -- that,

5

"The defense attorney was taking his best shot for his

6

client, pushing the envelope, maybe went over the top a

7

little bit.

8

prosecutor was being a very decent stand-up kind of

9

person, and -- but, right now, when we get down to the

10

business of making the decision, we have to follow the

11

rules.

12

what Judge Gisson just confirmed to us, that we are

13

limited to the enumerated factors, and factor (k) does not

14

include the Skipper evidence, because that was explained

15

to us by counsel."

But defense attorneys do that.

13

with Boyde, and it went through all of the proceedings at

likelihood that the jury didn't consider Skipper evidence.

16

And that's what we're asking this Court to do, the exact

17

same -- applying the Boyde test to the rule -- the rule of

18

decision that was clearly established by this Court as of

19

1986, and reiterated and expanded by this Court in 1987,

20

with Skipper.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but what has to be clear

22

under Teague is not just the rule, but the rule's

23

application in circumstances like this.

24

of rules that are clear, but if Teague means anything at

25

all it has to mean that you should have known that, in

2

not enough to say that there was a rule.

of rules out there, but the question is whether the

outcome should have been clear at the time.

what Teague means?

MR. MULTHAUP:

So it's

There are a lot

Isn't that

Certainly, Your Honor.

And

applying -- because when we -- when we take a look at

8

Penry I, this Court said -- in response to a Teague

9

argument by the attorney general, this Court held that

10

Penry got past the threshold Teague issue because of -- at

11

the time of the finality of his direct appeal, in 1986,

12

the rule was well-established that the sentencer may not

13

be precluded from considering relevant evidence in

So, we have a very, very different
And, if I may, Your Honor --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I know Payton was an

AEDPA case, but it, nonetheless, concluded that it was not

24

unreasonable for the California Supreme Court to read

25

instruction (k) in a way that allowed this evidence to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

considered.

2

unreasonable to have that reading, that the contrary

3

reading that you're proposing, and that the Ninth Circuit

4

adopted below, could hardly be said to have been dictated

5

by existing precedent.

6

And I would have thought, if it was not

MR. MULTHAUP:

Ah.

Well, the -- our position in

7

relation to that is, the direct quote from -- direct quote

8

from Payton itself, in which the Court said that, assuming

9

the California Supreme Court was incorrect, Payton,

10

nonetheless, loses.

Here we're arguing that the

11

California Supreme Court was incorrect, and, therefore,

12

Belmontes -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. MULTHAUP:

incorrect, it was, nonetheless, reasonable.

having trouble understanding how, if a contrary position

18

is dictated by precedent under Teague, a reading 180

20

Court as reasonable.

MR. MULTHAUP:

And I'm just

Court, even under different facts and under more egregious

the Court's argument, but I would argue that there are any

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Multhaup, one aspect of

your argument I wish you would clarify, and that's in your

4

brief at page 20, footnote 3.

5

saying -- you are not challenging factor -- the factor (k)

6

instruction as excluding Skipper evidence.

7

is limited to this particular case.

8

saying in that footnote?

9

MR. MULTHAUP:

As I understand it, you are

Your challenge

Is that what you're

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm not here to

10

refight the battle of Boyde.

You know, I spilled tons of

11

hours of time and printer's ink in an amicus brief in

12

1989, and I understand the concept of "you lose."

13

are arguing is that the Boyde test should be applied to

14

the circumstances of this case, and that factor (k),

15

standing alone, in a -- in a case where defendant relies

16

on Skipper evidence, does not warrant relief by that fact

17

alone.

18

Boyde, does call for relief.

Here we have much more than that fact which, under

MR. MULTHAUP:

6

the colloquy during the penalty deliberations.

7

Juror Hailstone's follow-up question regarding the

8

possibility of considering the availability of psychiatric

9

treatment, which was explicitly rejected, and very likely

10

confirming the message that had just been given to -- via

11

the answer to Juror Hern's case, that only the enumerated

12

factors can be considered.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We have
We have

Well, there is no

14

evidence on that question presented, right?

15

that the possibility of psychiatric treatment couldn't be

16

considered is because neither party had put evidence on

17

that question before the jury.

18

MR. MULTHAUP:

The reason

Well, Your Honor, you know that,

19

because you're the Chief Justice, but the people of San

20

Joaquin County had no idea that that was the reason, and

21

if not explained -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

It's a question

23

of what mitigating evidence was put before the jury.

24

jurors couldn't consider that, because it was the -- quite

25

proper for the trial judge to say, "You can't consider
41

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

However, the error occurred when the -- when the

the trial court's answer could only have reaffirmed the

misimpression that the court returned to the -- to

18

And Juror Hailstone's question -

I have a -- just a few minutes, and I would like

19

to give Respondent's answer to Justice Kennedy's question

20

to Petitioner, paraphrasing somewhat, How does Skipper

21

evidence extenuate the gravity of the crime?

22

answer is, it doesn't at all, logically, ethically, or

23

morally.

24

circumstances of the crime are what they are, and there's

25

nothing that can be done about that.

And the

As defense counsel conveyed to the jury, the

42

Alderson Reporting Company

The circumstances of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the crime are immutable and irreparable.

2

that can be extenuated in a penalty presentation is

3

Petitioner's culpability for the crime.

4

argued that Petitioner's culpability was some -- to some

5

extent, extenuated and mitigated because the evidence

6

showed that there was no plan to kill the decedent when

7

they went to her house.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And counsel

But we have said that remorse

extenuates the gravity of the crime, for punishment
purposes, under factor (k).

Well, of And that -

And, Your Honor, this pre- and

17

post- distinction, I don't believe has -- is a relevant

18

distinction.

19

the culpability for the crime, because when a defendant

20

expresses remorse --

21

It's whether it's functionally related to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh, you think pre- and crime --

22

pre- and post- distinction has no bearing on this case?

23

I thought that was really the linchpin of your argument?

24
25

MR. MULTHAUP:

No, Your Honor.

It's that

Skipper evidence is a specific and different kind of
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mitigating character evidence that doesn't extenuate the

2

gravity of the crime, but it provides a different kind of

3

reason for sparing the defendant's life.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is --

And yours is both pre- and

5

post- -- that is, you're referring to conduct that took

6

place before this crime was committed -- that is, his

7

prior incarceration -- and asking the jury to project that

8

forward to say, "That's how he behaved in prison, before

9

he committed this most recent crime, and that's how he's

10

likely to behave again."

11

MR. MULTHAUP:

Well, all of the Skipper evidence

12

in this case occurred as a matter of historical fact

13

before the capital crime and -- which, in fact, gives it's

14

much -- gives it much more weight, because it can't be

15

suggested that he contrived his good conduct after being

16

arrested for a capital crime.

17

But, I'm going to make a broad statement here.

18

There is no reported case in California where either a

19

defense attorney or the California Supreme Court makes a

20

text-based argument that Skipper evidence extenuates the

21

gravity of the crime, because it's illogical and doesn't

22

work.

23

argued that, "Well, of course you have to consider that

24

evidence under factor (k), because it's a catchall.

25

supposed to be inclusive."

Look what the defense attorney did in Payton.

That's not a text-based
44


Alderson Reporting Company

He

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument, that's a circumstantial-evidence kind of -- kind

2

of argument.

3

When we look at that -- when we look at that

4

phrasing of "extenuating the gravity of the crime," with

5

its plain meaning in English, and the distinction made, in

6

Skipper itself, that Skipper evidence does not relate to

7

Petitioner's culpability for the crime, the jury is going

8

to appreciate what the -- what the attorney said to them,

9

that the -- that the Youth Authority religious evidence

10

does not extenuate the gravity of the crime, but has

11

independent mitigating effect outside those enumerated

12

factors.

13

appropriate position to take, no constitutional problem

14

there until, during deliberations, the trial court

15

confirmed that they could only consider the enumerated

16

factors and could not consider nonstatutory mitigation,

17

the -- any other kind of mitigation, because that, in

18

effect, closed out consideration of the -- of the Skipper

19

evidence.

20

There's nothing -- that's a perfectly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the judge's response to

21

Juror Hern was so misleading, why didn't counsel object to

22

it, if it was as obviously misleading as you say?

23

MR. MULTHAUP:

Your Honor, it's like being -

24

stepping off a curb and being hit by a bicycle that you

25

didn't see coming.

This occurs in the middle of jury
45

Alderson Reporting Company

of this type.

3

the trial court fielded the questions, responded off-the

cuff, and the juror -- jury went back.

Nobody expected a juror to ask a question
And, of course, I'm speculating here, but

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's why you have counsel

there, to help the court when the court makes a real

7

boo-boo, and if this was as obviously error as you say,

8

one would have expected some objection from defense

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. JOHNSON

18

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

19

MR. JOHNSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

20

In a minute, I'd like to briefly touch on the

21

Teague issue.

At the time Belmontes' judgment was

22

pending, there was no precedent that would have dictated

23

the Ninth Circuit's conclusion here regarding the

24

sufficiency of the factor (k) instruction.

25

this Court's subsequent holdings, in Boyde and Payton,
46

Alderson Reporting Company

And, indeed,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

bear out the fact that it was at least -- that that

2

decision certainly was not dictated by precedent.

3

In Boyde, this Court dealt with evidence of good

4

character that was precisely the same as the evidence of

5

good character here.

6

succeeded during a prior commitment and religious

7

conversion, that he might be able to help others in the

8

future, was good-character evidence in the same way that

9

Boyde's evidence of having won a dancing prize, of having

The -- Belmontes' evidence of having

10

helped children, of having helped artistic -- having

11

artistic abilities, was all good character.

12

certainly nothing in Boyde to suggest that there is any

13

distinction.

14

that would compel all rational jurists to distinguish the

15

two cases.

16

And there is

But, even if there was, it would not be one

And that's further buttressed, of course, by

17

this Court's more recent opinion in Payton, which found

18

that it was at least reasonable for the State Court to

19

conclude that Payton's post-crime forward-looking evidence

20

would be understood to fall within the factor (k)

21

instruction if it was at least reasonable for California

22

to find that such forward -- post-crime forward-looking

23

evidence would fit within the factor (k).

24

Circuit's conclusion, to the contrary, regarding pre-crime

25

good-character evidence, certainly was not dictated by
47

Alderson Reporting Company

The Ninth

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

precedent.

2

I'd also like to address, quickly in my

3

remaining time, Mr. Multhaup's arguments regarding the

4

jury -- or the argument of counsel and the jury questions.

5

Again, Boyde counsels that the relevant

6

consideration is whether there is any reasonable

7

likelihood that the jurors view the instructions in a way

8

as to foreclose consideration of constitutionally relevant

9

evidence.

In this case, both -- the jurors were

10

instructed with the factor (k).

11

given the supplemental instruction that said that the -

12

that the previous listing -- factors were only examples of

13

some.

14

could, and should, consider this evidence.

15

As I've said, they were

And then, both counsel clearly said that the jurors

Is there some possibility out there that some

16

juror might have misinterpreted this in a -- in a -- in a

17

different manner?

18

reasonable likelihood, especially in light of the fact

19

that Belmontes' evidence, virtually all of it, was

20

directed at this main thrust of the argument.

21

like in Payton and Boyde, for the jurors to have believed

22

that they could nonetheless not consider that evidence

23

would have turned the whole proceedings in a virtual

24

charade or a pointless exercise.

25

I suppose so, but there is certainly no

So far as the questions during juror
48

Alderson Reporting Company

And, just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deliberations, it's, first, important to recognize, none

2

of these jurors said anything to suggest that they were

3

actually confused about whether they could consider any

4

evidence offered.

5

merely related to her -- she wanted to confirm her

6

understanding about the role of balancing mitigating

7

versus aggravating factors under California law.

8

certainly the parties there if -- would have been in a

9

better position to realize it if these questions somehow

Their question -- Juror Hern's question

And

10

suggested some ambiguity.

11

Moreover, in the same conference, the judge advised the

12

jurors to review the instructions again, which, of course,

13

again included the factor (k), and which, of course,

14

included the supplemental instruction that said that their

15

consideration of mitigating factors was not limited to

16

those that had been listed, but those that had been listed

17

were merely examples.

18
19

There was no objection there.

If the Court has no further questions, I will
submit the case.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
