United States.

Mr. Gordon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN C. GORDON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GORDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

When this Court construes a statute, the

12

words of the statute matter, the purpose of the statute

13

matters, and the results produced by that construction

14

matter.

15

When Congress defined in the Armed Career

16

Criminal Act a "serious" drug offense as one for which a

17

State penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed by law,

18

it meant for Federal courts to look to the law presently

19

in effect in that State.

20

reading of the statute, and words matter.

21

consistent with ACCA's purpose, which is punish the

22

Federal firearms offense, and if we are going to

23

punish -

24
25

This is the most natural

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It is also

Counsel, I -- I have

just one problem, which is under your theory, I
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understand it, if a State increases a penalty, makes

2

what would have been a penalty for a misdemeanor now a

3

felony, then that defendant is a career criminal, by

4

your logic.

5

MR. GORDON:

Uh -

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the person who

7

thought that at the time they committed the crime they

8

were committing a low-level crime is now a felon; is

9

that your theory of the case?

10

MR. GORDON:

If -- if a State were to

11

increase a penalty -- say from originally it was 5

12

years, increased it to 10 years, the defendant was

13

convicted at a time when it was 5 years -- if the

14

legislature increased the penalty, if the defendant

15

possessed a firearm, yes, he would be facing -

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What -- what -- what

17

logic do you think there is in that, why Congress would

18

want to punish someone now for -- for criminal activity

19

that they thought was lesser, and the State thought was

20

lesser, at an earlier time, less reprehensible?

21

MR. GORDON:

Because the purpose of the

22

Armed Career Criminal Act is not to enhance a sentence

23

because of the prior conviction.

24

Federal firearm offense at the time it was committed is

25

more serious based on -- based on its repetitive nature,

It is because the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

as this Court has said.

2

the defendant commits the offense, what his status is at

3

that time under the law we think makes sense and is

4

consonant with the purpose of what ACCA is trying to do.

5

ACCA is not trying to punish the State offense at the

6

time.

7

So therefore looking to, when

And of course the converse, Your Honor, is

8

that by adopting the government's reading, is

9

individuals who at a time committed an offense when a

10

State at that time viewed an offense as more serious but

11

now has changed its view of the offense, does not view

12

it as being as serious, that person also would receive a

13

15-year mandatory minimum sentence.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Gordon, the State

15

does regard it -- it does -- prescribe 10 years for this

16

defendant because it's made a -- made the change not

17

retroactive.

18

Mr. McNeill, and all others who committed the offense

19

prior to the change in law.

20

State's current position that for this offense the

21

maximum is 10 years.

22

So a maximum of 10 years is prescribed for

MR. GORDON:

So it is -- it is the

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's

23

correct.

Where we fundamentally disagree with the

24

government and with the Fourth Circuit is on the

25

significance of retroactivity.

We -- the statute

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

requires -- or the statute directs us to look at the

2

penalty that is prescribed for the offense, the offense

3

in its generic context.

4

circumstances of the defendant were that produced the

5

particular conviction for him.

6

It -- it is not about what the

No one who commits the trafficking offenses

7

that Mr. McNeill committed today is going to be facing a

8

10-year sentence.

9

who commits the offense from today forward.

It's not going to happen to anyone
And we

10

think that is where the statute directs us to look:

11

What is the penalty for the generic offense?

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose -- what would happen

13

in this situation?

14

State statute that says that anybody who sells between 1

15

ounces -- 1 ounce and 5 ounces of a particular

16

controlled substance is guilty of a felony and may be

17

punished by imprisonment for a certain amount of time.

18

A defendant is convicted under a

And then the State repeals that provision

19

altogether and enacts a new provision that says anybody

20

who sells between 1 ounces -- 1 ounce and 8 ounces is

21

punishable by a certain penalty.

22

comes up what -- what penalty does the court look at

23

with respect to the earlier offense that no longer

24

exists for which the defendant was convicted?

25

MR. GORDON:

And now the question

There -- there are two possible
6


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

answers, Justice Alito.

2

what the offense is now, could look back to what the

3

defendant did consistent with Shepard and so forth, and

4

see if the defendant's conviction contains the element

5

of the -- the elements that apply to the present

6

offense.

7

First, the court could look to

If the court could not do that, then the

8

conviction would count for purposes of the defendant's

9

criminal history.

It would not count as an ACCA

10

predicate, and the district court would then be limited

11

to a 10-year sentence as opposed to a 15-to-life

12

sentence.

13

So consistent with -- with its purpose, we

14

think that the statute should be read as speaking to the

15

time, not of the State conviction -- not of the State

16

sentence.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. GORDON:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mis -

Yes?
Mr. Gordon, is this -- is

20

this essentially an academic question?

21

district judge said that he would impose the same

22

sentence as a variant even if he couldn't do it under

23

the guidelines, even if it were an incorrect

24

calculation.

25

and astonishing; essentially, I'm going to throw the

He said:

Because this

This criminal record is violent

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

book at him, and I'm going to do it through a variant if

2

that's no -- if there's no other way.

3

So isn't that -- I mean, isn't this an -- an

4

exercise, essentially an academic exercise, if -- if

5

your -- your client would end up in the same place?

6

MR. GORDON:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it may

7

be an academic exercise for Mr. McNeill or for the Mr.

8

McNeills of the world.

9

were to agree with us, the judge could impose

The judge would -- if this Court

10

consecutive sentences on a remand and still achieve the

11

same sentence, yes.

12

For someone whose only offense, however, is

13

a 922(g) conviction, then it makes a huge difference

14

because, rather than looking at a 15-year mandatory

15

minimum penalty, the defendant would be looking at no

16

more than 10 years.

17

significantly cabined in -- in that sense.

18

So, the judge's -- it would be

And the other, with respect to the Mr.

19

McNeills of the world, the judge on a remand is still

20

going to be required to calculate the guidelines

21

correctly.

22

down in this case, for the judge to achieve a 300-month

23

sentence, the judge is going to have to state reasons

24

again and arguably more significant reasons to -- to

25

achieve that same level if he's working from a lower

And so if the guidelines change, if they go

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

guideline range.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Gordon, there are other

3

provisions in ACCA which seem to use the present tense

4

in circumstances where it doesn't seem as though the

5

statute truly means the present tense.

6

felony is one that "has as an element the use of

7

physical force, is burglary, arson, or extortion,

8

involves use of explosives;" and so on and so forth.

9

But we would not look as to -- in interpreting that

10

So, a violent

provision to the present day, would we?

11

MR. GORDON:

Justice Kagan, I think you

12

would, in this sense:

13

there is a generic offense.

14

is this existing thing right now called burglary.

15

a Taylor analysis does is it looks backward to what the

16

defendant did.

17

It takes those elements and brings it forward, and if

18

those elements fit in the box, then what he did is a

19

burglary.

20

The -- so, that's my essential answer to that.

21

For the violent felony provision,
Let's take burglary.

There
What

It looks to see what those elements are.

If it does not, then it is not a burglary.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it -

Why is -- why is -- why is

22

the present tense inadequate for the -- for the

23

government's position in this case?

24

that the North Carolina law is not retroactive, the law

25

reducing the number of years, it is the case that what
9

Once it is conceded

Official - Subject to Final Review

is the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense that

2

he committed -- how many years ago was it, whatever -

3
4

MR. GORDON:

Early '90s, Your Honor.

Yes,

'91, '92.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is the maximum

6

punishment for that offense which occurred at that time

7

is the longer period.

8

argument requires us to ask what would be the term if he

9

had committed the offense at a later date.

Why is -- I don't see why your

The maximum

10

term for his offense when he committed it is those years

11

because the State did not retroactively reduce his

12

sentence.

13

MR. GORDON:

That's correct for Mr. McNeill.

14

The penalty for him -- he would be facing an exposure of

15

10 years.

16

the penalty that is currently prescribed in North

17

Carolina for someone who commits McNeill's offenses is

18

not 10 years and, and depending on where they fall in

19

the prior record level, their maximum sentence is

20

considerably less than 10 years.

The penalty, however, that everyone else -

21

So we do not think it's consonant with the

22

statute to look to the circumstances of the individual

23

defendant.

24

penalty of 10 years or more is prescribed for the

25

defendant."

Congress easily could have said "for which a

We think that would be a different case.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not just for the

2

defendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to

3

the -- prior to the amendment of the statute.

4

MR. GORDON:

That's correct.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Anybody that committed it

then, the -- the -- it is an offense "involving

7

manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent

8

to manufacture or distribute a controlled...for which a

9

maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is

10

prescribed by law."

11

those offenses that occurred between whenever that old

12

statute was enacted and whenever this statute was

13

enacted.

It is prescribed by law for any of

MR. GORDON:

It is prescribed only if you

take the offense out of the category of a generic

18

defendants who committed the offense at a certain point

19

in time.

It is not -- it is -- it is not prescribed for
It is prescribed for particular

And, Justice Scalia, I think it raises a

21

rather fundamental question, which is if we're going -

22

if we really are punishing the Federal firearm offense

23

and we are not punishing the defendant for the prior

24

conviction, and we have two individuals who commit a

25

922(g) offense and they have similar records, but they
11

Alderson Reporting Company

sustain their State convictions on different days, do we

2

want to treat them the same for purposes of where they

3

-- of the Federal offense or do we want to distinguish

4

them on the basis of the State convictions?

5

the State convictions to really -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. GORDON:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Do we want

What if the State -

Yes, sir.
What if the State

change is to abolish the offense altogether?

Do we -

10

do we not have any predicate offense for the defendant

11

who committed the crime prior to the abolition of the

12

State offense?

13

MR. GORDON:

Your Honor, yes.

If -- if, as

14

I said earlier, you could not determine from the prior

15

conviction whether there is any present State offense

16

that might be called something different, but that has

17

those drug trafficking elements that the statute

18

requires, if you cannot determine, you know, from

19

Shepard-approved documents and so forth, yes, we think

20

for purposes of the armed career criminal enhancement

21

only that that would disappear.

22
23

That's correct.

I do want to stress, because I think it's
important to stress, that -

You're

happy with that?

4

5

Career Criminal Act?

6

The person committed a felony when it

Only for purposes of the Armed

It certainly would count as a

8

yes.

12

So, we do not -- our reading is not opening

13

the jail house door for anybody.

14

a hefty 10-year sentence.

15

that defers to the judgment of the States to determine

16

seriousness, are we going to defer to the current State

17

assessment of what seriousness is or are we going to

18

look back to repeal the discarded judgments?

19

They are still facing

The question is, in a statute

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it strikes

20

me that there's really no change in the State view of

21

how serious it is.

22

they're going to look at sentencing.

23

regime, you're sentenced to a particular term, but in

24

fact you serve a lot less.

25

sentencing, you're sentenced to what is a much -- a

It was just an overall change in how
Under the prior

With the new treatment in

13

Alderson Reporting Company

2

whole thing.

3

change in how they view the seriousness of the offense.

4

At the end of the day, there's no real

MR. GORDON:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

5

Justice, arguably yes.

6

drug offense definition, what we have to use is the

7

penalty.

8

as the State's proxy, if you will, for seriousness.

9

But for purposes of the serious

We have to look at the penalty as the State -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are we looking at it

10

because we want the States to determine the Federal

11

sentence or are we looking at it because we evaluate the

12

evil of the particular defendant on the basis of how -

13

how much of a crime he was willing to commit?

14

And so long as it was a serious felony when

15

he committed it, this is a bad actor.

16

the State changes its view.

17

to commit a felony that put him in jail for 10 years,

18

and that's what we're looking to, it seems to me, how

19

bad an apple is this fellow that -- that we're talking

20

about putting away?

21

because the State decides in the future that that same

22

act will not be a felony.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- but they're not the kind

2

of a person who's willing to -- to commit a felony that,

3

you know, puts them away for 10 years.

4

It seems to me that that's what the Federal

5

law is looking to.

6

the decision of -- of how long we should incarcerate

7

somebody in a Federal prison.

8
9

We're not giving over to the States

MR. GORDON:

Justice Scalia, if -- if that

were indeed what Congress wanted, then it would have

10

written the statute differently.

11

something in that definition about the defendant, and

12

there's not.

13

judgment that the State is making is about the

14

seriousness of the offense itself, and as we made an

15

effort to argue in our briefs, State views of drug

16

offenses change.

17

There would be

It's about the offense.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the -- the

I agree, it does refer to

18

the seriousness of the offense.

19

seriousness of the offense at the time the offense was

20

committed in order to determine how bad a fellow this

21

is, not -- not because we want the States to determine

22

how long we're going to keep Federal prisoners in

23

24
25

MR. GORDON:

Justice Scalia, respectfully,

I -- I don't agree with that.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the issue, though,

really.

3

MR. GORDON:

That is an issue, yes, Justice

4

Scalia.

5

Do you say Congress was really talking about trying to

6

get the Mr. McNeills any way we can or we are -- we are

7

interested in people who commit an offense that the

8

State currently regards as serious.

9

But the issue is, do you look at the defendant.

You will capture Mr. McNeills; you will also

10

capture people who, you know, under the old Texas law

11

that, you know, prescribed 99 years for someone who

12

might have sold one or two marijuana cigarettes as well.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you'll -- you'll put

14

away for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad

15

a guy.

16

17

ACCA.

18

what -- what Congress had in mind just because the State

19

now thinks that it's more serious.

20

State thinks?

21

this particular defendant is.

22

He committed a misdemeanor, and when the State

And I -- I can't believe that that's -- that's

Who cares what the

We -- we want to know how bad an actor

MR. GORDON:

In the case of a misdemeanor --

23

Justice Sotomayor asked earlier about misdemeanors and

24

felonies -- there may be some additional constitutional

25

issues in terms of whether if it's a misdemeanor
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conviction, even statutory reasons, if it's a

2

misdemeanor conviction, whether it should count.

3

think it works that way in the violent felony prong, for

4

example, where the term that you look at is was it 1

5

year.

6

I

But that is -- that is not the proxy for

7

seriousness because there is another provision, 18

8

U.S.C. section 921(a)(20), that exempts 2-year

9

misdemeanors.

So -- so, the 1 year in the violent

10

felony provision is not serving the same purpose that -

11

that the 10 years is in the serious drug offense.

12

A reason that Congress may have had for

13

doing that is to say that if we are going to hit

14

somebody with 15 years, we want to make sure that they

15

had their constitutional rights at the time they

16

sustained the predicate conviction, had a right to

17

counsel, indictment, jury, and so forth.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm -- I'm not sure what

19

you're urging now.

20

retracting the answer you gave to Justice Sotomayor,

21

that is, the case where the maximum was 5 years, but

22

then at the time of the Federal offense the State has

23

changed it so it's 10 years?

24
25

Are -- are you modifying or

I -- I think you answered her question that
it would work the same way, that what mattered is how
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the State currently ranks the offense, not the offender.

2

But now you seem to be saying there might be a different

3

answer when the State increases rather than decreases

4

the penalty.

5

MR. GORDON:

What -- what I meant to say,

6

Justice Ginsburg, is that if you are -- if you continue

7

to be talking about a felony offense, if it goes from

8

5 years to 10 years, it went from a felony to another

9

felony, in that circumstance I -- I -- I will concede

10

our reading of the statute would work to the detriment

11

of that defendant, that -- that's correct.

12

What I was simply trying to say about the

13

misdemeanor-felony is that there might be some

14

additional constitutional issues that would not be

15

present in -- if it went from 5 years to 10 years.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in the hypothetical

17

where the penalty is increased, would there be an ex

18

post facto problem?

19

MR. GORDON:

Your Honor, I don't believe

20

there would be.

21

notice that the law has changed.

22

The defendant presumptively is on

Now, if -- if the increase in the penalty

23

were between the time that he commits the 922(g) offense

24

and the time of the sentencing, yes, I think you have ex

25

post facto concerns there.

I think if you're talking

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about between the time of the State offense and the time

2

of the commission of the firearm offense, I don't think

3

it raises the ex post facto concerns.

4

defendant is on notice, he's presumed to know what the

5

law is at the time he commits the Federal offense, and

6

that's what we care about here.

Again, the

I -- I would also like to return to the

question of retroactivity for just a moment and note

9

that in terms of the administerability of the Armed

10

Career Criminal Act, the question of retroactivity would

11

introduce, if the government's reading is adopted,

12

problems that do not exist under reading ACCA speaking

13

in the present tense.

14

it is not simply that you can look at what the sentence

15

was that the defendant received in State court.

16

government says retroactivity matters.

17

Under the government's approach,

The

So you would still have to go to the present

18

penalty, and then you would have to conduct an inquiry

19

into what the, you know, what changes occurred in the

20

21

for a certain period of time, et cetera.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23
24
25

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner was convicted under North
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Carolina law of multiple offenses subject to a 10-year

2

maximum term of imprisonment, and he actually received

3

10-year sentences for his drug crimes.

4

that those convictions are not ones for which the

5

maximum term of imprisonment is at least 10 years for

6

purposes of ACCA's definition of serious drug offense.

7

He now claims

That result is incorrect, because the

8

sentencing court should consider the offense and the

9

punishment as they were defined by the body of law under

10

which the defendant was convicted and sentenced.

11

This is the simplest approach, because the

12

Court is already looking to the statute at the time of

13

the underlying conviction in order to evaluate whether

14

it satisfies the substantive component of the definition

15

of a serious drug offense.

16

Justice Sotomayor finished with my friend, we have one

17

footnote in the first part of our argument, footnote 5,

18

which clarifies an issue that isn't at stake here, which

19

is that when we say that you need to look to the time of

20

the underlying conviction, that that includes the time

21

of the sentencing which could include some sentence

22

modification proceedings.

23

And if I can start where

If the State had amended the law in the

24

meantime, made it retroactively applicable and the

25

defendant were able to get his judgment or conviction

modified, then we would not insist that -- that he still

had an offense that was subject to a 10-year maximum

3

term of imprisonment.

is consistent with what the Court said in Rodriguez,

where it was also evaluating the serious drug offense

under ACCA and pointed us to the documents associated

That's obviously not an issue here because

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is this the first time

you're advancing the argument, the first part of your

argument?

MR. GANNON:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

It -
It doesn't appear as you

did -- if you did it below; am I correct?

4

MR. GANNON:

We -- we did not advance this

5

below.

We weren't heard on the question at district

6

court.

The district judge adopted this argument in

7

response to Petitioner's objection to the PSR which had

8

taken this position.

9

Petitioner relied upon the Sixth Circuit's decision in

10

Morton, and we -- we responded the essentially the way

11

the Fourth Circuit did, which is to say the Fifth

12

Circuit has distinguished instances like that when the

13

court has not -- when the State has not made the -- the

14

intervening decrease in the sentence retroactively

15

applicable.

16

Circuit adopted.

17

In the court of appeals,

That's the interpretation that the Fourth

But the government has made this argument

18

before in -- in the Second Circuit in Darden, in the

19

Fifth Circuit in Hinojosa, in the -- in the Sixth

20

Circuit in Morton in the 1994 decision.

21

has made this lead argument that we're making today in

22

addition to the fallback argument that the -- that the

23

Fourth Circuit adopted here, and that the Fifth Circuit

24

adopted in -- in Hinojosa.

25

The government

But I would note that the lead argument that

preferable to the fallback argument.

4

fact that this is simpler, because it requires the judge

5

to just look to one time to evaluate the substantive

6

component of the definition and the -- the sentence

7

component of the definition.

Some of them have

I already mentioned the

8

But this also prevents the types of problems

9

that Justice Alito addressed earlier that may arise when

10

the State has amended the definition of the offense.

11

you just look to the -- the actual offense at the time

12

of the conviction, then you don't run into those sorts

13

of problems, and the Fifth Circuit recognized this in

14

its Allen decision and therefore ended up having to

15

adopt what is essentially the government's lead argument

16

here.

17

If

The Sixth Circuit which generally follows

18

Petitioner's rule also ended up adopting the

19

government's lead argument in the context of a

20

guidelines determination, because it recognized that it

21

-- it was unwilling to assume that a conviction simply

22

disappears when the State has modified the definitions

23

in such a way that you can't precisely translate into

24

current terms what the underlying offense of conviction

25

is.
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The government's reading avoids that problem

2

because it doesn't require you to recharacterize the old

3

offense at all.

4

What was the maximum sentence associated with that

5

offense at the time he was actually prosecuted?

6

nothing hypothetical about it.

7

Court pointed out in Rodriguez, we would expect a lot of

8

the documents association with a judgment of conviction

9

to make this a relatively easy inquiry to answer what

10

It just says what was he convicted of?

There's

And as the -- as the

was the maximum sentence at the relevant time.

11

This -- the reading also avoids the

12

difficulty that Justice Sotomayor pointed out that -

13

that is associated with later increases in -- in the

14

sentence.

15

an offense at a time when it was subject to a 10-year

16

punishment, Congress has reasonably assumed that you are

17

a dangerous person; but that Congress could also

18

reasonably assume that there's a distinction between

19

somebody who commits an offense at a time when it's

20

subject to a 10-year term of imprisonment and someone

21

else who commits that offense at a different time when

22

it's subject to only a 30-month term of imprisonment.

23

And so under North Carolina law, for instance, the -

24

the felony of manufacture of methamphetamine went from

25

being a class H felony which is subject to a 30-year

Under the government's view, if you committed

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

maximum term of imprisonment to being a class C felony

2

-- excuse me, a 30-month maximum term of imprisonment,

3

to a class C felony, which is subject to a 19-year

4

maximum term of imprisonment on December 1st, 2004.

5

we think it's reasonable for Congress to assume that

6

somebody who committed the crime of manufacturing

7

methamphetamine in North Carolina at a time when it was

8

subject to a 30-month maximum sentence is not as

9

dangerous as somebody who was willing to commit the same

10

offense at a time when it was subject to a 19-year

11

maximum term of imprisonment.

12

And

And the government's approach by -- by

13

requiring the court to look to the time of the

14

underlying conviction and sentencing unifies the inquiry

15

across both components of the definition of serious drug

16

offense and the definition of violent felony that

17

Justice Kagan alluded to in the earlier part of the

18

argument, that the definition of violent felony includes

19

present-tense references to whether a crime is burglary,

20

the question of whether it is punishable by a -- by a

21

term exceeding 12 months, which is necessary to

22

establish that it's a felony is one that -- that we

23

believe needs to be made at the time of the underlying

24

conviction.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the legislature

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decreases the penalty because it really has taken a

2

different -- a new look at the nature of the offense and

3

has come to the conclusion that this really is not

4

nearly as serious as we -- as we previously thought?

5

why should the prior judgment about the severity of the

6

offense be taken into account under ACCA?

7

MR. GANNON:

So

Well, Congress has given us a

8

very objective and simple yardstick to look to and

9

that's just what the maximum term of imprisonment is.

10

And if -- if the State actually thinks that the previous

11

offenses that were committed were less serious, then it

12

could make the decreased maximum term of imprisonment

13

retroactively applicable if -- if it wanted to

14

demonstrate that -- that it really thought that those

15

were mistakes.

16

Carolina has taken -- that North Carolina has taken

17

here.

18

But that's not the approach that South

It has said that for crimes that were

19

committed before October 1st, 1994, the prior sentencing

20

regime still applies.

21

out before, the State has not repudiated the judgment

22

that these were serious offenses, not -- not -- not only

23

with respect to when they were committed, but the entire

24

shift to structured sentencing Petitioner

25

acknowledges -

And as the Chief Justice pointed

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. GANNON:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what if -

-- wasn't intended -
What if they had repudiated

4

their prior normative judgment?

5

if they even had made it -- made the new sentence

6

retroactive, but a particular defendant was no longer in

7

prison, so wasn't on parole, so there was nothing -

8

there was no way that this could have any effect on that

9

person?

10

MR. GANNON:

And -- and even -- what

Well, it's possible that the

11

State could -- could provide a mechanism by which he

12

could have the documents associated with his prior

13

judgment amended to reflect the fact that he -- he ought

14

not to have been subjected to the -- to the greater term

15

of imprisonment.

16

I think that that's probably the hardest

17

case, somebody who once upon a time actually, like this

18

Petitioner, did a 10-year term of imprisonment for -

19

for the sentence, the State in retrospect concludes that

20

the offense had not been that serious even at the time,

21

and if he had been prosecuted today he -- he should have

22

received only a 5-year maximum term of imprisonment.

23

I think -- I think that that's -- that's an

24

instance where it -- it might be difficult to -- to -

25

to find a way in the statute to say that ACCA doesn't
30

Alderson Reporting Company

apply to him, that he did not have a previous conviction

2

at the relevant point in time.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure it's so hard.

4

I -- I could find my way clear to saying that if it has

5

been retroactively made a -- a -- a lesser offense, that

6

that would qualify under -- under the statute.

7

know why you insist that his actual conviction be -- be

8

altered.

9

MR. GANNON:

I don't

Well, I -- I think that we

would obviously still prevail under an approach like

12

13

with the conviction, but if -- if the court were to ask

14

in the context of the body of law that applies to his

15

offensive conviction, whether the State has changed its

16

mind by doing -- by altering the precise yardstick that

17

Congress has directed the court to look to, then -- then

18

I think that -- that that would be an appropriate way to

19

deal with it.

It would be an expansion of what we proposed in
We think that the relevant inquiry starts

20

I'm not exactly sure how you get it out of

21

the words of the statute, but it -- it would solve the

22

problem for -- for cases like this of somebody who had

23

been unable to take advantage of a sentence modification

24

type of proceeding.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you tell us whether

In any instance, these types of general
