ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. REDDING

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. REDDING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Federal Circuit's opinion is simply

11

wrong.

Enactment of Section 6404(h) did not repeal

12

district court and Court of Federal Claims refund

13

jurisdiction over interest by the Internal Revenue

14

Service.

15

pre-existing jurisdiction prior to the enactment of

16

Section 6406(h).

17

repeals that jurisdiction, and there are many instances

18

in the code where Congress when it does intend to

19

expressly limit jurisdiction, will state that in the

20

enabling statute.

21

reference to the tax court in 6404(h) was mandated

22

unnecessary by Section 7442 and the nature of the tax

23

court.

24

those matters where it is specifically set out in the

25

tax code.

Both circuits have found that there was

Nothing in Section 6404(h) expressly

Reference to the tax court, specific

The tax court is only given jurisdiction over

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And the established framework of pay and sue

2

jurisdiction in the district courts and prepayment

3

jurisdiction in the tax court is a well established

4

framework for tax litigation.

5

and enunciated by this Court as far back as the Flora

6

opinions.

7

jurisdiction in the two forums.

8
9
10

That has been accepted

It's a well established pattern of duality of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But not with respect

to abatement of interest in particular.
MR. REDDING:

Not with respect to abatement

11

of interest, Your Honor, but as a general basis.

12

availability of a prepayment forum that was originally

13

enacted to be complementary to the ability to pay and

14

sue in order to protect smaller taxpayers, and avoid the

15

hardships faced by having to pay in full before having

16

access to refund jurisdiction, and in fact perhaps to

17

avoid bankruptcy.

18

the way this section is enacted.

19

includes the limitation that only taxpayers with a net

20

worth below $2 million or corporations below $7 million

21

have prepayment access to the tax court.

22

by itself is generally a prepayment remedy.

23

The

That is completely consistent with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Section 6404(h) even

And abatement

That's a -- on that

24

point, Mr. Redding, it seems odd that given this

25

tripartite system, Congress would want only the tax
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court to be restricted in the people who could claim the

2

abatement, the net worth test applicable in the tax

3

court on your theory, if there is authority in the

4

claims court and in the district courts, they're not

5

limited to the net worth restrictions.

6

MR. REDDING:

That is correct, Your Honor,

7

but I do believe that it is consistent with the intent

8

of the formation of the tax court to provide a

9

prepayment forum to especially avoid hardship and the

10

potential even of bankruptcy.

11

that pattern to say that the larger taxpayer can afford

12

to pay the tax and sue, whereas the smaller taxpayer may

13

be in greater need of a prepayment forum.

14

consistent with imposing the very short limitation

15

period for bringing an action in the tax court, because

16

there the government has a very vested interest in being

17

able to proceed with collection of the tax.

18

It's very consistent with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's also

But why would you

19

not want some -- a larger taxpayer to be able to proceed

20

in the tax court if you can also proceed in the claims

21

court?

22

MR. REDDING:

Your Honor, I can't speak to

23

Congress's reasoning behind that but I can understand

24

the logic behind saying we're going to create a special

25

prepayment remedy that allows the smaller taxpayer an
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

expedited means of resolving these issues without having

2

to first pay it and sue, whereas the larger taxpayer is

3

not put into a hardship position, is not inconvenienced

4

as bad by having to follow the old well established

5

procedures of pay and sue.

6

And I will note that 6404(h) does not apply

7

only to 6404(e)(1), which is the subsection we're coming

8

under.

9

under Section 6404.

6404(h) applies to all of the abatement grounds
And if we were to repeal

10

jurisdiction in the district court and the Court of

11

Federal Claims over all of those provisions, then we

12

would be completely taking away a remedy that has been

13

there all along to the larger taxpayers.

14

a new remedy that is consistent with the pattern that

15

allows a small taxpayer access to a prepayment forum, I

16

think is completely consistent with the entire history

17

of this court.

18

its purpose.

19

But to create

This court meaning the tax court.

And

In evaluating two statutes that appear to

20

either conflict or overlap, I think it is, in reviewing

21

whatever doctrine you call it, whatever canon you call

22

it of interpretation, it appears to me that what this

23

Court has always done is to look to see if the two

24

statutes can be harmonized rather than seeing if one

25

supersedes the other.

And here considering the
6


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

extension of prepayment jurisdiction to the tax court

2

merely an additional form of prepayment jurisdiction

3

being granted to the tax court is completely consistent

4

with the long-standing pattern of pay and sue

5

jurisdiction in the district courts, prepayment

6

jurisdiction in the tax court -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you have no

8

basis for an abatement of interest action apart from

9

6404(h), correct?

10

That is the only place you get the

actual cause of action to sue for abatement of interest?

11

MR. REDDING:

12

remedy, yes, Your Honor.

13

abate the interest and you make payment then you have

14

the normal refund, refund provisions available.

15

Abatement as a prepayment
Once the IRS has failed to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what would you

16

cite to, in response to the prior cases that said you

17

had no cause of action for abasement of interest?

18

MR. REDDING:

Actually Your Honor I don't

19

believe that's what the cases said.

20

no cause of action that could be pursued under

21

6404(e)(1) but even the seminal cases, Horton -- or

22

Selman and Horton Homes compared a Section 6404(e)(1)

23

action to a Section 6404(e)(2) action and basically said

24

you could have brought a refund claim.

25

under (e)(2) there would have been no impediment to
7

Alderson Reporting Company

They said you had

If you qualified

bringing that as a refund action because there was a

2

clearly established standard.

3

must standard.

4

The (e)(2) provision is a

Now, under 6404(h) if it is exclusive over

5

abatement jurisdiction, then any taxpayer who would have

6

had access to the courts, for example for an (e)(2)

7

abatement case, unless they are a small taxpayer they

8

will be completely denied any remedy whatsoever.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that the one that says

5

interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check?

6

Or am I reading wrong?

7

MR. REDDING:

Yes, Sir, it is.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the one I'm

9

looking at just has (e)(1).

Did you have a page number?

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

At page 42 of the appendix,

11

all -- all there is is a subsection 1.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. REDDING:

That's right.

Well, Your Honor, I have the

14

code section in front of me now but I still do not have

15

the reference in the appendix.

16

don't have it, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I apologize but I simply

Can I go back to

18

something you just said, that I thought you said that

19

the people would have no remedy if the tax court -- were

20

the only forum for abatement claims?

21

the exclusive forum but nobody -- it wouldn't deny

22

access to anyone.

23

MR. REDDING:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

And it would be

Your Honor Abatement claim, if you

read this as the Government does, is one place where you
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

go, and the tax court but everyone who has an abatement

2

claim could go there.

3

So who's being cut out?

MR. REDDING:

Well no, Your Honor, everyone

4

cannot go there.

5

taxpayer, an individual taxpayer with a net worth of

6

less than $2 million.

7

You can only go there if you're a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Oh, yes.

But -- yes.

8

And I had asked you before well doesn't it seem, it

9

seems strange that Congress would want to limit the

10

authority of the, of the court where most people go and

11

have no limit for the wealthier taxpayers.

12

MR. REDDING:

Your Honor, again, my, my view

13

of that is the Congress intended to limit the special

14

relief of prepayment jurisdiction to the smaller

15

taxpayers.

16

was already in existence and continues in existence and

17

those wealthier taxpayers generally can afford to pay

18

the liability in full and sue.

19

But the availability of a pay and sue remedy

A prepayment forum which delays the

20

collection of the tax to the Government, you know, the

21

Government has a special interest there in restricting

22

access to that relief so that it can proceed with

23

collection.

24

as to a larger taxpayer the ability to pay and sue

25

should be a sufficient remedy.

And again, it just makes logical sense that

Generally speaking -

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought Congress was

2

operating on the assumption that no court could hear an

3

abatement claim?

4

MR. REDDING:

Your Honor, that comes largely

5

from the legislative history, the House Committee report

6

addressing interestingly, subsection (h).

7

subsection (h) since it applies only to prepayment

8

abatement claims specifically, I think then you, then

9

that legislative history makes sense.

10

And

Because in that

same page in the legislative history -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, give me a decision

12

of the claims court or a district court that said courts

13

have authority to abate the interest before Congress

14

enacted this legislation?

15

MR. REDDING:

I don't believe there is a

16

specific case out there that I can cite to you where it

17

has happened.

18

Homes and Selman that that availability existed with

19

respect to (e)(2) to -

20

It is, it is reflected in both Horton

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it fair to say that

21

Congress acted on the assumption that there was no right

22

to the abatement with, and to the payment unless it

23

enacted the statutes?

24
25

MR. REDDING:
so.

Your Honor, I don't believe

Again, because that legislative history that's
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

referred to is restricted, the House Committee report is

2

restricted only to the subsection creating the tax court

3

prepayment jurisdiction.

4

of the amendments to Section 6404.

5

doing so Congress also did not make the restriction on

6

the $2 million/$7 million net worth relative to the

7

rights being granted under the other provisions of 6404.

8
9

It is not relevant to the rest

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I note that in

It's easy to see why the

only cases you have relate to (e)(2) rather than (e)(1).

10

(E)(2) which we don't have in the materials, but I have

11

gotten a copy of it.

12

And (e)(1) says that the Secretary "may"

13

abate the assessment of all or any part.

14

cases that denied it said this is discretionary; he

15

doesn't have to.

16

abated with respect to erroneous refund check, says the

17

Secretary "shall" abate the assessment.

18

(e)(2) doesn't -- doesn't do you any good at all with

19

respect to whether there was a cause of action before

20

(h) was adopted.

21

And those

(E)(2) on the other hand, interest

MR. REDDING:

So really,

Well -- Your Honor, I

22

respectfully disagree because 6404(h) applies to (e)(2)

23

as much as it does to (e)(1).

24

would have met the net worth requirements or whether or

25

not they met the net worth requirements that are now in

And any taxpayer that

previously.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, sure.

5

6

could bring cases under (e)(2).

7

to bring cases under (e)(1).

8

that you could bring them for (e)(2) as well, but that

9

doesn't prove that you could prove them under (e)(1) in

10
11

you used to have the

But 6404(h) allows you

It would follow a fortiori

the claims court or the district court.
MR. REDDING:

No it does not, Your Honor.

12

What I'm trying to address is the intent to repeal the

13

pre-existing jurisdiction, again because 6404(h) does

14

not apply just to (e)(1), where the might be a question

15

about whether or not they could have brought the case

16

previously, although jurisdiction existed.

17

could have brought their case under (e)(2).

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I see.

Clearly they

What you're say is

19

that cases that used to be bringable under (e)(2) would

20

now be bringable only under (h) which would in effect be

21

an implicit repeal of (e)(2).

22

MR. REDDING:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

Of (e)(2) At least as far as suits

elsewhere than in the tax court.
MR. REDDING:

That's correct.

6

Doesn't the new statute

just apply to abuse of discretion?

8
9

It seems to apply just to

abuse of discretion.

5

7

MR. REDDING:

No, Your Honor, it does not.

It creates the standard under which the tax court may
review any interest abatement claim under Section -

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says you have

12

jurisdiction to determine whether it's an abusive

13

discretion.

14
15

The

Maybe I'm reading the wrong place.
MR. REDDING:

6404 -

Yes, Your Honor, that is the

standard it applies to.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Well that standard

17

doesn't apply to the (e)(2).

18

it; (e)(2) says if it's a refund, abate, if not, not.

19

It's not a question of abuse of discretion or not.

20

MR. REDDING:

It has nothing to do with

Well I think it's the standard

21

on which they are to review the Government's action.

22

And I believe I cannot cite the case but there are cases

23

that hold that a violation of law is a per se abuse of

24

discretion.

25

subsections under 6404 which are made provisions in

There are also other subsections -

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other 6404 subsections, which are must provisions.

2

There are about five different subsections under 6404

3

that provide for interest abatement.

4

Again, I come back to the long-established

5

pattern of having prepayment jurisdiction in the tax

6

court and postpayment refund jurisdiction in the

7

district courts and Court of Federal Claims.

8

well established system, and adding a new prepayment

9

form of relief into the tax court in no way should be

It's a

10

implied to be a repeal of the long established refund -

11

pay and sue refund jurisdiction that normally exists.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you went into

13

the district court and claimed that the failure to abate

14

interest was an abuse of discretion, what would you rely

15

on for the -- for the cause of action?

16

MR. REDDING:

If the failure to abate

17

interest was an abuse of discretion under (e)(1) you

18

would rely on (e)(1) for the cause of action.

19

is created by the other subsections of (h) of 6404.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The right

I thought the prior

21

cases consistently, consistently said that there was no

22

judicial review because it was "may abate" and that it

23

was only with the arrival of 6404(h)(1) that there was a

24

cause of action for abuse of discretion?

25

MR. REDDING:

Yes, Your Honor, but I believe
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what they actually said is that there was jurisdiction

2

to hear it but there was not a justiciable standard that

3

could be applied with regard to (e)(1).

4

Congress came in and says to the tax court you're going

5

to apply this standard, there is a standard of review.

6

That now indicates Congress did not intend it to be

7

solely discretionary, and that the district court or

8

Court of Federal Claims would look to the general common

9

law; it would look to precedents, such as the APAA abuse

However, once

10

of discretion standard is consistently used throughout

11

the court systems in -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you want to look

13

at 6404(h)(1) saying now we have a standard, but you

14

don't want the other stuff that goes along with

15

6404(h)(1), which is it's in the tax court; you got to

16

have less than ten million, blah, blah, blah?

17

MR. REDDING:

That is correct, Your Honor.

18

The abuse of discretion standard is a common law

19

standard which has been carried over into -- into this

20

statute.

21

But to create a JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it didn't exist

22

before this statute?

I mean, the lower courts as I

23

understand it said, routinely, yes, you can have

24

jurisdiction, but have you no claim for relief because

25

there is no, no law to apply.

This is a totally

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discretionary matter of the Commissioner's grace.

2

Congress perhaps didn't grasp the subtle distinction

3

between no jurisdiction, and you can walk in the door

4

but you go out the next door, because there is no

5

justiciable claim.

6

tax court for relief that was not available anyplace

7

before?

8
9

So

And it provided peculiarly in the

MR. REDDING:

I understand and that's

basically the Fifth Circuit's view, Your Honor.

I do

10

not agree with that view.

I think that the Congress was

11

merely expanding the existing structure of prepayment

12

jurisdiction for the tax court -

think the Fifth Circuit has this one right.

have is a grant of jurisdiction to the United States Tax

note to the Court, though, that 6404(d) is also a

also a permissive abatement provision, and those

provisions would clearly be covered by it.

jurisdiction in the tax code in order to enable the tax

of this Court with regard to 6404(h), it is going to

raise a question every time prepayment jurisdiction is

extended to the tax court over any matter as to whether

6

that somehow now becomes exclusive of the conventional

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, there's a

fundamental difference on this particular question
between pay and sue and sue -

11

MR. REDDING:

Prepay.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- prepay, because

13

if you -- in the district court if you're paying and

14

suing you're not really subject to the accrual of

15

interest, right?

16

MR. REDDING:

No, Your Honor, that is not

correct.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I owe the IRS,

And

2

make sense.

3

Basically, Your Honor, I believe that, I

4

believe that this case really rests on what I think the

5

Fifth Circuit summarized quite well when it says that it

6

makes more sense in this case to simply believe the

7

Congress, quote, "simply intended" -- "simply chose to

8

extend concurrent jurisdiction to the tax court over a

9

certain class of claims."

And that's all it really has

10

done here.

It has implemented and expanded the

11

conventional jurisdiction of the tax court as a

12

prepayment forum before you do have to pay the liability

13

to resolve a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service.

14

There is no reason, I don't believe, to see

15

this as a major departure from the existing structure of

16

pay and sue jurisdiction versus prepayment jurisdiction.

17

This is just a well established plan that's been in the

18

code for many, many years.

19

Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court has no other

20

questions I would reserve my remaining time for

rebuttal.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. MARCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

4

The court of appeals correctly held that the

5

tax court has exclusive jurisdiction over actions

6

challenging interest abatement determinations under

7

Section 6404(e)(1).

8

of the interest abatement review statute supports the

9

court of appeals' decision as to principles of sovereign

immunity.

11

restrictions on the remedy that Congress created may be

12

avoided by the simple expedient of filing a challenge in

13

another forum.

14

statute or this Court's precedent permits that result.

15

Under Petitioner's theory the specific

Nothing in the interest abatement review

The place to start is the language of the

16

interest abatement review statute.

17

provides the tax court shall have jurisdiction over an

18

interest abatement action brought by taxpayers who meet

19

the net worth limitations set out in another part of the

20

code and who file their claim within 180 days of the

21

Secretary's mailing of a final determination not to

22

abate interest.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Section 6404(h)

If, if the history of this

24

issue had been such that before the enactment of this

25

section the courts of appeals were divided or the courts
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

were divided as to whether or not there was jurisdiction

2

in the Court of Claims and in the district court, would

3

your position be different?

4

MR. MARCUS:

No, our position would be the

5

same.

We would first look to the statutory language of

6

Section 6404(e)(1) and that provision provides that the

7

Secretary may abate interest when there is an error or

8

delay committed by an IRS employee in the performance of

9

a ministerial act, and that "may" language contrasts

10

with other provisions that have mandatory language that

11

requires the Secretary to abate.

12

look at the nature of the -

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In addition, if you

So it's, so it's only (h)

that gives any court any jurisdiction at all?

15

MR. MARCUS:

That's correct.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even though in our

17

hypothetical world some courts of general jurisdiction

18

thought that they did have jurisdiction?

19

MR. MARCUS:

That's correct, Justice

20

Kennedy.

21

to abate in these circumstances.

22

Up until 1986 the IRS didn't even have ability

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

well as to (e)(1)?

24

abatement provisions?

25

Did (h) apply to (e)(2) as

Does it apply only to discretionary

MR. MARCUS:

No, it's our position it

applies only to discretionary abatement determinations

by the Secretary.

4

the decision being reviewed involves an exercise of

discretion.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
(e)(2)?

So what happens with

8

The language -- typically when abuse

Yes, you could use it, although

it typically comes up when the Government has filed an

10

action to recover an erroneous refund.

11

raised as a defense.

12

It's usually

But you could bring it that way.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, isn't it an abuse -

13

isn't it an abuse of discretion for the Secretary to

14

fail to do what the statute tells him he absolutely

15

must?

16

MR. MARCUS:

I think as a technical matter,

17

Justice Kennedy, that's correct.

18

that's the natural way to read the statute, and when the

19

Congress imposed that abuse of discretion standard it

20

assumed that the decisions that were being -- that were

21

subject to review involved the exercise of a discretion.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I don't think

I don't, I don't even think

23

it's technically correct.

How is it an abuse of

24

discretion?

25

could you say he has abused his discretion?

He has no discretion.

25
Alderson Reporting Company

He must do it.
What

How

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discretion?

2

MR. MARCUS:

Well I think some cases -

3

there is some case law that has said that when there is

4

an error of law committed by a lower court that can

5

constitute an abuse of discretion.

6

again it's not the natural reading of the standard that

7

Congress put in.

8

legislative history, Justice Kennedy, you'll see that

9

Congress was focused on the absence of a judicial remedy

But in our view

And also, if you look at the

10

with respect to determinations by the Secretary that

11

involved an exercise in discretion.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what the cases

13

said prior to 6404(h) when they asked for interest

14

abatement was not that we don't have jurisdiction to

15

consider that claim.

16

standard to apply, so it's committed to agency

17

discretion by law.

18

along and gives you a standard, so that removes that

19

objection.

20

They would just say there's no

Then all of a sudden 6404(h) comes

What's wrong with that?
MR. MARCUS:

I think that's -- with respect,

21

I think the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is too clever by

22

half.

23

of Section 6404(h)'s integrated whole and held that

24

there now is a refund cause of action that's not subject

25

to the specific restrictions.

The Fifth Circuit basically extracted one piece

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

of the way that Congress enacted the language.

3

doesn't say that the tax court and only the tax court

4

shall have jurisdiction.

5

have jurisdiction.

6

preferred forum and they're saying you can bring it

7

there as well, but it doesn't take away the jurisdiction

8

that the prior courts had recognized.

9

Well, that's because
It

It says the tax court shall

That is a, in many respects a

MR. MARCUS:

Well, I think you need to look

10

at what the state of the law was when Congress enacted

11

this provision and think about what Congress would have

12

wanted to do.

13

those decisions that had said there's no cause, no

14

refund cause of action for interest abatement, they

15

could have easily referenced the refund statute and said

16

there is a refund action available.

17

have specified that the Court of Federal Claims or the

18

district courts can exercise jurisdiction over interest

19

abatement issues.

20

If Congress would have wanted to reverse

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They also could

Don't you think it's

21

kind of strange, though, if you have the interest

22

abatement is available only for a particular category of

23

taxpayer and not others?

24

MR. MARCUS:

No.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
27
Alderson Reporting Company

If you have a net

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

worth of two million and one dollar you can't get any

2

interest abatement, but if it's $2 million you can.

3

MR. MARCUS:

I don't think, I don't think

4

it's anomalous.

I think if you consider the concept of

5

interest under the tax code, the way it works under the

6

tax code is interest accrues on an unpaid tax liability

7

from the time the tax is due until the time the tax is

8

paid.

9

taxpayer is borrowing from the Government.

So the amount of underpayment is the amount of
The interest

10

that accrues on that underpayment is not a penalty; it's

11

just a charge basically for the time value of money.

12
13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right, but you abate

it in some cases, but you don't abate it in the others.
MR. MARCUS:

Right.

But I think, I think

15

the idea was that Congress was concerned that some

16

taxpayers, taxpayers that fall within the net worth

17

limitations, might be in positions where they are less

18

positioned to pay the full tax liability up front.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's what I

20

thought, too.

But then your friend explained that in

21

the initial bill is where the interest is contained in a

22

lot of these cases and in this case in particular.

23

it's not as if you have the opportunity to pay it in

24

advance to stop the accrual of interest.

25

the bill and you find out, you know, you owe a 1,000
28
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Just you get

1

dollars and 300 of it is interest.

2

MR. MARCUS:

I don't think that's correct,

3

Your Honor.

4

abatable is, a taxpayer is in full control of whether

5

that interest runs or not.

6

full tax liability on time, interest doesn't accrue, so

7

there's no interest to abate.

8

10

The way this is -- the interest that's

If the taxpayer pays his

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But he doesn't even know

what his tax liability is, especially in a partnership
situation.

11

MR. MARCUS:

Well, the taxpayer -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA

:

He makes the

13

partnership calculation, it goes to the IRS, and then

14

they figure out what the tax is.

15

know, the interest is running.

16

MR. MARCUS:

And meanwhile, you

Well, Justice Scalia, first of

17

all, the taxpayer is in the best position to know what

18

the tax liability is.

19

certain investments, they should understand what the tax

20

consequences are.

21

If a taxpayer is going to make

This is quite a different

22

argument.

23

the full tax in the first place, not he could have paid

24

the interest that he knew was accruing.

25

You're saying, you know, he should have paid

MR. MARCUS:

Right.

But he could have

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prevented that, the abatable interest, from accruing.

2

This abatable interest doesn't accrue until the taxpayer

3

receives notice from the IRS that there is a problem

with the return.

5

period from the time the underpayment is made until the

6

IRS notifies the taxpayer, that, that interest is not

7

subject to abatement.

8

there is no remedy.

9

that period, and there's just a period, there's a

So the -- in other words, that first

That automatically accrues and
Congress has created no remedy for

13

for the interest that accrues until you're notified of

what the -

15

Say that again?

I didn't

MR. MARCUS:

There's no abatement

Until you're notified, until

16

the IRS notifies you that they are looking further at

17

your return.

18

precisely how much you owe, but you're on notice that

19

the IRS is looking into your return further and that you

20

can at that point make a payment or put down a deposit

21

that doesn't compromise your ability as a taxpayer to go

22

into the tax court, but it does stop the accrual of

23

abatable interest.

24
25

They might not at that point tell you

JUSTICE SOUTER:
to pay, do you?

But you don't know how much

I mean, when they send you the notice

Alderson Reporting Company

they don't send a notice that says, we're looking into

2

this and we think you're going to end up owing $5,000,

3

do they?

4

They don't give you a figure.
MR. MARCUS:

Again, they don't necessarily

tell you exactly how much you owe, but it's the

MR. MARCUS:

They sometimes do, and then at

13

18 months, at 18 months under subsection (g), under 18

14

months under a provision that was acted in 1998, the IRS

15

has to at 18 months tell you how much you owe;

16

otherwise, the interest cannot continue to accrue after

19

liability is.

20

But you should -- but it is the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's true.

That's true.

But you can make that argument.

22

accepted it, would be an argument for having no

23

amendment to subsection (h) at all.

24

MR. MARCUS:

25

That argument, if you

Right, but that's the idea.

Until 18 -- until 1986 there was no authority at all for
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Secretary to abate, and then Congress gave the

2

Secretary that authority as a matter of grace in 1986,

3

to extend this relief to forgive the accrual of

4

interest.

5
6

I mean, after this is money JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the question is, why is

the grace confined to some taxpayers and not to others?

7

MR. MARCUS:

The short answer is because

8

Congress has said that, said that, and the Congress

9

decided to impose the net worth limitation.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They've said it if we

11

accept your view of the exclusivity of the amendment to

12

(h).

13

MR. MARCUS:

Right.

And typically when

14

Congress imposes restrictions on a remedy this Court

15

reads that, reads that as an intentional -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but is there any

17

other instance in the law?

I suppose there probably is,

but what surprised me about that is this:

15

action and the other doesn't have a cause of action.

16

And the difference you're making between the two is

17

you're permitting the Secretary to waive the interest

18

with respect to the rich.

You're requiring him to do it

19

with respect to the poor.

Isn't that the difference?

MR. MARCUS:

That's correct.

That might be the

answer.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

incentive or even the ability to defer paying a tax,

where the people that have large bank accounts may, and

2

investments, may well profit by just paying the interest

3

to the Government.

5

MR. MARCUS:

That's exactly right.

And

Justice Breyer, if you want, if you -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait.

Wait.

There are two

7

separate things.

8

words, the Secretary does not have the power to abate

9

the interest in respect to the rich person?

10
11

I want to understand this.

MR. MARCUS:

No.

In other

He does have the

authority.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's permissive, not

14

mandatory.

15
16

MR. MARCUS:

Yeah, the Secretary has the

authority to waive interest.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But he doesn't have -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

He can do it -- in the

19

first case with the rich person, he can abuse his

20

discretion.

21
22
23

MR. MARCUS:

With respect to taxpayers who

meet the net worth limitations.
JUSTICE BREYER:

In other words, in the one

24

case Congress has passed a law saying with a poor person

25

you cannot abuse your discretion, but with a rich person
37
Alderson Reporting Company

you can abuse your discretion.

2

underlying substantive statute says.

3

MR. MARCUS:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what the

And there's another Wait a minute.

They are

5

not really saying that.

They're saying it's totally

6

within your discretion.

You can't possibly abuse your

7

discretion when you have total discretion.

8

saying, you know, do it if you want to do it.

9

MR. MARCUS:

That's right.

They're just

It's a matter of

10

administrative grace for the Federal taxpayers who

11

are -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

The standard of

13

discretion is the same for the poor and the rich, isn't

14

it?

15

court and the rich cannot.

The only difference is that the poor can get into

16

MR. MARCUS:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

They have an enforceable right.
So it's a question of

remedy, not standing.

19

MR. MARCUS:

Right.

There's a judicial

20

remedy in one case and only an administrative remedy in

21

the other.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

MR. MARCUS:

24
25

Is that the poverty line?

And there's another provision

in the tax -- I'm sorry, Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Is the net worth of $2

million the poverty line now?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. MARCUS:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

rationale?

6

differently, is it?

7

Not that I'm aware of.
So what is -- so what's the

This isn't treating the rich and the poor

MR. MARCUS:

It's treating exceedingly high

8

net worth individuals and corporations differently from

9

everyone else.

10
11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Someone with a net worth of

$1.5 million couldn't invest the money in the interim?
MR. MARCUS:

They could.

Congress chose to

13

draw the line where it used this provision that was

14

already in place under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

15

It referred to that provision -

16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This was for purposes of

attorneys' fees?
MR. MARCUS:

Right, the provision that

19

applies to attorneys' fees.

Congress has also imposed

20

this provision in a burden shifting provision in the tax

21

code, Section 7491.

22

idea of what Congress's concern for what it called the

23

average taxpayer, or the smaller taxpayers, it can look

24

at the legislative history.

25

March of 1995 that's cited on page 98 of the

If the Court wants to get a better

There was a hearing in

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

supplemental appendix to the cert petition, and that was

2

the Court of Federal Claims decision.

It's footnote 19.

3

It refers to a hearing in March 1995.

And if you read

4

through that, you can see where that concern for the -

5

for average taxpayers and lower net worth taxpayers came

6

from.

7

Nothing in Section 6404(h) gives rise to an

8

inference that Congress intended to establish additional

9

remedies in the district court and Court of Federal

10

Claims.

11

applied the rule that when Congress creates a specific

12

remedy, it intends that remedy to be exclusive.

13

rule is fully applicable here.

14

restrictions Congress imposed on the remedy could be

15

defeated by bringing the claim in a different forum.

16

To the contrary, this Court has consistently

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That

Otherwise, the specific

Wouldn't it have been

17

simpler if Congress just said the tax court shall have

18

exclusive jurisdiction, instead of just saying

19

jurisdiction?

20

MR. MARCUS:

That might have made it

21

simpler, Justice Ginsburg, but it accomplished the same

22

result by imposing the specific restrictions that it

23

did.

24

there are two other provisions in the tax code where

25

Congress -- where the tax court effectively has -- one

And again, it would have -- there's another -

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the provisions where the tax court has exclusive

2

jurisdiction under Section 6330(d), where also it

3

doesn't specify that -- the Congress didn't specify the

4

tax court has exclusive jurisdiction but it does.

5

there's another case where there's an administrative

6

determination, it doesn't go to the underlying

7

substantive tax liability.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

The difference -

the difference is that the district court, the claims

10

court already has jurisdiction for pay and sue claims,

11

if you pay the IRS you can sue to get a refund.

12

this isn't as if we're looking at something that says

13

the tax court has jurisdiction and trying to use that as

14

a wedge to get other jurisdiction.

15

grant of jurisdiction.

16

standard of review for these may abate claims, and all

17

of a sudden we find in this provision there is a

18

standard of review, it's abuse of discretion, and that

19

fills the void.

20

And so

There's already a

The problem was, there was no

Why can't they just use that?

MR. MARCUS:

Well, again, Mr. Chief Justice,

21

I don't think it was just a matter of not being a

22

standard of review.

23

being, of intent by Congress to have this just be a

24

matter of administrative grace.

25

contrast the language of the different -

I think it was a matter of just

And again, if you

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I thought what

2

you had argued before when people would try to seek this

3

release was that there's no standard of review to hold

4

the Secretary's exercise of discretion up against.

5

MR. MARCUS:

I think that was one of the

6

reasons that the Government cited, but I think there was

7

others as well.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But one thing you

never said was that there was no jurisdiction, because

10

there is jurisdiction in the district court.

11

paid money to the IRS and you want it back, you can

12

bring a refund action.

13

MR. MARCUS:

If you've

If you have a legal entitlement

14

to it, and the point is you didn't have a legal

15

entitlement to it before.

16

and Congress responded to that, not by saying you do

17

have a legally entitlement to this through a refund

18

action, which they easily could have said if they wanted

19

to reject those prior decisions, but instead they

20

created a limited remedy in the tax court.

21

how you can read that limited remedy in the tax court to

22

give rise to a broader remedy that doesn't have those

23

restrictions that Congress imposed on the tax court

24

remedy.

25

That's what the courts held,

I don't see

So it should be -- I think 6404(h) should be

one piece and then bring that over, as the Fifth Circuit

said, to apply to a refund action.

4

the proper way to interpret the.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't think that's

I now think maybe I don't

6

agree on this point that there are different standards,

7

because it does say in this abuse of discretion.

8

indeed that's a normal administrative standard, and so

9

as you read this you would think that the IRS does not

discretion in refusing to bring an abasement in refusing

12

to bring an abatement -- excuse me, to abate the

13

interest.

So far do you agree?

14
15

MR. MARCUS:

I'm sorry, Justice Breyer?

That Congress -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Once they make clear that

the standard is abuse of discretion, it only makes clear

It just means you

So there's a standard that

back to it is it closes the courthouse door.

nothing to do with the standards that applied.

to have something to do with why one class of people by

to characterize it as the closing of the courthouse

MR. MARCUS:

That's a fine way of looking at

it, Justice Scalia.

The other, the other anomaly the

seeking a refund having to split off his claims.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

too is not a significant anomaly.

2

taxpayers seek redetermination of their tax liability in

3

the tax court and those taxpayers must split their

claims because the interest abatement claim doesn't

ripen until the taxpayer's underlying liability has been

assessed.

The vast majority of

Moreover, the interest abatement question is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can they bring it as

additional claim after they get the final determination?

10

They start a whole separate action for interest

11

abatement?

12

MR. MARCUS:

That's -- if they, if they, if

13

they got relief on their refund claim, if they prevail

14

on their refund claim there would be no need to do that.

15

The interest would automatically abate.

16

were unsuccessful they could still pursue an interest

abatement on the grounds that the IRS committed an error

18

in delay in performing a material act.

Is it part of the

that there are several hundred cases below waiting the

These taxpayers would have

interest abatement in the tax court for abuse of

discretion on 6404(e)(1).

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the point that

13

Mr. Marcus just made, that the issue is discrete on

14

interest abatement, and it involves mishandling within

15

the Internal Revenue processing, and it's not like other

16

questions that have to do with the -- with the

17

intricacies of the Internal Revenue Code -

18

MR. REDDING:

That's only relatively true to

19

6404(e)(1), Your Honor.

But I will note that under

20

6404(a), where cases are now coming out of the tax court

21

for the first time, because it now has jurisdiction

22

under (h), it provides authority for the Commissioner to

23

abate interest where the IRS has erroneously or

24

illegally assessed the tax liability after the statute

25

of limitations runs or whether it's simply an erroneous
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

assessment.

2

discretion, and they are not really just ancillary to

3

the tax liability; they arise out of the substantive

4

challenge to the liability itself.

5

that has come out, which is the, I think is the first of

6

the 6404(a) cases, was an assertion that the

7

interest had been charged after the tax had been paid.

8

Now that's not a discretionary abatement; that's an

9

illegal assessment of interest and that's a 6404(h)

10
11
12
13

Those claims have nothing to do with

The Woodrall case

claim now.
Previously it would have been strictly a
refund claim under 16 -- under 1346.
I would also note that in terms of the being

14

able to pay it to cut off the interest accrual, that in

15

these cases, these cases that are before the Court, the

16

F quality -- the document the Government first sent out

17

proposing adjustments to the partnership level, if you

18

had computed the liability based on what the

19

Government's position was, the ultimate tax liability

20

including interest to any point in time would have been

21

at least three times the amount that results from the

22

tax court decision.

23

It's just ludicrous to say that the taxpayer

24

should be expected to take whatever the Government's

25

proposed adjustments are, compute what his maximum
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

liability may be, and pay it in advance or post a bond

2

in advance in order to cut off the interest accrual.

3

That argument just doesn't -- in my mind does not fly,

4

Your Honor.

5

This, this Court in Bob Jones University did

6

address the pay and sue versus prepayment jurisdiction

7

issue in terms of constitutionality and due process.

8

And, and basically said that as long as there is a pay

9

and sue remedy available, the taxpayer has no due

10

process rights to a prepayment remedy, but that the

11

Court might have come down differently had there been no

12

remedy available in terms of pay and sue.

13

I would also note that both the tax court,

14

the district courts, the Court of Federal Claims and the

15

appellate courts have long reviewed other discretionary

16

acts within the tax code by the Commissioner where no

17

standard is set forth on an abuse of discretion

18

standard, such as the authorization of the Commissioner

19

to abate certain penalties where the taxpayer has sought

20

an independent appraisal on the overvaluation penalty

21

under 6659.

22

the tax court and by the district courts in refund cases

23

on an abuse of discretion standard.

24

common law standard for reviewing an abuse of

25

discretion.
