ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
When Judge Wood on the Seventh Circuit

12

addressed precisely the same issue that's before this

13

Court, I think she correctly observed that the

14

distinction between an ongoing violation that arises

15

with each new use of a seniority system and the present

16

effect of a past discrimination is a distinction that is

17

subtle at best.

18

But it is the line that this Court has asked

19

the lower courts to draw, and I think the majority of

20

those courts have actually drawn that line

21

appropriately, although you could actually probably

22

argue that it's more a scatter plot than it is a line.

23

And I think it's a scatter plot that essentially looks

24

to three primary factors in evaluating whether or not

25

this is a case that is more like Evans and Lorance and
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Ledbetter, or a case that is more like Bazemore.

2

And those three factors are the stale nature

3

of the claims, whether or not there is a seniority at

4

stake, and whether or not the employees have fair and

5

adequate notice at the time of the action of the

6

employer.

7

Let's look at the staleness of the claim.

8

In this particular case, we are talking about maternity

9

leaves that were taken by -- taken by the Respondents

10

between 1968 and 1976.

The information that's available

11

to AT&T today is simply whether or not these particular

12

individuals were paid for periods of time.

13

nothing more than that.

There is

14

We have no way of knowing whether or not

15

these were maternity leaves or not maternity leaves,

16

whether these were leaves to go to school, leaves to

17

take care of -- of parents, or leaves for any other

18

particular purpose.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But at the time -- at the

20

time of the original reduction of credits, was there any

21

right claimed that any of these women had?

22

nothing had happened to them except there was a

23

bookkeeping entry.

24

sought retirement or sought some other benefit that

25

increased seniority would give them.

I mean,

They wouldn't be hurt until they

4
Alderson Reporting Company

But could they

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have come into court just from, on the books of AT&T,

2

they were docked X number of days?

3

as a consequence of that.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Nothing has happened

Justice Ginsburg, they not

5

only could have, but they did.

If you look at the

6

Eighth Circuit's decision -- and, indeed, Respondents in

7

this case did -- in the Communications Worker case out

8

of the Eighth Circuit, which is 602 F.2d 304, they

9

specifically alleged that one of the Bell operating

10

companies, one of the subsidiaries, had, in fact,

11

refused to grant these -- these exact service credits,

12

sued on that basis pre-PDA, and alleged that they were

13

entitled to relief.

14

The Eighth Circuit in that case looked at

15

this Court's decision in Gilbert and looked at this

16

Court's decision in Satty, and said specifically this

17

case is more like Gilbert than it's like Satty, but

18

never remotely questioned that that was an actionable

19

claim at that point in time.

20

me clear that that's an actionable claim because there

21

-- there is very little that is quite as critical in

22

this process -- in the employment relationship as

23

seniority.

24

benefits seniority here.

25

competitive seniority.

And, candidly, it seems to

And -- and we are not talking about simply
We are talking about

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So whether you have a -- a better claim to a

2

cushier job or -- or to better working conditions, all

3

of those are determined on the basis of -- of seniority,

4

which is being decided on an individualized basis.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it hadn't been

6

applied in any of those situations yet.

At -- at the --

7

at the point when the person returns from leave and is

8

docked a certain number of days, it hasn't been applied

9

to any of the situations you mentioned.

I grant you the

10

case would be totally ripe if there was a better job to

11

bid for, if there was an early retirement opportunity.

12

But here there was nothing -- nothing to be done.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I --

14

I question the premise that there was nothing to be

15

done.

16

less seniority today than they had yesterday, and if

17

they were told that on the basis of -- of gender-based

18

discrimination or race-based discrimination, would say:

19

I am entitled to go to court today.

I think the average person told that they have

20

Not only do I think that that's the way most

21

people would react to it, but the reality is if you look

22

at the way the litigation arose in the Eighth Circuit

23

case that I alluded to earlier, these very -- the same

24

union here made exactly that claim prior to the passage

25

of the PDA.

So the notion that the employees, one,
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't have notice -- they clearly did have notice --

2

and, two, didn't have an incentive to act, they clearly

3

did have an incentive to act.

4

And I think this is not much different from

5

what the Court said in Ricks, which is that obviously

6

you have more of an incentive when you feel the true

7

pain of a -- of a discriminatory act, assuming the act

8

was in -- was, in fact, discriminatory, but the

9

obligation to respond more -- to respond sooner remains

10

on the plaintiff.

11

And, again, to go back to the point I was

12

trying to make initially, these are all claims that

13

arose -- these are all actions taken between 1968 and

14

1976.

15

And one of the -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you have to, I

16

think, recognize that there's a big difference between

17

Evans, who was told, goodbye, you got married, you have

18

to resign -- a definite act that had immediate

19

consequences -- and this, where there -- there is a

20

potential for future consequences but no immediate

21

consequence of the kind that existed in your model case,

22

Evans.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, Justice Ginsburg,

24

there's -- there's no question that the impact in Evans

25

is -- is stronger than the impact here.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

I will readily

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

concede that.

2

importance of seniority is so far down the pecking order

3

or so de minimis in its impact that it would be

4

reasonable to assume that the average employee, told

5

that I'm am taking away your seniority on the basis --

6

on the basis of your race, would then sit back and say:

7

I'm not going to do anything; I'm going to wait until

8

the impact of that is felt.

9

But what I won't concede is that the

To the contrary, you would expect, given the

10

-- the centrality of seniority as a term of employment,

11

that any employee under those circumstances would

12

respond, you know, almost immediately under those

13

circumstances.

14

The -- the second factor in this case that,

15

it seems to me, this Court has relied upon significantly

16

in the prior decisions that have come out on the side of

17

not allowing this kind of litigation to go forward is we

18

are talking about a seniority system here.

19

as I said a minute ago, it's not just the rights of the

20

individual and what benefits she might be entitled to.

21

The seniority system obviously affects the rights of all

22

members of the -- of the seniority plan and all of the

23

pension plan and the entire system that the seniority

24

operates on.

25

that are involved here.

And the --

And so there are third-party interests

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And, again, both Congress and this Court's

2

decisions have consistently recognized that when that

3

situation arises, the resolution of the question ought

4

to be to say, no, these are present effects of past

5

discriminatory acts; we should be loath to try to

6

interfere with those -- with that seniority scheme under

7

these circumstances.

8

And then the third factor that it seems to

9

me the Court has been concerned about -- and it's one we

10

have been discussing -- which is the -- the -- you know,

11

the adequacy of the notice, where the employee is put on

12

notice at the time that actions were being taken.

13

Now, we can quarrel about how serious the --

14

the actions were, how detrimental they might have been.

15

But it seems to me there is no question that the -- that

16

the injury here is real and that the average employee

17

being told that you are being deprived of seniority on

18

-- on a race-based or sex-based or any other condition

19

that is protected would act immediately.

20

Now, it seems to me that the only argument

21

that the -- that the Respondents offer on the other side

22

-- and it's almost a mantra-like exposition by them and

23

it was certainly the basis for the Ninth Circuit, and I

24

think it's where the mistake arises -- is this claim

25

that this is -- is a facially discriminatory policy.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And their argument is if it's facially discriminatory,

2

then you can apply it now, and all of the reasons why

3

this Court has not applied these -- these kinds of

4

claims in the past in Evans and Lorance and Ledbetter is

5

-- is -- are off the hook in this circumstance.

6

But the truth is this is not a facially

7

discriminatory policy.

In the first place, this exact

8

same policy was looked at in "SAH-tee" or "SAT-ee."

9

don't know exactly how to pronounce it.

I

And the Court

10

said these kinds of arrangements where you don't give

11

service credit for people who take pregnancy leave is

12

not facially discriminatory.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

was prevailing.

15

way today.

16

So -But that was when Gilbert

Certainly, we would not regard it that

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't know whether it

17

would be regarded as facially discriminatory today.

18

think it would be regarded as illegal today.

19

would be facially discriminatory I think is a -- is a

20

trickier question, because again it seems to me that --

21

that the other side relies heavily on the statement in

22

Lorance about facially discriminatory plans.

23

I

Whether it

But what the Court described as a facially

24

discriminatory plan in that day was it was -- in that

25

case, was a situation where every day a male worker is
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

credited with a full day of work for a day's -- a day's

2

effort, and a woman is credited with half a day's work

3

for a day's effort.

4

rightly, that's a facially discriminatory plan.

5

And -- and the Court said, quite

Well, we don't have anything like that in

6

this case.

7

passage of the PDA to bring it completely in compliance.

8

So the plan, as it operates today, is -- is not only not

9

facially discriminatory; it is in no way discriminatory

10
11

This plan was changed in the wake of the

-JUSTICE BREYER:

Btu you -- what about --

12

I'm trying to work with this distinction where I agree

13

with you that it's hard to see exactly what it is.

14

if I look at Bazemore, I think there we have a large

15

number of employees.

16

thing, a salary structure, earlier, you see that that

17

salary structure systemically paid black people less

18

than white people.

19

reasons, there wasn't a statute -- we assume that that

20

was lawful at the time.

But

And if you look at a complicated

And at the time, for whatever

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then later it turns out

23

that they are keeping that salary structure, although

24

not for racially motivated reasons.

25

simply because that's what it was.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

They are keeping it
And the Court says,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you've taken that complex structure, and you are

2

administering it now, and the administration of it now

3

is what is unlawful.

4

Then, look at your case.

We had a

5

complicated structure involving seniority, really.

6

part of that old seniority system was this rule which

7

was legal at the time.

8
9

And

It is no longer legal.

Now, we move that structure over until now,
and we see we are administering the same complex

10

structure today in the same kind of way that was at

11

issue at Bazemore.

12

you have to apply today in order to see who is entitled

13

to what, just as they did that in Bazemore.

14

to think, doesn't that, on the key matter, look very

15

much like Bazemore?

16

It's a complicated set of rules that

So I began

What is your response?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Breyer, I -- I -- in

17

looking at this case, I have long thought of it as kind

18

of an M.C. Escher picture, where you look at it from one

19

direction and it looks one way, and then you turn it and

20

you look at it the other way, and it looks completely

21

different to you.

22

But I think the right answer to -- to your

23

analysis is that the way to look at Bazemore is that

24

every day after the statute was enacted, every employee

25

who showed up to work who was black was paid less than
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

every employee who showed up to work who was white.

2

that, it seems to me, as the Court said in Bazemore,

3

unanimously and without a whole lot of fanfare, is just

4

something simply illegal under Title VII under those

5

circumstances.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

exactly the same kind of analysis here?

8

not showing up for work.

9

getting retirement benefits.

And

Yes, but why can't you make
People here are

They are staying home and
And every day a person who

10

was out for 90 days because of a physical illness other

11

than pregnancy is getting a retirement benefit with an

12

extra dollar.

13

for 90 days for maternity is only getting an extra 33

14

cents.

15

retirement benefit exactly on par with the payment of

16

the salary in Bazemore?

17

And everybody who was out -- who was out

And -- and why isn't the payment of the

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I mean, I think the

18

answer to that, Justice Souter, is that's not -- that's

19

certainly not an implausible way of trying to look at

20

this problem, but if you look at the language of this

21

Court two terms ago in Ledbetter, and I'll quote it for

22

you:

23

adversely affects the calculation of a neutral factor

24

like seniority" -- which is what we are talking about

25

here -- "that is used in determining future pay" --

"The fact that pre-charging period discrimination

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which is the benefits from this program -- "does not

2

mean that each new paycheck constitutes a new violation

3

and restarts the EEOC charging period."

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

Well, do you -- do you see

Ledbetter in effect as -- as overruling Bazemore?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I think Ledbetter deals

7

with Bazemore in the context of a -- of a true seniority

8

system and an arrangement in which what you are looking

9

at -- because our case is a fortiori from -- from Evans

10

and -- and Ledbetter because, remember, we are talking

11

about a situation where what we did at the time, in our

12

judgment, was perfectly legal.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and at the time, in

14

Bazemore, that the private employers discriminated for

15

racial purposes, that was not unconstitutional or

16

illegal, either.

17
18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, I understand that, but

--

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At that time, even --

And then --- even more so.

You --

22

you've said several times that it was perfectly legal,

23

but isn't it true that the law in all of the circuits

24

was the other way, and it wasn't until this Court

25

decided the Gilbert case that the law changed?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

But if

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you were -- if you were an employer and you were

2

advising a client in, say, 1975, look to see where the

3

circuits were, the circuits said, yes, discrimination on

4

the basis of pregnancy is surely discrimination on the

5

basis of sex.

6

the Aiello case and then Gilbert that -- that that law

7

changed.

8
9

It wasn't until this Court decided first

But -MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, I understand that,

Justice Ginsburg, and obviously we don't quarrel with

10

that.

The problem obviously is the Court did decide

11

Gilbert; the Court didn't say the law changed.

12

the way the Court interpreted the statute at the time,

13

and under the interpretation of Gilbert and Satty, what

14

we did was perfectly legal, and when the statute

15

changed, what we did was to bring ourselves into

16

assiduous compliance with that position, Justice Souter,

17

which is what I think distinguishes --

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It was

No, but I mean, that --

19

with respect, I think that sort of begs the question

20

because if Bazemore is the right template for analyzing

21

this case, then you're not in compliance when you --

22

when your payment of the pension benefit reflects the

23

pregnancy differential.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Souter, there's no

question that you can read Bazemore that way.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

I just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think that the way this Court has read Bazemore and

2

Lorance and Ledbetter suggests that, in the context of

3

the case we have here, the right answer is this is more

4

like present effects of past allegedly discriminatory

5

acts and, therefore, not actionable at this time.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just be sure I

7

understand one thing:

8

is not unlawful or that the claim is untimely?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

actually.

11

we also say that if --

12
13

Are you contending that the plan

We are -- well, both,

We say it's not -- we say it's untimely, but

JUSTICE STEVENS:

At the time it was

adopted, it was lawful.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, exactly.

And that

15

otherwise it would have to be retroactive application of

16

the PDA.

I would like to reserve the balance of my
time.

2

The Ninth Circuit's decision in this case

3

impermissibly imposes retroactive liability on

4

Petitioner, and Respondents' claims are in any event

5

time-barred.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Miss Blatt, that was not

7

the position of the only representative of the United

8

States in the Ninth Circuit, as far as I know, the EEOC,

9

the brief in the Ninth Circuit.

We don't hear from the

10

EEOC in this Court, but I think it was not just that

11

brief but in the EEOC manual, they are taking a position

12

that is 180 degrees opposite yours.

13

MS. BLATT:

Am I right in --

You are absolutely correct.

You

14

are absolutely correct.

And Ledbetter -- this Court's

15

decision in Ledbetter, which was issued after both the

16

compliance manual and after the EEOC filed their brief,

17

explained that the EEOC is entitled to no special

18

deference on the interpretation of this Court's cases.

19

And the EEOC's interpretation is based on a conclusion

20

whether this case is governed by Evans or Bazemore, and

21

the EEOC hasn't purported to even discuss the

22

retroactivity -- or the retroactive imposition of

23

liability because the pregnancy leaves in this case were

24

taken before the PDA and, as the EEOC acknowledged in

25

that compliance manual, that denial of service credit at
17
Alderson Reporting Company

the time was lawful under this Court's decision.

less rhetorical about it.

statute providing that, starting one year from the

6

effective date of the statute, no pension plan will

differentiate in computing pension benefits on leaves

taken between -- as between leaves taken for -- for

9

conventional sickness and leaves taken for pregnancy.

10

What if Congress passed a

Would that statute be unconstitutional?

11

MS. BLATT:

Unconstitutional?

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MS. BLATT:

Yes.

I think -- I mean, the way I

14

understand your case is that Congress can speak in clear

15

language to impose retroactive --

16
17
18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

To make it retroactive.

Yes.
MS. BLATT:

Retrospective liability.

It's

19

just there's nothing in the PDA that indicates that

20

retroactive liability was imposed.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And --

So your -- your argument

22

simply is a -- a purely statutory construction argument:

23

That isn't what Congress had in mind.

24
25

MS. BLATT:

Right, and your hypothetical

statute would seem inconsistent with -18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If Congress would have had

in mind, then there would be a question whether Congress

3

could do it, and you agree that it could.

4

question is simply:

5

So the

Did it or didn't it in this case?

MS. BLATT:

That's right, and I think the --

6

the seniority system provision, 703(h), would just be

7

completely counter to that hypothetical provision

8

because Congress has taken special care to make sure

9

seniority systems can continue to exist, even though

10

they incorporate pre-Act discrimination.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Was this statute effective

180 days after its -- after signature?

13

MS. BLATT:

With respect to fringe benefit

14

programs, I think it was effective on the date it

15

passed.

16

that AT&T immediately came into compliance on the

17

effective date of the Act.

And there's no question -- everyone concedes --

18

And the -- our key point on retroactivity is

19

the way to look at this is what the statute prohibited

20

and that is discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.

21

And the pregnancy discrimination occurred in this case

22

based on the discriminatory leave policies, and those --

23

those were all taken in the '60s and '70s before the PDA

24

was passed.

25

is it orders Petitioner to restore service credit taken

And what the Ninth Circuit's decision does

for the pregnancy leave before the passage of the -- of

the PDA.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you -- do you think

Ledbetter modified or overruled Bazemore?

5

MS. BLATT:

No.

It just put it in context,

6

and I don't think that Bazemore deals with the

7

retroactivity point, and let me explain why:

8

employer in Bazemore who continued to pay African

9

Americans less than whites was ordered prospectively to

The -- the

10

start paying equal wages for equal work, but

11

specifically not ordered to make up for past wage

12

differentials.

13

What this does is much -- much more prejudicial and

14

upsets expectations in three ways, and this is some of

15

the things that Mr. Phillips talked about.

16

time the pregnancy leaves were taken, the Petitioner was

17

entitled and probably required to make planning and

18

funding decisions for its pension liabilities.

19

And I think it's for three reasons.

And at the

Second, the Petitioner should not, 30 to 40

20

years after the fact, have to defend claims about

21

whether these women were disabled and actually unable to

22

work due to pregnancy, when medical records and

23

personnel records are probably missing and memories long

24

since faded.

25

And, third, the retroactive scrambling of a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

seniority system upsets the vested rights of other

2

employees.

3
4

And I just don't think you have any of that
in Bazemore.

The employer said --

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MS. BLATT:

7
8
9

Well, why does it upset --

-- you me to pay out money

prospectively.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So far as pension benefits

are concerned, it doesn't upset any employee's

10

expectations.

The ones who don't have a pregnancy

11

background are going to get the same pension that they

12

-- they bargained for.

13

MS. BLATT:

Well, I think of a pension plan

14

as a zero-sum game.

There's a more limited amount.

15

more specifically, there --

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But

Well, but that -- I mean,

17

that's -- that's an issue that you touched on, on your

18

second point.

19

And if -- if I were faced with -- with a problem, and I

20

may be, in which I really have two choices -- I've got

21

two analogies in our cases, I can take either one, and

22

there were evidence in here that the -- that this was

23

going to be so traumatic to the pension system that it

24

would be manifestly unfair and perhaps endanger benefits

25

for others to force these benefits to be paid, that

I don't know if it is a zero-sum game.

21

would be a good reason to go one way.

we have that in the case.

And --

MS. BLATT:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

But I don't think

Well, I -And if we don't have it in

the case, then this isn't a zero-sum game.

10

The class allegations are

But my point on vested seniority rights is

11

that the class includes current employees.

12

Respondent Porter is a current employee.

13

this case is to restore seniority credit, I assume for

14

current employees, which will give them greater

15

seniority rights vis-a-vis other employees who have

16

planned their own issues about job bidding and

17

retirement and seniority based on 30 to 40 years of

18

expectations.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

situation like Evans, somebody who was out of the

21

22

bump some people who -- who filled in while she was not

23

working, and get that credit.

24

This is just a question of weeks.

25

MS. BLATT:

This is quite different.

these people had very significant disabilities, over 6,

the -- the female flight attendant was discharged on a

4

facially discriminatory policy of forcing married female

5

flight attendants to resign.

6

Court cases have said that the decision -- as

7

inexplicable as it was, the decision not to treat

8

pregnancy as a disability was not on its face a

9

discriminatory policy.

10

But in terms of the fairness here, I mean,

Here, the two Supreme

Now, the PDA immediately overruled that, but

11

applied it prospectively, and now we are here 30 to 40

12

years later basically litigating the complaint that was

13

brought in the Eighth Circuit as well as the complaint

14

that was brought in the Second Circuit by the Respondent

15

here.

16

these are all cited on the Petitioner's brief and the

17

reply brief on page 17.

18

They brought this case twice in the Second -- and

In the Second Circuit case, it was granted,

19

vacated, and remanded in light of Gilbert.

20

the Eighth Circuit case, they actually lost on the

21

merits under Satty.

22

And then in

Now, the only thing that has changed is the

23

passage of 30 years and the PDA, which doesn't apply

24

retroactively.

25

So I just think that --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do I correctly understand

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that -- that you would agree that if this plan were

2

adopted today it would be unlawful, but because it was

3

-- that at the time it was adopted, and the statute uses

4

the word "adopted," it was lawful?

5

MS. BLATT:

Let me be very clear on this.

6

The seniority system in this case is facially neutral;

7

it just accords seniority to men and women on an equal

8

basis depending on whether they took disability leave or

9

personal leave.

The leave policy that forced women to

10

take pregnancy leave as personal leave would be illegal

11

if it were adopted today, because the PDA says you can't

12

treat -- women affected by pregnancy have to be treated

13

for the same purposes.

14

So the seniority system is always just the

15

same.

It says, based on total years of service, you get

16

pension benefits, men and women the same.

17

accrual policy, men and women were treated identically.

18

Just like in Evans, men and women were denied seniority

19

or service credit if they were terminated for -- for

20

charge, and there was a separate unlawful policy that

21

basically defined -- cause -- excuse me -- if you were

22

terminated for cause -- and a separate policy that

23

defined "cause" to say, well, if you were a female

24

flight attendant and you married, then you were forced

25

to resign.

In the

So obviously that policy was always

1

unlawful.

2

if AT&T hadn't had changed its leave policy, someone

3

could sue immediately.

4

immediate --

5

It would be unlawful today.

And similarly,

I mean, these women -- the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before you -- do I

6

understand your answer to Justice Stevens's question to

7

be yes, it would be legal to adopt this seniority policy

8

today?

9

MS. BLATT:

Yes -- the seniority system is

10

their seniority system, and it's completely neutral and

11

completely lawful.

12

if you were a woman and you take pregnancy --

13
14
15

AT&T's pre-PDA leave policy.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand, but

we're -MS. BLATT:

-- that's unlawful today.

would be facial discrimination on the basis of

pregnancy, and it would be unlawful.

the policy today -- which I thought was

Justice Stevens's question, and maybe it's not -- that

would be acceptable?

the fact that this -- the leave policy -- the seniority

policy was adopted during the time prior to Gilbert?

MS. BLATT:

MS. BLATT:

Then I think you would have

a -- well, you would have an unlawful policy that

7

someone could sue on immediately, and it would be facial

discrimination, and we wouldn't be up here making a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN RUSSELL

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20
21
22

MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The distinction between Evans and this case

23

turns on the difference between discrimination outside

24

of the seniority system which affects an employee's

25

ability to provide service to the employer, and
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discrimination within the seniority system itself that

2

gives unequal credit for equal service.

3

Congress drew that line, adopting one that

4

this Court had referred to in Lorance, when it passed

5

section 706(e)(2) of Title VII, which provided that a

6

facially discriminatory seniority system can be

7

challenged, not only when --

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

May I ask a question?

If

there is a facially discriminatory system, are you

10

saying this is a disparate impact case or a disparate

11

treatment case?

12
13

MR. RUSSELL:
case.

14
15

This is a disparate treatment

JUSTICE STEVENS:

When did the -- when did

the intentional discrimination take place?

16

MR. RUSSELL:

It took place when AT&T

17

applied an accrual rule to my clients' disability leave,

18

and said --

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You do not -- you do not

20

contend that the plan was unlawful at the time it was

21

adopted?

22

MR. RUSSELL:

We think that it was, but it

23

doesn't matter.

Ultimately under 706(e)(2), what

24

matters is that the plan discriminated on its face.

25

the insight beyond that -- and that doesn't turn on

face, intentionally discriminates on the basis of height

4

every time it's applied; and when it does, whether it's

5

lawful or not, is applied in accordance with the law

6

that existed at the time of the application.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

A plan that

Well, let me ask you this

8

question:

At the time the plan was adopted,

9

discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not

10

discrimination on the basis of sex, according to the

11

majority in Gilbert.

12

MR. RUSSELL:

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

Which I happen to disagree

with.

15
16

That's correct.

So as a matter of law, it seems to me at the
time the plan was adopted it was a lawful plan.

17

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, we think it was unlawful

18

for two reasons, and one is that it was unlawful under

19

Satty.

Now, I acknowledge --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

MR. RUSSELL:

Under what?

Under Satty, under the Court's

22

decision in Satty that said discrimination with respect

23

to seniority had an unlawful discriminatory impact on

24

the basis of sex.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was -- that was

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

coming back to work and having all of your seniority

2

stripped.

3

Is that -MR. RUSSELL:

That is correct, but we don't

4

think that there's a distinction because what the Court

5

said was that the injury is cognizable because it

6

affects employment opportunities.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but I thought the

8

question was whether it was unlawful at the time, before

9

the later statute.

10

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes, and we think --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and you say that,

12

even though discriminating against pregnancy leave was

13

itself lawful, a retirement plan that did not give you

14

credit for the time of that pregnancy leave was

15

unlawful?

16

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

Let me be clear.

We

17

think that at the time our clients took their leave, it

18

was unlawful under Title VII and under Satty to

19

discriminate on the basis of pregnancy with respect to

20

seniority, whether it's the right to retain accrued

21

seniority or the right to accumulate it in the first

22

place.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you say Gilbert had

nothing to do with it?
MR. RUSSELL:

Gilbert said that it wasn't
29

Alderson Reporting Company

1

intentional discrimination on the basis of sex.

Satty

2

said it had an unlawful disparate impact on the basis of

3

sex.

4

section 706(e)(2), the question is whether the system as

5

a whole, which includes the accruable, discriminates on

6

its face, whether it's intentionally discriminatory; and

7

the insight behind that rule was, as I said before with

8

the example of a height discrimination, a rule that

9

discriminates on the basis of height intentionally

But ultimately none of this matters, because under

10

11

applied.

answer.

15

off on the other point.

Could you -- could I

I'd just trying to understand your earlier
It just took me a little while before you got

16

You're saying it was lawful at the time to

17

deliberately discriminate on the basis of pregnancy --

18

Gilbert -- but that that was somehow unlawful if in fact

19

your deliberate discrimination had a disparate impact?

20

MR. RUSSELL:

Had a disparate impact on the

21

basis of sex, yes.

22

what Satty held clearly with respect to accrued

23

seniority.

24
25

That's what Satty held -- that's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
missing it.

Well, maybe I'm

Isn't it a bit unusual to say it's
30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

perfectly all right to discriminate intentionally, but

2

if it has a disparate impact, that's not all right?

3

MR. RUSSELL:

4

case.

5

it's not --

That's every disparate impact

It's not that it's all right.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's just that

No, I -- I don't

7

think it's every disparate impact case.

In a disparate

8

impact case, it's because you can't show, typically,

9

deliberate discrimination, so you look at what the

10

impact was.

11

where it's okay to do something intentionally, but it's

12

illegal -- to discriminate intentionally, but it's

13

illegal if that has a disparate impact.

14

But I guess I've never heard of a case

MR. RUSSELL:

Let me just be clear about the

15

terms.

16

discrimination, but Satty said that it constitutes --

17

that pregnancy discrimination with respect to seniority

18

credits constitutes -- has an unlawful disparate impact

19

on the basis of sex.

20

Gilbert said it was not unlawful intentional sex

In that sense --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but Gilbert

21

said it wasn't discrimination on the basis of sex,

22

because it said that discrimination on the basis of

23

pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex;

24

and yet you are saying if there is a disparate impact on

25

the basis of pregnancy, then it is discrimination on the
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

base of sex.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

Let me try one more time.

3

maybe -- it's just to say that sometimes, intentional

4

discrimination on the basis of pregnancy can have a

5

disparate impact on the basis of sex.

6

said -- Satty said.

And

7

That's what Satty

But --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your -- is there

8

any other -- can you cite a case to me where we have

9

held there is discriminatory treatment, but that's

10

lawful, but the discriminatory impact of that is

11

unlawful?

12

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, I think a height

13

requirement would be intentional discrimination on the

14

basis of height that could have an unlawful disparate

15

impact on the basis of sex.

16

construction.

I think it's a parallel

17

But, ultimately, I -- I don't want to waste

18

too much time on this, because I don't think it matters

19

because the insight behind section 706(e)(2) is that

20

every act that implements a facially discriminatory

21

system constitutes a fresh act of that intentional

22

discrimination.

23

And so there's no question --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But does the statute use

24

the term -- does the statute use the term "facially

25

discriminatory system"?
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

It uses the term

"intentionally discriminatory system."

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. RUSSELL:

Right.

And there's no dispute that a

5

facially discriminatory system discriminates

6

intentionally.

7

And so --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is also clear that --

8

is it also clear that a statute -- that -- that a plan

9

that does not intentionally discriminate may,

10

nevertheless, discriminate facially?

11

things --

12

MR. RUSSELL:

I think the two

Well, again, it's -- it's the

13

predicates that change.

It's a -- it can be a plan that

14

doesn't intentionally discriminate on the basis of sex

15

at the time, in the past.

16

that it intentionally discriminates on the basis of

17

pregnancy.

But when it -- but it's clear

18

And so then the question -- so then under

19

706(e)(2), under this Court's insight in Lorance, the

20

current application of that system constitutes a present

21

act --

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but that was the

23

current application of a system that was plainly

24

discriminatory, intentionally discriminatory.

25

was.

Lorance

They intentionally discriminated against women.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes.

The -- the intent behind

2

the system is imbued in every application of the system.

3

So a system that is intentionally discriminatory on the

4

basis of pregnancy discriminates intentionally on the

5

basis of pregnancy every time it's applied.

6

question --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. RUSSELL:

9

Go on, finish.

And the

I --

And, under Section 706(e)(2),

the question is simply whether that discrimination is

10

unlawful at the time of application --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand why you

12

say that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory

13

now.

14

discriminatory.

You contend that right now it's facially

15

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes, it's --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me what the

17

retirement plan says is that there is deducted from your

18

seniority, for purposes of calculating what you get

19

under the plan, all periods in which you -- you were

20

lawfully not deemed to be -- to be working for the

21

company.

22

discriminatory at all.

23

Now, that doesn't seem to be facially

MR. RUSSELL:

I think it's -- the system is

facially discriminatory -- there are several parts.

is:

One

system?

2

3

it's part of the seniority system.

4

discriminated on its face on the basis of pregnancy.

5

And we think that the rule that says pregnancy

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that rule

No, but it didn't.

Not --

6

not during the period for which it is used in -- in the

7

retirement system.

8

MR. RUSSELL:

There's no --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

After the new legislation

10

was passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority.

11

But -- but during the period before that occurred, it

12

was not counted towards seniority, and it -- and it was

13

lawfully not counted towards seniority.

14

So what you have is a retirement plan that

15

says all lawful periods of work -- all periods of work

16

are -- that lawfully must be credited will be credited

17

to the -- to the employees.

18

facially discriminatory.

19

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't see how that is

It facially discriminates on

20

the basis of pregnancy and then does so whether the

21

pregnancy discrimination was unlawful at the time or

22

not.

23

discriminatory intent to discriminate on the basis of

24

pregnancy is carried forward today in every application.

25

And the whole point of the rule was simply to say that

And under 706(e)(2), that -- that facially

we don't want to force employees to have to run into

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is -- is there a difference

between "facially discriminatory" and "discriminatory

6

7

all it says is that you are credited with all of the

8

periods in which you were lawfully working for the

9

company and you are not credited for periods in which

10

the company lawfully deemed you not to be working for

11

the company, I don't see how that is facially

12

discriminatory in -- in any sense.

13

I mean I can see how you could say it has a

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, that scenario, I think,

14

is indistinguishable from what happened in Bazemore.

15

Recall, in Bazemore, that the basic rule is you get paid

16

now today what we paid you before Title VII, plus a

17

nondiscriminatory raise.

18

is simply perpetuation of the pre-Act intentional race

19

discrimination, which wasn't unlawful at the time.

20

if you apply that system today, that constitutes a

21

present act of racial discrimination subject to the

22

present requirements of Title VII.

And this Court said that that

your assertion that it's facially discriminatory.

Alderson Reporting Company

Did

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Basemore more say it was facially discriminatory?

2

MR. RUSSELL:

No, Bazemore did not use that

3

term.

4

rationale of Bazemore was the rationale this Court gave

5

in Lorance, which was that it involved a --

6

intentionally a systematic system of discrimination

7

that, even though it was lawful when it was instituted

8

-- was first instituted, its carrying over into the

present era subjects it to the requirements of Title VII

But this Court, in Ledbetter, assumed that the

now.

distinguishable because what the employer in Bazemore

13

did is -- is simply what AT&T has done here.

time Title VII took effect, the employer in Bazemore

15

stopped giving discriminatory base salaries and stopped

giving discriminatory pay raises, but it just added to

that base salary in a nondiscriminatory manner, in the

same way that AT&T stopped discriminating in the amounts

that it added to accrued seniority.

MR. RUSSELL:

They were applying a pay

structure that was adopted --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, they were still

It didn't depend on history; whereas, a pension plan --

they always look at the formation of the plan.

under subsection (h), I think you do.

MR. RUSSELL:

At least

The paychecks were in -- in

Bazemore were intentionally discriminatory only insofar

as you look back to the pre-Title VII --

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that's what I disagree

with.

22

Bazemore, you find they are getting different salaries

because of the difference in -- one is of one race, and

the other is of another race.

that, in this case, you had a plan which was established

be given to any reliance interest on the part of the

that judgment?

25

One reason would be reliance

How are we in a position to make

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't think you are, which
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is why I do think that it's perfectly appropriate for

2

this Court to do what it did in cases like Manhart,

3

which is to say there's one definition of

4

"discrimination" under Title VII, and it's not going to

5

vary depending on whether we're talking about the

6

pension plan or something else.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but doesn't the

8

risk or the potential of a fixed-fund pension plan where

9

employees who are not parties to this action receive

10

less?

Isn't there at least that possibility?

11

MR. RUSSELL:

There's only that --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And shouldn't that

13

possibility be weighed in the decision of this Court?

14

think that's the line of questioning here.

15

MR. RUSSELL:

I

And my suggestion is, number

16

one, that there's no realistic possibility of that here.

17

But, number two, that that's a --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And there's no realistic

19

possibility that some pensions are based on a fixed fund

20

which has been established already?

21

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't think so.

If you are

22

talking about a defined benefit plan, which is what we

23

have here, any increases in liability simply mean that

24

the employer has to --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I take it that this

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decision you want us to write applies across the board

2

to all plaintiffs.

3

MR. RUSSELL:

I think that it does, but I

4

think that it could quite possibly apply differently,

5

for example, through a 401(k) plan where the

6

discrimination would have occurred at a time when people

7

are making running contributions.

8

mean, I think that this Court has taken into account

9

those kinds of things at the remedial phase, where you

10

have an opportunity to look at the facts about how this

11

would affect the pension in this case or pensions

12

generally.

13

But ultimately, I

There's simply no evidence here to suggest

14

that there are those kinds of problems, because very few

15

employers as far as we can tell continue this kind of

16

discrimination.

17

And we're talking about a small subset of employees and

18

relatively small amounts of money with respect to each

19

of them.

Most have eliminated it decades ago.

20

So I think -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Russell, what do you

21

say to Mr. Phillips' argument that you brought -- you

22

brought essentially this case way back when, that the

23

union said that this retirement plan is in violation of

24

Title VII?

25

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, first of all, I mean, my
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

individual-named clients didn't bring those claims back

2

then; and they lost, the union that brought this claim.

3

And then there were -- if I recollect correctly, they

4

were challenging at that moment the denial of their

5

disability leave payments.

6

saying simply, you know, the only harm we're facing now

7

is the prospect in the future of a lower pension.

8

They weren't coming in and

And that's the kind of hypothetical future

9

harm that we don't think Congress would have intended to

10

be the basis of a lawsuit, not -- one of the -- when the

11

entire purpose of enacting 706(e)(2) was that Congress

12

was concerned not to require employees to run to court

13

every time there is some discrimination that affects the

14

amount of their seniority, because that causes a

15

disruption to the employment atmosphere, it creates work

16

for the EEOC and the courts, and in many, many cases the

17

marginal difference in the amount of the seniority

18

credit we are talking about here will make no big

19

difference at all to anything.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, when you say there's

21

relatively little amounts of money, can you tell us what

22

amount -- what the maximum amount would be involved?

23

Are you --

MR. RUSSELL:

I think -- and we haven't had

I think there is a fairly linear

$17 billion surplus in that fund.

that this is going to bankrupt this particular fund.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's no question

What -- what do you do

about section 703(h) of Title VII, which -- which we

25

have held says that -- that makes it lawful for a bona
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

fide seniority system to perpetuate the effects of

2

pre-Act discrimination?

3

MR. RUSSELL:

The distinction between 703(h)

4

and this case is that, in this case, we challenge a

5

system, a seniority system that is itself facially

6

discriminatory, and 703(h) says that doesn't apply --

7
8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That hinges -- that hinges

on your "facially discriminatory."
MR. RUSSELL:

It does.

And in addition, we

10

also have the argument that the Ninth Circuit accepted,

11

but -- that the PDA on its own terms says, that 703(h)

12

doesn't apply to permit discrimination that the PDA

13

itself would forbid.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, yes, that's -- that's

15

rather implausible, but 70(h) covers sex discrimination

16

and even race discrimination, but it doesn't cover

17

pregnancy discrimination.

I mean, I --

18

MR. RUSSELL:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

You may think that, but -You need pretty clear

language to persuade me of that.
MR. RUSSELL:

I think that in the end, I

22

mean, it's worthwhile to focus on the consequences of

23

accepting AT&T's view.

24

mightily on whether an employer keeps a running tab on

25

seniority, in which case they can avoid the application

On the better view, it depends

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the PDA because it made the calculation beforehand,

2

and an employer who, at the end of an employee's career,

3

simply tabulates the term of employment, which I think

4

under their view subjects that employer to the current

5

requirements of the PDA.

6

that Congress wouldn't intend Title VII to turn on such

7

trivial distinctions.

8

And we respectfully suggest

Moreover, under their view, an employer

9

who -- an employer would be able to pay black workers

10

today smaller pensions than white workers who provided

11

exactly the same amount of service, if those black

12

workers started working for it before Title VII was

13

enacted, at a time when the employer had no pension

14

system for blacks and didn't give them any seniority

15

credit.

16

says here, which is that the present disparity in

17

pension benefits is simply the present effect of

18

discrimination that was lawful when it occurred.

That employer could say the same thing AT&T

saying anything that is in effect and is still there,

for other areas or not?

sure of is how it squares with Ledbetter.

7

MR. RUSSELL:

And the other thing I'm not

Well, the difference between

8

Ledbetter and this case is Ledbetter involved

9

discrimination entirely outside of the seniority system,

10

and as a result, it didn't -- 706(e)(2) didn't apply;

11

this Court's decision in Lorance didn't apply.

12

Congress enacted this 706(e)(2) to provide a very

13

special rule to displace the rule of evidence.

14

-- it was unambiguously intended to displace the rule of

15

evidence with respect to intentionally discriminatory

16

seniority systems.

17

MR. RUSSELL:

And

It was

Evans isn't a problem because

18

the rule they were administering in Evans is whoever is

hired is in fact hired at low seniority.

to say that that's a complicated system of rules that

21

had a pre-existence, even though this individual was

22

where she was because of that earlier system.

23

MR. RUSSELL:

Now, it's hard

Again, I think the distinction

24

between Evans and this case is discrimination that

25

occurred entirely outside of a -- the seniority system
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and discrimination within the seniority system that

2

gives unequal credit for equal service.

3

said of that kind of discrimination -- we're not going

4

to make you challenge immediately.

5

you wait until the reduced seniority has a concrete

6

effect on your compensation or other terms and

7

conditions of employment, and then you can raise it

8

then.

9

And Congress

We're going to let

And the underlying thought of the provision

10

is that if you are subject to intentional discrimination

11

with respect to seniority accrual, we are going to

12

impute that intent to the subsequent applications of

13

that seniority system when it's applied to injure you.

And if --

that the key is the -- is the intent.

MR. RUSSELL:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. RUSSELL:

You are relying on Nashville v. Satty, which was

Which is it?

We make alternative arguments.
Oh, okay.

We argue that to the extent it

23

matters whethers this was lawful at the time our clients

24

took their leave, it was not unlawful, and we point to

25

Satty.

But we say ultimately that doesn't matter
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because under section 706(e)(2), so long as they

2

implement, so long as they rely on the diminished

3

seniority in the present, that constitutes a present act

4

of pregnancy discrimination, intentional pregnancy

5

discrimination, which is unlawful under the PDA.

6
7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, as soon as you get

back to the intentional, you get away from Satty.

8

MR. RUSSELL:

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes, I agree with that.
Oh, okay.

But I don't think there can be

11

any dispute that when my clients had their seniority

12

reduced, it was an act of facial pregnancy

13

discrimination; and under 702 -- 706(e)(2), that intent

14

to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy is --

15
16

JUSTICE STEVENS:
the time it was done.

17
18

But it was not unlawful at

MR. RUSSELL:

I do think it was unlawful,

but it doesn't matter with respect to 706(e)(2).

19

If I could turn briefly to the retroactivity

20

argument:

It's important to be clear what the Ninth

21

Circuit held and what it didn't hold.

22

that AT&T was liable for anything it did prior to the

23

effective date of the PDA.

24

that it was liable simply because it moved the NCS dates

25

or because it relied on them in any way before the

It did not hold

It didn't, for example, hold

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

effective date of the PDA.

All it said was that AT&T is

2

precluded from relying on that discriminatory measure of

3

service in the future.

4

And in that sense, this case is quite like

5

this Court's decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Company,

6

where the Court said Title VII prohibits employers from

7

relying on the results of discriminatory employment

8

tests.

9

VII subjected to liability employers who administered or

10

relied on those tests before the effective date of Title

11

VII, but everybody understood that they couldn't rely on

12

those results after the effective date of Title VII, and

13

nobody thought that that gave the statute a retroactive

14

effect.

15

Now, nobody thought that that meant that Title

And that's all that the Ninth Circuit

16

interpreted the PDA to do here, is to prohibit AT&T from

17

engaging in the post-Act reliance on those pre-Act

18

discriminatory measures, that AT&T had every opportunity

19

to conform its -- to conform its conduct to the -- to

20

the requirements of the PDA, and a statute that simply

21

tells an employer how it has to treat past events for

22

future employment decision purposes is simply not a

23

statute that has a retroactive effect.

24
25

Finally, I'd like to -- if I have time, I'd
like to address this suggestion from the Solicitor
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

General's Office that this doesn't involve seniority

2

discrimination at all because what we are talking about

3

here is discrimination that occurred with respect to the

4

personnel policy about the classification of leave, as

5

opposed to discrimination within the seniority system

6

itself.

7

And this Court was clear in California

8

Brewers that an accrual rule that says how time counts

9

for seniority purposes is part of the seniority system.

10

And under AT&T's system, it's true you have to apply a

11

two-part rule.

12

asked, does this pregnancy leave count, you have to ask,

13

well, is it personal leave?

14

anything until you apply the second part of the rule

15

that says pregnancy leave counts as -- as personal

16

leave.

17

You have to know whether -- if you are

But that doesn't tell you

And because you need to know the answers to

18

-- to both of those questions, both parts of the rules

19

are properly considered to be part of the accrual rule

20

and part of the seniority system.

21

Finally, if I -- if I could return once

22

again to this alternative argument that we have, that

23

even setting aside Bazemore and section 706(e)(2), this

24

is not -- our clients weren't required to challenge this

25

discrimination before because it wasn't an completed,
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unlawful employment practice at the time.

2

And, again, the point is that discrimination

3

with respect to a small amount of time going towards

4

seniority doesn't affect even the worker's actual

5

seniority, that is, her place in the seniority

6

hierarchy.

7

person who is next in line above her and 2 years' senior

8

to the person next in line below her -- 6 weeks of

9

service credit aren't going to make any difference with

A worker who is 2 years' junior to the

10

respect to her place on the seniority hierarchy.

11

not going to make any difference with respect to her

12

ability to bid for jobs.

13

going to make any difference with respect to her

14

pension, because at the time that these leaves are taken

15

typically, the person is years away, perhaps decades

16

away, from even vesting in their pension benefit.

17

It's

And it's not necessarily even

And Congress reasonably would have thought,

18

I think, that that kind of harm is too speculative to

19

warrant immediate -- to warrant the requirement that the

20

employees have to immediately challenge that kind of

21

discrimination at the time it occurs.

22

Congress enacted section 706(e)(2), to give employees an

23

opportunity to wait until the discrimination has a

24

concrete effect on their employment status, on their

25

compensation or terms of employment.
53
Alderson Reporting Company

That's why

And AT&T's view of

Official - Subject to Final Review

the statute --

Now, if 706(e)(2) applies, they can
challenge the system as of -- when it's adopted or when

10

it's applied to them, but otherwise they have to wait

11

until it injures them within the meaning of section

12

706(e)(2).

And that's a perfectly sensible rule.

13

Remember, we're talking here about facial

14

discrimination, and the concerns about stale evidence

15

are not particularly strong here because -- and, as a

16

result, we are able to stipulate to the underlying

17

facts.

18

did.

19

the reduction in our clients' leaves was as a result of

20

pregnancy versus something else.

21

is simply a consequence Congress must have intended when

22

it said that discriminatory seniority systems are open

23

to challenge whenever they apply to injure a worker,

24

even if that means that so long -- if an employer

25

implements a plan for 30 years, Congress understood that

Everybody knows what the system was and what it
And there's no reasonable dispute about whether

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

8

I'd just like to make a couple of points:

9

Justice Ginsburg, you asked a question about the earlier

10

litigation, and let me just quote from the first page of

11

Judge Bright's opinion where it says the appellants in

12

the class action allege that Southwestern Bell

13

discriminates against women by, quote, "refusing to

14

extend full seniority credit to female employees on

15

maternity leave."

16

being litigated in this particular case.

17

That is precisely the claim that's

And contrary to my brother's position just a

18

few minutes ago, that these don't have any impact and

19

why would anybody act on the basis of them, it seems to

20

me that that lawsuit belies that fact.

21

the impact on seniority, and they acted immediately as a

22

consequence of that.

23

They recognize

Justice Souter, I do agree with you.

I

24

think the reason that Bazemore is not the -- I wouldn't

25

say "line" -- more the point of authority to be as the
55

1

departure in this particular case is because of the

2

implications for the seniority system.

3

Justice Kennedy, the problem here is we

4

don't know exactly what the impact's going to be.

5

we do know is that all plans are funded on a set of

6

actuarial assumptions, and, candidly, if they say we

7

were overfunded a couple months ago, given to what has

8

happened to my pension plans in the last couple of

9

months, I would worry a little bit about what the

10

What

situation is.

11

But the -- but the most fundamental point is

12

you don't know.

13

understand is that Congress routinely says protect the

14

seniority systems, protect the pension plans.

15

my colleague says, well, but this is all form over

16

substance because what if they come back at the end and

17

decided to do all these calculations?

18

fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the pension

19

process.

20

actuarial assumptions.

21

they're going to allow the determination of seniority to

22

be made at the tail end without making assumptions about

23

what they are going to be like going in.

24
25

And in that context, what we do

You know,

That

You have to fund these in advance.

You make

No one is in a position where

And, Justice Breyer, I think that is the
answer to your question because we are not taking this
56

1

complex system wholesale and just dumping it post-PDA.

2

What we did is we retained the specific rules with

3

respect to the accrual and the seniority, and we

4

eliminated the underlying distinctions between pregnancy

5

and other kinds of disabilities.

6

apply it, and that, frankly, is fundamentally different

7

from Bazemore because we are not discriminating every

8

day in a way that harms them.

9

decision, like a pay decision, pre-Act; now we are

And that's how we

We made a seniority

10

acting -- it's not a pay decision post-Act.

11

to my mind in that sense it is just like Evans and that

12

line of cases.

13

And it's --

Finally, you asked the question, Justice

14

Souter, could Congress have done -- have done exactly

15

what the Respondents ask?

16

yes.

17

this.

18

upset a lot of expectations.

19

And the answer to that is

Congress could say today we're not going to allow
It would upset a lot of pension plans.

Congress could have done it.

It would

Congress

20

didn't do it, or at least if it were going to upset all

21

of those reliance interests, Congress would have done so

22

in language that was much more explicit than what it has

23

done in the PDA and 706(e)(2).

24
25

If there are no further questions, Your
Honor, I urge you to reverse the judgment below.
