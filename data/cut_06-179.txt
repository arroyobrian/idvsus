CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in case 06-179, Riegel v. Medtronic,

5

Inc.

6

Ms. Zieve.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLISON M. ZIEVE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. ZIEVE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether Section

12

360k(a) of the Medical Device Amendment to the Food,

13

Drug, and Cosmetic Act preempts State law claims seeking

14

damages for injuries caused by a device that received

15

pre-market approval.

16

approval process is that it results in an FDA decision

17

that a particular device must be designed, labeled, and

18

manufactured in a particular way.

19

incorrect, and so I want to talk -- begin by talking

20

about what pre-market approval is and what it isn't.

21

PMA is FDA's permission to market a Class 3 device.

22

manufacturer PMA device develops the design and chooses

23

the -- choosing it on its own.

24

submits the application, the FDA evaluates it, based on

25

information submitted, but it does no independent

Medtronic's view of the pre-market

This view is

The

After the company

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

testing, no product development, no comparison with

2

other products to see if this one is as good as or

3

better than existing products -- or even if it's the

4

best that it can be.

5

If the information submitted by the company

6

meets the statutory standard, reasonable assurance of

7

safety and effectiveness, the FDA grants PMA, thus

8

permitting the device to be sold.

9

the design and labeling chosen by the manufacturer, but

10

the agency doesn't require the manufacturer to choose -

11

to make those choices.

12

So the FDA approves

Once on the market, a PMA device may prove

13

to be unsafe, because very often problems and hazards

14

come to light only after the device is in widespread

15

use.

16

So CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't that situation

17

addressed by the requirement that the manufacturer alert

18

the FDA to new information and at least file annual

19

reports, and then the FDA can pull back the pre-market

20

approval if they think these problems require it to do

21

so?

22

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, yes and no.

The

23

requirement about submitting adverse event reports and

24

the annual report are intended help the FDA to monitor

25

the device after it's on the market.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

responsibility and the opportunity to improve the design

2

or labeling or to initiate a recall is really on the

3

manufacturer in the first instance, because the

4

manufacturer is the first one to learn about the

5

problem.

6

receives the information that the manufacturer sends to

7

it -

8
9

The FDA has a more passive role.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The FDA

What if the manufacturer

wants to make what you call an improvement?

Can it

10

simply market the product with that improvement without

11

further FDA action?

12

MS. ZIEVE:

Depending on whether it is a

13

design or labeling change, the answer is different.

14

a labeling change, some changes can be made prior to FDA

15

approval.

16

safety and effectiveness can't be made without a further

17

submission to the FDA.

18

For

For design changes, any change that affects

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even if it is designed to

19

improve safety and effectiveness?

20

MS. ZIEVE:

That's right.

And in that way a

21

PMA device is no different from the 510(k) device that

22

this Court considered in Lohr, because with respect to

23

those devices as well, any change that would have a

24

significant effect on safety and effectiveness has to

25

await a new submission and a new 5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right, but those devices

2

had not been -- they were just grandfathered.

3

not been specifically approved as safe and effective by

4

the FDA.

5

They had

Right?
MS. ZIEVE:

Right.

But the question isn't

6

what the level of pre-market scrutiny is.

7

is what requirements are imposed on the manufacturer at

8

the end of the process when the device enters the

9

market.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The question

Well, before that decision

11

is reached, let me ask you this -- under State law,

12

either generally or specifically under the law of the

13

State that you are trying to invoke here, does the jury

14

-- does the finder of fact weigh the potential risks of

15

injury and illness against the probable benefits to the

16

health of the patient?

17

jury does?

18

important device, but it had a one percent risk.

19

the jury consider that when it determines whether that's

20

been negligently sold?

21

MS. ZIEVE:

Is that one of the things the

In other words, suppose this was a very

Well, the standard in New York

22

is whether the product is unreasonably hazardous.

23

think the term unreasonably -

24
25

Does

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I

Alright, now isn't that

exactly what the FDA measured in the PMA process?
6

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

FDA is specifically charged with weighing the risks

2

against the probable benefits.

3
4

MS. ZIEVE:

That's right.

And in that way,

the State -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

same thing that the FDA did.

7

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes.

So the jury is doing the

And as this Court said in

8

Lohr and in Bates, when the State law mirrors the

9

Federal law, there is no preemption.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that was under

11

the expedited 510(k).

12

because in PMA there's a specific weight.

13

MS. ZIEVE:

That's different than PMA,

What the FDA does before the

14

product reaches the market is different in the PMA

15

context as opposed to 510(k).

16

comparing the State and Federal requirements -- I think

17

is what you are getting at -- Lohr's analysis and the

18

analysis in Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, Inc. didn't turn

19

on how rigorous the FDA requirements are, but are they

20

parallel to the State requirements.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But when it comes to

What was the State

22

requirement there?

I mean, what was the Federal

23

requirement there?

It was simply that the device had

24

been on the market before the law became effective.

25

Right?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. ZIEVE:

The design requirement in Lohr?

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MS. ZIEVE:

Yeah.

It had to be substantially

4

equivalent, safety and effectiveness, to a device that

5

was grandfathered in, that's right.

6

argued in that case that it couldn't change the design

7

of that product without filing another submission to the

8

FDA, and that that was why there's preemption, and

9

that's the same argument -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But Medtronic

Well, but the point is that

11

the -- to follow up on Justice Kennedy's question, the

12

point is that the FDA in Lohr had never made a

13

determination of weighing the risks against the

14

benefits, as they do for the issuance of PMA's.

15

the jury was not replowing the same ground that the FDA

16

had already plowed in Lohr.

17

MS. ZIEVE:

And so

I don't think that goes to

18

preemption under 360k(a) which looks for a specific

19

Federal requirement, a State device requirement, and

20

then looks at -- compares the two to see if there are

21

counterparts.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how does it -- how

23

does it compare with another process that the FDA looks

24

at very closely, I think even more closely than new

25

devices -- new drugs.

New drugs also go through a very

approval, and the drug is marketed, and it turns out it

6

that the FDA gave me"?

7

MS. ZIEVE:

Is there -- is there a defense to the

Under the common law of most or

8

all States, compliance with Federal law is a defense on

9

the merits, and it is not usually dispositive, but in

10
11

some States -- in some States it is.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it would certainly be

12

at least the same here, right?

13

Federal law would be a defense on the merits.

14

MS. ZIEVE:

That compliance with the

Absolutely.

I don't think that

the PMA is irrelevant to the tort suit.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's just not

Is there a reason -- as I

18

understand it, tort suits are not preempted with respect

19

20

differently?

21

Is there a reason to treat the two
For new medical devices and the new drugs?

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, there is no express

22

preemption provision in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

23

with respect to drugs.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that's the difference.

So the question -- what does the express preemption
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

provision mean?
MS. ZIEVE:

Right.

But I think in trying to

3

figure out what the express preemption provision means,

4

it's actually useful to consider why there's none for

5

drugs and there is one for devices.

6

because drugs were regulated by the FDA since 1938.

7

Devices weren't regulated until 1976.

8

intervening 38 years, States had stepped in and started

9

to do some regulation on their own to fill that

10
11

And the reason is

So, in those

regulatory void.
California is the most notable example, and

12

the one discussed the legislative history.

13

drafting the medical device amendments and coming up

14

with the system for pre-market scrutiny, the question

15

arose, well, what about California?

16

States that are regulating good manufacturing practices?

17

Or California had a PMA scheme of its own.

18

legislative history makes clear that Congress, faced

19

with this dilemma, decided California shouldn't be able

20

to continue to regulate devices in that way.

21

shouldn't be able to pre-screen devices once the FDA had

22

stepped in and filled the Federal void.

23

So, when

What about other

And so the

It

And that's why you didn't need an express

24

preemption provision for drugs.

The States weren't

25

doing that in 1938, but because the government -- the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal government waited so long to regulate devices,

2

it was necessary to say what are we going to do about

3

these State regulations?

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does that mean that, under

5

the Food and Drug regulation, the States can issue their

6

own regulations that contradict the Federal approval?

7

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, they couldn't issue

8

regulations that contradict the Federal approvals

9

because of the express preemption provision.

10

without it, California -

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:
drugs.

Not medical devices.

13
14

But

MS. ZIEVE:

No.

No.

I'm talking about

You say that -

That would be a conflict

preemption question.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, no.

I mean, you can

16

comply with both.

It's just additional -- you have to

17

go further to comply with the State rule, so there's no

18

conflict.

It's easy to -

19

MS. ZIEVE:

20

then there would be no preemption.

21

Well, if there's no conflicts,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then the States can issue

22

regulations that go beyond -- beyond what the FDA says

23

in drug matters?

24

case.

25

I would be surprised if that's the

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, if there's -- the only
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

basis for preemption with respect to drugs is conflict

2

preemption.

3

there's no conflict, then there would no preemption.

4

But -

5

So, if your question incorporates if

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And is that the only basis

6

here?

Conflict -- there's no conflict?

7

under the Medical Devices Act?

8
9

MS. ZIEVE:

It's all okay

Well, here, if there is not a

specific Federal requirement that is the counterpart to

10

a State requirement, there is no preemption.

11

what -- that's the language that Congress wrote and -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's

They can add additional

13

requirements so long as -- and I suppose they can do

14

this by regulation -- so long as these additional

15

requirement dos not prevent complying with the Federal

16

requirements?

17

States can add additional requirements under the Medical

18

Devices Act?

So long as there's no conflict, the

That's not my understanding of it.

MS. ZIEVE:

No.

That It is field preemption,

isn't it?
MS. ZIEVE:

No, I don't think so.

The -

wouldn't that at least be preemptive?

We'd like to make this

And then there's a tort suit based on

MS. ZIEVE:

Wouldn't the FDA

If the -- if 360k(a) ever

preempts tort claims, I think that would be a situation,

but if -- only the tort claim is -- is specific in that

way, that you -- that the company failed in its duty of

care because it didn't design the device in the specific

way that the FDA had rejected.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's not the way I

would -- the jury has to say that?

18

I mean, in fact -

MS. ZIEVE:

20

Well, that In fact, that's what's

21

going on, but it could have been safe if -- if they had

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the The trial is, you know, had

Alderson Reporting Company

but he didn't make the change and, therefore, you,

ladies and gentlemen of the jury, should hold the

company liable.

MS. ZIEVE:

But if that's the theory of the

case, I think that's basically the one-inch/two-inch

that hard, because most tort claims are -

I thought your response

was it wouldn't go to the jury if the FDA had said no,

18

you cannot make this, and the plaintiff's point is you

19

must make it in order to make this device safe.

20

I thought your answer to me was that the FDA

21

regulation -- the FDA's action in refusing to allow the

22

change to be made would be preemptive and you wouldn't

23

give it to a jury to second-guess that determination by

Federal law preemptive in that situation, when the FDA

says you can't do it and the personal injury lawyer

3

wants it to convince the jury that they had to do it?

4

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes.

In a situation where the

5

FDA has said you are required not to market this

6

7

seeking to impose a common-law duty that you must market

How about the -

The relevance of Another variation -- the

13

FDA says you must include X in this device or we won't

give you the pre-market approval.

16

wants to charge that putting X in made the device

dangerous.

18

And so the

Would the FDA's insistence that X be put in

19

take X out of any State court's tort litigation?

20

is, wouldn't -- if the FDA says you must have it, a

21

State court couldn't put to a jury whether you should

22

have eliminated it?

23

MS. ZIEVE:

Yes.

That

I think that's Justice

government says you must and the State law duty says
16

that you cannot.

litigated as a general matter.

don't say you must have this design feature.

5

First of all, PMA's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

There's I thought

6

that was your -- your theory was a little more nuanced.

7

In other words, they don't require you to market a

8

particular catheter.

9

to be arguing is that there may be a better design and

10

that it was negligent for the manufacturer to market a

11

particular design, even though they're allowed to; they

12

don't have to.

And you -- what I understood you

13

MS. ZIEVE:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

happens, what, as a -- what's going to happen for

21

patients at a time when your theory comes up, the

22

manufacturer looks at it and says, well, maybe this is a

23

better device; we don't want to risk these tort suits,

24

so we're going to stop selling our old device that's

25

been approved, but now we have got to get FDA approval
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the new device and that might take forever or at

2

least a year, let's say.

3

in that year?

4

And what happens to patients

They've got no device.

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, first of all, if the

5

device is reasonably safe and effective, then the

6

company is just not going to stop marketing it because

7

of tort suits.

8
9

And we know that because -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your theory is

that although this device has been approved, here's a

10

better one.

11

part to market a device, even though approved by the

12

FDA, when there's a better one that would reduce the

13

risks.

14

And it's negligent on the manufacturer's

MS. ZIEVE:

Right.

But we know that

15

manufacturers don't respond by taking devices off the

16

market, because PMA has coexisted with tort suits since

17

1976.

18

For instance, recently CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you want

19

them to do if you think it's negligent for them to

20

market the approved product?

21

take it off the market?

22

MS. ZIEVE:

Don't you want them to

Well, I -- they should make

their devices as safe as they can be.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, this is all a

13

little unrealistic.

14

agency of the State has conducted a very scientific

15

inquiry and decided that there's something safer than

16

what the FDA approved or that it's negligent to issue

17

what the FDA approved.

18

It is not as though some expert

What's going on is simply one jury has

19

decided that in its judgment, there was a safer device

20

that should have been used; and because of the judgment

21

of that one jury, the manufacturer is placed at risk in

22

selling a device that scientists at the FDA have said is

23

okay.

24

I find that extraordinary.

25

MS. ZIEVE:

Well, any one of us might have
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

drawn the line differently.

But the line Congress drew

2

was when there is a specific Federal requirement, we

3

looked for a device counterpart State requirement.

4

where they don't exist, there is no preemption.

And

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought that was

6

something a little different than that.

7

that I have which might be helpful to me, if you can

8

answer it, is -- that's being serious about it -- I'd be

9

helped by knowing what the specific design defect is

10

that you claim?

That is, in what respect was this

catheter -- and I'd like you to refer to the details of

the catheter -- in what respect, what material or what

shape or what -- what it is about this catheter that you

can tell me?

There's not a lot of discovery

a theory.

The general theory is that the

not have -- should have been strong enough -

As I said, the design claim in

20

this case was not significantly developed.

21

would help to talk about the design claim in Horn v.

22

what the design defect was.

Perhaps it

What about the label -

So you said you really don't know
How about the label?

21
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would be the other thing.

2

MS. ZIEVE:

The labeling claim is that the

3

label was -- inadequately warned or was misleading

4

because although at one place it lists among 12

5

precautions not to inflate the balloon above the rate of

6

burst pressure, which was eight, at another place it

7

says to -- it has a chart that shows inflation up to 13

8

atmosphere, and at another place in the instructions, it

9

says inflate to the nominal pressure, which is -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that's just like

Was Medtronic free to

the instructions without prior approval.

Let me tell you why I asked

my question, because I don't want to leave -- you to

leave with an unfavorable impression in my mind on your

What's worrying me is that, of course, it's

6

a terrible thing when somebody is hurt in these kinds of

7

accidents.

So every time there is an accident or

15

something bad happens, the lawyers assert a design claim

and they gear up discovery.

And in my mind, could Congress have intended

other cases where there is quite a clear theory about

There are cases where the products have been

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18

Thank you, counsel.

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

I think that the key central focus of this

20

case was touched upon by Justice Kennedy's question.

21

Congress made a decision that it wanted to balance

22

reasonable safety and effectiveness of lifesaving

23

devices with the availability of lifesaving devices to

24

the public.

25

They did so by vesting this responsibility
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the experts, the expertise, the judgment, and the

2

processes at the FDA.

3

And preemption of potentially conflicting,

4

confusing, and burdensome State law requirements is

5

essential to this scheme.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why, Mr. Olson, is it

7

more essential to this scheme than the new drugs?

I

8

would think that if everything that you said about new

9

devices would apply in bold letters to new drugs,

10

because the testing procedures are much longer, are they

11

not?

12

MR. OLSON:

They're similar, but they're

13

also quite different, Justice Ginsburg.

14

difference is this preemption provision that is the

15

fundamental issue in this case.

16

that similar provision was not put by Congress in the

17

new drug -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The principal

Section 360k(a)(1),

Well, there's an argument

19

that what it was intended to do was to cut out State

20

pre-market approval, where States like California came

21

in when there was a Federal void and said we shouldn't

22

let the manufacturers put out whatever they'd like.

23

Let's have a pre-market approval.

24

And the argument is, as you well know, which

25

was presented in Senator Kennedy's brief, that's what we
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

meant to do with the preemption provision.

2

more.

3

MR. OLSON:

Nothing

If there was such a State

4

pre-market approval process, it would be something like

5

the Federal process which would involve a very detailed

6

application which would have everything about the

7

design, the manufacture, and the warning labels in it.

8

Then California would come up with different

9

requirements, presumably or potentially, than what the

10

FDA had decided was a reasonable balance between safety

11

and effectiveness and availability.

12

there would be different requirements.

13

And so therefore,

And, as Justice Breyer pointed out in his

14

concurring and dissenting opinion in the Lohr case, if a

15

State jury or a State court comes up with those

16

different requirements, it is the same problem:

17

Different States, different requirements under different

18

circumstances.

19

And it would be quite anomalous for Congress

20

to have given more power to juries in individual ad hoc

21

cases which don't do the weighing, Justice Kennedy -

22

they can't do the same amount of weighing because their

23

focus -

3

to the balloon plastic, and all of a sudden it turns out

to be a serious problem.

5

How can you say that that's preemptive?

6

MR. OLSON:

This is a continuous process.

25

It can

It can do all of those things.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But

It takes time for the FDA

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to act.

Let's assume that we know it's going to take

2

six months for the FDA to do this.

The manufacturer

3

knows that there's a real problem.

He can continue to

4

sell in the face of the knowledge of the real problem?

5
6

MR. OLSON:

FDA can act as promptly or as slowly -

7
8

What I'm suggesting is that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I was asking you about the

manufacturer's duty pending the FDA's action.

9

MR. OLSON:

It's dependent upon the

10

manufacturer providing information to the one

11

centralized agency -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Olson, suppose the

13

manufacturer did not provide information.

14

preemption nevertheless exist?

MR. OLSON:

Would the

Yes, Justice Stevens, because in

that case JUSTICE STEVENS:

At least as a theoretical

18

possibility, there could be a newly discovered risk that

19

the FDA never knew about.

20

would be preemptive.

21

MR. OLSON:

And, nevertheless, the claim

Yes.

And that's a judgment that

22

Congress made, because with the -- the manufacturer then

23

would be violating the law, failing to tell the FDA what

24

was going on, perhaps comitting fraud, and be subject to

25

criminal penalties, recall penalties, civil penalties,
28
Alderson Reporting Company

and that sort of thing.
The choice is, Justice Stevens, in that

3

situation -- is to allow the agency that has the

4

expertise, that has spent 1200 hours or so on this

5

particular device, according to your opinion in the Lohr

6

case, to make a judgment with respect to whether this

7

product should be on the market or not.

8

Because as I -

question was addressed to.

His question was what if the manufacturer

14

has learned that there is -- that there's a problem that

15

somebody hadn't anticipated?

16

the FDA, and the FDA has not yet acted.

The manufacturer has told

17

Leave open the question of whether the FDA

is slow or whether it just takes time, but there's a -

there's a hiatus here.

Does preemption still apply?

MR. OLSON:

And the reason for that, Justice

Souter, is that someone must make a judgment.
29

That -

the information that the manufacturer may have learned

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you know whether the PMA

12

process in this case considered the design defects that

13

the Petitioner seems to be relying on?

14

MR. OLSON:

Well, all -- no, I don't know

15

the answer to that specifically, Justice Alito.

But I

16

do know -- and this is the application, itself, which is

It goes into elaborate detail with

precautions, the hazards, the counter -

5

counterindications, and that sort of thing, there's a

6

professional judgment there.

7

The safety indications, the

My colleague says that well, it's not the

8

FDA's not imposing requirements, because this is a

9

design submitted by the manufacturer.

Of course, it's a

10

design submitted by the manufacturer.

That's how

11

devices are made.

12

But the FDA examines every little part of

13

that design -- the way it's manufactured, the way it's

14

labeled, the way it's marketed, the way it's going to be

15

used.

16

And it can say no, change that part of it,

17

or have you considered this?

the manufacturer and the FDA.

19

It's a dialogue between

And then when the FDA is satisfied that it's

20

reasonably safe and effective -- and the word

21

"reasonable" is important.

22

You can make a car weigh a hundred tons, and it might be

23

perfectly safe, but balances have to be made, the same

24

with drug devices.

25

Nothing is perfectly safe.

So -

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you look at the file of a
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

PMA proceeding after it is concluded, can you tell

2

exactly which design features and which risks the FDA

3

has considered?

4

MR. OLSON:

No, I don't think you can.

What

5

you can do, Justice Alito, is examine -- and Justice

6

Breyer's example of the two-inch versus one-inch wire in

7

the Lohr case is a good example.

8
9

The FDA will have examined, and presumably
done its job, with respect to every aspect of the

10

design, manufacture, and labeling and marketing of the

11

device.

12

Now, the choice is between that -- and I

13

think Congress made this judgment quite consciously,

14

because if a -- if a jury comes along in a particular

15

case, examining a particular infant or a particular ill

16

person and the facts of a particular situation, and says

17

well, the device should have had a one-inch nail -- a

18

wire, or it should have had a different tensile strength

19

of the balloon, or something like that, then the

20

manufacturer is in this dilemma.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't there -- to -

22

to take care of that kind of hypothetical where the FDA

23

says this isn't it, to say that kind of suit can't be

24

brought.

25

category of suits that is simply saying:

But it is, indeed, mentioned that there's a

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Manufacturer,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you didn't do what's in that pre-marketing approval?

2

So we're kind of a backup to not doing

3

anything in conflict with the FDA's approval.

4

simply saying you didn't follow the labeling

5

requirement, or you didn't follow the design submission

6

that you -

7

MR. OLSON:

We're

I think if there's a violation

8

of the requirements -- now, it's no -- there's no

9

question that there are requirements, because every

10

aspect of this approval incorporates the design and all

11

of those things.

12

If the manufacturer fails to comply with

13

those requirements, that's a parallel suit that may be

14

brought.

15

Now, in this case, the negligent

16

manufacturer -- a claim was made.

17

18

Circuit because there was no evidence to support it.

19

--

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So

You -- you agree

that that was not preemptive.
MR. OLSON:

That was -- we agree that was

23

not preempted, and -- and the court of appeals came to

24

that same conclusion, but affirmed the district court

25

that dismissed it on summary judgment because there was
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no evidence to support it.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You would say the same

3

thing for -- for design and labeling if the manufacturer

4

did not do what the FDA approved?

5

MR. OLSON:

6

That's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

7

Now our -- the statute, I think, could not

8

be more clear with respect to every aspect of what the

9

Court talked about in the Lohr case.

And I think that

10

the analysis that this Court articulated in the Geier

11

case having to do with the air bags, although that was

12

an implied preemption and conflict preemption case and

13

this is an express preemption case, is very

14

illustrative.

15

The Court went through an analysis of what

16

manufacturers might do if they were required to put an

17

air bag in the car when the Department of Transportation

18

had decided that it wanted a little bit of play in the

19

marketplace with respect to different types of

20

restraints of individuals.

21

And the Court made it very clear that if a

22

trial court in Kansas or some other place decides that

23

cars must be manufactured in a certain way, that's what

24

would happen.

25

And then the judgment of the Department of

20

to continue without making the change?

they are indeed safe, or -- and the FDA then may make a

judgment that the reasonableness -- if there is a much

device, they can -- they can withdraw the approval of

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the manufacturer finds

19

just from its own laboratory experiments and not because

20

of any data it's received from doctors and patients that

21

there's a better way to do this, does it have the

22

obligation to notify the FDA?

23

MR. OLSON:

I don't think so,

24

Justice Kennedy.

I think that there may be marketplace

25

incentives and other things that would cause a 36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

someone in the marketplace to say I found a better way.

2

Someone in the marketplace might say well, it might be

3

better, but it might be prohibitively expensive.

4

are all kinds of those judgments, and I think that

5

illustrates the point.

6

There

The FDA is the right place for these

7

decisions to be made and this balancing process to

8

occur, because an individual ad hoc -- not

9

scientifically trained jury that is not required to

10

consider the consequences for the marketplace as a

11

whole, cannot make those judgments.

12

As conscientious as a jury might be, that

13

judgment is in for that case and for that patient and

14

might say well gee, it should have been done differently

15

in this particular situation; a one-inch wire might have

been better in this particular case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the Mr. Olson, I'm

18

looking at the Government's brief on page 4 which says

19

that in the annual reports, the -- the manufacturer has

20

to disclose unpublished reports of data from clinical

21

investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies

22

involving the device.

23

So presumably that includes any nonclinical

laboratory studies that the manufacturer itself

25

conducted.

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

I believe that's true, but

2

I think that was a slightly different point than

3

Justice Kennedy's one; what was -- if it is the same

4

point, I agree with you, that there is an elaborate

process of information exchange from the manufacturer

there's a reasoned explanation for the FDA's -- the

The fact is that there are specific detailed

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think it might be useful to begin by

21

focusing on the consequences of Petitioner's argument

22

that the PMA approval of an application does not result

23

in requirements that are preemptive for purposes of the

24

preemptive provision.

25

after the FDA gave PMA approval to a particular device,

Under Petitioner's view, the day

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State legislatures or State regulatory agencies could

2

adopt laws or regulations that would direct the

3

manufacturer to manufacture or design the product or to

4

give labeling that would conflict with what the FDA had

5

just approved.

6

have intended in enacting the express preemption

7

provision here to allow State regulatory agencies or,

8

even more so, individual juries that could very within a

9

State -

10

And we don't think that Congress could

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that you

11

conceded that there would be conflict preemption, that

12

the States could not -- either through a State agency or

13

through a jury -- come up with a requirement that would

14

conflict with an FDA requirement.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

But we think that the express

16

preemption provision embodies that very important

17

conflict, or maybe in this context it is best to

18

conceptualize it as field preemption, of the things that

19

are included within the application that is submitted to

20

the FDA and the labeling.

Additional requirements are

That's -- that's entirely

correct, and if I could just elaborate on that JUSTICE BREYER:
conflicting?

How are they not

Go ahead; go ahead -- elaborate.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, what I was going to say

8

-- to elaborate on the point that I made, Petitioner

9

concedes that if there is an FDA PMA requirement, the

10

State may not impose its own PMA requirement; and that

11

has to be correct, because in the State PMA approval,

12

the State could withhold its approval unless the

13

manufacturer changed the device or changed the labeling

14

in some way to get it cleared through -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Everybody agrees that

16

far, that the States were not to be in the business of

17

issuing PMA's.

18

clause mean any more than that?

19

The question is does the preemption

MR. KNEEDLER:

But it's important to

20

understand why.

Congress was not concerned about the

21

PMA in the abstract or as a process; it was concerned

22

about what the consequences of requiring the

23

manufacturer to go through the PMA process were.

24

that was precisely because the result of the State PMA

25

process could be to impose different requirements.
43

And

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

labeling should read differently -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

Isn't it -- isn't it -

-- the product should be

differently.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you compared drugs,

6

which -- I think you will -- you will concede -- go

7

through a very arduous process, new drugs, why -- maybe

8

you think that the same preemption applies there,

9

although there's no preemption clause.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

There is -- there is no

11

express preemption clause there.

12

explanation might be is that a -- that a device is a

13

tangible concrete item, an item of commerce that is -

14

that has extensive design and planning and blueprints in

15

a way that a drug doesn't quite have that same -- that

16

same characteristic.

automobiles or something, that they have a tangible

aspect and a long lead time in the design and

entitled to considerable deference, FDA recognized that

there would be a serious undermining of FDA's approval

authority and its balancing of the risks and benefits,

And you could -- and the

manufacturer continued to sell the device knowing that

7

the label is being misconstrued by very good doctors

pending FDA action?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Ordinarily, yes.

If there

10

was -- if there was a very serious risk to health and

11

safety -

12

Yes, it's very serious.

powerful incentive because of the criminal penalties and

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Kneedler, let me ask

19

you to -- a textual question which perhaps would be

20

better directed to counsel for the Petitioner, but let

21

me get your take on it.

22

If the only objective in the -- in the

23

preemption clause were to preclude State PMA in addition

24

to Federal PMA, there would have been no reason to

25

include the phrase -- would there have been any reason
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to include a preclusion of a requirement that is

2

different from in addition to a preclusion of something

3

which is in addition to?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- if it was just -- I

5

think that's a good point.

If it was just a question of

6

going through a duplicative State PMA process -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

"Addition to" would be Right.

Right.

Right.

Okay.
And also I think the FDA

11

regulations promulgated when this was put out, soon

12

after the '76 amendments were passed, I think reinforced

13

the conclusion that -- and, in fact, there was a

14

regulation that specifically talks about the application

15

of general adulteration standards in a way that might

16

require a specific label change to be made by a

17

manufacturer, and we think that's basically precisely

18

this lawsuit.

19

that would require the manufacturer or a standard of

20

care under common law that would say that what the

21

manufacturer had done specifically approved by FDA was

22

-- was improper as a matter of State law.

23

that is in the teeth of the preemption provision.

think Justice Alito asked the question about the issue

of whether FDA focused or didn't focus on a particular

had done.

what the end product was; what was the application that

was finally approved and the labeling associated with

7

it, much like the filed rate doctrine.

8

was put before the agency and what was approved, not

9

what might have gone into -- into consideration.

so the catheter's label, where it says "inflate the

The Court has already interpreted

Section 360k(a).

In finding no preemption in Lohr of

any of the claims, the Court looked to the labeling

regulation 801.109 was applicable to the device there.

That is the same exact regulation that is applicable to

the device here.

21

We come to it

If Medtronic's PMA device complies with

801.109, then it is deemed to be not misbranded, but

that is a moving target.

for use changes as the manufacturer learns about use of
