ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVE BULLOCK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. BULLOCK:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Tongue and Powder Rivers are the only

11
12

significant water supply in a 10,000-square-mile area in

13

Montana and Wyoming, and this Court is being asked to

14

decide whether the compact allows Wyoming to take the

15

return flows that Montana farmers in that area have

16

always relied on or, instead, affords protection to both

17

States.

18

reasons.

Our exception should be sustained for three

First, the plain language of the compact

19
20

preserves the water supply each State was receiving as

21

of 1950.

22

the Master's interpretation would allow individual water

23

users to alter those amounts.

24

policy determinations about efficiency add ambiguity to

25

the principles underlying a century of western water

Second, contrary to the compact's purposes,

And, third, the Master's

3
Alderson Reporting Company

law.

On that -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

General Bullock, would

3

you please point to the precise language of the compact

4

that freezes consumption, as distinguished from the

5

amount of water diverted -- which freezes consumption as

6

of January 1st, 1950?
MR. BULLOCK:

7

Yes, Your Honor.

In the

8

compact, it's at the appendix of the Master's first

9

interim report.

Two areas:

first, the preamble

10

provides for an equitable division/apportionment of the

11

water; and then the operative provision, article V(A),

12

states that the uses existing as of January 1st, 1950,

13

in each signatory State shall continue to be enjoyed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14
15

Well, the uses existing

is irrigation.
I don't see where it says -- and so I can

16
17

understand, the amount of water diverted can't be

18

increased.

19

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, the whole of

20

article V(A) and V(B) -- I mean, no one contests that

21

it's the full allocation of the water.

22

after 1950; V(A) is prior.

23

quo to be -- remain -- for the appropriative right to

24

beneficial uses existing in Montana as of 1950, there

25

needs to be a water supply.

So V(B) is water

And in order for the status

And also operative to that,

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's within the definitions at article II(H), is

2

beneficial use.

3

from the general prior appropriation law, because it's

4

that use by which a water supply is depleted

5

when usefully used.

6

And that's a derivation or departure

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why doesn't the

7

language in article V(A) -- and this is not too helpful

8

-- simply restate the issue before us, what is a

9

beneficial use by the upstream owner?

10

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, it need not

11

because in article II(H) it defines what a beneficial

12

use is, and that's that use by which the water supply of

13

a basin is depleted.

14

of 1950, so it wasn't a full consumption of water in

15

Wyoming, and that depletion is the return flow upon

16

which Montanans rely.

17

And it's that depletion that -- as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's the essence

18

-- that's the essence of the argument before us.

19

depletion was the amount of water that was taken from

20

this water source to irrigate the crops.

21

issue now before us is whether beneficial use means

22

consumption or it means use, isn't it?

23

The

The -- the

I -- you're begging the question in my mind,

24

because I don't -- what source do you have for the fact

25

that a return flow is beneficial use?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, the return flow is

2

the basis of Montana's water right, so that the return

3

flow under the compact isn't actually beneficial use.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

That's not actually

5

true.

Their water right was the beneficial use that

6

your pre-1950 consumers used, meaning you had consumers

7

who were irrigating their own crops, who were doing

8

other things with the water.

9

their pre-1950 uses.

The rights protected are

You're putting -- you're -- you're

10

still equating consumption as -- as being their use, but

11

I don't know where you get that equation from.

12
13

MR. BULLOCK:

The equation, Your Honor, that

consumption is the same thing as -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. BULLOCK:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. BULLOCK:

As use.

-- as use?
Uh-huh.

Well, we could go actually to

18

the Special Master, who himself had stated that when

19

exploring -- I mean, the beneficial use reflects the

20

historic consumptive use.

21

It's on page 82.

22

is limited to the amount he originally beneficially

23

applied and consumptively used; that is, the amount

24

received at the point of use minus the runoff.

25

It's from his own textbook.

The Master says that a senior's right

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could someone pre-1950

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

who irrigated crops change the crops?
MR. BULLOCK:

2

It's -- it's an open question,

3

Your Honor.

Yes, they certainly could, but not if it

4

impacted a downstream appropriator, as per this compact.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

How in the world do any

6

States monitor that?

The change in crops, the change in

7

irrigation methods, the change in anything that would

8

cause a difference in return flow?

9

warming in some form or another evaporated more water,

Let's assume global

10

and so some crop area did some solar heating that caused

11

a greater evaporation.

Is that a breach of the compact?

So two questions embedded in there.

12

How

13

does any State monitor that, the change in crops or

14

change in irrigation methods?

15

it go in terms of the pre-1950s right to use their

16

water?
MR. BULLOCK:

17

And, second, how far does

To the first question, Your

18

Honor, even as of 1950, the drafters recognized that

19

this was a fully appropriated river; it had reached its

20

maximum practical limit.

21

knows how much water they should be getting.

22

have 80 years of measurements on one of these rivers

23

alone, and you could go online right now and find out

24

what the flow is at the State line occurring as of this

25

morning.

So each individual downstream

I mean, we

Official - Subject to Final Review

So a piece of it that this is something

2

we've been doing for a long time in the west as far as

3

knowing what water is in the river, where it is, and

4

throughout, you know, downstream appropriation.

5

To the second question -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But would -­
But all that shows is -­

8

or might show in a particular case, is that the amount

9

of water is reduced.

Now the -- then the question is

10

have the senior appropriators or the upstream

11

appropriators reduced it in a way that's inconsistent or

12

that's an overuse of their beneficial rights, and you're

13

right -- again right where we started from.

14

you have to regulate exactly how each irrigator is using

15

the appropriative right.

16

MR. BULLOCK:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

And then

And, Your Honor, you don't -­
So the -- so the flows

don't necessarily answer the question.

3

4

5

west, is you have a right to pull out, you know, water,

6

and the appropriative right is you have the right to

7

take out however much you were taking out.

8

that less comes back, that's something different.

9

doesn't affect your appropriation.

And to me that suggests, which I

What the

And the fact
That

11

of the compact, that Wyoming recognized their paper

12

rights, that appropriative right was much more than the

13

actual use occurring.

14

out of -- especially under this compact, but in any.

15

Even under the general common law, you only have an

16

appropriative right for the beneficial use, and all

They're doing it now, just as they were back then.

The beneficial use is irrigation

They

Mr. Chief Justice, two things,

the first of which, the beneficial use is -- I mean, we

can't read this definition of beneficial use out of the

second of which, though, that it's also a fundamental

5

tenet of prior appropriation law -- is the downstream

7

first got his or her right.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

And it is a
And, also, though -­

Given the same conditions.

But is there any evidence, or can you say anything from

10

the record or any other place, going back to 1950 -- I

11

assume in 1950 people knew how much the different

12

landowners were taking out of the stream of the river in

13

Wyoming to use for irrigation and other such purposes.

14

They knew that.
Is there any indication they knew at that

15
16

time how much each individual landowner was putting

17

back?

18

interested if it's "yes."

19

a lot if it's "yes," because I'm -­

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think the answer is "no."

But I'd be very

And I think it would help you

To tell you the truth, I'm

22

pretty skeptical of the fact that they're writing an

23

appropriation right into this about regulating something

24

they don't even know about.

25

MR. BULLOCK:

Effectively, Your Honor, it
10

Alderson Reporting Company

could be yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:

2

Well, I didn't say it could

3

be yes.

I would like you to tell me if the answer is

4

yes, and then, of course, I'm going to ask you -­

5

MR. BULLOCK:

Sure.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- where in the record I

7

find something that says that they knew how much each

8

individual landowner is putting back into this river in

9

Wyoming.

10

can you?

And I think you can't answer that question,

MR. BULLOCK:

11

I certainly cannot answer

12

that, and they didn't need to know, from the

13

perspective -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Oh, they didn't?

In other

15

words, they didn't know how much is coming back, but

16

you're coming in and saying what they were -- what they

17

were regulating here is they're saying, not only you

18

get -- you maintain a right to take out 100,000 units to

19

do your irrigation, but you have to put back 80,000, but

20

they didn't even know what the number was, whether it

21

was 80, 70, or 60, and the appropriation law is

22

ambiguous?

23

you to say it's ambiguous, but I don't see how I can go

24

further.

they were?
MR. BULLOCK:

First, Your Honor, the

What they do

need to do is make sure that the beneficial -- the

and there's an intriguing footnote where the Special

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

If your understanding is

8

correct, would the result be that landowners in Wyoming

9

would only be allowed to consume as much as they

10

consumed in 1950, but landowners in Montana could take

11

advantage of improved irrigation techniques and use much

12

more of the -- they could divert the same amount of

13

water, but they could use much more of it?
MR. BULLOCK:

14
15

No, Your Honor, that would not

be the case.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MR. BULLOCK:

Why wouldn't it?
First, for the irrigators in

18

Montana -- I mean, one of the things -- Montana sought

19

to have a system of interstate administration.

20

-- or Wyoming, through storage, through curtailing

21

consumption by post-'50 users, or otherwise can

22

administer its water rights in however it so deems.

And what that said is if the return flow

is the Special Master's own footnote.

It's 69/12, where

10

he says that, you know, even though State change

11

procedures don't typically apply to crop or -- changes

12

in crop irrigation techniques, this does not mean

13

there's no way to challenge increases in efficiency.

14

Downstream water users, for example, could sue to enjoin

15

an upstream appropriator from increasing consumption or

16

to force the upstream appropriator to replace lost

17

runoff.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would think your best

19

point is not all of that stuff, but simply the

20

definition section, which very clearly makes a

21

distinction between beneficial use and diversion.

22

your point is that what is guaranteed is not the

23

diversion right that existed pre-1950, but the

24

beneficial use right, which is the net use of the water,

25

not -- not the total amount diverted.

definitions, it seems to me it would be a little -- your

case would be a little harder.

those definitions there and with V(A) using beneficial

5

use rather than -- it could have said diversion,

appropriative right to diversion, but it didn't say

that.

that without a water supply.

The Court has identified in previous

questioning this case at this point in this issue

involves whether a Wyoming or a Montana diverter may

22

change cropping patterns, may change various

23

technologies in irrigated agriculture, and change up and

down, depending on the year and the fallowing of land

25

and that sort of thing, the amount of water that is

actually consumed by crops.

2

identified the critical fact that a water right, a

3

classic western water right, appropriative right as in

4

article V(A), is made up of the right to divert an

5

amount of water at a head gate in an irrigation

situation, put it on a defined quantity of land, and use

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what is the

15

amount of water, or are they -- when they switch crops

Waste, of not wasting water,

The irrigation right is a general

So it's not a question of -- of percentage

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. MICHAEL:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought -­

It's a question -­
Suppose the first -­

suppose the first crop absorbs 50 percent of the water

10

and returns 50 percent by seepage.

The second crop that

11

they switch to still absorbs just 50 percent of the

12

water but because of the -- of the pattern, the other 50

13

percent just evaporates?

14

MR. MICHAEL:

The -- the way that the water

15

is -- there's -- there's a basket, Your Honor.

There's

16

a basket that starts with a quantity that's taken at the

17

head gate, 4 cubic feet per second put on the -- on the

18

field.

19

multiple -- two components, basically:

20

consumed by the crop -- I should say the amount consumed

21

by the crop or depleted by other elements, ditches,

22

seepage, other types of things, deep percolation into

23

the ground -- and -- and the other component which is

24

water that's not lost but can return or go somewhere.

25

It's not evaporated; there's no transpiration.

And within that quantity there -- there's

27
Alderson Reporting Company

the amount

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

there's those two components.
And if that -- if that quantity, that

3

division changes, that's perfectly permissible within

4

the use of the water right.

5

set out in Wiel's -- Samuel Wiel's text in 1911, carried

6

forward in texts and cases ever since, that -- and in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we're dealing here with

a compact which has a text, and -- and what the water

13

law of Wyoming or of Montana happened to be cannot

14

overrule the text, and I am -- I'm hung up on the fact

15

that article V(A) says appropriative rights to the

beneficial uses of the water of the Yellowstone River

System existing as of January 1, 1950.

18

say "that use by which the water supply of a drainage

4

what could be a legitimate water right that is excluded

5

under this definition.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

No, but, I mean, to -- to

7

do that, the definition would have read:

The term

8

"beneficial use" is defined to be that use by which the

9

water -- that use "for which" the water supply of a

10

drainage basin is diverted for useful employment by the

11

activities of man, and that's not what it says.

contrary, it makes a clear distinction between

13

"depletion" and the previous definition of "diversion."
I just -- I was trying to give that stark

To the

difference some effect in the later section V(A).
MR. MICHAEL:

Let me say this, Your Honor,

if I might:

terms are both used.

9

Will you give us

some discussion about an appropriative right is the

10

right to use a quantity of water.

That makes sense

11

other than if you're in a compact, and Montana gets no

12

water.

13

his brief at a footnote -- he said, well, what we might

14

do, then, is that Montana could bring an equitable

15

apportionment action for the pre-1950 water.

The Solicitor General even pointed out then in

That highlights the -- I think to me, the

16
17

illogic of just focusing on the rights and not looking

18

at the uses and how much each State was consuming,

19

because at that point I'll be right back here saying we

20

want the same water under like conditions that we had in

21

1950.

Thank you, Your Honor.
