 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (10:29 a.m.) 
 THE COURT: 

We'll hear argument this morning 

in Case 12751, Fifth Third Bancorp v. Dudenhoeffer. 
 Mr. Long. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR. 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. LONG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 A fiduciary's decision to do exactly what an 

11

employee stock ownership plan is designed to do and what 

12

the plan requires by continuing to offer employer stock 

13

as an investment option is presumptively prudent. 

14

Statutory language, trust law, congressional policy, and 

15

practical considerations all support this result. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You  you want us to say 

17

that we have sort of a coach class trustee.  We're all 

18

traveling in coach class when we have an ESOP.  Once 

19

once we go down that road, how  how do we define what 

20

the duties of the trustee are? 

21

 MR. LONG: 

Well, we're not asking for a 

22

coach class trustee.  I mean, we're  we're saying to 

23

look at the statutory definition of the duty of prudence 

24

in Section 1104(a)(1)(b), which says that the duty of 

25

prudence must take into account the character and aims

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the enterprise.  So when we talk about ESOPs, we're 

2

talking about a pension plan of a very specific kind. 

3

It is designed, the definition 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This does  this plan 

5

didn't require you to invest solely in employer stock, 

6

did it? 

7

 MR. LONG: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10
11

This plan 
It gave you the option 

to do it and to go above the 10 percent.  But it didn't 
require you to buy only employer stock, did it? 
 MR. LONG: 

Well  well, ERISA, the statute, 

12

requires that an ESOP invest primarily in employer's 

13

stock.  This particular plan, like many plans, requires 

14

that all of the assets in the ESOP be invested in 

15

employer stock except the amount that needs to be in 

16

cash for shortterm management requirements.  So  so 

17

Congress both 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you point to the 

19

part of your plan that did that?  Because I looked at it 

20

and I didn't see the plan requiring 100 percent 

21

investment. 

22

 MR. LONG: 

If  Your Honor, if you look at 

23

page 735 of the Joint Appendix, you'll find in  in 

24

part 3.3, it states, "However, in all events, the Fifth 

25

Third stock fund as described shall be an investment

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

option." 
 And then if you look on 736 and then 

3

continuing on to 737, it says that, "The funds shall be 

4

invested primarily in Fifth Third stock."  It says, "It 

5

may also be invested in shortterm liquid investments to 

6

the extent the administrator determines they are 

7

desirable to accommodate expected short run liquidity 

8

needs." 

9

 But then it says, "The trustee shall have no 

10

discretionary authority to sell Fifth Third Bancorp 

11

shares or refrain from acquiring additional Fifth Third 

12

Bancorp shares with funds not held for short run 

13

liquidity needs." 

14

 So we think that 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You use the word 

16

"primarily."  There's an allegation here that you should 

17

have stopped buying stock once you understood that there 

18

was a serious condition in the company.  That you've 

19

breached your duty of loyalty, not of prudence.  What do 

20

you do with that allegation? 

21

 MR. LONG: 

Well, what we say is that these 

22

duties  again, we're not asking for coach class 

23

duties.  These are first class, if you will, duties, but 

24

they have to be understood in the context of this 

25

special kind of plan with special purposes.  The  the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purpose of an ESOP is to own company stock, to give the 

2

employees a piece of the rock, an ownership interest in 

3

the company.  And so when  when the issue is, as 

4

you're  as you're posing it, Justice Sotomayor, at 

5

what point does a duty of prudence or a duty of loyalty, 

6

either one, require the trustee to break the plans of 

7

the term, deviate from the plan's 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It doesn't say you have 

to.  It says "primarily."  It doesn't say you have to 
continue buying. 
 MR. LONG: 

Well, again, I mean, I  I 

12

quoted the language.  As we read the plan, and I think 

13

the government agrees with us on this, the  the 

14

instructions of the plan are to invest all the money in 

15

Fifth Third stock except as needed for shortterm cash 

16

requirements. 

17

 Now, there is the duty of prudence, and 

18

we're not asking for a second class duty.  But we think 

19

in this context, given this special kind of plan, what 

20

that duty means is can the purpose of this 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Long, there is no 

22

presumption written into this statute.  There is an 

23

exception from the diversification requirements in ESOP. 

24

The whole object is to buy the company's stock, and so 

25

you don't need to diversify.  But apart from that, the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statutory requirement on loyalty and prudence is 

2

undiluted.  And so I don't know where this presumption 

3

comes from.  It's not in the statute itself. 

4

 MR. LONG: 

Well  well, we do think it 

5

comes from the text of the statute.  It comes from the 

6

duty of prudence itself which looks to the character and 

7

aims of the plan, and then in Section 1107(d)(6), an 

8

ESOP is defined in ERISA to be a plan that's designed to 

9

invest primarily in the employer's own stock.  So we 

10

think that defines the special character name of the 

11

plans.  Congress has also spoken to this in other 

12

statutory enactments 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Long, I think it 
Section 1104 of ERISA, 

15

which this  this plan is not exempted from, says that 

16

the fiduciaries must manage a plan, and I quote, "for 

17

the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to 

18

participants and their beneficiaries."  Do you 

19

acknowledge that that's binding on the 

20

 MR. LONG: 

It  it is.  And the government 

21

adds the word "retirement" before benefits, and they say 

22

an ESOP must be managed exclusively to provide 

23

retirement benefits, but that 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I don't add that. 

I'm just saying providing benefits.  I mean, that's 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's 

2

 MR. LONG: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, yes. 
 that's quite different 

4

from running a plan to  to own stock in the company. 

5

That's  that's not the basic purpose of it. 

6

 MR. LONG: 

Well,  well, but, 

7

Justice Scalia, plans  ERISA plans provide different 

8

kinds of benefits.  The pension plans themselves can 

9

provide death benefits, hardship benefits, disability 

10

benefits.  So if the benefit is stock in the company, a 

11

piece of the rock, you know, the duty of the fiduciary 

12

is to manage that as best as it can be managed to 

13

produce the largest benefit for the participants.  But 

14

it's  but it's not  to go back to your question to 

15

say, well, you know, it looks like some other investment 

16

would be a better investment this week or this month. 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is there anything in the 

18

trust law or the common law that allows us to define 

19

benefits that way? 

20

 MR. LONG: 

Well, I mean, I don't think we're 

21

asking for a special definition of benefits.  We're just 

22

saying that what this plan  and trust law does say the 

23

settlor has a great deal of leeway to define the  the 

24

benefits that are being provided.  This is a particular 

25

kind of benefit, though, that Congress not only

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

authorized, but has strongly encouraged.  I mean, 

2

employers are strongly encouraged to offer this benefit. 

3

 So to say that prudence or loyalty or  or 

4

any of these fiduciary duties requires a sort of 

5

continuous monitoring of the company to see whether 

6

this is no longer such a good investment. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You say the benefits 

8

referred to in the  providing benefits to 

9

participants, and you're saying the benefits to 

10

participants is their ownership of company stock, 

11

including worthless company stock. 

12

 MR. LONG: 

Well  well, no, not at all, 

13

Justice Scalia.  I mean, the  the idea is that the 

14

company stock is valuable, and the hope is 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But when it ceases to be 

valuable, it seems to me you're not. 
 MR. LONG: 

Well, and  and we agree as 

18

as every court of appeals has  has held, that has 

19

looked at this, all seven, that there  there does come 

20

a time when the purpose of the ESOP, of allowing the 

21

employees to build an ownership stake in the company, 

22

can no longer be realized because the company is in 

23

serious peril, serious jeopardy. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But  but there are 

occasions, Mr. Long, outside of that very narrow

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

category of cases that you define in which the stock is 

2

going to be way, way, way, overvalued relative to what 

3

the fiduciaries know is the company's actual value. 

4

Let's just say it  the  the market price is four 

5

times more than the actual value, and the fiduciaries 

6

know that because of inside information that they have. 

7

It just sort of defies language to say that some  a 

8

prudent person would retain the investment in that kind 

9

of wildly overvalued stock, doesn't it? 

10

 MR. LONG: 

Well, I mean, if I could take 

11

that in several steps.  I mean, that material 

12

overvaluation standard, which no court has ever 

13

accepted, we think, is unworkable.  I mean, first of 

14

all, before you get to the inside information, which I 

15

think is the kernel of it that's left at the end, if you 

16

have a stock that is traded on an active market, you 

17

really can't tell the fiduciary, absent possibly inside 

18

information, Well, you need to outsmart the market. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No.  But I'm talking about a 

20

case in which the fiduciary has inside information 

21

that  that  that enables him to know that the stock 

22

price is way overvaluing the actual value of the 

23

company. 

24
25

 MR. LONG: 

But when you  when you get to 

that point of the analysis, and this is what all the

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts have recognized, you have to then bring in 

2

securities law, and you have to recognize to trade on 

3

that inside information would violate securities law. 

4

So prudence or loyalty cannot require a violation of 

5

securities law. 

6

 So what  what are the other options? 

You 

7

could halt trading.  That would not itself violate 

8

securities law.  But that could do great damage to the 

9

participants if the company  if the company's own ESOP 

10

said, well, we think something is so wrong that we're 

11

shutting down the 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I  I suppose it 

13

could, but a prudent manager might say that it would do 

14

greater damage to the  to the participants in the plan 

15

to enable this misinformation to exist and to keep 

16

putting  to keep buying stock, to keep putting more 

17

and more of their retirement investments into something 

18

that is really overvalued. 

19

 MR. LONG: 

Well, I mean, our point is that 

20

that public announcement, that the ESOP has stopped 

21

allowing purchases of company stock, could cause a sort 

22

of collapse in the stock price that would be terrible 

23

for the participants, and saying that prudence requires 

24

that is kind of risky gamble. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, you assume that

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

truthful information will out in the end, and is it 

2

better to keep on putting more money into something that 

3

is  is  you know, is really not a good investment 

4

for the participants and the beneficiaries? 

5

 MR. LONG: 

Well, but  but by  you know, 

6

stopping immediately you could cause even greater harm. 

7

But let  I think your initial question 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what's wrong with 

following the law and disclosing that material 

10

information to the public and stopping the  the 

11

employees from losing more money in worthless stock 

12

 MR. LONG: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14
15

And I think that's ultimate 
 or almost worthless 

stock? 
 MR. LONG: 

That's ultimately where the 

16

government comes in.  Now, we've moved a huge distance 

17

from let's, you know, shut down the ESOP to let's 

18

release information. 

19

 But there we would say, again, we think you 

20

have to consider this in connection with securities law 

21

that if  if you announce, well, there's this sort of 

22

general duty to release information  I mean, first of 

23

all, that would be quite a big change in ERISA. 

24

There's  there are many specific requirements for 

25

disclosure of information in ERISA.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And what the lower courts 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's just background 

3

information for this point you're discussing.  Can 

4

can you tell me, is it a very common practice for the 

5

directors and officers of the company themselves to be 

6

the trustees?  I had just assumed that that didn't 

7

happen much anymore.  Can you just tell me, because a 

8

lot of these problems would be taken care of, insider 

9

information and so forth, if there was an outside 

10

trustee.  And I assume  tell me if I'm wrong  that 

11

the reason for the trust  for the company themselves 

12

to do it is because it saves money.  It's  it's 

13

cheaper than hiring an outside investment.  Maybe I'm 

14

wrong about that.  But can you 

15

 MR. LONG: 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17

Can you just tell us what 

the  what the landscape is? 

18
19

Well, in several 

 MR. LONG: 

First  first of all, it is 

common.  So this  this happens quite a lot. 

20

 You know, second of all, this  this idea 

21

of, well, we could appoint an independent trustee, would 

22

not really solve all the problems because then you'd 

23

have to have a monitoring trustee who would have to give 

24

the independent trustee any inside information that they 

25

had.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So the government's suggestion is, well, 

2

okay, you'd get a lowlevel employee to be the 

3

monitoring trustee.  Well, that could itself violate 

4

ERISA if you had somebody so low down that they wouldn't 

5

know anything, that  that also could be a violation. 

6

 So it's 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

I'm sorry.  If you want to 

9

 MR. LONG: 

I mean, part of 

So  so it's  it's really not 

10

a solution, but it is common to have the officers of the 

11

company, and I think it's not just to save money.  It's 

12

because it's a very important part of what the company 

13

does, and they want to have their top people running it. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean, the dilemma 

15

we're talking about, which is you've got inside 

16

information and if you do something with it, it's going 

17

to hurt the beneficiary, I mean, isn't that just a 

18

reflection of the fact that these are really bad 

19

investments?  I mean, you're putting all your eggs in 

20

one basket.  Your  your  your job depends on the 

21

company and your  your retirement depends on the 

22

company. 

23

 MR. LONG: 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

Well 
So that's why you're 

in this awkward position of saying if the company is

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doing something bad, you know, having inside  inside 

2

information that should be disclosed because it affects 

3

the stock price, then it's going to hurt not only the 

4

company, but also your retirement stock. 

5

 MR. LONG: 

Well, I mean, first of all, it's 

6

quite right that an ESOP, because it's totally 

7

undiversified, is not by itself a good retirement plan. 

8

And we think that just confirms that the  the special 

9

nature and  and aims of an ESOP is not solely for 

10
11

retirement benefits. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it is  it is a 

12

purpose, Mr. Long, isn't it?  You said  you quoted the 

13

statute, and the statute just says benefits.  But isn't 

14

the plan  doesn't the plan itself mention retirement? 

15

 MR. LONG: 

Oh, yes.  And  and  and the 

16

hope, of course, is that these plans will produce lots 

17

of retirement benefits.  The third plan, for long 

18

periods of its history, has been extremely successful at 

19

producing retirement benefits. 

20

 Our  our basic argument is, though, that 

21

because of the nature of this plan, because it is linked 

22

to the company's stock, and because Congress recently 

23

looked at this exact issue after Enron and said, we want 

24

employees to have choices, but company stock can still 

25

be a choice and we actually encourage that

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 MR. LONG: 

3
4

Well, the participants 
 but you don't shut it down as 

soon as there's trouble.  If a company 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why do you need a special 

5

rule for  for ESOPs?  I mean, the  the factors that 

6

you mentioned, it seems to me, apply to any trustee 

7

who's managing.  You say, oh, you should have sold 

8

because the stock was overvalued on the  on the stock 

9

market.  Well, how is the trustee supposed to know that? 

10

 MR. LONG: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

It's  it's 
Is he going to outguess the 

market? 

13

 MR. LONG: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.  Absolutely. 
Surely you don't demand 

15

that a prudent trustee outguess the market.  Okay?  So 

16

if it's not the market that's overvalued, it must be 

17

inside knowledge 

18

 MR. LONG: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. LONG: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Inside 
 that causes him to know. 
And I want to come 
And you have the same 

22

problem about not being able to use that inside 

23

knowledge. 

24

 MR. LONG: 

25

 And let me come back to Justice 

You can't use it. 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So  so why do we need a 

2

special rule for ESOPs I'm saying?  All the points you 

3

make apply to any  any kind of trustee, whether it's 

4

only company stock or not.  Why do we need a special 

5

rule for  for company stock operations? 

6

 MR. LONG: 

Well, because if it were just an 

7

ordinary investment 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 MR. LONG: 

10

 where the purpose really is 

just to maximize retirement benefits 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MR. LONG: 

13
14

Right. 

Right. 
 there you do look at the 

riskreturn ratio and the expenses and all 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  But you have the 

15

same  the same  the same problems that  that you 

16

justify doing nothing for the ESOP, justifies doing 

17

nothing in the other  in the other plans; namely, you 

18

can't expect me to  to outsmart the market, number 

19

one, nor can you expect me to use my inside knowledge. 

20

That violates the securities laws. 

21

 So those are your two points, but it seems 

22

to me those points apply.  We don't have to adopt a 

23

special law for this. 

24
25

 MR. LONG: 

Well  well, but, again, 

Justice Scalia, we're  we are agreeing with the lower

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts.  There is absolutely a duty of prudence, and we 

2

don't deny that there would be a point when a prudent 

3

ESOP fiduciary 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But even in saying that, 

5

Mr. Long, you have a category where you would say the 

6

duty of prudence applies, and it's this category of 

7

where the company is on the verge of collapse. 

8

 But even there, you would face the exact 

9
10

same securities law problems that you're  that you're 
saying should preclude 

11

 MR. LONG: 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well 
 the government's test. 

13

Because there, too, you would have this kind of, I don't 

14

know what to do, I'm between a rock and a hard place, 

15

the securities laws prevent me from selling on inside 

16

information.  The same problems apply. 

17

 MR. LONG: 

Well, no.  What  what we're 

18

saying is using public information, the chances that the 

19

company is going to be able to provide employee 

20

ownership for the long term may become so low that a 

21

prudent fiduciary would decide to shut it down. 

22

 But I do  I do want to answer your 

23

question on inside information because I think that's 

24

the nub of it, and you raised the point of, if the 

25

fiduciary actually knows the inside information, don't

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

they have to do something, make it public. 
 We talked about the securities law problem 

3

with trading on it.  The government says, Well, just 

4

just make it public.  Just release it to the public. 

5

 There we think the problem is, first of all, 

6

that that would create this new sort of general ERISA 

7

duty to provide information when it's not spelled out in 

8

ERISA as  you know, which has very specific 

9

requirements.  But 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's not an ERISA 

11

responsibility.  It's an SEC responsibility.  It's 10b5 

12

responsibility.  Aren't you supposed to disclose any 

13

information that a reasonable investor 

14

 MR. LONG: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 MR. LONG: 

And  and that's 
 would real 

 that's really exactly our 

17

point, Justice Sotomayor.  This is  if there's inside 

18

information that has to be disclosed, the securities law 

19

provides a complete legal regime for this.  The 

20

government even agrees that in terms of the timing of 

21

disclosure, the SEC timing should govern. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what's  what's 

23

wrong with a rule that simply says a fiduciary has to do 

24

whatever it's  possible to protect beneficiaries 

25

within the bounds of the law?

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. LONG: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, it  it 
And so if the law 

3

required you to disclose it, and you didn't, you've 

4

breached your duty of prudence and of loyalty, because 

5

you've protected the company 

6

 MR. LONG: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8
9

Well 
 but not the 

beneficiaries. 
 MR. LONG: 

It sounds good, but I think it 

10

would create serious problems.  I mean, you would have, 

11

then, two sources of information about the company, the 

12

ESOP fiduciary, which you would be saying would have an 

13

independent duty to decide when it thinks there's been 

14

some material misstatement or some inside information 

15

and the company, which could create great confusion. 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You  you don't 

you're  you have an absolute duty to the beneficiary. 
 MR. LONG: 

Well, but  but the  I guess 

19

the point is, Justice Sotomayor, from the  the 

20

fiduciary can say, Look, if there's been a securities 

21

law violation about disclosure or material 

22

misstatements, there's a securities law remedy for that, 

23

and the plan participants will get that remedy. 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, then, what if the 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In an ESOP  in an ESOP,

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can the fiduciary take into account the interests of the 

2

participants as employees as opposed to their interests 

3

as investors?  It doesn't seem to me that those will 

4

necessarily always be the same.  And there may be 

5

situations in which something that would be potentially 

6

good for the participants as investors would be quite 

7

bad for them as employees. 

8
9
10
11

 They want to keep their jobs. 

They want the 

company to stay afloat.  Can that properly be taken into 
account, or is that outside of the bounds? 
 MR. LONG: 

I mean, I  I don't think you 

12

have to do that.  I think you  you know, you look at 

13

the interest of the participants who are both employees 

14

and participants in the plan, you know.  So  so I 

15

don't think it's necessary to say, Well, we're not even 

16

looking at them as participants in the plan.  We're 

17

looking at them only as employees.  Are  we think 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, I'm not saying only as 

19

employees, but I'm saying can you take that into account 

20

at all?  If you're in the situation where stopping 

21

trade  stopping purchases in company stock would be a 

22

signal that would potentially trigger bankruptcy and 

23

liquidation for the company, can that be taken into 

24

account? 

25

 It might not be in the best interests  if

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the  if the  if these participants were simply 

2

investors, it might be in their best interests to stop 

3

buying the stock.  But if taking that step would have 

4

the consequences that I mentioned, it might be very much 

5

not in their best interests as employees. 

6

 MR. LONG: 

Well, I mean, I think I'd say 

7

that that would be one way to sort of work this out. 

8

It  that's another way of getting to the  the bottom 

9

line that we think is correct here, which is that an 

10

ESOP is a special kind of pension plan, and the whole 

11

nature of it is to own company stock.  And therefore 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, how do you fine 

13

define the standard or the duty that's responsive to 

14

Justice Alito's concern?  And I had the same problem. 

15

 Let's assume that trustees in a nonESOPs 

16

plan have a duty to maximize returns and provide stable 

17

investments.  Is it somehow different when it's an ESOP? 

18
19
20
21

 MR. LONG: 

Yes, I  I think it is.  If 

there's 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 
duty? 

22

 MR. LONG: 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

24

 MR. LONG: 

25

And if so, what is the 

The  I think the 
How do you define it? 
I think the  the duty is to 

maximize the returns for this special kind of a vehicle,

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which is a vehicle that owns stock in only one company, 

2

the  the employee's company, and for reasons that 

3

this kind of goes to  to Justice Alito's point but in 

4

a different way  for reasons that go beyond just the 

5

returns. 

6

 It's  it is because it is the  the 

7

employees' company.  Congress thought it was beneficial 

8

for many reasons to encourage employee ownership of 

9

companies, and so you don't look to whether, you know, 

10

this appears to be a bad investment as compared to a 

11

mutual fund. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, if I'm the trustee, 

13

I don't know what my duty is based on your answer.  I 

14

don't know what I'm supposed to do. 

15

 MR. LONG: 

Well, I mean, the courts of 

16

appeals have had a fairly uniform approach to this for 

17

now almost 20 years, and it has  it has not been 

18

causing a great deal of  of trouble.  The approach 

19

they've all been taking is that because of the special 

20

nature of ESOPs and, you know, when the plan requires 

21

that all the funds be invested in the ESOP at least, 

22

that's what the fiduciary must do, and that is 

23

presumptively prudent. 

24
25

 It's not necessarily prudent, and there 
would be, you know  the way we think the Courts have

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

best expressed it, if  and they draw this from trust 

2

law  if the special aims of this plan, employee 

3

ownership, can no longer reasonably be achieved, then 

4

prudence requires the plan to be shut down.  That is not 

5

a brightline standard, but that is the standard 

6

the courts have adopted.

 I'd like to save the balance of my time, if 
I may. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MANN 

12

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

13
14

Thank you, Mr. Long. 

 MR. MANN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 

15

 I think what I can most usefully do is talk 

16

first about the question of the relevant benefits that 

17

was raised by some of you, and then second address this 

18

socalled "rock and a hard place" problem which we think 

19

is essentially a confession of disloyalty by my most 

20

able opposing counsel. 

21

 First, the nature of the benefits in the 

22

statute, the reference to benefits in 404(a)(2)(A) is 

23

quite plain.  It refers to the basic type of plan that's 

24

covered by ERISA, which is an employee benefit plan as 

25

defined in Section 1002 sub 3 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Mann, I think it would help if you 

raised the podium a bit so you're closer to the microphone. 
 MR. MANN: 

Section 1002, Sub 3 describes 

4

 employee benefit plans, which are the subject of ERISA. 

5

 And there are two types of employee benefit plans as 

6

 defined in that section.  There are plans that provide 

7

 welfare benefits and plans that provide pension 

8

 benefits.  And I think there is no doubt that the 

9

 benefits that must be the exclusive purpose of an ERISA plan 

10

 are those benefits that are required to be governed by 

11

 ERISA. 

12

 And I think we need to remember the grand 

13

 bargain of ERISA, reflection of the statute is, if 

14

 employers are going to provide these kinds of benefits, 

15

 the people that manage the retirement and welfare plans 

16

 must accept fiduciary duties.  That's the bargain of 

17

 ERISA.  If you are going to provide these kinds of 

18

 benefits, you have to accept fiduciary duties. 

19
20
21

 And the sole purpose of the plan under the 
 statute is to provide those benefits. 
 Now, I'd like to talk about this idea of 

22

 this "rock and a hard place" that was first raised by 

23

 Justice Kagan. 

24
25

 I think that the best way to think about 
 this is, essentially, what the petitioners are saying

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 is, if I decide to put myself in a position where I owe 

2

 duties to two different people, my employer on the one 

3

 hand and the beneficiaries of the plan, because I've put 

4

 myself in a conflicted situation, it's perfectly right 

5

 for me to just do nothing. 

6

 That's not the way it works. 

You can 

7

 imagine a lawyer that undertakes to represent two 

8

 clients with conflicting interests.  If it comes to the 

9

 point where the interests are in conflict, well, the 

10

 lawyer has already made a mistake.  The lawyer cannot 

11

 simply say, well, I choose to protect one client, not 

12

 the other.  They have to be something, and they're going 

13

 to violate some 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I would say that  well, 

15

 what the problem  but can you give me any example of 

16

 any case?  There may be so many you can't even give me 

17

 your best one.  But trusts have been around for probably 

18

 800 years.  And can you give me an example of one where 

19

 a court said a trustee has breached its fiduciary 

20

 obligation because he failed to use inside information? 

21
22
23
24
25

 MR. MANN: 

Oh, no, I  I think there 

 probably isn't such a case, but I would 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You think there is not such 

 a case? 
 MR. MANN: 

I think there probably is not

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 such a case.  The court of appeal 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Fine.  If there is not such 

3

 a case, what's the problem?  Because what's the rock and 

4

 the hard place? 

5

 MR. MANN: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, the 
The person has an 

7

 obligation to act prudently in respect to the 

8

 fiduciaries  to the beneficiaries, of course.  But he 

9

 cannot, irrespective of that, have an obligation to use 

10

 inside information.  End of the matter.  What  what's 

11

 wrong with saying just that? 

12

 MR. MANN: 

I  I'm not sure what you mean 

13

 by that, but I'd like to 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What I mean by it is just 

15

 what I said.  There is no rule of trust or ERISA law 

16

 that you can breach a duty to a beneficiary by failing 

17

 to use inside information, period.  I don't know what 

18

 the SEC's brief is.  I'm going to ask 

19

 MR. MANN: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think I 
 the SG what their 

21

 opinion is because they don't seem to appear on this 

22

 brief. 

23

 MR. MANN: 

I think I would respectfully 

24

 disagree with that, and I think it's important to 

25

 understand why, Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan.

27

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 been a case ever holding the contrary 

3

 MR. MANN: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

But that's 

 MR. MANN: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 but you yourself 

 disagree with it. 

6

8

The answer is there's not 

But that is 
Now, what the reason you 

 disagree with it? 
 MR. MANN: 

That is because the courts of 

10

 appeals unanimously, as Mr. Long says, have held that 

11

 the trustees of these plans have no duties at all.  And 

12

 so if trustees have no duties at all, it's of course 

13

 quite difficult for them to breach the duties.  Now, 

14

 my 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm sorry.  I'm saying go 

16

 back to England.  There are many cases where settlors 

17

 have said what kinds of things you should invest in, and 

18

 they invest in them.  They have inside information that 

19

 it is a bad investment.  Is there any case that says 

20

 they have a duty of obligation not to do what the 

21

 settlor says?  I wouldn't have been surprised if you had 

22

 found some cases, but I'm also not surprised that there 

23

 aren't any.  That's why I asked the question. 

24
25

 MR. MANN: 

With respect to that particular 

 question, and I  I did not understand your question

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that way, and I don't  I can't say whether there is or 

2

 has never been such a case. 

3

 But what's important from our perspective is 

4

 the trustees in this case undertook to represent 

5

 conflicting interests.  Ordinarily when people undertake 

6

 to represent conflicting interests 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let me just continue to 

8

 Justice Breyer's question.  There are some legal duties. 

9

 I don't know of a trustee who has to break the law. 

10

 They can't sell on the basis of inside information, and 

11

 that's a legal prohibition. 

12

 MR. MANN: 

I think that's clearly true, but 

13

 I think they, at the same time, at their peril, breach 

14

 their duties of loyalty to those for whom they've 

15

 accepted a fiduciary duty.  And the 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So your claim rises and 

17

 falls on the fact that you think they're  they've 

18

 breached their duty of loyalty by having the inside 

19

 information and  or exactly what is your claim?  What 

20

 could they have done that wouldn't breach the law? 

21

 MR. MANN: 

My claim does not rise or fall at 

22

 all on that.  And I don't think there is any reason why 

23

 you need to address that, given the particular nature of 

24

 the complaint.  The complaint in this case alleges that 

25

 the trustees knew or would have known, if they had

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 undertaken a reasonable investigation of the type that 

2

 is required by ordinary principles of prudence, that the 

3

 stock was materially overvalued, and the stock was a 

4

 much more risky investment than it was at the time that 

5

 the plan was designed. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

How would they 
What do they have to do 

8

 then?  You said they can't sell the stock based on that 

9

 information.  What are they supposed to do?  Or is it 

10

 your argument that they just never  you never should 

11

 have insiders serving as trustees; you always have to 

12

 have an outside running these ESOPs? 

13

 MR. MANN: 

Well, I wouldn't say that you 

14

 always have to, but I do think that the situation is 

15

 quite parallel to the situation that corporate directors 

16

 face when they come into a conflicted situation.  In the 

17

 corporate context where directors ordinarily are 

18

 protected by the business judgment rule, if a situation 

19

 arises in which their interests patently diverge from 

20

 the interests of the shareholders, they don't simply 

21

 decide to represent both interests but pick one over the 

22

 other.  They instead step aside and appoint  and, you 

23

 know, allow independent people to represent the 

24

 shareholders. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So you're basically saying

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that if it's not flatly prohibited, it is very unwise. 

2

 It generally shouldn't happen.  You're putting yourself 

3

 in an impossible position if you are an insider and 

4

 you're going to serve as the trustee of an ESOP. 

5

 MR. MANN: 

Well, I think it's a plain 

6

 implication of Justice Kennedy's opinion in Glenn and 

7

 the majority opinion in Glenn that the structure of the 

8

 fiduciary and the relationship to the trust being 

9

 conflicted should raise a red flag. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Here when you say  I am 

11

 totally with you on this.  We walk into the trustee's 

12

 office.  It's like Ralph Nader investigating the FTC 

13

 years ago.  There is someone asleep on the sofa.  In his 

14

 inbox is ten feet of papers telling him about all 

15

 public  telling him about the corporation's condition. 

16

 It's apparent he's never read them.  If he had read 

17

 them, he would have taken action.  Of course you would 

18

 have a case, I would think. 

19

 MR. MANN: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21
22

But that is our complaint. 
But you want to go beyond 

 that? 
 MR. MANN: 

No.  Our complaint is they have 

23

 the information in step one.  They didn't do anything. 

24

 Step one, they did not 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not just information.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Remember I carefully said all this was publicly 

2

 available information.  You want to say it also applies 

3

 when it's not publicly available information.  Am I 

4

 right or wrong? 

5

 MR. MANN: 

You are correct.  I would also like to 

6

 say that, but I would like to point out our complaint 

7

 alleges a large amount of information that is one, 

8

 public; two, false information promulgated by the 

9

 petitioners, the falsity of which perhaps could have 

10

 been undertaken by  discovered by considerable 

11

 investigation. 

12

 And instead of conducting a reasonable 

13

 investigation that a trustee for a billion dollar 

14

 pension plan ordinarily would conduct  and just to be 

15

 clear for the earlier discussion, this is not a plan 

16

 that is invested solely in Fifth Third stock.  This plan 

17

 has a variety of investments.  There is one particular 

18

 fund that has 1 to $200 million 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose you were a 

20

 legislature or a congressman.  You are absolutely 

21

 committed to the idea that it's important and salutary 

22

 to have employees own stock in the company for which 

23

 they work.  How would you write the statute? 

24
25

 MR. MANN: 

I think Congress has done a great 

 job of writing the statute.  Congress wrote a

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 statute that tells employers you can set up these plans, 

2

 and the trustees don't have to diversify, which is 

3

 inherent in having a plan that has employee stock 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, once you say the 

5

 trustee doesn't have the duty to diversify, it seems to 

6

 me you are living in something of a different world. 

7

 MR. MANN: 

I think that's right.  And that's 

8

 why we believe that this standard of prudence is 

9

 affected by the fact that it's an employee stock 

10

 ownership plan rather than just a portion of the fund 

11

 that owes employers' stock.  But that doesn't mean that 

12

 there's no duty of loyalty.  It shouldn't affect that at 

13

 all. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but affected 

15

 is not quite enough.  I mean, this trustee's job is to 

16

 buy the company's stock.  In that particular fund, it's 

17

 100 percent, other than the money you need to buy and 

18

 sell.  So he has the easiest job in the world.  He gets 

19

 up in the morning and says, "I think I will buy some of 

20

 this company's stock." 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's what he's 

23

 supposed to do.  And I think that what every Court of 

24

 Appeals has recognized is that that is by definition 

25

 prudent, because that is the settlor's objective with

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 one exception.  If everything is going, you know, south 

2

 and the company's collapsing, well, then he does have 

3

 the obligation to do something. 

4

 So I don't understand how you keep  can 

5

 say that he has breached a fiduciary duty of prudence 

6

 when the people investing in this ought to know what 

7

 they're going to get is the company's stock. 

8
9
10

 MR. MANN: 

I think it's  I'm glad that you 

 asked that question, because I think that's central at 
 the disagreement between respondents and petitioners. 

11

 Now, the first answer, of course, is that 

12

 you can't look at the statute without thinking that 

13

 Congress had a different understanding of the duties. 

14

 And if I just could just mention a couple of things 

15

 about the statute.  It's not only the point that Justice 

16

 Scalia made that Section 404(a)(2) specifically carves 

17

 out some duties but not others. 

18

 It's also that it only forgives prudence to 

19

 the extent of diversification, which means that prudence 

20

 has to mean something other than diversification.  And 

21

 then it still further limits the scope of forgiveness. 

22

 It only forgives it with respect to the acquisition or 

23

 holding of qualifying employee securities  employer 

24

 securities, which is much narrower than the fiduciary 

25

 duty defined in Section 403 to manage and control the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

 assets of the plan. 
 But what's important for our purpose is, it 

3

 would not  if you ask the question, although the 

4

 statute resolves it, it would not have been sensible for 

5

 Congress to tell the people that manage employer stock 

6

 ownership plans that they have no duties of prudence or 

7

 loyalty to the employers whose retirement funds are at 

8

 stake. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what is 

10

 exactly the duty of prudence?  Presumably, you buy 

11

 you invest the funds in the company's stock, whether 

12

 it's going up or going down, right?  If you have the 

13

 funds, all you can do is invest them.  The stock is down 

14

 half a point or whatever.  You still buy it, right? 

15

 MR. MANN: 

Okay.  So I'd like to say, first, 

16

 there is the duty of loyalty.  And it does breach the 

17

 duty of loyalty, for example, as the Court said in 

18

 Varity, and I don't think it's controversial, to lie to 

19

 the beneficiaries.

With respect to the duty  so 

 the duty of loyalty is enough to sustain

No, no.  I didn't 

 ask a question about the duty of loyalty.

 MR. MANN: 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

With respect to 
I asked a question 

3

 of whether or not the trustee is imprudent because he 

4

 buys the stock because it's gone down  you know, gone 

5

 down 10 percent. 

6

 MR. MANN: 

Okay.  The most fundamental thing 

7

 about the duty of prudence that you would get from your 

8

 statement of trust is that the outcome of the investment 

9

 is not what's relevant.  What's relevant is, and Justice 

10

 Scalia when he was on the D.C. Circuit wrote a long 

11

 opinion in Fink, which discusses in detail, and you'd 

12

 see the same thing in the comments to Section 90 of the 

13

 restatement, the most important thing is what you might 

14

 call procedural prudence.  Okay.  These people are 

15

 managing a fund of $1 billion.  The relevant question is 

16

 what would a reasonable trustee of a billiondollar fund 

17

 have done to investigate the situation?  Would someone 

18

 with a billiondollar fund and 100 to $200 million of 

19

 Fifth Third stock have routinely been collecting 

20

 information about the nature of that investment, whether 

21

 they should take some action? 

22

 It well might be  it well might be that 

23

 they should not in a flighty or haphazard way dispose of 

24

 the stock, because that's the baseline of this plan, is 

25

 to invest in the stock.  But that's entirely different

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 from doing absolutely nothing, not telling the employers 

2

 information 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do you think the trustee has 

4

 a duty to acquire inside information?  The trustees say, 

5

 I don't want to know insider information.  I'm going to 

6

 put myself in exactly the position of an outside 

7

 trustee, so I'm going to take into account only public 

8

 information, I'm not going to do an investigation. 

9

 MR. MANN: 

Our position is that the duty of 

10

 the trustee is to behave as a prudent fiduciary would 

11

 behave, and if the trustee is unable to do that because 

12

 the trustee has conflicting interests to serve, then the 

13

 trustee is violating the duty of loyalty and should 

14

 arrange the situation differently. 

15
16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What's the answer to my 

 question?  Assuming that 

17

 MR. MANN: 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The answer to your question 
 permissible for an 

19

 insider to be in this position, can the insider behave 

20

 like an outsider? 

21

 MR. MANN: 

I think it's plain in the case 

22

 that if the trustee does not undertake the investigation 

23

 that a prudent fiduciary would take, because of their 

24

 concern about acquiring insider information of the 

25

 employer, then they would violate the ordinary standard

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 of prudence. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, can we talk 

3

 concretely instead of just saying, well, they've got to 

4

 do what a prudent fiduciary can do?  Are they allowed to 

5

 take into account the impact of a decision to stop 

6

 buying on the beneficiaries?  The stock is going down, 

7

 if the trustee stops buying, that's going to cause a 

8

 drop in the value of the shares and that's going to hurt 

9

 the beneficiaries.  So what does he do?  Does he say, I 

10

 shouldn't buy any more because I think it's going to go 

11

 down some more?  Or should he say, I should keep buying 

12

 because otherwise all of the holdings, and this is all 

13

 they are invested in, their holdings are going to go 

14

 down? 

15

 MR. MANN: 

I think the obligation of the 

16

 fiduciary at all times is to behave prudently in 

17

 managing investment prudently.  There might 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I asked for an 

19

 answer to the question.  And I  it doesn't  it's not 

20

 going to help me to have this mantra as opposed to 

21

 MR. MANN: 

Well, I don't  I don't believe 

22

 that the question is whether they must sell or mustn't 

23

 sell.  I think they have to decide would it be in the 

24

 based on the facts we know right now, do we believe that 

25

 this is a shortterm blip in the stocks and it will rise

 back up, in which case, we 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

In a way, what happens is 

3

 that the trustee, knowing that the company has announced 

4

 an enormous oil strike, is having to sit on a private 

5

 meeting where three people come in and you say, yeah, 

6

 there was an oil strike, but it's impossible to get the 

7

 oil out.  Ha, ha, we put one over on that time.  Okay. 

8

 MR. MANN:

 JUSTICE BREYER:

If the 
Now, what's that trustee 

 supposed to do? 
 MR. MANN: 

I think I lost track of whether 

 the oil strike was true or false. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. MANN: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No.  There's a false. 
Okay. 
He alone, when two other 

16

 people, know that this oil is worthless.  The market 

17

 doesn't.  It's totally inside information.  What, in 

18

 your opinion, is he supposed to do? 

19

 MR. MANN: 

I believe that the trustee 

20

 violates the duty of loyalty and the duty of prudence if 

21

 the trustee, believing that the stock is overvalued, in 

22

 fact, does not take action to protect the beneficiaries. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So your answer is, 

 totally inside information, he sells, right? 
 MR. MANN: 

I didn't say that.  I think he

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 needs to do something. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I just don't see what the 

4

 trustee is supposed to do.  You have the company stock. 

5

 By comparing it with other stocks, there will be many 

6

 investments that are just as good or better.  When does 

7

 he have to make the investment, in other words, just as 

8

 good or better?  I don't understand.  I don't understand 

9

 what  how we're going to implement what Congress 

10

 wanted to implement. 

11

 MR. MANN: 

Well, we believe that the 

12

 traditional fiduciary standard is not that hard to 

13

 implement.  It's a standard that's been imposed on 

14

 fiduciaries for centuries.  It's a standard that all 

15

 managers of trusts have undertaken.  The only thing 

16

 that's really different about these particular trustees 

17

 is that they're managing funds that are worth, you know, 

18

 billions of dollars. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

19

Mr. Mann, you said you were going 

20

 to deal with the rock and a hard place.But it's been put to you that if 

21

the 

22

 trustee goes out and sells, that would be a signal that 

23

 things are bad with the company.  So it will end up 

24

 being worse for the beneficiaries of the plan. 

25
26

 MR. MANN: 

We certainly believe that if the 

 trustee's view, based on the information, is that

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 selling the stock would be bad for the beneficiaries, 

2

 then a decision not to sell is prudent.  If the trustee 

3

 decides selling would be bad for the beneficiaries so 

4

 we're not going to sell, that is a prudent decision.  It 

5

 might be right.  It might be wrong.  But if that's their 

6

 decision, I think that's prudent.  If a trustee decides 

7

 selling would be beneficial to the beneficiaries, it 

8

 might be right, it might be wrong, but if that's what 

9

 they actively decide, then I think they need to do 

10
11

 something.  And that's our position. 
 Now, the rock and the hard place, I 

12

 understand that some of the Justices have disagreed. 

13

 But I mean, our position on that is quite clear.  The 

14

 only reason petitioners are between a rock and a hard 

15

 place is they have undertaken to have interests that 

16

 directly conflict with their fiduciary obligation to 

17

 these employees' retirement benefits.  There is nothing 

18

 in the statute.  There is no practical consideration 

19

 that petitioners have suggested.  There is no reason 

20

 that these funds need to be managed by insiders.  As far 

21

 as we 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about the argument  so you have 

23

outside trustees, they have to get information from the insider 

24

 and if they get the information from an insider we're back in the same 

25

place. 

26

 MR. MANN: 

Well, of course, if you wait

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 until you are in possession of information and you know 

2

 the stock is overvalued, you can't solve the problem by 

3

 stepping aside then.  But if you set up the trust in the 

4

 hands of an independent investment manager in the 

5

 beginning, we believe that if you look carefully to 

6

 provisions of Section 1105(c) and (d), you will see that 

7

 Congress has provided a great deal of protection for the 

8

 person it appoints.  Of course, it's true that if the 

9

 person in the company that appoints a fiduciary knows 

10

 that there is a breach of fiduciary duty by the 

11

 investment manager, they're still liable.  But what else 

12

 could Congress possibly say?  Congress couldn't write a 

13

 statute that says people that knowingly breach fiduciary 

14

 duties of the employees are not supposed to be liable, 

15

 so 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The status of the 

17

 trustee, whether it's an interested party or a 

18

 disinterested fiduciary, is disclosed to the 

19

 beneficiaries, I take it, at the outset?  They can 

20

 decide that they don't want to invest in that particular 

21

 fund and there are nine other options because of that 

22

 potential conflict? 

23

 MR. MANN: 

Yes, they are advised of that. 

24

 Their ability not to invest in that particular fund is 

25

 limited during the class period because all of the

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 matching contributions for all of the class period went 

2

 directly into this fund.  So employees would have to 

3

 take that active step to remove them from the fund. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

If they wanted 

5

they got four percent matching funds if 

6

 they were in that fund? 

7

 MR. MANN: 

8

 I think the most important thing for us to 

That is correct. 

9

 emphasize is the point of ERISA is that if an employer 

10

 is going to provide employee benefits, the people that 

11

 manage those benefits have to accept fiduciary duties. 

12

 There is nothing unusual about that.  The standard is 

13

 not unworkable.  It's a standard that is provided for 

14

 centuries.  And if the only reason that the people 

15

 managing the fund can't comply with those duties is 

16

 because they have obligations to the employers, then 

17

 that is not something that ERISA can tolerate. 

18

 Thank you.

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

23
24
25

Thank you, counsel. 

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court:

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Several points at the outset. 

Justice Alito 

2

 asked about taking into account the interests of 

3

 employees as employees.  But Section 1104 speaks in 

4

 terms of operating the plan for the exclusive purpose of 

5

 providing benefits to participants and their 

6

 beneficiaries, which means the interests of employees 

7

 are taken into account only insofar as they are 

8

 participants in the plan, not more generally. 

9

 And the second and related point I would 

10

 like to make with respect to that is the use of the word 

11

 "benefits" in 1104(a) that says that the plan must be 

12

 operated for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits 

13

 to participants.  We have that on page 6(a) of our 

14

 petition appendix.  Further up on that is the definition 

15

 in 1234 of an individual account plan, which 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Kneedler, a stock 

17

 drop in and of itself, I don't think, can prove a lack 

18

 of prudence because 

19

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Agree. 
You agree with that? 
Yes, we do.  I mean, there 

22

 are situations in which there may be additional unusual 

23

 circumstances, but simply a stock drop would not.  But I 

24

 think that, as Justice Scalia pointed out, that would 

25

 also be true in a diversified plan.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Exactly.  It's true 

 almost anywhere because you can't outsmart the market. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

At least we're not 

4

 insisting that a fiduciary in order to be prudent 

5

 must 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So how do you deal with 

7

 what has been vexing us, the issue of what a fiduciary 

8

 should or can do when they are an insider and have only 

9

 inside information, not public information? 

10

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right. 
So where is the breach 

12

 of fiduciary duty?  Where's the breach of loyalty?  What 

13

 can it consist of, and what does someone have to prove 

14

 in a complaint?  Because this has to do with a pleading 

15

 presumption and a merits presumption. 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Right.  And if there is a 

17

 substantive principle here, that would have to be 

18

 pleaded.  If it is an evidentiary presumption, as the 

19

 Sixth Circuit said, that would not have to be pleaded in 

20

 the complaint. 

21

 But several points on that. 

First of all, 

22

 in response to Justice Breyer's question about inside 

23

 information, we would point out on page 31 of our brief, 

24

 quoting Scott, that if a fiduciary has peculiar 

25

 knowledge about a corporation's stock's value, that is a

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 factor to be taken into account in terms of the way the 

2

 trustee exercises his responsibility. 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, the  the union 

4

 brief says the thing to do in that situation is, without 

5

 saying anything, turn the trusteeship over to a person 

6

 who doesn't have that knowledge.  That takes care of the 

7

 problem.  And the reason I raised the question, of 

8

 course, is there are trillions of dollars probably 

9

 managed by ERISA funds.  I don't know what percentage of 

10

 those involve stocks.  Not this kind  of this kind. 

11

 Maybe you know, but my guess is a lot. 

12

 And obviously, before I wrote a word that 

13

 said what you have to do or don't have to do with inside 

14

 information, I would like to know directly, not 

15

 indirectly, what the SEC thinks. 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well 
And maybe you can tell me. 

18

 But the SEC isn't here.  And at least there's no SEC 

19

 lawyer that signed your brief.  So I don't know the 

20

 extent to which that's 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

22
23
24
25

I mean, this is primarily a 

 labor case.  The security 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It might be you might have 

 a good reason for it. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Right.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But right now I am supposed 

 to write some words or join some words. 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
And those words will tell 

5

 trustees of possibly  I have no idea  but maybe 

6

 hundreds of billions, or maybe billions anyway, of  of 

7

 assets in the stock market, what they're supposed to do 

8

 when they learn some inside information that affects the 

9

 company's stock.  And I hate to tell you, I don't know 

10

 anything in this area about what the likely effects are. 

11

 And, therefore, I'd like to know what they think.  And 

12

 the closest I came to it was the AFLCIO brief, frankly, 

13

 where they said what you're supposed to do here is  is 

14

 turn this over.  So what do I do? 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, that is, of course, one 

16

 option if  if circumstances get very bad.  This was 

17

 true in the WR Grace situation.  The trustee  the 

18

 inside trustees appointed an outside trustee to do an 

19

 evaluation.  But the first  the first step that 

20

 that Mr. Mann pointed out is, I think, a fundamental one 

21

 that should not be overlooked here.  And that is that 

22

 the fiduciaries have an obligation to actually exercise 

23

 their discretion and actually investigate.  And here, 

24

 the allegation is that these trustees did not even do 

25

 that.  So if you're going to be giving deference to a

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3
4

 trustee under 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Investigate 

 what, the nonpublic information?  Investigate 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Investigate  investigate 

5

 the consequences of the nonpublic  this would be true 

6

 of public information, too, that the  this is not  a 

7

 plan like this, even though it is exempt from  from 

8

 requirements of diversification, there are still prudence 

9

 duties, which include investigation and  and 

10

 monitoring of the  of the investment.  So the  the 

11

 fiduciaries of a plan like this do have an ongoing 

12

 obligation to investigate and to keep themselves 

13

 apprised of how the company is doing. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what exactly, 

15

 concrete terms, what do you do as the trustee?  You have 

16

 this information, inside information that says that the 

17

 stock is overvalued.  Do you sell?  In which case the 

18

 beneficiaries' holdings go way down and they sue you, or 

19

 do you not sell?  In which case when the information 

20

 comes out, the beneficiaries sue you because their value 

21

 goes down.  What are you supposed to do? 

22

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

In  in the category of 

23

 cases we're talking about here, and these are the ones 

24

 that are of the greatest concern to the Department of 

25

 Labor, the stock is materially overvalued because of the

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 inside information.  In that situation  and I think 

2

 this is the point Justice Kagan was making  it 

3

 would  it would ordinarily be the right thing to do to 

4

 sell, the truth will out eventually.  But  and there 

5

 may be  there may be a precipitous drop.  But the 

6

 stock has already been at a  at a level and  and 

7

 stock has already been purchased at an inflated level, 

8

 which means that the employees are not getting what they 

9

 were entitled to. 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But you say they should sell 

 based on the inside information? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No, he can't  he can't sell 

13

 on the basis of inside information.  He could  I'm 

14

 sorry, he could stop purchasing, which is 

15
16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But the market will see 

 through that in about two seconds.  But the 

17

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, no, this is the 
That isn't really my 

19

 question.  It's a numerical question.  What  you know, 

20

 I was making up numbers wildly.  What are the actual 

21

 numbers?  That is, approximately how much in assets is 

22

 accounted for by ownership of the company's  you know, 

23

 this kind of a plan where you buy the company's stock. 

24

 Do you know? 

25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I don't know the amount of

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 assets, but 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

About? 
 as I  as I recall, I 

4

 think there are perhaps 12 or 14,000 ESOP plans. 

5

 Some  about half the employees covered are in publicly 

6

 traded  in publicly traded corporations. 

7

 I want to make another point in terms of the 

8

 purposes of an ESOP.  The  Congress has provided for 

9

 investment in  in employer stock, but it has not 

10

 excepted the fiduciaries from the general duty of  of 

11

 prudence.  The statute  the statute makes that clear. 

12

 And in 2006, Congress provided that employees of 

13

 publicly traded companies must be given the right to 

14

 diversify, which reflects the judgment 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But your  your argument, 

16

 at least according to the Petitioners's brief, and I 

17

 think they're correct, you go away from the purity 

18

 standard.  You have your own standard whether or not 

19

 it's materially overvalued in this instance.  Or are you 

20

 saying 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

For inside  where there's 

22

 inside information and is it  is it materially 

23

 overvalued.  And there could  there can 

24

 be circumstances 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but then  but

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 then you are creating a special standard which is just 

2

 what you're accusing the Petitioners of doing. 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, the question is what's 

4

 the general standard of prudence.  And it would always 

5

 be imprudent for a diversified or nondiversified plan 

6

 for the fiduciaries to purchase a  an asset that 

7

 they  or hold on to an asset that they know to be 

8

 or should know with reasonable investigation is 

9

 materially overvalued. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me give you  I'll give you this 

11

 example.  It's helpful to have something concrete here 

12

 and not just general statements of  of  about 

13

 fiduciary duty. 

14

 Let's say that the trustee receives inside

 information that someone has alleged that corporate 

16

 office  a particular corporate officer has engaged in 

17

 illegal conduct.  And if it turns out that that conduct 

18

 actually took place, that  that information  that 

19

 will cause damage to the company.  But it's  it's 

20

 it hasn't been proven.  There's simply been an 

21

 allegation. 

22

 Now, what  at that point, what does the 

23

 trustee  what do you think the trustee has to do?  If 

24

 that information were available to the public, let's say 

25

 it would cause the price of the stock to go down, so

51

1

 it's material  it's material information, but at a 

2

 somewhat preliminary stage.  What do you do?  Completely 

3

 stop buying the stock?  You can't sell.  Disclose the 

4

 information?  What is supposed to be done? 

5

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

There is no absolute answer 

6

 in that situation.  Stopping buying might be the right 

7

 approach.  That's not uncommon, and there are blackout 

8

 periods where  where plans in companies bar trading in 

9

 the stock.  But if it's material information that the 

10

 securities laws require to be disclosed, there is no 

11

 reason why the participants in an ERISA plan should be 

12

 unprotected when that material information affects 

13

 the 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's  no.  But 

15

 but would that information have to be disclosed under 

16

 the securities laws?  Let's say there was no prior  no 

17

 prior misleading statement regarding this matter. 

18
19

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

It would have to be 

 disclosed. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Eventually. 
If it's major, it might have 

22

 to be disclosed within 4 days under  under 8(k). 

23

 Otherwise, it would be quarterly or annually.  And we 

24

 are  we are suggesting that the  that disclosure 

25

 obligations should be geared to what the securities law

 provides 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The Chief Justice 

3

 indicated I can ask just one question.  Is this a 

4

 case in which we must decide what the fiduciary standard 

5

 is quite without regard to inside information?  Is 

6

 inside information just an added issue in the case or is 

7

 it the key issue in the case? 

8
9

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

We think in this case it 

 is  it is the key issue.  The Court does not have to 

10

 decide what fiduciary obligations the fiduciary of an 

11

 ESOP would have in  in dire circumstances where the 

12

 where you have a failing company or mismanagement or 

13

 something like that.  We are focused here on inside 

14

 information that materially enhances the value of the 

15

 stock, overvalues it, and in that situation, we think 

16

 that a fiduciary of an ESOP, just like the fiduciary of 

17

 any other plan, has a  has a duty of prudence not to 

18

 remain invested in or to purchase materially overvalued 

19

 stock.

 Mr. Long, you have five minutes.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR. 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. LONG: 

The ESOP association brief 

 reports at page 2 that there are $1.07 trillion in these

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 employee stock plans, and we think really that's the 

2

 key, are all of the Courts of Appeals considering many 

3

 cases, you know, with many different fact patterns have 

4

 not disagreed.  There is no circuit split on the issue 

5

 that we've spent all our time discussing this morning. 

6

 The only circuit split is on whether this presumption 

7

 applies at the motion to dismiss stage. 

8
9
10
11

 The real point here, as  as Justice 
 Kennedy said, Congress strongly supports ESOPs.  It 
 wants to encourage them so it 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I appreciate that. 

12

 But if I'm listening to the government carefully and 

13

 understanding its position, it's basically saying if 

14

 there's been a violation of a securities law that a 

15

 fiduciary knows, then why shouldn't it be liable both 

16

 under the company, under 10b5, and the director of the 

17

 plan or the trustee of the plan as a breach of loyalty 

18

 to  or  or of prudence to the beneficiaries? 

19

 MR. LONG: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, again  again 
It's like  yes, it's a 

21

 double remedy, but there's lots of things that provide 

22

 double remedies.  So if that person should have 

23

 disclosed. 

24
25

 MR. LONG: 

Well, I mean, securities law will 

 provide the first remedy.  And if you're going to add an

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 MR. LONG: 

If you're going to add an 

 additional 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It will against the 

 company. 
 MR. LONG: 

Well, but  but the additional 

9

 ERISA remedy in this ESOP context is going to create 

10

 these tremendous problems.  I  I couldn't begin to 

11

 understand what the ESOP fiduciary was supposed to do in 

12

 these circumstances, I mean, in terms of 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Obey the law.  I think 

 that that's the simple answer. 
 MR. LONG: 

Well, but you will create two 

16

 different centers of communication now out of each 

17

 corporation with an ESOP.  The corporation's own 

18

 statements and then the ESOP. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

 the conflicts. 

21

 MR. LONG: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You know they created 

Well, I think  I think 
I'm not shrugging my 

23

 shoulder out of lack of sympathy but out of reality. 

24

 The loyalty is to the beneficiaries.  If you're going to 

25

 place someone there who comes to inside knowledge,

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 you're going to create potentially a problem. 

2

 MR. LONG: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, but 
But I think your 

4

 adversary was saying that's a selfinduced problem, not 

5

 one that the law should excuse you from following 

6

 whatever the law is. 

7

 MR. LONG: 

Well, but  but two points.  I 

8

 mean, you  I would submit you should be very cautious 

9

 about interpreting these duties in ways that will make 

10

 ESOPs unworkable, and I think that would basically cause 

11

 many companies to say we can't put fiduciaries in that 

12

 situation, so we're not going to have ESOPs at all. 

13

 And the  you know, again, because the 

14

 special purpose of an ESOP is to give the employees a 

15

 piece of the rock, ownership in the company, if the 

16

 company is going through temporary hard times, even if 

17

 there's a situation where there's some, you know, 

18

 material misinformation that is out in the market, that 

19

 may all be corrected in the long term.  You know, in 

20

 this case, if the fiduciaries had shut down the ESOP, 

21

 they would certainly have been sued because they would 

22

 have violated the plan terms, and the  the plan has 

23

 done very well.  It's gone up from $2 to over $22. 

24
25

 So they might have had a very hard time 
 winning that case because they would have been

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 challenged that prudence didn't really require you to 

2

 shut it down.  Yes, we were going through some severe 

3

 problems, but we came through them. 

4

 That's the razor's edge. 

That's the rock 

5

 and the hard place.  They're going to be sued unless you 

6

 recognize this presumption that every court of appeals 

7

 has recognized to give the ESOP fiduciary some leeway. 

8

 They're going to be different from any other fiduciary 

9

 in any other plan because it's the company's stock. 

10

 And if they, you know  if  if the stock 

11

 goes down under this openended duty of prudence, 

12

 they're going to be sued for not having anticipated that 

13

 and done something, sold, stopped trading, put out 

14

 information.  But if they don't do it and the stock goes 

15

 up, they're going to be sued for that. 

16

 And, in fact, you know, if you recognize the 

17

 government's approach, there'll be a whole new class of 

18

 cases, which is, if the stock goes up, their 

19

 plaintiffs' lawyers will be able to argue, well, the 

20

 fiduciary should have  should have anticipated that, 

21

 and the participants who were selling and deciding to 

22

 move over to the S&P 500 fund, you let them sell their 

23

 stock too cheaply, and that's a violation.  So it's 

24

 it's unworkable. 

25

 We submit.
