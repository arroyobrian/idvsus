ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WHALEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Mr. and Mrs. Kawashima came here to the

11

United States as legal immigrants in 1985.

12

on, they pled guilty to filing a false statement under a

13

corporate tax return.

14

is whether that conviction under 26 U.S.C. 7206 is an

15

aggravated felony, specifically under (M)(i) of the

16

aggravated felony statute.

17

And later

The issue we bring to the Court

This Court many times has held that it is

18

the elements of the crime of conviction that determine

19

whether a crime is an aggravated felony.

20

elements of 7206 do not change when they go over to the

21

immigration statute.

22

basically as the Department of Justice has written in

23

its Tax Manual.

24

If you don't tell the truth, and you know what you're

25

saying is false, and you do it under oath, that's

And the

And the terms of that statute is

It is basically a tax perjury statute.

perjury.

2

There are other statutes, perjury statute,

3

which in essence says the same thing.

4

1001 is also a perjury statute.

5

require the Justice Department or a court to determine

6

whether fraud and deceit was an element of that crime.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And 18 U.S.C.

And none of them

How would you prove fraud

8

and deceit beyond proving that the person lied,

9

intentionally lied?

What -- what is added to

10

intentionally lying to convert that into fraud or

11

deceit?

12
13
14
15

MR. WHALEN:

It's the intention to deceive

or the intention to defraud.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And simply -Isn't intentionally

lying -- doesn't that mean that you intend to deceive?

16

MR. WHALEN:

It does not, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. WHALEN:

It doesn't?

It does not mean, because you

19

are saying a false -- making a false statement, that

20

that is evidence of an intent to deceive.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Whalen, the common

22

definition of deceit is acting -- intentionally giving a

23

false impression, intentionally giving a false

24

impression with the intent that someone will act on it.

25

So, it seems that's exactly what filing a false return
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is.

You give a false impression of what your income is

2

with the intent that the IRS will accept it.

3

MR. WHALEN:

Justice Ginsburg, the

4

difference I'm trying to ask the Court to consider, it

5

is the intent which is an element of fraud and deceit.

6

Under section 7201, the tax evasion statute, that

7

includes both a requirement or a finding of fraud and

8

deceit.

9

Section 7206 does not.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why isn't it obvious?

10

What proof would you need?

You submit a document

11

because you want to convey a false impression for

12

someone to act on.

13

more than that to establish deceit?

14

MR. WHALEN:

Why do you have to have anything

Because the requirements, Your

15

Honor, of 7206 is a finding of -- of simply making a

16

false statement.

17

when they go after a taxpayer because they have not

18

provided -- they have not disclosed all of their income,

19

the IRS comes in, or rather the Department of Justice,

20

and all they have to prove is that it's false.

21

don't have to prove --

That's all that's required.

Well, correct me if I'm

statute unless we have some gloss on, that if you think

indicating, would be a violation.

That's not the way I

Now, have we said something other than that in

13

MR. WHALEN:

If I may, Your Honor.

This

Court has written in the Spies case, and specifically in

15

the Bishop case, that in order to be convicted of any

16

tax offense under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS or

17

the Department of Justice must show it was done

18

willfully.

19

really intrinsic to all of the tax offenses.

20

"Willfully"

21

means that the IRS cannot bring a criminal information

22

or indictment against somebody who does something

23

unintentionally.

24

"Willfully," as this Court defined in Bishop, is simply

25

evidence that -- to commit any of these IRS crimes you

MR. WHALEN:

What's wrong with it, Your

22

Honor, is that what we're talking about is the

aggravated felony statute.

24

be a narrow one for this Court -- is whether the

25

conviction under 7206, which does not require anything

And the issue -- and it may

Alderson Reporting Company

1

more than filing of a false statement without any intent

2

to deceive or defraud -- whether that is an aggravated

3

felony.

4

is the elements of the offense that determines

5

aggravated felony.

And this Court has said time and again that it

6

If I may illustrate the point, if -- if a

7

conviction under 7206 was viewed by this Court as

8

including fraud and deceit for the reasons many of the

9

Justices have indicated, that, you know, that when

10

somebody writes a false tax return, it's got to be

11

deceit, what that does is that would collaterally estop

12

a taxpayer from denying fraud and deceit in the civil

13

collection action.

14

So, this is what Commissioner Walters was

15

concerned about, why he has filed his brief, that it in

16

effect would undermine the ability of the government to

17

get an easy conviction based simply on a false

18

statement.

19

Similarly, if you are convicted of tax

20

evasion, the -- the tax evader cannot challenge fraud.

21

He is collaterally estopped.

22

government goes to seek recovery -- that is, getting the

23

taxes back in a civil proceeding -- there's no statute

24

of limitations.

in the Internal Revenue Code section 6501, where if a

2

person is convicted under 7206 and the government seeks

3

to collect the unpaid taxes in an assessment proceeding,

4

Congress particularly said that where there's a

5

conviction under 7206, the government has the burden of

6

proving fraud, which seems to me to be evidence -- or

7

rather, the government has the -- a duty to prove there

9

the same.

But the conclusion is

10

If Congress had intended that proof of fraud

11

and deceit would be in 7206, there would be no reason at

12

all for Congress to put that in 70 -- 6501.

Therefore --

If you're going to rely on it, we

MR. WHALEN:

Yes.

I apologize for that,

Your Honor.

9

I would like to move to the second part of

10

my argument, if Your Honor please, that the -- this

11

Court has been very clear on deciding statutes invoking

12

canons of construction.

13

is that different words have different meanings.

14

And one of the important canons

So, in (M)(i), we have loss to victim or

15

victims in excess of $10,000, and in (M)(ii), we have a

16

revenue loss to the government in excess of 10,000.

17

as this Court said in Nijhawan, referring to (M)(ii),

18

this is the Internal Revenue provision, a correct

19

assessment I suggest, and that (M)(i) deals with

20

injuries or damage to third parties, not to the

21

government.

22

And

If you take the government's position that

23

fraud and deceit crimes are in -- fraud and deceit

24

revenue crimes are in (M)(i), then (M)(ii) would be

25

worthless or pointless.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why?

Because it

2

wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or

3

defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a

4

willful lie.

5

and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie.

6

It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing

7

postcards saying, I know I owe money; I'm just not -- I

8

just ain't gonna pay it.

9

there.

10

It would be adding to the -- to the fraud

There's no fraud and deceit

It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to

evade or defeat tax.

11

MR. WHALEN:

Well, anyone who leaves the

12

country with an intent to avoid tax is committing tax

13

evasion.

very point.

And that is -Without lying -- without

MR. WHALEN:

What I'm saying is that fraud,

20

such as you suggest, Your Honor, is going to be an

21

aggravated felony.

says -- only revenue offense, only offense under the

23

Internal Revenue Code which Congress designated as an

It's the only one that Congress

created a useless, pointless provision.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

it would not have been included within (M)(i).

5

no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it

13

One can do that by simply not report income, for

example.

15

example, by going to Cuba.

16

else?

And one can do that without lying.

Or in -- in Justice Breyer's more colorful

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. WHALEN:

Was it Cuba or somewhere

Well, the point I am trying to

19

make, Your Honor, is that if your example is an example

20

of fraud and deceit, which I agree it is, then a crime

21

of fraud and deceit would not be in (M)(i) because it

22

would be -- it would already be captured in (M)(i) if

23

the government's position was upheld.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the point that was

being made is not that it's fraud and deceit.
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Quite the

Official

opposite.

2

Justice Scalia have tried to get you to focus on the

3

evasion that involves no false statement at all, evading

4

payment where you say nothing.

5

if you simply don't pay your taxes, and you don't file a

6

return, so you are not filing anything that's false?

7

Where would that come in the Internal Revenue --

8

I think Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor,

9

MR. WHALEN:

That would be a violation of

one of the other Internal Revenue crimes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11

What would be the crime

Would it be evasion

simply not to report your income?

12

MR. WHALEN:

If the government chose to

13

prove that it was an attempt to evade the tax, it would.

14

The Internal Revenue's statute and crimes all carry the

15

duty to -- it's a legal duty we all have of fairly

16

reporting our income, our deductions, what have you.

17

It's the same legal duty whether it's in 7201 or 7206.

18

The difference is, in tax evasion, there

19

must be a proof of fraud or deceit.

That's inherent.

20

From the beginning of this country -- rather, beginning

21

of the tax statutes, Congress has always separated

22

revenue statutes from other crimes.

23

(M)(i) deals with crimes involving third parties;

24

(M)(ii) deals with revenue loss crimes to the

25

government.

In this case,

Only (i) is an aggravated felony.

7

Thank you, counsel.

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

Congress's specific reference to tax evasion

10

11

aggravated felony did not remove all other tax offenses

12

from the scope of subparagraph (M)(i).

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

that you can commit tax evasion without committing

15

either fraud or deceit, and are there cases that show

16

that?

17

MR. GANNON:

The cases that we cited in our

18

brief on page 34 that discuss this are ones that are

19

evasion of payment cases as opposed to evasion of

20

assessment cases.

21

which somebody could accurately file a tax return and

22

say I owe you this amount of money and then take steps

23

to prevent the IRS from collecting on it, usually by

24

removing their assets from the IRS's reach.

25

And those -- those are instances in

coins out of the country to take them to a Swiss bank,

4

they often don't mention that when they're leaving the

5

country.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about just not filing

a return?

8
9

If somebody's taking more than $10,000 in gold

MR. GANNON:

Just not filing a return is

probably not going to be enough to establish tax

10

evasion.

That would be an offense under 7203, which

11

doesn't necessarily involve fraud or deceit.

12

that distinguishes 7201 is the need for the government

13

to establish that there is an attempt to evade either

14

the assessment or payment of taxation.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The thing

I mean, I suppose what

16

confuses me is that when somebody is convicted of 7201,

17

they can't -- they're estopped from contesting a civil

18

fraud suit; isn't that right?

19

crime of moral turpitude, which involves fraud.

20

of those things suggest, and I think kind of the cases

21

as a whole suggest, that tax evasion involves fraud.

22

MR. GANNON:

And it also counts as a
And all

Well, certainly in the context

23

of the civil tax fraud penalty, the Tax Court has

24

concluded that intent to evade is synonymous with an

25

understatement due to fraud.

And the reason why it has

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

refused to reach that conclusion in the context of 7206

2

offenses, like the ones at issue in this case, is

3

because the 7206 offense does not require the government

4

to have proved that there was any understatement to

5

begin with.

6

understatement due to fraud.

7

And so, there could not have been an

I'd also note that it's not at all clear

8

that in the context of the evasion of payment cases that

9

I was just discussing in the context of tax evasion,

10

that the same civil tax fraud penalty would be

11

applicable there, because the civil tax fraud penalty is

12

triggered by an understatement of an amount required to

13

be shown on the return.

14

if it isn't actually something that's done in the

15

context of filing a tax return that understates how much

16

you owe the government, then -- then that may well not

17

trigger the collateral estoppel effect in the follow-on

18

civil case.

19
20
21

And, therefore, if it isn't --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost

always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was

thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that

is being super-careful about this; and yet, at the same

clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction

4

if you look at the context of the rest of paragraph

5

(43), the aggravated felony definition, you'll see that

6

there are several other provisions that have significant

7

overlap in them.

8

murder and rape; those would also generally be covered

9

in crimes of violence in subparagraph (F).

And so subparagraph (A) refers to

The same

10

thing is true in paragraph (E)(i); it pulls in various

11

explosives offenses including arson, destruction of

property or building by fire or explosives; that's the

reference to an 8441 --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, our rule of statutory

15

construction when it comes to this aggravated felony

16

statute is that superfluity doesn't matter?

17

MR. GANNON:

No, Justice Kagan, I think that

18

in context, there is a lot of overlap among the

19

different provisions in -- in paragraph (43) already,

20

and I -- I was also going to mention subparagraph (K)(i)

21

and (ii), which like (M)(i) and (M)(ii), are ones that

22

have little (i), which has a generic reference there to

23

offenses associated with managing a prostitution

24

business, and little (ii) then expressly refers to

25

certain enumerated Federal statutes, all of which
24

Alderson Reporting Company

involve transporting individuals for purposes of


2

prostitution in the case of seeking commercial


3

advantage.


4

And I think that virtually all of those


5

offenses would have been included within (K)(i), but

6

Congress wanted to be sure and, therefore, added

7

(K)(ii).

8

out before, textually it -- it had reason to think that

9

7206 would be picked up by fraud or deceit here in --

And as -- as Justice Breyer, I think, pointed

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

But 7206 is the lesser

11

offense.

12

that the heavier crime is the 7201 crime; that is,

13

evasion.

14

Congress picks out one tax crime and one tax crime only,

15

why wouldn't we assume that that's what Congress meant

16

with respect to aggravated felonies?

label.

MR. GANNON:

The reason why we don't think

that's appropriate is in part because, as I've

explained, there would -- there is some aspect of which

(M)(ii) is not superfluous.

25

don't think that the specific controls -- the general

But, more importantly, we

canon is triggered here, and we don't think that (M)(ii)

2

talks about a category of tax crimes or tax offenses

3

more generally, because it only refers to one offense.

4

And so, the cases that Petitioners invoke

5

here, in order to establish that there is a category

that's being pulled out of (M)(i), are HCSC-Laundry and

way that supports the definition that we're relying upon

3

But going back to the point that I was

4

trying to make about this not ruling out all tax

5

offenses, Justice Ginsburg, I think that the reference

6

to 7201 alone doesn't do that, nor do we think the fact

7

that Congress then added a limited -- limiting language

8

that said that when the revenue loss exceeds $10,000, it

would satisfy (M)(ii).

As a factual matter, can you point me to any cases that

do not involve affirmative acts of fraud?

6

MR. GANNON:

I don't believe that I can, but

7

I think that to the extent that the Court is looking to

8

the elements of the offense in 7201, if they're talking

9

about evasion of payment, that will not necessarily

10

require deceptive acts of concealment.

11

the reason --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so, that's

I know, but we have a very

13

active IRS, which prosecutes lots of tax cases, and

14

you're saying that it just never prosecutes tax cases

under this section that don't involve affirmative acts

16

of fraud.

19

Congress was so worried about this problem that it

20

ignored normal rules of statutory interpretation.

Well -- and I believe that the

22

reason that they were worried could be because of the

23

Scharton decision, in which this Court had already said

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it would have been

14

perfectly easy for Congress to write a provision which

15

said just in case that you -- you know, just in case

16

this decision called Scharton has any effect, we mean

17

tax evasion, too, without writing it in this way that

18

appears to exclude all other tax offenses.

19

MR. GANNON:

I don't see how -- if Congress

20

wanted to exclude all other tax offenses, I think they

21

should have put that exception in (M)(i).

22

have said offenses involving fraud or deceit, but not

23

tax offenses, in which the loss to the victim or victims

24

exceeds $10,000.

25

exception tax offenses --

They should

If Congress wanted to make an

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's just arguing

2

against our application of the normal rule of avoiding

3

superfluity where we can.

4

MR. GANNON:

Well, yes.

I agree that the

5

Court avoids superfluity where it can.

Here we have

6

contextual reasons to think that Congress was just

7

trying to add more offenses to the definition rather

8

than rule out an entire class.

9

there is no way to avoid the consequence of bifurcating

And I also think that

10

all of those other provisions under Petitioner's

11

reading.

12

And so, if you were to say that the

13

reference to 7201 pulls out all revenue loss offenses,

14

that would mean that some mail fraud cases against the

15

government in which the government loses more than

16

$10,000 count and some don't.

17

Same for false statements.

18

conspiracy to false claims, and Klein conspiracies under

19

section 371, which -- which are -- have a great deal of

20

overlap with 7201.

21
22

Same for false claims,

JUSTICE SCALIA:
Why?

They still wouldn't -- no.

They still wouldn't be tax offenses.

23

MR. GANNON:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Same for wire fraud.

Well, I -- they would be -I mean, you use the mail to

avoid -- still, what you're being prosecuted for is use
38

Alderson Reporting Company

of the mail to defraud.


2

MR. GANNON:

But the -- I mean, as I


3

understand Petitioner's argument, it is the fact that


4

(M)(ii) refers to revenue loss that is the thing that


5

makes it pull in or define a category of cases involving

6

tax offenses.

7

against the government involved taking -- getting more

8

than $10,000 worth of refunds from the government as

9

opposed to getting more than $10,000 in an ill-gotten

And I think that if a mail fraud offense

10

government contract or government benefits from the

11

government, that that could still be characterized as

12

revenue loss.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

it wrong.

He should have said -- just tax statutes are

MR. GANNON:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Well, he put it -- he put

Well, that -Then -- then you wouldn't

have to bifurcate, right?
MR. GANNON:

Then I just don't see how the

20

reference to a single provision of 7201 refers to all

21

other tax provisions --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's not just that.

23

It's -- it's also that -- that (M)(i) says loss to the

24

victim or victims.

25

the government has to exceed 10,000.

And (M)(ii) says the revenue loss to

39

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, in one

Official

1

case, it's the loss to the victim or victims.

2

why did it use parallel language?

3

say an offense that involves -- an offense in which the

4

loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000 and (i)

5

involves fraud or deceit or (ii) is described in section

6

7201 of Title 26?

7

seems to contrast loss to the victim or victims with

8

revenue loss to the government.

9

Why --

Why -- or why did it

I mean, if -- if you read it, it

And I find it hard to regard the government

10

as a victim in any of these cases, to tell you the

11

truth.

12

MR. GANNON:

Well, I -- none of the courts

13

of appeals has had any difficulty concluding that the

14

government is a victim when it loses more than $10,000

15

in a fraud case or, indeed, in a tax evasion case.

16

so, here, there is a different phrase, but I think

17

what's important is that 7201 doesn't define a class of

18

revenue loss offenses.

19

tax evasion offenses.

20

statute.

21

has to be a deficiency in order to -- for there to be a

22

7201 conviction, there must be a tax deficiency.

23

it's natural to talk about the relevant losses being

24

revenue loss to the government.

25

And

Instead, it defines a class of
It only refers to the one

And -- and then in that context, where there

Then

The phrase in (M)(i) is broader because it
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

also applies to other types of frauds.

2

the reference to 7201 alone doesn't indicate Congress is

3

intending to read out all tax offenses.

4

And I think that

As Justice Ginsburg mentioned before,

5

although 7201 has a 5-year maximum statutory penalty,

6

which is longer than the 3-year maximum that applies

7

under 7206 and some of the other tax offenses in that

8

particular chapter of Title 26, as a practical matter

9

the -- the sentencing guidelines use the same thing, the

10

-- the same criteria that are both tied to loss.

11

more importantly, a lot of these other offenses, like

12

371 and 1341 and 1343 in Title 18, actually have longer

13

maximum punishments.

14

And

So, if the government wants -- has a

15

particularly big fraud that they want to -- to get after

16

somebody who has a tax evasion case in which they've

17

cost the government a great deal of money, it may choose

18

to proceed under one of the other provisions where it

19

can get an even greater punishment.

20

referring to 7201 as the capstone I don't think allows

21

it to be a stand-in for all other tax offenses.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so, just

There's a technical

23

aspect of this case I don't understand.

Maybe you can

24

explain it.

25

the revenue loss in -- in the case of the wife.

There was a question about what might be

convicted of aiding and abetting.

3

MR. GANNON:

She's -- she's

She -- although it's -- the

4

statute itself refers to aiding, assisting, procuring,

5

or advising, it's not a traditional aiding and abetting

6

statute.

7

primary violation.

It doesn't require there to be an underlying

8
9

It's an independent offense.

And so, as it happens in this case, we all
know and it's not disputed that they're for the same

10

underlying false tax return, the same tax return that

11

ended in 1991 for one of the corporations that

12

Petitioners co-owned, but -- but we just didn't have

13

that evidence in the record.

14

And so, I think even though it's an aiding

15

and abetting, it's -- it's not a classic aiding and

16

abetting violation that depends on the husband's

17

conviction.

18

too, even if the husband didn't know anything about the

19

false numbers that she was providing him from the

20

restaurant that they were operating.

21

She could have been convicted under 7206,

So, if there are no further questions, we'd

22

urge the Court to affirm the court of appeals.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. WHALEN
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

2

MR. WHALEN:

My colleague mentioned the

3

Yermian case, which is in our brief, but I failed to

4

present it to the Court today.

5

important case decided by this Court, which said that

6

filing a false statement is not -- is not indicative,

7

not evidence, of an intent to deceive.

And it's a very

8

Similarly, the Harry Bridges case, as also

9

decided by this Court, said that -- and the Court held

10

that making a false statement about Mr. Bridges'

11

involvement with the Communist Party does not evidence

12

fraud.

13

And these cases, I believe, of this Court

14

control the issue that deceit or fraud is not an

15

essential element of this crime of conviction.

16

Following up what Justice Kagan has said or has asked,

17

that the rules -- canons of construction that the

18

Petitioner has invoked, the rules of superfluity --

19

against superfluity; the idea that the court must give

20

cognizance to different words mean different things;

21

that is, revenue loss from the government is different

22

from loss to a victim or victims; and the specific

23

versus the general.

24

The answer of the Government is simply

25

speculation and conjecture of, among other things,
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts make the wrong decisions; Congress didn't

2

understand that tax evasion does involve fraud; and,

3

therefore, it will be superfluous.

4

The position of the Government in this case

5

is simply that tax evasion may not be in 72 -- or may

6

not be in (M)(ii), the reason that -- rather, that fraud

7

and deceit may not be in tax evasion, but that a lesser

8

revenue offense is in (M)(i).

9

I would like to remind the Court, as many of

10

the Justices have indicated, that we're not looking at

11

an idea of someone who suffers a penalty because -- as a

12

result of the tax offense.

13

banishment.

14

the statute in which we're -- of which we're involved

15

should be read in favor -- where the Congress has not

16

been clear, the statute should be read in favor of the

17

immigrant.

18
19

We're talking about

And we're talking about deportation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Although it's not a

criminal statute?

20

MR. WHALEN:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

And

Pardon me, Your Honor.
It's not a criminal

statute.

23

MR. WHALEN:

This Court in the Fong case

24

said that the rule of lenity applies to an immigration

25

case.

And the holdings of this Court have been
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consistent that the rule of lenity applies to both

2

criminal cases as well as immigration cases.

3

invite the Court to look at the cases we have cited that

4

the rule of lenity has applied, in fact, to immigration

5

cases.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I

There -- there's one

7

technical feature, too, that I also didn't understand.

8

The particular tax here in question, the failure to

9

report was 76-some thousand dollars, but the number that

10

was given for the total failure to report is over

11

1 million, and the -- the loss to the IRS at -- is

12

245,000.

13

the failure to report 76,000.

Well, the 245,000 loss must refer to more than

14
15

MR. WHALEN:

The threshold amount is not an

issue in the case.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'd just like to know how

17

we got -- how the 245,000 revenue loss was calculated,

18

given that the crime that was charged, the failure was

19

to report only 76,000?
MR. WHALEN:

20

I don't know.

It was in

21

negotiations between the government and the Kawashimas.

22

In any compromise, the government chose only to charge

23

them with a crime under 7206, which -- and to settle on

24

that basis.

25

Padilla case quite emphatically, that attorneys

As Justice Alito has mentioned in the

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

representing immigrants deal with the government in

2

order to avoid deportation.

3

whether the Kawashimas in fact had filed false returns

4

in an attempt to deceive, that was by the boards,

5

because the government and the taxpayer agreed that

6

their offense would be solely 7206, which as you read

7

the elements -- and you can read the Justice Department

8

handbook which tells you what the elements are, and it

9

does not include fraud and deceit.

And that -- in this case

If there are no further questions, I --

10
11

finally, I would like to mention one case which hasn't

12

been brought up, which evolved from the questions by the

13

Justices, and that is a Third Circuit case which we

14

cited, Nugent, mentioned in response to Justice Breyer's

15

question, that the Nugent case said that you must

16

fulfill both elements, that is perjury, (S) under the

17

statute, and if it's included in fraud and deceit, you

18

must fulfill the elements of both crimes at issue.

19

And, of course, in this case, the Kawashimas

20

did not -- were imprisoned for 4 months and did not meet

21

the statutory requirement for an aggravated felony of 1

22

year.

23

But in any event, I want -- I would like the

24

Court to keep in mind that what we are dealing here with

25

is perjury, and we're not dealing with fraud or deceit,
46

Alderson Reporting Company

as agreed to by the government and the taxpayer.

And

2

that, I suggest to the Court, should be dispositive in

the decision in this case.
