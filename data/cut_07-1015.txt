ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

GENERAL GARRE:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case concerns the qualified immunity of

12

high-ranking government officials, like the Attorney

13

General of the United States and Director of the FBI,

14

and supervisory liability claims under Bivens based on

15

the alleged wrongdoing of much lower level officials.

16

In concluding that the complaint in this

17

case was sufficient to subject the high-ranking

18

officials, like the Attorney General, to the demands of

19

civil discovery, the court of appeals erred in two

20

fundamental and interrelated respects.

21

First, the court erred in concluding that

22

the complaint stated a violation of clearly established

23

rights by the former Attorney General and Director of

24

the FBI, because under this Court's precedents the

25

complaint fails adequately to plead the personal
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

involvement of those high-ranking officials for the

2

alleged discriminatory acts of lower level officials.

3

And, second --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Garre, will you

5

clarify one point?

6

overcome qualified immunity.

7

pleading is analyzed discretely.

8

motion, is it?

9
10

You said "fails to state" enough to

GENERAL GARRE:

But, usually, these -- the
This is a 12(b)(6)

It is a 12(b)(6) motion.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so that tests just

11

the pleading.

Qualified immunity is an affirmative

12

defense which hasn't even been stated formally.

13

isn't it entirely conceivable that you could have a good

14

complaint judged from the 12(b)(6) point of view, but

15

when the qualified immunity defense is asserted, the

16

plaintiff isn't able to come up with enough to stave off

17

a summary judgment motion?

18

GENERAL GARRE:

So

No, for two reasons,

19

Justice Ginsburg.

The first is that this Court has

20

recognized that a defense can be a basis for a motion to

21

dismiss under 12(b)(6).

It did so most recently in the

22

Jones versus Bock case.

And -- and it's established

23

practice in the Federal courts, in part because of this

24

decision, that appeals from the denial of a motion to

25

dismiss on the ground of qualified immunity are
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appropriate.

2

And, second, as the Second Circuit

3

recognized -- and we think it got this right -- the

4

question of whether a complaint adequately pleads the

5

personal involvement of government officials goes

6

directly to the question of qualified immunity -- and

7

the court of appeals said that on page 14a of its

8

decision -- because it goes to the question of whether

9

these defendants have violated any clearly established

10
11

rights.
And so the question of supervisory liability

12

in this case we think is essential to the question of

13

whether or not the Attorney General and Director of the

14

FBI are entitled to qualified immunity.

15

the government's -- the Petitioner's motion to dismiss

16

on the ground of qualified immunity, the district court

17

erroneously deprived these Petitioners of the

18

protections of that important defense.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And in denying

Well, Mr. Garre, isn't

20

there more involved here than simply derivative

21

liability for the acts of others?

22

of excerpts from the complaint, but let me just go to

23

one, on section -- paragraph, rather, 97.

24

the defendants Ashcroft and Mueller with willfully and

25

maliciously designing a policy.

I -- I've got a bunch

That charges

It doesn't sound like

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

respondeat superior.

2

them directly with coming up with what these people are

3

complaining about.

4

I mean, it seems to -- to charge

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, I think that that's

5

fair, Justice Souter.

I mean, I think that there are

6

two general types of allegations in this complaint.

7

set of allegations says that Petitioners came up with

8

this policy, and if you look at those allegations -- and

9

I think I would point you to paragraph 69 and paragraphs

One

10

10 and 11 -- those allegations we think describe a

11

policy which is neutral on its face, a policy of holding

12

persons determined by the FBI to be of interest in

13

connection with a terribly important investigation until

14

they have been cleared.

15

And so we think that those allegations can't

16

be enough to sustain these -- to subject these

17

Petitioners to -- to civil discovery.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, why don't -- may I

19

just interrupt you there?

Why don't you think the

20

reference here in the language I just read, to designing

21

a policy, includes the policy which is several times

22

described as being one which called for holding -- for

23

Arab Muslim men of certain countries of origin without

24

reference to any penal purpose?

25

that is adequately described in there as part of the

I mean, that -- I think

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

policy.
GENERAL GARRE:

I think if you look at the

3

complaint, that -- that interpretation doesn't hold up.

4

And in particular, I would point you to paragraph 48,

5

which is on page 164a of the joint appendix -- I'm

6

sorry, the petition appendix.

7

says is that these allegedly discriminatory

8

determinations, classifications, were made by FBI

9

officials in the field, not Petitioners here, the former

And what that paragraph

10

Attorney General and director of the FBI.

11

importantly, these determinations were made, quote, and

12

this comes from paragraph 48, "without specific criteria

13

or uniform classification system."

14

And

And so that's what's going on here.

You've

15

got a complaint that alleges that specific lower level

16

officials are making these determinations.

17

paragraphs 50 and 51.

18

that these determinations are being made on the basis of

19

ad hoc criteria.

20

these overarching allegations that the Attorney General

21

and the Director of the FBI knew about, approved, and

22

condoned these discriminatory conduct of much lower

23

level officials.

24
25

That's in

You've got a complaint alleging

That's page 48.

And then you have

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't -- you

don't dispute that, whatever the policy was, that it was
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

approved and condoned by the Attorney General and the

2

Director of the FBI?

3

GENERAL GARRE:

We've accepted that at some

4

level that this complaint maintains, and it's in

5

paragraph 69, that there was a policy of holding

6

suspects until they -- the suspects were determined to

7

be of interest by the FBI, until they were cleared by

8

the FBI in connection with this investigation.

9

policy we have not disputed, and that policy we think is

That

10

a -- is a factually neutral, perfectly lawful law

11

enforcement response to the 9/11 attacks, resulting in

12

--

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it may -- it

14

may very well be, but isn't it, for purposes of a

15

complaint, sufficient to raise a due process claim by

16

saying what they say?

17

have a very good defense to it.

18

that does not ever get beyond -- get them beyond the

19

point of summary judgment.

20

charge that there was a policy in which they picked up

21

people and they held them until they were cleared, i.e.,

22

sort of demonstrated to be innocent in some way, that at

23

least on the face of it seems to -- to state a due

24

process problem under the Fifth Amendment, doesn't it?

25

In other words, you -- you may

GENERAL GARRE:

You may have something

But for them simply to

Not with respect to the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Petitioners here, the former Attorney General and the

2

Director of the FBI, because -- and I think in

3

evaluating --

4
5
6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Even -- even if, as the

Chief Justice said, they knew and condoned the policy?
GENERAL GARRE:

Well, the question is which

7

policy, what policy?

8

I think the only policy that the allegations bear out

9

with respect to the Attorney General and the Director of

10

the FBI is a policy described in paragraph 69 of holding

11

suspects until cleared.

12

And if you look at the complaint,

The --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you may be -- you --

13

I mean, you may be right.

14

lot of tension in the -- in the allegations here.

15

I grant you that.

16

those tensions at this stage to file a motion for a more

17

definite statement and find out for sure?

18

I think there's -- there's a
I --

But isn't the proper way to deal with

GENERAL GARRE:

No.

I mean, certainly that

19

is one option.

I mean, the Court mentioned that in the

20

Crawford-El case, and that's an option.

21

the Bell Atlantic case, where that was an option, too,

22

and where the defendants in that case did not avail

23

themselves of their opportunity to file a motion for a

24

more definite statement, the Petitioners here did not do

25

so and they were not required to do so.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

But just as in

They had a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different option under the Federal Rules of Civil

2

Procedure to move for dismissal under 12(b)(6).

3

exercised that option, and the complaint -- the

4

complaint should be dismissed because it fails to state

5

a claim against those individuals.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They

The difference, it -- and

7

maybe this isn't a sufficient difference.

But the

8

difference in my mind between this and Bell Atlantic was

9

that, in Bell Atlantic you had a set of allegations in

10

which in -- in effect it was an either-or choice.

11

were two possibilities consistent with the allegations

12

in Bell Atlantic.

13

was a -- a lawful parallel conduct possibility.

14

there just wasn't any way to pick one as being a more

15

probable interpretation of what they were getting at.

16

There

One was a conspiracy possibility; one
And

Here the problem is not so much an either-

17

or choice as to which we are clueless, but a just

18

vagueness or uncertainty.

19

about the -- the racial criterion go to the policy as

20

devised or the policy as implemented?

21

it seems to me that here we're -- we're in a kind of

22

conceptually a squishier situation and it might be

23

better to get a more definite statement than to say,

24

well, you -- you've got to make a choice, and there's no

25

way to make a choice.

Does the -- Does the talk

10
Alderson Reporting Company

And so on.

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

GENERAL GARRE:

That's one of the reasons

2

why I think it's important to distinguish between the

3

different sets of claims.

4

a policy of holding suspects until cleared is much more

5

like the Bell Atlantic situation, where you have got

6

factually neutral allegations, perfectly lawful law

7

enforcement conduct to have a policy that says, FBI

8

agents, if you determine these people are of interest,

9

hold them until they are cleared so that we are not

I think the general claim of

10

releasing people that are potentially suspects or

11

wrongdoers in this investigation.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Garre, I think

13

that the Bell Atlantic case -- and -- and I'm sure that

14

Justice Souter will correct me if I'm wrong about this,

15

but most of it is about what it takes -- what are the

16

essential elements of a Sherman section 1 charge.

17

there's a big mistake that the pleaders are making; that

18

is, there has to be an agreement, and they haven't

19

alleged an agreement.

20

This case seems to be quite different.

And

And

21

I think you have taken Bell Atlantic, frankly, for more

22

than is there.

23

opinion, the Court says, we are not developing any

24

heightened pleading rules.

25

it was yesterday.

That is, twice -- at least twice in the

Form 11 is as good today as

What we are talking about is a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

missing -- is an essential element to a substantive

2

claim for relief.

3

I thought that's what --

GENERAL GARRE:

And we're not asking for a

4

heightened pleading standard, Justice Ginsburg.

5

what's missing here fundamentally is a substantive

6

requirement of the cause of action -- Bivens -- for

7

supervisory liability which is an affirmative link.

8

Subsidiary allegations suggesting a plausible

9

affirmative link between the discriminatory actions

10

allegedly taken by much lower level officials in the

11

field and the Director of the FBI and the Attorney

12

General of the United States.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think

That -- that sounds

14

like an argument on the merits of the Bivens claim,

15

rather than an argument going to qualified immunity.

16

GENERAL GARRE:

It -- it's not -- I mean, in

17

-- in a similar way that this Court considered the scope

18

of a Bivens cause of action in the Wilkie case recently

19

and in the Hartman case recently.

20

cases the Court recognized that the scope of the Bivens

21

cause of action goes directly to the question of

22

qualified immunity.

23

In both of those

And here, in order to evaluate whether the

24

pleadings are adequate against the Attorney General and

25

the Director of the FBI, you have to know what the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

substantive standard under Bivens is for a supervisory

2

liability type claim.

3

did in Bell Atlantic, you had to know the substantive

4

standard of antitrust law in this kind of context.

5

you have to know the substantive standard of what's

6

required to subject the Attorney General of the United

7

States or the Director of the FBI to potential

8

liability, civil damages, burdens of civil discovery,

9

for supervisory liability for the claims of much lower

10

You have to know -- just as you

level officials.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

How does -- how does this

12

work in an ordinary case?

13

this, but I don't.

14

Jones sues the president of Coca-Cola.

15

has no reason for thinking that.

2

GENERAL GARRE:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where does it say that in

GENERAL GARRE:

It -- it says that, as this

4

And I think it would be --

the rules?

5
6

Court interpreted it, in Rule 8 of the rules, Justice

7

Breyer.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

GENERAL GARRE:

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

In Rule 8?
Yes, because in Rule 8 -I thought Rule 8 was move

for a more definite statement.

12

GENERAL GARRE:

No.

Rule 8 is the -- is the

13

plain statement showing entitlement to relief.

14

the rule interpreted in Bell Atlantic, and there the

15

Bell Atlantic Court said that the plaintiff had the

16

obligation to show a plausible entitlement to relief.

17

And --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is

He shows a plausible

19

entitlement.

He says -- there's no doubt it's a claim

20

if the president of Coca-Cola did put the mouse in the

21

bottle.

It's just there is no basis for thinking that.

GENERAL GARRE:

25

right out of the rules.

It's -So he wants to go to the

Now, what allows

the judge to stop this deposition?

2
3

GENERAL GARRE:

Rule 8 does, as interpreted

--

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

GENERAL GARRE:

Where?
-- in Bell Atlantic, because

6

that is not a plausible entitlement of a claim to relief

7

--

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But, Mr. Garre, you are

using the word "plausible" or you're taking the word

10

"plausible" out of Bell Atlantic, I think, and you are

11

using it to mean something that probably can be proven

12

to be true.

13

-- the plausibility there is a plausibility that if they

14

prove what they say, they will -- they will establish a

15

violation.

16

Bell Atlantic drew that distinction.

GENERAL GARRE:

They

I certainly agree with you.

17

You don't have to show that it probably is, but you have

18

to show facts suggesting -- above the speculative level.

19

And just as in Bell Atlantic --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

I -- I think you are

21

right that if somebody makes just a totally bizarre

22

allegation that nobody in the world could take

23

seriously, that -- that the issue can be raised.

24
25

But in Justice Breyer's case, the -- that -that may be the case if the claim is that the president
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of Coke was -- was personally putting mouses in bottles.

2

But the claim, it seems to me, that the Attorney General

3

or the Director of the FBI was establishing a policy of

4

no release until cleared or a policy that centered on

5

people with the same characteristics as the hijackers

6

does not have that kind of bizarre character to it and,

7

I think, would not run afoul of the -- of the

8

plausibility standard.

9

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, we certainly think --

10

I mean, in Bell Atlantic, the Court said common economic

11

experience would -- would support its determination in

12

that case.

13

by former attorney generals from several different

14

administrations makes this point as well, that common

15

government experience would suggest that the Attorney

16

General of the United States is not involved in the sort

17

of microscopic decisions --

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We think here, and I think the brief filed

Well, I would agree, but

19

this is about as far from common government operation as

20

one can get.

21

GENERAL GARRE:

The -- and I think that gets

22

to one of the fundamental problems with the Second

23

Circuit decision, is it held the extraordinary context

24

of the 9/11 attacks and the aftermath of those attacks

25

against the Petitioners in this case.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

And that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

problematic, not only from the qualified-immunity

2

perspective of what it's going to be like for officials

3

next time they have to --

4
5

JUSTICE SOUTER:
can't --

6
7

GENERAL GARRE:

-- deal with something like

that.

8
9

Oh, I know, but the courts

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The courts can't ignore the

extraordinary circumstances, either.

10

GENERAL GARRE:

But it's problematic because

11

you have to look at the reality of the job of the

12

Attorney General of the United States and the Director

13

of the FBI.

14

responsible not only for the litigating divisions within

15

the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of

16

Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency, enforcing

17

countless laws.

18

extraordinarily busy schedules.

19

In general, these are people who are

These are people who have

have the answer to my question.

I must not have said it

properly.

ago.

24

whatever reasons, the plaintiffs included allegations

25

that were just factually very unlikely.

Imagine, way before Twombly -- these rules
So we go back years

Certainly, there have been many cases where, for

17
Alderson Reporting Company

I want to know

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where the judge has the power to control discovery in

2

the rules.

remember my civil procedure course.

taught on day 4.

That's -- I should know that.

(Laughter.)

GENERAL GARRE:

discovery, Justice Breyer.

8

I can't

Probably, it was

Well, Rule 26 governs

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I see that.

It says

9

a person has a right to go and get discovery.

10

doesn't say they only control it under certain

11

provisions which don't seem to me to apply to the truly

12

absurd discovery.

13

It

There must be some power a judge has.

And the second question I'm going to ask

14

you, when you tell me what that power is, which

15

apparently I'm not going to find out -- but -- but

16

whatever that power is, which must be there, why doesn't

17

that work to solve your problem?

18

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, the power to -- to

19

govern discovery doesn't solve the problem for the same

20

reason that it didn't in Bell Atlantic.

21

specifically said we are not going to rely on district

22

courts to weed out potentially meritless claims because

23

we recognize the burdens that discovery can impose in

24

the civil and in trust contexts.

25

multiplied many times here where you are talking about

The Court

And those burdens are

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

subjecting to -- subjecting high level government

2

official to the burdens of civil discovery.

3

I think fundamentally we think you don't get

4

to the question of how do district judges control

5

discovery, because they haven't gotten through the

6

gateway of pleading an adequate claim.

7

give you the substantive rule that we think is on point

8

here -- this Court, in the Rizzo case, which is a

9

section 1983 case, considered the question of claims

And if I can

against high-ranking officials, the Mayor of the City of

Philadelphia, for alleged wrongdoing by individual

13

police officers there.

14

And there -- in that case, the Court held

15

that a plaintiff under section 1983 has to establish, as

16

a matter of law, an affirmative link between the acts of

17

the -- the subordinates and the higher-level officials.

18

And we think that that substantive rule in section 1983

19

at a minimum carries over to the Bivens context.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what -- I mean, my

those sorts of claims where the court --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, Mr. Garre, it seems

17

to me you are really arguing -- I am very sympathetic to

18

the argument -- that if there was no plausible claim in

19

Bell Atlantic, in which there was a direct allegation of

20

a conspiracy in violation of section 1, was rejected

21

because the Court thought it implausible, a fortiori

22

this claim is implausible because it's got exactly the

23

same problems in that you don't want to subject these

24

important people to all the inconvenience of discovery.

It seems to me these cases are very, very similar.

GENERAL GARRE:

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

And certainly that's our position.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We think it's --

Of course, in both of the

4

cases, the job of the district judge would have been

5

made much easier if one of the defendants had filed an

6

affidavit denying those allegations, but nobody has done

7

that in either case.

8
9

GENERAL GARRE:

No one did it in either

case, but in both cases the defendants are entitled to

10

dismissal.

I think this case is even stronger, not only

11

because we think that the factual allegations are less

12

plausible, but because we have the substantive rule of

13

law that comes from Bivens, that you have to establish

14

the affirmative link of alleged wrongdoing between much

15

lower level officials, the FBI agents in the field here.

16

And the Attorney General of the United States and the

17

Director of the FBI, common experience shows, simply

18

aren't involved in those sorts of granular decisions.

that the court erred in saying that there was a -- a

GENERAL GARRE:

And --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I wanted to reach the

3

second, and I was wondering if the second would address

4

this sub-question that I have.

5

Twombly is to be confined to the antitrust and

6

commercial context, would -- would that destroy your

7

case?

8
9

GENERAL GARRE:
those questions:

If we were to say that

Well, let me answer both

First, the second point I wanted to

10

add is interrelated with the first, and that's that the

11

court of appeals applied an overly expansive conception

12

of the supervisory liabilities available under Bivens.

13

And, I think, in order to evaluate the adequacy of the

14

pleadings, this Court has to have in mind the standards

15

of supervisory liability that Bivens applied.

16

think the that court of appeals applied an overly

17

expansive concept of that under Rizzo and other -- the

18

other precedents we cite in our case.

19

And second:

And we

No, our case would not go away

20

if this Court got rid of Bell Atlantic or if this Court

21

limited Bell Atlantic to the antitrust context.

22

don't think the Court should do that.

23

dispensed -- disavowed the broad no-set-of-facts

24

language from Conley v. Gibson, we took the Court to be

25

saying:

We

When the Court

We are disavowing that for all cases under Rule
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8; we are not limiting it to parallel conduct in the

2

section 1 of the Sherman Act context.

3

So I think that Bell Atlantic's explication

4

of Rule 8 and the disavowal of the no-set-of-facts

5

language, which, after all, is the test under which the

6

district court had to resort to, to sustain the claims

lingering doubts as Justice -- or concerns or questions

to wait for Twombly in order to have this, and it seems

12

to me Rule 11 is not applicable here because it simply

13

works after the fact.

14

It's hard for me to believe we had

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, we don't think you had

15

to wait for Twombly to get rid of those claims.

We

16

think that many of those claims would dismiss.

They

17

certainly would have been dismissed in the section 1983

18

context under this Court's decision in Rizzo.

19

And we could talk about what it would be

20

like for claims against the president of Coca-Cola or

21

Ford Motor Company, but really we're here talking about

22

claims against the highest level officials of our

23

government, who everyone agrees are entitled to the

24

doctrine of qualified immunity, a doctrine that was

25

designed, at the end of the day, to protect the

officials are entitled at least to the protections that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

These

General Garre, there was

6

a reference, I think, in Judge Gleason's decision in the

7

report on the detainees' treatment at the Metropolitan

9

Detention Center.

10
11

Is there nothing in those reports

that lends some plausibility to Iqbal's claims?
GENERAL GARRE:

We don't think so,

12

Justice Ginsburg.

13

extra-record materials, extra-complaint materials can't

14

make up for the deficiencies in the complaint itself.

15

Plaintiffs had the benefit of that 200-page report when

16

they brought their action in this case.

They have
And so, in that

And, secondly, if you look at that report,

21

if you want to go outside the record and look at that

22

report, I would urge you to look at page 70 of the

23

report, which says that "we found" -- and I am quoting

24

from the report -- "we found that the information

25

provided to high-level officials suggested this 'hold

Alderson Reporting Company

2

'suspected of being involved in the'" 9/11 attacks, a

3

perfectly lawful law enforcement program.

4

on to say that "in practice the policy may have been

5

applied differently in the field. "

And it goes

6

And the other pages I would point you to are

7

pages 18, 40, 47, and 158, which make clear that this --

8

the alleged discriminatory acts were -- were taken on an

9

ad hoc basis.

That's what the complaint in this case

10

says on page 48, where it says that FBI officials, far

11

removed from the Attorney General and the Director of

12

the FBI, were making these determinations without

13

criteria, without a uniform classification system.

14

And we think that to go back up the chain to

15

suggest that the Attorney General of the United States

16

and Director of the FBI may be potentially subject to

17

civil liability, the burdens of civil litigation goes

18

far beyond Rule 8 as it's described in Bell Atlantic,

19

far beyond this Court's qualified immunity cases.

MR. REINERT:

Thank you, General.

Thank you.
Mr. Reinert.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

24

I think I should start with paragraph 69 of

25

the complaint because I think Petitioners' treatment of
28
Alderson Reporting Company

1

paragraph 69 shows why they have no coherent theory of

2

what a conclusory allegation is and what it's not.

3

Because what does paragraph 69 do?

4

policy, and it says that Petitioners approved the

5

policy.

6

Paragraph 69 you can find at 168 of the appendix;

7

paragraph 96 you can find at 172 to 173.

Paragraph 96 does exactly the same thing.

It sets out a

Now,

10

Petitioners here conceded at oral argument, contrary to

11

their reply brief but consistent with their opening

brief, that paragraph 69 states a factual allegation.

13

So if paragraph 69 states a factual allegation that is

14

entitled to be considered true, then paragraph 96 states

15

a factual allegation that is entitled to be considered

16

to be true.

MR. REINERT:

there's no reference to that in the rules.

We think

Do you -- do you

established that the level of pleading required depends

16

on the context of the claim -- the context of the

particular case?

MR. REINERT:

I don't -- I don't understand

Bell Atlantic to argue that the level of pleading

the substantive liability that is in the background of

I want to throw you a

I'm not sure it's a softball question.

You

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

I -- I'm starting with the assumption, which

You can let me know.

13

I think is -- is in Bell Atlantic, that what we are

14

concerned with in context is that the -- the context

15

tells us how specific you've got to be versus how

16

conclusory you've got to be, and the reason it does so

17

is that some allegations are -- are more likely to be

18

true than others depending on the context.

19

Is it fair to say -- going back to Justice

20

Breyer's question, is it fair to say that your basic

21

pleading here rests on the following assumption:

22

it is more plausible that the Attorney General of the

23

United States and the Director of the FBI were in fact

24

directly involved in devising a policy with the racial

25

characteristics and the coercive characteristics that
40
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you claim, than that the President of Coca Cola was

2

putting mouses in bottles?

3

MR. REINERT:

Well, I think that -- I think

4

that is our -- our contention, Your Honor, because it's

5

a -- it's an allegation about a policy.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you would say, if -- to

7

the Coke question you would say, yes, they've got to get

8

more facts there, this is just -- this is just crazy to

9

think that the president is putting mice in the bottles.

10

But you're saying that, so far as the close

11

involvement of the Attorney General and the FBI

12

director, it's not crazy to assume what you -- what you

13

say, and, therefore, you don't have to get into more

14

detail in order to have an adequate claim here.

15

that --

16

MR. REINERT:

Is

We certainly don't think it's

17

absurd or bizarre, which is the argument that the

18

Petitioners raised below --

19
20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's also not

the --

21

MR. REINERT:

I'm sorry.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Absurd and bizarre

23

is also not the pleading standard, and how are we -- to

24

follow up on Justice Souter's question -- how are we

25

supposed to judge whether we think it's more unlikely
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the president of Coca-Cola would take certain

2

actions as opposed to the Attorney General of the United

3

States?

4

MR. REINERT:

I think it is a problem posed

5

by that interpretation of Bell Atlantic.

6

it's a problem that's posed by this particular case, Mr.

7

Chief Justice.

8
9

I don't think

I think --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, the problem

with the president of the Coca-Cola is the allegation

10

probably would be that the Coca-Cola Company has adopted

11

sloppy procedures in its manufacturing lines, and the

12

president is responsible for those procedures, and

13

that's why the bottles are filled with rats.

14

MR. REINERT:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

allege it.

Well --

You wouldn't say he did it personally.

17

MR. REINERT:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19
20

That's the way you would

Well, Justice Stevens -And then you would have a

similar question.
MR. REINERT:

You probably wouldn't say he

21

did it personally, and there might be a respondeat

22

superior theory there, for liability, that we don't have

23

access to in the Bivens arena, which we concede; we have

24

to establish a link between the unconstitutional conduct

25

and -- and the actions of the Petitioners.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

So that may

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be how it's pleaded, and that might get it closer if

2

there were -- certainly if there were a policy of

3

putting mice in Coke bottles, that would certainly get

4

it closer.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, this is a policy of

6

being derelict in the sanitary conditions in the plant

7

and so forth and so on; therefore, mice -- mice are

8

getting into bottles with undue frequency, and the

9

president is responsible for that.

10

that's a fanciful allegation.

11
12

MR. REINERT:

It -- I -- I don't know that

it is fanciful, Justice Stevens.

13
14

JUSTICE STEVENS:
Coca-Cola really does that.
MR. REINERT:

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

I think --

I'm not suggesting that
Of course not, but --

15

18

I don't see that

No, certainly not.

But the standard theory is

that -MR. REINERT:

I think -- I mean, the

20

essential point in this case is that the Second Circuit

21

was faced with a dilemma.

22

pleading standard and there's qualified immunity.

23

the Second Circuit tried to resolve it, did I think a

24

very good job of resolving it with the interests -- all

25

of the interests that Petitioners are concerned about.

I mean, there's a liberal

43
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

They were --

2
3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they weren't "all"

completely -- they were not --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was just going to

5

say the -- the difficulty with wrestling with the case

6

through the perspective of the hypothetical of the mice

7

in the bottles is that it's -- it's by its nature

8

particularly absurd, but what if the allegation is that

9

the president of Coca Cola is individually involved in a

10

particular price-fixing scheme?

11

seem so terribly different from the level of specificity

12

Bell Atlantic would require?

13

MR. REINERT:

Then does this case

Well, I guess I want to

14

distinguish that allegation from the allegations here.

15

We are not alleging that the Petitioners individually

16

identified particular detainees as of interest or as of

17

high interest.

18

the policy or they knew of and approved of it.

19

We are alleging that they either created

Now -- now, we could talk about "knew of and

20

approved."

21

established by a saying that they knew it; we can't read

22

9(b) any other way, and Petitioners don't suggest that

23

we do.

24
25

As I said, under Rule 9(b), "knew of" is

So then we have "approved."

Now, if they

knew it, right, if we accept that they knew about this
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

policy, and we also accept paragraph 69 as Petitioners

2

concede we must accept it to be true, then we know that

3

they knew that there was this policy occurring and they

4

approved the policy of not releasing them --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's easy.

6

hope that the Attorney General and the Director of FBI

7

-- of the FBI knew of and approved whatever the policy

8

was.

9

what you have to allege are some facts, showing that

I

10

What you have to show is some facts, or at least

they knew of a policy that was discriminatory --

11

MR. REINERT:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13
14

Yes.
-- based on

ethnicity and country of origin.
MR. REINERT:

And I think I was -- I was

15

trying to get there, Mr. Chief Justice, and the way I

16

would say it is this:

17

paragraph 96, that the policy was discriminatory.

18

That's clearly alleged in paragraph 96.

19

alleged that they approved the policy.

20

We've alleged that they knew, in

We've also

The link -- to the extent that approval is

21

not sufficient for this Court, the link between approval

22

in 96 and an allegation is paragraph 69, because if they

23

knew that these individuals were being detained in

24

restrictive conditions of confinement because of their

25

race, religion, and national origin, as we alleged in
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

96, and they also approved that they should not be

2

released until cleared, then they are approving them

3

being held in restrictive conditions of confinement

4

based upon race, religion, and national origin.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but they didn't -- that

6

isn't what 96 says.

What 96 says, which I think is

7

important, is it says that they knew of and agreed to

8

subject the plaintiffs to these harsh conditions solely

9

on account of their religion, race, and national origin,

10

and for no legitimate penological interest.

11

they are looking for suspects from 9/11, given the

12

people they found, it's not surprising that they might

13

look for people who looked like Arabs.

14

isn't surprising to me, because that was what the

15

suspects looked like.

16

Because, if

All right?

That

So, they want to say, yes, that was part of

17

it, but it's not for no legitimate penological interest;

18

it was for every good reason:

19

to go off.

We didn't want more bombs

20

Now, suppose that's their view.

Suppose

21

also -- I'm just hypothetically -- they never, and they

22

know this, ever had a conversation where they said, go

23

look for people of Arabic descent alone.

24

said that.

25

other connections and had something we reasonably

They never

They said, look for those people who have

believe is 9/11-connected; they might be dangerous.

2

Suppose that's what they thought.

3

and they think, Judge, I want to tell Judge that you

4

have no evidence to show anything other than what I just

5

said, which sounds as if it might be reasonably

6

connected to the 9/11 investigation.

7

our two defendants, if you win this case?

8

right, how do they prevent lots of depositions from

9

coming in and taking their time?

So they read this,

13

are the facts, then those are facts that have to be

Now, at the pleading stage, if they don't

want to file an answer and deny the facts, they can move

to dismiss on qualified-immunity grounds as they have.

They'll -- they'll deny the

22

facts; then you'll say there's a factual matter.

have no reason at all hypothetically, imagine, for

We don't get to drag them through

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just interrupt?

14

There are a whole bunch of other defendants in this

15

case.

As I understand it, they're still in the case.

16

MR. REINERT:

That's correct.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you do have discovery

18

of maybe 25 to 30 officials who would have a lot of

19

information about this case.

20

entirely possible that you could either postpone

21

discovery and dismiss the two principal defendants for

22

now and then bring them in later, if the facts you

23

develop from the other discovery would prove what you

24

have alleged.

25

MR. REINERT:

It seems to me it's

Well, as to postponing
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discovery, that's exactly what the Second Circuit

2

directed the district court to do.

3

Your Honor.

4

So that's been done,

As to dismissing them and re-filing later,

5

the problem with that is there could be a statute of

6

limitations problem, and that -- so that's just not a

7

solution.

8

might result ultimately in absolute immunity in these

9

kinds of cases.

I mean, that's -- that was a solution that

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

limitations that would apply?

12

MR. REINERT:

What is the statute of

It's 3 years here, Your Honor.

13

And so we've -- we've obtained discovery.

had discovery from the Attorney General or --

MR. REINERT:

Certainly not.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. REINERT:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So --

Certainly not.
So it's -- it's as though

21

discovery with respect to those two defendants was

22

stayed pending your discovery from the lower level

23

defendants?

24
25

MR. REINERT:

In fact, it has been formally

stayed, Justice Ginsburg -49

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. REINERT:

decision confirms that.

4

Has it?

And the Second Circuit's
I mean, the --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that may be what

5

happened here, but if -- if the Second Circuit is

6

affirmed, there may be other suits that are like this.

7

And what is the protection of the high-level official

8

with qualified immunity with respect to discovery if the

9

-- the official cannot get dismissal under qualified

10

immunity at the 12(b)(6) stage?

How many district

11

judges are there in the country?

12

district judges has a very aggressive idea about what

13

the discovery should be.

14

MR. REINERT:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Over 600?

One of the

What's the protection there?
Well, if this Court -It's a discretionary

decision, interlocutory discretionary decision by the

trial judge.

18

MR. REINERT:

Well, if -- Justice Alito, if

19

this Court in affirming the Second Circuit outlines and

20

says the Second Circuit took the proper steps -- this is

21

what the district court should do -- then if any

22

district court disregards that, then there could be a

23

petition for mandamus.

24

of appeals would respect this Court's opinion if this

And that's -- and I think courts

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

way to resolve it.
I do want to make a point about the -- I do

3

want to make one jurisdictional point, Your Honor --

4

Your Honors, and that is, if Petitioners had raised

5

these arguments in the context of a motion to dismiss

6

for failure to state a claim, and they had lost, we

7

wouldn't be here today, right?

8

jurisdiction.

9

clear that you can't bootstrap jurisdiction by referring

10
11

There would be no

And Johnson v. Jones, I think, makes

to qualified immunity.
And, in fact, if you look at Petitioners'

12

Notice of Motion to Dismiss, point 1 is dismiss for

13

qualified immunity; point 2 is dismiss because it does

14

not sufficiently allege personal involvement.

15

in their notice of motion itself, they separated out

16

these two issues.

17

That is,

Now, in their briefing at all the lower

18

courts and in this Court, they've elided them.

But our

19

position on -- on jurisdiction is that there is no --

20

there is no appellate jurisdiction to -- to deal with

21

this question, and in fact Petitioners' own motion

22

suggests that these two issues are separable and that

23

the only issue here is whether or not clearly

24

established law applied and the objective reasonableness

25

of Petitioners' conduct.

And that, we think, is another
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

way of resolving the case.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you this

3

question?

And -- and I ask it, you know, mindful of

4

what you've just said, but I -- I'm not sure that the

5

two issues can be kept as -- as separated as you

6

suggest.

7

Another avenue to responding to the problem,

8

I think, that Justice Breyer's last hypo raised would be

9

as follows -- and then I'll tell you the difficulty that

10

I have with it, and I was going ask you to comment on

11

the difficulty.

12

He said that the -- the allegation -- one

13

way to read the allegation, and I think a fair way, is

14

to say that the Attorney General and the Director of the

15

FBI devised a policy and condoned the implementation of

16

a policy that was based on racial and religious grounds

17

with no penological purpose.

18

circumstances of immediate post-9/11, it is not

19

surprising necessarily that they -- they devised a

20

policy that had reference to religion and national

21

origin and so on, given what we knew about the

22

hijackers.

23

Well, under the

What is not so easy to accept, as a matter

24

of adequate pleading, is the claim that there was no

25

penological interest involved in the decision of how
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to and how long to hold the individuals who were picked

2

up.

3

One answer to that, which I think is -- is

4

in your pleadings, is that you refer to specific

5

individuals and in particular to your own client, who

6

was in the position of being held under these conditions

7

for a considerable period of time, and it turns out

8

there's -- there's no indication that there was

9

ultimately a justified penological interest.

10

So that might be your answer to

11

Justice Breyer's question.

12

specific detentions to make it plausible for pleading

13

standards that they were being held without any

14

penological interest.

15

There's enough in here about

The difficulty I have with that line of

16

thinking is this:

You also allege in there that lower

17

level officials were making decisions on an ad hoc basis

18

without adequate criteria as to -- as to how they should

19

make them.

20

suggests that what was really going on here, including

21

what was happening to your client, wasn't the result of

22

-- of clear policy decisions made by the Attorney

23

General and the Director of the FBI, but they -- they

24

were just being scattered.

25

your whole pleading makes it adequate simply to charge

And that particular line of allegations

So, what in the context of

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on a conclusory basis that these two defendants were

2

devising a policy that had -- that was intended to have

3

an effect of no penological interest?

4

MR. REINERT:

Well, Your Honor,

5

Justice Souter, I do think that in this way the OIG

6

report is very instructive.

7

none of the folks who were held as of interest or as

8

high interest were ever charged or suspected of being

9

involved in terrorism.

10

As for paragraph 48 --

11
12

It basically confirms that

That was well over 700 people.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Did -- you'll have to help

Did you allege that?

13

MR. REINERT:

We alleged that many -- like

14

many -- plaintiffs, like many detainees, were held for

15

no reason.

16
17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

That's what you're

saying --

18

MR. REINERT:

That's what we alleged.

19

And in paragraph 48, I just want to say that

20

does not support the view that there was no racial

21

criteria here.

22

followed by paragraph 49, which says the classifications

23

were made because of race.

24

distinction between "of interest" and "of high interest"

25

was totally arbitrary.

What it -- paragraph 48 is immediately

Are you -- are you saying

7

that the -- that the claim that there was no penological

8

interest for certain decisions goes simply to the

9

distinction between the decision whether to classify as

10
11

"of interest" versus as "of high interest"?
MR. REINERT:

No, Your Honor, I think

12

it's -- I think it's very difficult for us to say in a

13

complaint anything other than no -- no legitimate

14

penological interest, because we couldn't go through the

15

MR. REINERT:

Namely that these people are the -- are the

MR. REINERT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

Well -Surely for at least a

period, you can hold people just -- just to investigate?

6

MR. REINERT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I don't

7

think for a period it's constitutional to hold them

8

solely based on their race, religion, and national

9

origin.

And if it is --

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it wasn't solely on

that.

12

MR. REINERT:

Well, that is the allegation.

13

If it is, that's an issue to be dealt on the merits,

14

exactly as this Court did in Johnson v. California.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the net was surely not

16

cast wide enough if anybody with that race, religion was

18

MR. REINERT:

Well --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, if it's solely for

that reason, there would have been hundreds of thousands

of others.

MR. REINERT:

Justice Scalia, that is the

allegation in the complaint, that as individuals were

But I would say

Wasn't it limited to

MR. REINERT:

These were people --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We're not dealing with

8

the universe of men who are of a certain national

9

origin; we are dealing with only ones who were

10

incarcerated for an offense that has nothing to do with

11

terrorism.

12

MR. REINERT:

Justice Ginsburg, these were

13

individuals who were swept up either in the immigration

14

detention system or in the justice criminal detention

15

system, and that's where the classification was made.

16

But -- but I -- I do --

We don't dispute

But I think this Court's decision in Johnson

v. California and in Parents Involved is instructive,

25

because there the Court says, look, if there is a racial

classification, it has to be judged under strict

2

scrutiny.

3

Court said the State's power was at its apex, which is

4

in the context of their prisons, and even where there is

5

an argument that we have gang violence -- we know that

6

racial identity goes to gang violence to some extent --

7

still the State was put to its burden of proof of a

8

compelling State interest, and even though that was a

9

case that involved damages, it was a qualified immunity

And even in Johnson v. California, where the

MR. REINERT:

You can finish.

The Petitioners were allowed

17

to rely on the 9/11 context in making their argument

18

about qualified immunity, about the objective

19

reasonableness of their conduct, and about whether the

law was clearly established.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. GREGORY G. GARRE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

GENERAL GARRE:

discoveries.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

And, first, let me clarify the record on

4

The Second Circuit didn't hold that

5

discovery could not go forward against these

6

Petitioners.

7

that's the word it used on page 67a of the petition

8

appendix -- postpone or limit discovery.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

It held that the district court might --

So --

But it -- it did happen?

At least it did --

11

GENERAL GARRE:

To the grace of the district

12

court, that's right, and I think Judge Cabranes

13

emphasized the -- the concerns of potentially vexatious

14

discovery in this context, and we certainly

15

wholeheartedly agree with that.

16

Second, I think Mr. Reinert made an

17

important concession when he acknowledged that

18

substantive standards of law affect what you have to

19

plead.

20

two substantive issues that are key.

And here there are two substantive standards --

21

One is the standard for supervisory

22

liability under Bivens, which requires that the

23

plaintiff show an affirmative link between the

24

wrongdoing alleged by lower level officials and the

25

potential wrongdoing on the part of higher level
59
Alderson Reporting Company

officials like the Attorney General.

2

this case has no subsidiary facts on which a reasonable

3

person could affirm that kind of affirmative link.

The complaint in

And, second, the -- the Attorney General is

5

much different than the president of Coca-Cola in that

affect how one views the complaint.

Third -JUSTICE BREYER:

And the reason you can't

make this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?

6

GENERAL GARRE:

Well, we are in the realm of

7

discovery, and we are in the realm of relying on the

8

district court --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

The judge there is supposed

10

to weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward.

11

And so why don't you make this argument right at that

12

point?

If you are right you win; if not, you lose.

GENERAL GARRE:

For the reason this Court

gave in Bell Atlantic:

judges to weed out potentially meritless claims through

discovery.

Third, context does matter.
Justice is right about that.

The Chief

In evaluating the claim,

61
Alderson Reporting Company

you have to look at the context in which it arises.

2

Here the fact it arises in the qualified immunity

3

context with respect to high-level officials is very

4

important.

5

the less plausible it is that the high-level official

6

like the Attorney General is going to be aware of and

7

know about the sort of microscopic decisions here:

8

mistreatment in the Federal detention facility in

9

Brooklyn, alleged discriminatory applications made by

These are not matters that one would

with.
