CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Hotel v. Amalgamated Bank.

6

Mr. Neff.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. NEFF

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. NEFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The question presented in this case is

12

whether a secured creditor must be allowed to credit bid

13

when its collateral is being sold under a Chapter 11

14

plan.

15

plainly says no.

The relevant section of the Bankruptcy Code

16

Section 1129(b)(2)(A) provides that a

17

Chapter 11 plan must be fair and equitable to a secured

18

creditor that objects to it.

19

It then provides three alternatives that the

20

debtor can pursue to satisfy that test.

21

these three alternatives can be used when assets are

22

being sold, but only one of them requires the right to

23

credit bid.

24
25

Any one of

Under subsection (i), the plan must allow
the creditor to retain its lien and receive payments
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

over time, with the present value equal to the value of

2

its collateral.

3

Under subsection (ii), the plan must allow

4

the creditor to credit bid when its asset is being sold

5

free of its lien.

6

But under subsection (iii), the plan must

7

provide the creditor with the indubitable equivalent of

8

its secured claim.

9

The debtors have chosen to pursue a plan --

10

a plan sale without credit bidding under subsection

11

(iii).

12
13

The plain language of the statute permits
that result.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how does one

15

determine what is the indubitable equivalent of the

16

creditor's claim?

17

MR. NEFF:

The indubitable equivalent will

18

be determined at the time of plan confirmation, in our

19

case, after the sale has been conducted, although not

20

yet approved by the court.

21

So the court will have --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the sale --

22

something -- the sale can't go on without the court's

23

approval.

24

court's approval, right?

25

I mean, the -- the auction has to have the

MR. NEFF:

Well, here's what happens
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

typically:

2

case, to approve bid procedures.

3

determines whether those bid procedures are appropriate

4

for the sale.

5

The debtor files a motion, as we did in this
The court then

The sale is then conducted.

Then the debtor

6

goes to plan confirmation; and, at the plan confirmation

7

hearing, aside from establishing the 16 requirements of

8

Section 1129 for a plan to be confirmed, the debtor also

9

seeks to confirm the results of the sale.

10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so what qualifies as

indubitably equivalent?

12

MR. NEFF:

The indubitable equivalent must

13

be an amount that is at least equal to the amount of the

14

secured claim.

15

by what the assets sold for, provided that the sale has

16

generated the best possible price for the asset.

17

In essence, it's going to be determined

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the -- suppose

18

the creditor thinks that the -- the sale was --

19

undervalued the assets, that it -- it wasn't the

20

equivalent?

21

MR. NEFF:

The creditor has an opportunity,

22

at the plan confirmation hearing, to raise any issue

23

with regard to the sale process, with regard to the

24

auction that occurred -- has the opportunity to raise any

25

other issue that may bear on the price that is received
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at the sale that occurs.

2

For instance, it could say, well, they

3

conducted this auction, but I have an appraisal here

4

that says the property is worth much more.

5

can't possibly be -- my --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

So this

Well, isn't the -- isn't the

7

issue who is going to decide whether something is really

8

the indubitable equivalent?

9

judge, which is what you would like?

10

Is it going to be the
Or is it going to

be determined through a particular bidding procedure --

11

MR. NEFF:

Well, it's --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- namely, where there can

13

be credit bidding, which is what the -- which is what

14

the Respondent would like.

15

MR. NEFF:

It's going to be the judge, after

16

reviewing what happens at the sale.

17

allowing a creditor the right to credit bid under all

18

circumstances is, in a case like ours, we don't believe

19

we will ever get to an auction because no one else will

20

show up.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

The problem with

Well, if the Respondent

22

thought that what the judge would determine would

23

indubitably provide the indubitable equivalent, then

24

there wouldn't be an issue here, right?

25

The reason why there's an issue is because
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they don't think that what the judge will decide will

2

indubitably provide the indubitable equivalent.

3

MR. NEFF:

In this particular instance, I

4

would suggest that the -- the creditor simply does not

5

want the asset sold.

6

back and hold it for some time period.

7

It would rather take the asset

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's not --

Well, isn't that --

8

isn't that pretty much what he bargained for when he

9

insisted upon security before giving the loan?

10

MR. NEFF:

Well, what they bargained for was

11

that the asset be liquidated and all of the proceeds

12

applied to their loan.

13

propose to do under our sale procedure.

14

And that's exactly what we

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you're

15

depriving the secured creditor of the opportunity to

16

hold on to the asset because he thinks it is, for

17

perhaps a short period, unreasonably devalued.

18

MR. NEFF:

Right?

Well, he -- he is denied that

19

right under subsection (i), which is our traditional

20

reorganization -- internal reorganization provision of

21

Section 1129(b)(2)(A).

22
23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did -- did I cut off

your answer to Justice Alito?
MR. NEFF:

Well, with regard to the

indubitable equivalence, clearly, the judge is going to
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make that determination.

2

the judge making a determination under subsection (i) as

3

to what the fair market value of the collateral is for

4

purposes of determining the note that the creditor is

5

going to receive and be paid off over time.

6

But that's no different than

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could the -- could the

7

judge say, when the proposal is made to him, the only

8

way I can be sure that it is the indubitable equivalent

9

is to have the sale open to credit bidding, which is

10
11

what we always do?

Can the judge say that?

MR. NEFF:

If there is testimony provided to

12

the judge that that is the way that will maximize the

13

sale proceeds and that, in fact, you can't get

14

indubitable equivalence unless you allow credit bidding,

15

it would seem to me, under that circumstance, the judge

16

would have that discretion.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, you're, you're -It makes no sense to me

19

what you are saying because, under all circumstances,

20

the credit bid, unless the property is valued higher

21

than the credit bid amount, but then another bidder

22

could do -- could make -- could enter that bid.

23

MR. NEFF:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Well, the problem is when -The maximum value always

has to be the value of the credit.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. NEFF:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3
4

Well, I -If the -- if the -- if

the creditor is willing to put it at risk that way.
MR. NEFF:

Your Honor, I would disagree.

I

5

think, in a situation like ours, no one else is going to

6

come to bid because creditors who are -- or potential

7

purchasers who are looking to buy a hotel have multiple

8

opportunities to buy other hotels.

9

So if they know that they are going to show

10

up at a sale, where a creditor is owed substantially in

11

excess of what the property is likely to sell for, they

12

are not going to spend their time and effort doing the

13

due diligence that is required to acquire or make a bid

14

on an asset like a hotel.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so what's wrong with that?

16

I mean, a creditor loaned you a million dollars.

17

million dollars, he got an interest -- a secured

18

interest in a piece of property.

19

worth whatever it was -- whatever it's worth -- less

20

than a million, and he says that's the deal.

21

For the

And that property is

I -- I have a secured interest in this; I

22

want the property.

Now, you are better off because you

23

can stretch out the payments over time, and maybe you

24

don't have to give it to him immediately, but I don't

25

see anything unfair about saying, give him the property

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if he wants it.

2

MR. NEFF:

That, in essence, would be

3

denying Chapter 11 relief to a host of debtors where

4

their collateral is worth --

5
6

JUSTICE BREYER:
(i), (ii) and (iii).

7

Well, in accordance with

I mean, I'm not saying skip those.

MR. NEFF:

What -- the problem is you are

8

cutting off the bankruptcy process, really, before it

9

has --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't understand that.

I

mean, as I read it, to put it out on the table, I read

12

this makes perfect sense.

13

help the debtor a little, without mucking up the secured

14

creditor's collateral.

15

creditor his collateral, and there is still a lien on

16

it.

17

off because he can stretch the payments out over time,

18

and that's one and two.

What they are trying to do is

Choice (i), give the secured

He has what he had before, and the debtor is better

19

Choice (ii), we give the creditor some new

20

collateral.

Hmm, that's a little risky, but to be sure

21

it's fair, we are absolutely certain, with a few

22

exceptions not relevant, that the creditor can credit

23

bid.

So he has it within his control.

24

Choice (iii), something else which comes up

25

in different situations, for example, a creditor who is
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

over-secured, see, and -- and they want to sell the

2

piece of property.

3

sell it, but I want something that's the equivalent,

4

give me this other property over here that you own, that

5

has no liens at all.

6

say that's fair.

7

as far as I could understand it.

8
9
10

And he says, sure, I will let you

And the judge can look at that and

That's what (iii) is basically about,

So it all makes sense to me.

And I don't

understand why you would want to have a rule saying that
(iii) trumps (i) and (ii) and stops credit bidding.

11

MR. NEFF:

Your Honor --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that's the whole thing,

13

as I am seeing it at this moment.

14

chance to reply.

15

MR. NEFF:

Thank you.

So I'll give you a

Your Honor, I don't

16

see subsection (iii) as having the limiting language

17

that it should have if, in fact, it was meant to be

18

something other than what is in subsection (i) or

19

subsection (ii).

20

as provided for in subsection (i) or (ii), relief other

21

than --

22

There is no language that says, except

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it doesn't have the

23

language, which is why we have a case.

24

trying to interpret it in a way that makes sense, what

25

is wrong with what I said as a way that makes sense?
11

Alderson Reporting Company

But, I mean,

I

Official

1

mean, why, since we are trying to give the -- the

2

creditor the indubitable value, at the very least -- the

3

best way to do that would be let the creditor credit

4

bid.

5

MR. NEFF:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

read it.

8

you want.

9
10
11
12

Well -So why not?

And you can

You don't have to read it the way that -- that
You could read it the opposite way, too.
MR. NEFF:

If you are looking at it from the

perspective of the creditor saying well, this -- JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm looking at it from

the perspective of a bankruptcy system --

13

MR. NEFF:

Okay.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that is trying to get

15

secured creditors what they have their security in,

16

while giving the debtor the advantage here of being able

17

to stretch out his payments.

18

MR. NEFF:

I agree.

And there are other

19

parties and interests in -- in a bankruptcy case,

20

including, obviously, unsecured creditors, that get

21

nothing, if the result is all the creditor gets is the

22

relief from the automatic stay to foreclose on the

23

collateral, when you have this great discrepancy between

24

what it's owed --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how would they get

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

anything, anyway?

I mean, your brief suggests that,

2

somehow, there are these unsecured creditors in the mix

3

who are going to receive some benefit if your

4

understanding of this statute goes forward.

5

But, you know, in a circumstance like this,

6

doesn't the secured creditor either get the property or

7

get the money from the property, and the unsecured

8

creditors are out of the mix regardless?

9

MR. NEFF:

Well, in our particular instance,

10

obviously, there are some senior liens that would be

11

paid, including things like mechanic's liens and real

12

estate taxes.

13

There are other costs that --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But those are -- those

14

continue forward.

15

the property, there would be mechanic's liens on the

16

property, isn't that right?

17

So even if the secured creditor got

MR. NEFF:

That's true, although resolving

18

them pursuant to a plan is usually a better resolution

19

for them, by providing more certainty and -- with regard

20

to the result, and a more quicker resolution, usually,

21

as opposed to being relegated only to State court to

22

fight them.

23

In our -JUSTICE SCALIA:

answer.

I'm sorry.

Mr. -- Mr. Neff, can -- are

I didn't want to stop your

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. NEFF:

I was only going to say that, in

2

our particular instance, the stalking horse had agreed

3

over a future time, after it obtains the property, to

4

provide for recovery to general unsecured creditors.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I -- let's look at the

6

text.

Little (ii) provides for exactly what you want to

7

do here.

8

what (ii) says, except you want to eliminate, subject to

9

Section 363(k) of this title, right?

10

What you want to do under (iii) is precisely

Does it -- does it make much sense for a

11

provision to say you can do it three ways:

12

number (ii), you can have this sale subject to credit

13

bidding; and number (iii), after -- after saying that,

14

specifically, oh, you can have this sale, not subject to

15

credit bidding?

16

number (i);

That's -- that's not a very sensible

17

statute.

18

of -- of saying number (ii), if you could have left it

19

to number (iii) anyway?

20

Why -- why go through that -- that problem

MR. NEFF:

Subsection (ii) provides that, if

21

you allow credit bidding, regardless of the price that's

22

achieved, that that is deemed to be fair and equitable

23

treatment of the secured creditor's claim.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

But that's just not true

from what you just said, meaning what you just said is
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the buyer, obviously, is paying other things off,

2

and by definition, he's deducting that from the purchase

3

price.

4

property and agrees to pay something else and gives the

5

highest price for the property once they've done that.

No one gives a purchase price for a piece of

6

So what you're asking for is permission for

7

the debtor to use this property to pay other debts, and

8

that's what I thought a secured interest prevented.

9

MR. NEFF:

With regard to Justice Scalia's

10

question, all I was trying to point out is that, in

11

subsection (ii), regardless of the -- the price that is

12

achieved as long, as you allow the secured creditor the

13

right to credit bid --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. NEFF:

16
17

So why doesn't he get --

-- that's the fair and

equitable -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why doesn't he get

18

everything that the buyer is promising to everyone else?

19

For that, indubitably, is part of the price because he

20

is giving out money to others.

21

of this property.

22

secured creditor, entitled to all of the proceeds from

23

the property?

24
25

That's part of the value

So why isn't the creditor -- the

The secured creditor will get all

the proceeds from the property.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No -- with -- with

sales price, but not from all the payments.

3

MR. NEFF:

With regard to

4

the pavements that are in the future, those are after

5

the -- the sale would be consummated to the stalking

6

horse bidder.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You still haven't

answered my --

9

MR. NEFF:

There are other benefits that the

10

secured creditor -- that will get, that will increase

11

the -- the price that is received by having sold the

12

property in bankruptcy.

13

through a plan, you avoid the payment of transfer taxes.

For instance, when you sell

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. NEFF:

Yes.

So, clearly, to the extent that

16

the transfer taxes being saved are in an amount that

17

exceeds what ultimately goes to the unsecured creditors,

18

these --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You still haven't

20

answered my question.

21

willing to give up to others, why isn't he putting it in

22

the purchase price?

23

MR. NEFF:

If the buyer had money that he's

Why isn't that part of the price?
It would be our obligation to

24

show at confirmation that the creditor is paying the top

25

dollar for the asset.

If the creditor desires to pay a
16


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bonus or a premium on top of that, we would have to show

2

that, nonetheless, that the secured creditor is

3

receiving the indubitable equivalent and either have to

4

show by argument that -- a savings on the transfer tax

5

or some other way that this is not causing the secured

6

creditor to not receive the indubitable equivalent.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could -- could you

8

explain what the reasoning is for requiring a credit

9

bid, if property is sold during the plan, but not

10

permitting it when it's sold at plan time?

11

MR. NEFF:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

understand what benefit, other than delay of the

15

bankruptcy process, that would occasion.

16

MR. NEFF:

Sure.
Doesn't that delay the
I can't actually

Is your question why we always

have it under Section 363, but not under the plan?

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

Uh-hmm.

Section 363 allows the sale of

property outside the ordinary course of business during

25

There is no requirement that you show that any of the

It can be done as quickly as on
So it can be done on a very truncated

plan requirements in Section 1129 must be met.

2

So there are good reasons to have this

3

protection for the secured creditor when you are selling

4

under Section 363 outside of a plan context that don't

5

necessarily exist when you are selling in the course of

6

a plan because a plan takes a much longer time period,

7

usually at least 2 months' notice, if not much longer --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
sorry for the United States?

Mr. Neff, don't you feel
The United States is often

10

in the creditor situation, and the United States cannot

11

come up with cash.

12

Are they going to run to Congress and get an

13

appropriation for each -- each security case it has?

14

What -- what do you propose we do with the United

15

States?

16

interests anymore or what?

The United States just can't take any security

17

MR. NEFF:

Well, no, I don't think that that

18

is the case.

19

don't know the extent that, in practice, that actually

20

occurs because, for instance, they pointed out the SBA

21

loans.

22

would be a motivation, at least by the principals of the

23

debtor, to maximize the return to the SBA.

24
25

Those are typically guaranteed loans.

MR. NEFF:

Well, when we sell assets, the

11

debtor typically has the control over how it's going to

12

be marketed and sold.

13

to the secured creditor, but they're usually not going

14

to give the secured creditor the veto power over how to

15

conduct the sale.

16

They may give some input rights

But I -- I would suggest that, when you have

17

a situation with a creditor that truly cannot bid cash,

18

that -- that there would be an opportunity to impress

19

upon the judge that they need to have a greater role

20

when you are actually marketing and selling the

21

property.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Neff, can I understand

how your system would actually work in practice?

24

Suppose you have an -- an auction, and there is -- the

And then you have the secured

creditor, let's say, is in the position of the United

2

States and comes in and says, we couldn't credit bid,

3

but we -- excuse me -- we couldn't pay cash, but we

4

think it's $750.

5

MR. NEFF:

Right.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, now, the court has to

7

decide whether it's $500 or $750, after the auction has

8

gone forward.

9

What happens?

MR. NEFF:

The court is going to review the

10

process to actually sell the asset -- you know, who

11

was -- where was it marketed, who knew about it, who

12

showed up at the auction, how many bids were made --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, now, let's say the

yes, well, you know, I -- I guess that that price is

4

whatever -- whatever price it sold for?

5

always be?

6

MR. NEFF:

I

Wouldn't it

No, because you are going to have

7

situations where creditors -- secured creditors will

8

credit bid amounts that have no relationship to the fair

9

market value, what we call, for instance, loan-to-own

10

lenders, where their only interest is actually getting

11

the title to the property.

12

situations that -- where the credit bid does not equate

13

to market --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you are going to have

Well, that might be, but --

15

you know, it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to

16

figure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or

17

for credit, you are going to get more bids and higher

18

bids than -- than if you allow them to bid for cash

19

only.

20

MR. NEFF:

The problem is, when you are

21

dealing with larger assets, like what we are dealing

22

with, you are not going to get a sophisticated buyer to

23

come in to bid against a lender that can credit bid,

24

particularly in a situation like our case, where the

lender has said, I simply want the property back.

When this procedure is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEANNE E. MAYNARD

16
17
18
19

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. MAYNARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Secured creditors bargain for the right to

20

be repaid in full or, if not, to foreclose and take the

21

collateral that secures their loan.

22

When a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan is going

23

to cram down a plan over the objection of a secured

24

creditor, Section 1129(b)(2)(A) gives the secured

25

creditor the ability to protect those rights, regardless
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the proposed treatment of its collateral.

2

Specifically, when the plan proposes, as

3

here, to sell the collateral, free and clear of the

4

secured creditor's liens, and give the secured creditor

5

nothing but the proceeds from that sale, clause (ii)

6

entitles the secured creditor to bid what it is owed in

7

the absence of cause to preclude it.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or -- or he is

entitled to realize the indubitable equivalent of his

10

claims.

11

the statute says, "or."

12

You really do just kind of elide the fact that

MS. MAYNARD:

No, Your Honor.

We give full

13

meaning to the "or."

We don't dispute that these are

14

three alternative ways to cram down a plan.

15

question here is or what?

16

of the alternatives and in which circumstances they

17

apply.

The

And the question is the scope

18

And, here, Congress turned its attention to

19

precisely the situation at hand and determined what the

20

requirements were, but not just the requirements for a

21

sale free and clear.

22

you sell it free and clear and you allow credit bidding,

23

then that's one way to go.

24

requirement of credit bidding.

25

only exception to credit bidding.

It's not like clause (ii) says, if

It's not just the
It also sets forth the

28

Alderson Reporting Company

And Petitioners'

Official

1

reading would read clause (iii) to be a much bigger

2

exception.

3

Now, Petitioners here tried and failed in

4

the Bankruptcy Court to prove cause, and they don't

5

appeal that.

6

exception to the exception Congress allowed --

7
8

So they are trying to create a much bigger

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They tried and failed to

prove what?

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Cause.

10

MS. MAYNARD:

Your Honor, cause.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MS. MAYNARD:

Cause.

So under -- we reprint -- the

13

1129 clause (ii) is on 20a in the red brief at the back.

14

And it -- it provides:

15

Section 363(k) of this title, of any property that is

16

subject to liens securing such claims free and clear of

17

such liens."

18

also at the back of our brief.

19

"For the sale, subject to

And that refers you to 363(k), which is

And 363(k) provides that, "Unless the court

20

for cause orders otherwise, the holder of such claim may

21

bid at such sale; and if the holder of such claim

22

purchases such property, such holder may offset such

23

claim against the purchase price of such property."

24
25

you let them credit bid, then that's one way to go to

on the other side suggests that (ii) and (iii) address

different ways of protecting the secured creditor.

9

is procedural, right?

(ii)

You can go through these

10

procedures, and you can cram down, so long as you are

11

going through these procedures, which include credit

12

bidding.

13

Or you can cram down if you ensure that he

14

receives the indubitable equivalent, a substantive

15

protection.

16

What is wrong with that reading?
MS. MAYNARD:

I don't think that's a fair

17

characterization of the three clauses, Mr. Chief

18

Justice, because all three of the clauses have both

19

procedural and substantive components.

20

what Petitioners seek to do here is exchange their

21

preferred procedure, which is a sale without allowing us

22

to credit bid, followed by a judicial determination of

23

whether whatever number that sale produces is high

24

enough to be our secured claim.

25

And essentially,

But the whole point is, if the secured
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

creditor is willing to bid one more dollar of what it's

2

owed at the sale, that is the value of our secured

3

claim.

4

And -JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it correct that, really,

5

the heart of your argument is that the real value of

6

this property is greater than the value that you think

7

the Bankruptcy Court would assign to it, if this were

8

done under subsection (iii)?

9
10

MS. MAYNARD:
Justice Alito.

11
12

That is definitely the fear,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why?

Why do you have that

fear?

13

MS. MAYNARD:

Because valuations are

14

inherently uncertain, and Congress knew that.

15

this Bankruptcy Code, Congress tried to move away from

16

judicial valuations for precisely that reason.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And in

property, so that it knows what the right income stream

21

is.

22

MS. MAYNARD:

In clause (i), the

That's true, Justice Kagan.

23

But, if you proceed through clause (i), the code

24

provides a secured creditor with a different protection

25

against undervaluation.

So the whole code structure is

that their -- their value of their property will be

9

And that's the Section

So Section 1111(b) election allows

17

18

The principal -- the face

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about in subsection

21

(iii), where it talks about substitute collateral?

22

That's completely a judicial valuation, isn't it?

23

MS. MAYNARD:

That would be true, but I

24

think, in that situation, we would also have the option

25

to make the 1111(b) election.

And, therefore, they

would have to substitute collateral that would be up to

the $130 million mark.

3

that Congress did leave this other, but it is an other.

So it's true -- and it's true

And I think -- I think another way to --

4
5

another point to make that clear is the fact that clause

6

(ii) expressly has a role for clause (iii), and it

7

doesn't come into play until after the sale at which the

8

secured creditor gets to credit bid.
JUSTICE ALITO:

9

And --

Well, what is it about the

10

auction -- what is it about the auction process that you

11

think is likely to produce or creates an -- an

12

unacceptable risk of producing a valuation that is --

13

that is too low?

14

the stalking horse or -- or what is it about the

15

process?

16

Is it because of this -- the use of

MS. MAYNARD:

If the secured creditors

17

aren't able to come in and bid their credit and if the

18

secured creditors can't, as is a real risk, raise enough

19

cash to bid the amount of their credit in cash -- and,

20

in some instances, as with the government, they're -- they

21

can't -- they actually can't.

22

But, in a lot of these complicated loans,

23

there are multiple lenders, and it would be very

24

difficult to come up with the money to put in.

the whole premise of why this problem arises is that the

security is worth a lot less than -- than it was,

than -- a lot less than the claim that it was meant to

secure.

9

Everyone agrees that the

property is under water, but it's important to note that

11

the valuations in this case that have been filed in the

12

district court, in conjunction with the relief from the

13

stay, the appraisals are different by tens of millions

14

of dollars, what the property is worth.

15

And if you allow that to go to a judge, to

16

decide whether it's enough, that's an inherently

17

uncertain process.

the -- the court -- tens of millions of dollars, the

judge could decide, and it might not be a fact that we

But another instance -- and it's actually
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

one that -- that goes to something Justice Kagan asked

2

earlier, which is -- is -- when there's some dispute

3

about priority or whether there might be senior liens.

4

So, in this case, the -- the bankruptcy

5

judge provided at 44(a) and 45(a) -- because there --

6

there are some real estate taxes that would be senior to

7

our liens, and there's a debate about whether the

8

mechanic's liens are senior or not.

9

And so the bankruptcy judge provided that --

10

that -- that, here, it would be appropriate for us to

11

either put up cash, in that amount, the amount of the

12

potentially senior liens, or to offer -- you know, some

13

security to cover those, in the event that they turn up.

14

And that is an example of cause.

15

clearly answers the concern that there may be others.

16

And that is --

No one junior to these creditors is going to

17

take anything.

And all making us cash bid would do,

18

assuming the secured creditors are able to come up with

19

the cash to bid in this amount, would be to endless --

20

just to pointlessly cycle money into the estate, and

21

then, if we're the winning bid, through the estate and

22

back to us, at the risk of their siphoning off the money

23

that really shouldn't go to anyone else because we

24

have -- the cash collateral is these secured

25

creditors' -- the hotel and the parking garage are all
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these secured creditors' collateral.

2

Now, the Petitioners say this is going to --

3

if you let the secured creditors bid, this is going to

4

chill credit bidding.

5

the bankruptcy court, and the bankruptcy court, at pages

6

43(a) and 44(a), rejected that as a matter of fact.

7

Well, they tried to prove that in

But, anyway, as a matter of theory, their

proposal -- who would bid in their proposal?

9

proposal is you do the due diligence, you have to prove

10

you have the money, you put up the bid, and then at the

11

back end, you know that the secured creditor is going to

12

be able to come in and tell the bankruptcy judge, I

13

would have bid more with my secured credit.

14

who bids knows that there's the potential that it's all

going to be a waste of time.

The secured creditor

And you've got these unsecured creditors who

11

is that not -- or not.

12

MS. MAYNARD:

I think all those things are

13

ways that it can happen, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

certainly, counsel was distinguishing the --

15

during the plan sale requirement, where he concedes

16

that, if you do a 363(b) sale -- you know, 363(k)

17

applies, but he says it's not a problem because you can

18

negotiate.

19

And,

There are actually many negotiations in a --

20

in a plan sale context.

21

I would suggest, that you can do a cramdown plan over

22

the secured creditor's objection and have less credit

23

bidding rights than you can when you agree to do it.

24
25

And it would be odd, I would --

And so, in the end, there's nothing wrong
with the secured creditor coming in and bidding its

put in $142 million.

3

debtors have no equity in -- in this process.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

Wouldn't that be a reason

5

for saying that there's no adequate -- there's nothing

6

under (iii) that would be the indubitable equivalent?

7

In other words, one thing is to say that, if

8

you -- if (ii) -- if you fit into (ii), that's it, you

9

don't go to (iii).

Another is to say, well, you can go

10

to (iii), but it's most unlikely that there would be the

11

indubitable equivalent of allowing credit bidding.

12

MS. MAYNARD:

I don't think that latter way

13

would be the better reading of the statute, Justice

14

Ginsburg, because Congress turned its attention to this

15

precise problem and decided that the best way to protect

16

the secured creditor against the risk of undervaluation

17

was to allow it to -- to bid.

18

the reasons I said earlier, the system that they propose

19

is -- is not a workable system or a good system, and it

20

wouldn't be good to have there be uncertainty about the

21

auction -- about whether or not it was going to

22

ultimately -- you know, go through.

23

And I -- and I think, for

And as long as the secured creditor is

24

willing to bid at the -- at the auction its secured

25

credit, put its money where its mouth is, that is the
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

value of its -- of its secured claim, and so it could

2

never be the indubitable equivalent to go under (iii),

3

where it's not allowed to bid.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The Petitioner suggests that

5

the usual rule that the specific governs, rather than

6

the general provision, doesn't apply in this case

7

because the specific is not a subset of the general.

8

What's -- what's -- what's your view about that?

9

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, this Court's never

10

applied the rule in that way.

11

it's -- it's always the case that, when the Court's

12

looking at these kinds of problems, that the general

13

provision could be read to encompass what the party

14

before the Court is seeking to do.

15

And I think the Court --

But the -- when Congress has set up a

16

precise scheme -- and, here, I think it's important to

17

realize it's not just the requirements, but also the

18

exception to the requirements -- and then, also, the way

19

that (ii) is -- refers to (iii), and (iii) doesn't kick

20

in until after the sale --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MS. MAYNARD:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

I lost you.

I lost you.

Okay.
It's not just the

requirements, but the exceptions to the requirements.
What are you referring to?
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. MAYNARD:

2

So by reading in 363(k), Justice Scalia,

3

it's not only the requirement of credit bidding, but

4

also the only exception.

5

The for cause.

But then also, if I could just elaborate

6

this -- the point about how it refers to clause (iii),

7

on 20(a) of our brief, we set forth the text.

8

clause of clause (ii) says that, once the sale goes

9

through, the liens attach to the proceeds of the sale.

The final

10

And the treatment of those liens on the proceeds are

11

done under clause (i) or clause (iii) of this

12

subparagraph.

13

So clause (ii) contemplates that there will

14

be some judicial determination of indubitable

15

equivalence, but only after the amount of the

16

proceeds -- because -- after all, what we're trying to

17

determine here is the value of the secured claim.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said, earlier,

19

we have never said that the specific has to be a subset

20

of the general.

21

specific and the one general?

22

a subset, then they are alternatives.

23

the whole doctrine makes any sense, if the specific is

24

not a subset of the general.

25

How do -- how would it otherwise be

MS. MAYNARD:

It seems, if they are not
I don't see how

Well, maybe I misunderstood
44


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Kagan's question or I misunderstood their point.

2

I thought their point was looking specifically at the --

3

the facts of the Speedy Trial Act case and saying

4

because it's a list and it says, "includes," and then

5

there are subsets under the list, that's how I

6

understood their argument.

7

Yes, it's certainly true -- like, take the

8

venue statute case -- you know, the general venue

9

provision clearly covered patent infringement suits.

10

But then there was a specific patent infringement venue

11

statute, and the -- the patent infringement statute

12

didn't say it was the exclusive patent venue statue, and

13

the general venue statute didn't say, "except as

14

otherwise provided in the code," yet this Court said,

15

well, the patent -- Congress turned its attention to

16

patent infringement suits and created this venue.

17

that's --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So when we say, our

19

doctrine says the specific controls over the general,

20

the specific is a subset of the general?

21

MS. MAYNARD:

Yes, to the extent that I

22

think it's always fair to say that what the party who's

23

claiming they fit within the general does could

24

definitionally possibly fit within the general.

in these days, which is that we have constraints on our

19

provisions of Chapter 11 are designed to protect the

20

rights of secured creditors.

And the detailed cramdown

21

The essence of being a secured creditor, of

22

course, as the Court has suggested, is that the secured

23

creditor has bargained for the right either to get its

24

money back or to get the thing that secures its loan, to

25

get its collateral.
46

Alderson Reporting Company

And the type of sale that is contemplated in

2

clause (ii) of Section 1129(b)(2)(A) is precisely

3

designed to guarantee that the creditor will get the

4

benefit of its bargain.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You have got a whole

6

cadre of U.S. trustees that, presumably, can look out

7

for the interests of the poor United States.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, in most Chapter

10

it's a debtor in possession.

in charge of the property of the estate.

MS. HARRINGTON:

And so the trustee is not

Where the -- where the
That -- that's true.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

In those cases, of

course, the trustee's there, right?
MS. HARRINGTON:

The trustee is there.

But,

20

if the debtor proposes a plan that wouldn't allow the

21

United States to credit bid at an auction that is

22

selling its collateral, then the United States is

23

usually out of luck because the Antideficiency Act

24

prevents us from bidding cash.

25

Now, I would like to respond to one -- one
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sort of assumption that has seemed to permeate the

2

conversation here, which is that a secured creditor will

3

always have an incentive to bid the full amount of its

4

claim at an auction of its assets, where the auction is

5

supposed to be free of liens.

6

true.

7

That is actually not

As my friend Ms. Maynard suggested, unless a

8

bank is trying to get into the business of running a

9

hotel or running whatever business is the collateral,

10

the creditor will only want to take the property if it

11

thinks it can make a profit by then turning around and

12

selling the property.

13

So if there is an auction, where there is a

14

cash bid, and the creditor thinks that the value of --

15

the amount of the cash bid is actually a fair valuation

16

of the property, the creditor has no incentive to bid

17

higher than that in credit because it has no expectation

18

of getting more money than that when it then takes the

19

property and turns around and sells it.

20

So allowing the credit bidding won't have

21

the effect of serving as a veto on what would be a fair

22

sale price by a cash bidder.

23

creditor's incentive is only to bid up to what it -- up

24

to what it views as the value of the property and not a

25

penny more because it's not trying to take the property

The -- the secured

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just for the property's sake.

2

to take the property and then sell the property.

3

In most cases, it wants

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, of

4

course, it could bid up if it thinks that there are

5

going to be other bidders, right?

6

flexibility than the other bidders to -- to the extent

7

of its security interest.

8
9

MS. HARRINGTON:

It has a lot more

I mean, it has more

flexibility because it has already put up its money.

10

But every bidder has that incentive that you suggest,

11

which is to try to make sure that it's -- to sort of

12

game the system a little bit and -- and -- and make

13

everybody put their money where their mouth is.

14

But Congress gave secured creditors a right

15

to have a role, where they get to put their money where

16

their mouth is, any time there is --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That just begs the

18

question, Congress gave them a right -- I mean, that's

19

what we are deciding, right?

20

MS. HARRINGTON:

Absolutely.

And -- and

21

Petitioner is certainly correct, that the phrase

22

"indubitable equivalence," an unusual phrase in the

23

statute, that that phrase is broad enough to cover any

24

type of disposition of a secured creditor's claim,

25

including the sale of property free of liens.
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But Congress also enacted two much more

2

specific provisions right next to clause (iii).

3

those provisions, number (i), which governs -- governs

4

the retention of liens on -- on collateral, and number

5

(ii), which governs the sale of -- the sale of

6

collateral free of liens, there are very specific

7

protections written into clauses (i) and clause (ii).

8

And this Court's interpretive canon that a specific

9

provision will trump a more general provision, where

10
11

And, in

both could apply, would seem clearly to apply here.
If a plan proposes a disposition of a claim

12

that is addressed by a clause (i) or a clause (ii), it

13

doesn't make any sense to allow them to strip out

14

protections that are provided in those clauses by

15

purporting to go under the more general standard of

16

indubitable equivalence.

17

That is especially true because the type of

18

judicial valuation of the property that would take place

19

under Petitioners' type of scheme is not guaranteed to

20

make sure that the creditor gets what it bargained for,

21

which is either its money or its property, but that is

22

exactly what clause (ii), that type of auction, is

23

guaranteed to do.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the reference?

In clause (ii), we were just told, the -- the last
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clause refers to "under clause (i) or clause (iii)."

2

What -- what is the reference in (ii) to clause (iii)?

3

What does that mean?
MS. HARRINGTON:

4

Well, the type of sale

5

contemplated in clause (ii) is, essentially, a

6

liquidation of the secured creditor's lien on a

7

property.

8

liquidate the lien.

9

that -- that there would need to be a replacement lien

And so you -- the sale would, essentially,
And then clause (ii) provides

10

on the proceeds of the sale.

11

would then have to be treated under clause (i) or clause

12

(iii).

13

That replacement lien

I think it's fair to say, in most

14

situations, what happens is that the proceeds of the

15

sale are handed over to the secured creditor, which is

16

essentially a clause (iii) treatment of the lien on the

17

proceeds, in the sense that, if the lien on the proceeds

18

is a lien on the pile of cash, if you hand over the pile

19

of cash, you're surrendering the collateral that is

20

securing that lien, which is the classic example of

21

indubitable equivalence.

22

cited in the legislative history and in Judge Hand's

23

opinion in In re Murel.

That is one of the examples

24

I think one of the assumptions that

25

permeates the Petitioners' brief is that valuation -- that

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the value of collateral is something we can all know and

2

agree upon.

3

But valuation is an inherently difficult

4

undertaking.

5

Congress enacted the code in 1978, it shifted the

6

preference to move from judicial valuation towards

7

market valuations.

8

And this Court has recognized that, when

And, here, Congress, in clause (ii),

9

expressed its view that -- that the type of market that

10

would value this property would include one of the most

11

interested market participants, who is -- which is the

12

secured creditor who has an interest in the property.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, valuing

14

property is what bankruptcy judges do all the time,

15

right?

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

They -- they definitely do.

17

But I think, here, Congress provided that this would be

18

a situation where the secured creditor would have a role

19

in valuing the property, and even under -- as Justice

20

Kagan pointed out, even -- I think it was Justice

21

Kagan -- under clause (i), the judge has a role in

22

valuing the property because we have to determine the

23

present day value of the cash stream that the creditor

24

would be owed.

25

But as judge -- as my friend -- as Ms.
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Maynard pointed out -- maybe you will be a judge some

2

day --

3

(Laughter.)

4

MS. HARRINGTON:

The creditor in that

5

situation has a role in -- in protecting itself against

6

undervaluation because it can make the 1111(b) election,

7

retain the full amount of its claim if it wants, and --

8

and protect itself going forward.

9

I think one way that's important is that it

10

protects -- it prevents debtors from cashing out

11

creditors at a low value, at a point where the -- in the

12

market where the value of the property is low because

13

they retain the lien for the full amount.

14

The same thing is true here.

If this is a

15

particularly low point in the market and the creditor is

16

trying to sell the property at auction -- I'm sorry --

17

the debtor is trying to sell the property at auction,

18

the creditor can come in and take the property and

19

realize any -- any upside down the road.

subsection (iii) plays in subsection (ii) -JUSTICE SCALIA:

What you just said is, so

15

long as they come in with some appraisals that are above

what -- what the property sold at for cash, then it's

17

not the indubitable equivalent?

18

MR. NEFF:

If they can --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because you've got to have

20

at least one appraiser who says it's -- it's worth more.

21

Is that all it takes?

22

MR. NEFF:

23

Right.

The -- the question --

it's a very high standard.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. NEFF:

Indubitable is indubitable.

It's a very high standard.

MR. NEFF:

If you have one honest

and we were unable to achieve that, then we will have a

6

very difficult time satisfying that standard, but the

7

process will have been allowed to play out, which is

8

extremely important because those of us who have done

9

debtor work know how many times a lender doesn't want to

10

do something, and, ultimately, you have a sale or

11

otherwise some sort of disposition of assets, the price

12

gets high enough, and they are willing to go along with

13

it.

14

So with regard to the market test --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what happens if you

16

go to the judge and the judge says, there is one higher

17

bid, so I can't say it's indubitable?

18

happens?

19

MR. NEFF:

Then what

Then -- then you would have to

20

provide additional consideration to the secured creditor

21

to get it to the level that the judge would find it to

22

be indubitable.

23

So it's no different than at any plan

24

confirmation hearing, if you say, judge, my plan is

25

dependent upon the interest rate being set at 5 percent.
55

The judge says, well, I find it should be 6 percent.

2

You have to find a way to bridge that gap.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that assumes that you

4

can just pull out a wad of cash from your back pocket,

5

but, mostly, the debtors are not in that position.

6

it just seems like a gigantic waste of time.

7

MR. NEFF:

So

It's -- it's more so that the --

8

the purchaser would have to come up with that -- would

9

have to come up with that or find some other way to

10

bridge that gap.

11

It's not really a waste of time because,

12

again, you are allowing the process to -- to play itself

13

out.

14

they're unwilling to deal with debtors because they have

15

gotten them in the particular situation.

16

you are able to actually have an auction, they are

17

surprised by how high the bidding gets because

18

bankruptcy auctions are very fulsome events and -- and

19

create -- can create quite a lot of bidding that can

20

really generate very high -- high value for the

21

property.

22

Too many times, we see, with secured creditors,

And then, when

As far as the role that (iii) plays in (ii),

it's a bit convoluted; but, if you pursue a plan sale

indubitable equivalence, as long as they are allowed to

with regard to Section 363 sales, as opposed to plan

20

What it -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

people didn't think they could do it in plan sales.

why should we upset the expectation?
