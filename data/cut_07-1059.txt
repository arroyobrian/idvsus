Mr. Stewart.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11
12

IN NO. 07-1059
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is

13

whether the provision of enriched uranium under

14

separative work unit or SWU contracts is covered by the

15

Federal antidumping duty law.

16

question turns on whether the performance of SWU

17

contracts results in merchandise being sold in the

18

United States.

19

Federal agency entrusted by Congress with the

20

administration of the antidumping duty law, concluded

21

after an extensive investigation that SWU contracts do

22

result in sales of enriched uranium.

23

was reasonable and should be sustained by this Court.

24
25

The resolution of that

The Department of Commerce, which is the

That determination

Now, the fundamental bargain in a SWU
contract is that the customer, the utility, provides a
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

combination of feedstock or feed uranium plus cash, and

2

receives in return a specified quantity and assay of

3

enriched uranium, and by "assay" I mean the percentage

4

of weight of U-235 within the final product.

5

customer has discretion to choose among varying

6

combinations of feedstock and cash in order to complete

7

the transaction for a particular quantity and assay of

8

enriched uranium; but the enricher has its own

9

discretion.

Now, the

That is, having received the consideration

10

paid by the utility, the enricher is free to make its

11

own determination based on economic considerations as to

12

the relative proportions of feedstocks and SWUs that

13

should be used to make a given quantity of enriched

14

uranium.

15

So the overall -- the character of the

16

overall transaction is comfortably characterized as a

17

sale, because it involves the acquisition by the utility

18

of a product, merchandise, that it didn't own at the

19

outset of the transaction in exchange for consideration.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I can imagine you could

21

have a grain mill and they have lots and lots of grain

22

absolute identical one to the other.

23

takes his grain up and they operate on it, and then he

24

drives away with the grain, milled.

25

difference to anybody whether the identical molecules
4

Alderson Reporting Company

And the farmer

Now, it may make no

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are the same; and I think in such a case you'd say they

2

are processing it; they are not buying and selling it.

3

MR. STEWART:

Well, indeed, as we've

4

explained in our opening brief, at common law the

5

distinction between a bailment and a sale in that type

6

of circumstance depended upon whether the miller or the

7

equivalent processor was under an obligation to return

8

the very same thing in processed form.

9

was -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if that

You are saying if we have

11

that, in fact, if the -- if the exact situation, if some

12

farmers up in North Dakota send their grain just to be

13

milled -- it's their grain -- up in Canada, and they

14

come back, and it -- you know, it may not be the

15

identical molecule, but it's identically the same; they

16

have done this for 100 years -- now suddenly this -- the

17

Commerce Department is going to say, that's a sale, and

18

the antidumping statutes apply?

19
20

MR. STEWART:

We are saying that Commerce

could treat it as a sale.

And -

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. STEWART:

Well, would it or not?

I think Commerce in that

23

hypothetical -- again, if we were talking about grain

24

being provided by the customer to a miller overseas -

25

overseas, and then the finished product being brought
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

back into this country, I think the logic of the

2

Commerce determination here would suggest that it would

3

be a sale.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree with you, and I

5

just wonder, what I would like to know, is if any

6

businessman involved in any of these or related things

7

before this decision of the Commerce Department would

8

have thought that that is how the Commerce Department

9

would have treated such a transaction?

10

MR. STEWART:

Well, I don't think that

11

Commerce had before this incident dealt with exactly

12

this type of situation.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

have treated it that way, you say?

15
16

MR. STEWART:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's pretty good

authority.

19
20

Common law would have treated

it -

17
18

Well, but common law would

MR. STEWART:

It certainly suggests that

Commerce could permissibly treat it as a sale.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know.

I'm

22

asking -- the question is the same as the last case, to

23

me:

24

could have done it.

25

of whether they had a rule that any reasonable person

Not whether they could have done it; sure they
My question is based on my question

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have thought that is how they treated it -

2

MR. STEWART:

I -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because after all, you have

4

three precedents in related areas, not the direct area

5

but in related areas, that suggest that they wouldn't

6

have treated the millers that way.

7

MR. STEWART:

I'm not sure exactly which

8

precedents you mean.

If -- the one that is -- the

9

administrative determination that is cited most

10

frequently is SRAMS from Taiwan, in which the design

11

house provided, I believe it was a design mask to the

12

foundry, and the foundry manufactured the finished

13

equipment and in concluding that it was the design house

14

rather than the foundry that was properly treated as the

15

producer of the goods, the Commerce Department relied in

16

part on the fact that the design house had intellectual

17

property rights in the design mask.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

You know what, I'm thinking

19

of those things, they're something called "tollers."

20

don't know exactly what tollers are.

21

like people who give haircuts.

22

servicers of some kind.

23

and -- and subcontractors.

24
25

MR. STEWART:

I

They seem to be

They're sort of

They're talking about tollers
And that is a related area.
That's correct.

And the SRAMs

cases is one of the toller or subcontractor cases.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Department of Commerce relied in part on the fact

2

that the design house had intellectual property rights

3

in the design mask.

4

was not an input that the foundry could have gotten from

5

another source.

6

So it was not fungible property, it

The other thing we would say about the grain

7

hypothetical is that when you hear about the farmer

8

providing grain to the miller or the utilities providing

9

feedstock to the enrichers, it may conjure up images of

10

a tangible good that is in the physical possession of

11

the farmer or the utility that is then physically

12

transferred to the enricher.

13

that is correct.

14

In the case of the miller

But the way that a utility provides

15

feedstock to an enricher is not by taking physical

16

possession of the feedstock and then by transporting it.

17

Rather, the utility simply makes financial arrangements

18

with the supplier of feedstock, basically cuts a check

19

or transfers funds -

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Stewart, can I ask a

21

question about the scope of discretion involved here?

22

Assume the facts were not exactly as they are here, it

23

is not a fungible product, but that each shipment was

24

separately identified and each shipment was processed as

25

a different batch in France and then sent back.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

That I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

assume would not normally be treated as a sale of goods?

2

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think that Commerce's

3

determination suggests, without squarely holding, that

4

it would treat that as a sale of goods because it would

5

involve substantial transformation of the original item.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's really what I

7

wanted to ask you.

8

just as in the example I gave, do you think the Commerce

9

Department would have discretion to treat that as a sale

10
11

Even if the facts were more extreme,

of goods?
MR. STEWART:

We do.

And I think it's

12

important, to carry on with the thought I was sketching

13

out previously about the way in which the raw materials

14

are provided to the enricher.

15

If you imagine my buying a suit from a

16

tailor, and the tailor says:

17

that accounts for the cost of the cloth; $300 is the

18

labor that's involved in sewing it into a suit.

19

Clearly, that's a sale of merchandise, even though the

20

price has been broken up -

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The price is $600; $300 of

But then supposing they

22

send the suit back to a different person for

23

alterations, and they say, well, this is part of the

24

sale, so we want to treat it as a sale of goods?

25

MR. STEWART:

Well, the alterations would
9


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just be a finishing process and that wouldn't involve

2

substantial -

3
4
5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What is the difference

between that and what we've got here?
MR. STEWART:

But the point I was going to

6

make about the suit, and it applies equally to the

7

uranium enrichment process, is if I say to my tailor,

8

rather than I pay you $600 and you pay your cloth

9

supplier $300, how about I just give you $300 and I will

10

give $300 to your cloth supplier, and it will amount to

11

the same thing in the end, because you won't have to pay

12

for the cloth?

13

the economic substance is exactly the same.

14

would seem strange to say that it's a sale if I just pay

15

$600 to the tailor, but it's not a sale if I break down

16

the cost in the way that I've described.

17

If the tailor accepts that arrangement,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it

Could you articulate

18

precisely what your test is, because you have been going

19

back and forth between whether the raw materials are

20

fungible and whether there is a fundamental

21

transformation in the product?

22

those two in an articulable test so that business people

23

can know when they are going to be subject to this

24

regime and when they were not?

25

MR. STEWART:

So, how would you merge

I think that the Commerce
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

determination -- that Commerce did not purport to either

2

promulgate a regulation or announce a test that

3

precisely defined the term "sale".

4

of the Commerce Department's determination was that

5

substantial transformation was enough, but that the case

6

was much easier by virtue of the fact that the

7

producer -- the enricher dealt with fungible goods and

8

also had substantial discretion to decide how much of

9

the feedstock would be used vis-a-vis -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think the thrust

You would say your

11

ultimate touchstone is whether there is substantial

12

transformation, and whether it's a raw material or

13

discretion, those go into that determination?

14

MR. STEWART:

That's correct, although it

15

would certainly be appropriate for this Court if it

16

didn't want to address the situation in which only

17

substantial transformation was present, to say that at

18

least when both circumstances were present there was a

19

sale.

20

And again, to distinguish this somewhat from

21

the miller hypothetical, the miller in making grain into

22

flour may have discretion as to which individual grains

23

to use for a particular batch of flour, but it won't

24

typically have discretion as to what weight of grain

25

will be used to make what weight of flour.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

enricher has that discretion as well; that is, to

2

produce a particular quantity and assay of enriched

3

uranium, the enricher can either use more feedstock and

4

fewer SWU's -

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:
on the SWU.

7

What's a SWU?

You lost me

What's a SWU?
MR. STEWART:

A SWU is a unit of work and

8

it's work in the sense of output; that is, it is the

9

work necessary to separate out a particular quantity of

10

enriched uranium -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you put in more time

12

with the uranium, with the same amount of 235, if you

13

put in more time you can get out more?

14

MR. STEWART:

That's right.

The amount

15

of -- the separation process or the enrichment process

16

involves a separation of the original feedstock into the

17

enriched uranium and what is referred to as the tails,

18

which is the residue or the depleted uranium.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

prepared for a wide variety of hypotheticals.

21

about a diamond?

a diamond.

23

away into something that, I guess you could say it's

24

been substantially transformed.

3

MR. STEWART:

I'm not sure whether Commerce

would treat that as substantial transformation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Neither am I, and

4

it's kind of -- it's sort of a bit of a concern.

5

fluctuating test that is hard to determine how it's

6

going to be applied in a wide variety of cases.

7

MR. STEWART:

It's a

Now, in this case -- in this

8

particular case, Commerce noted that there was no

9

dispute among the parties that the enrichment process

10

did result in substantial transformation.

11

that uncertainly is not present here.

12

So that -

But I agree that there is a gray area with

13

respect to substantial transformation that isn't present

14

when you are trying to answer the question:

15

customer getting back the same thing in modified form or

16

is he getting back a different thing?

17

the contracts between the utility and the enricher deem

18

the enriched uranium to have been produced with the

19

customer's own feedstock, everybody acknowledges that

20

that is not the fact in the real world.

21

Is the

That is, although

And so, what the customer receives back is

22

not like your diamond hypothetical, in which he receives

23

an improved version of the original product.

24

though you had a diamond company that said, we need

25

inventory all the time, and we're prepared to work out
13
Alderson Reporting Company

It is as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an arrangement where if you send us a raw diamond plus

2

cash, we will send you back a different cut diamond.

3

That would be a sale, regardless of whether there was

4

substantial transformation, because you would have

5

payment of consideration for a product that you

6

indisputably didn't own at the outset.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stewart, we're

8

reviewing a decision of the Federal Circuit.

And the

9

Federal Circuit relied dominantly on the Florida Power

10

case in which the same issue was presented, albeit under

11

a different statute.

12

But I -- reading that Florida Power, where

13

the Federal Circuit adopted the Government's position,

14

the Government's position then was that this very same

15

transaction involved the rendition of services and not a

16

sale of goods.

17

Does the Government have a distinction

18

between those two cases, or are you now saying in

19

hindsight you realized that the position that you took

20

before the Federal Circuit in the early case was wrong?

21

MR. STEWART:

I don't think we have

22

disavowed the position we took in the Florida Power &

23

Light case.

24

question of the Contract Disputes -- Disputes Act's

25

applicability to SWU contracts is of a lot less interest

Now, in all candor, I would have to say the

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the Federal Government now than it was then, because

2

the reason that arose in a case involving the Federal

3

Government was that at that time USEC was a Government

4

instrumentality and we were representing USEC in its

5

governmental incarnation.

6

Now that USEC has been privatized, the

7

Federal Circuit is unlikely to confront the question

8

whether the Contract Disputes Act applies to this sort

9

of, because these are not -- this is not a Federal

10

entity, in any event.

11

The reason that we think the two cases are

12

reconcilable is that the Contract Disputes Act, as its

13

name implies, is a statute that governs the resolution

14

of disputes between contracting parties.

15

situation, it's much more appropriate to look to the

16

form of the parties' arrangement.

17

Federal Circuit in Florida Power and Light placed a lot

18

of emphasis on the fact that the contract was styled as

19

one for enrichment services.

20

consideration to take into account when you are

21

resolving disputes between the contracting parties, but

22

when the whole purpose of the antidumping statute is to

23

prevent contracting parties from entering into

24

arrangements that are mutually beneficial to themselves,

25

but that would and unfairly disadvantage domestic

And in that

And the court -- the

And that is an appropriate

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

competitors, it was appropriate for Commerce to look

2

behind the form of the contract and to look at physical

3

and economic reality.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But isn't it correct that

5

the universe of transactions that is the subject of this

6

Act is sales?

7

contracts.

8

Is that not right?

MR. STEWART:

Rather than service

Well, it is true that the

9

antidumping statute requires that merchandise be sold in

10

the United States, and we don't contend that the statute

11

applies to price discrimination in services like

12

insurance or banking.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But do you -- do you

14

contend the word "sold" is an ambiguous term, requires

15

construction by a particular agency?

16

MR. STEWART:

It is ambiguous at the

17

margins; that is, the classic arrangement, the classic

18

sale is an exchange of -

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think Congress

20

intended the ambiguity to be resolved by an agency

21

rather than judges applying the rules of common law and

22

the rules of sales law generally?

23

MR. STEWART:

Yes, and I think this is a

24

statute that has been around for, I believe, close to

25

90 years now; and in order for it to remain efficacious
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in this area, Commerce has to be able to adapt its

2

principles to new forms of transactions.

3

doesn't mean that Commerce's discretion is limitless,

4

but it has some discretion at the margins.

5
6

If I may, I would like to reserve the
balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

IN NO. 07-1078

13
14

Again, that

MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

15

I would submit, as the questions this

16

morning have indicated, one of the difficulties in this

17

case, obviously, is this is the kind of transaction that

18

can be thought about reasonably enough in different

19

ways.

20

circumstances where a customer is providing raw

21

materials of the kind that the producer uses to make a

22

good, and to say in that circumstance we could look at

23

it as the customer providing two kinds of consideration

24

for the good it's receiving; or we could look at it, as

25

the Respondents do and as the Federal Circuit did, as

It is possible to look at this very narrow set of

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

saying, the other way to look at it is this is

2

essentially the customer receiving a service on its own

3

goods.

4

Now it seems to me to begin with, the

5

question that is before the Court properly is whether

6

Commerce, which is undoubtedly the agency charged with

7

enforcing this statute, has adopted a reasonable view

8

when it's taken one of those two positions.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what do we do about

10

the question that is bothering me?

Maybe at some

11

point -- maybe it's not a relevant question -- but I

12

will assume for the sake of argument Commerce does have

13

the power to classify it either way.

14

What is bothering me, and maybe that's not

15

in this case, is that as the -- as your brother lawyer

16

just said, this statute has been around for 90 years.

17

There has been trillions of dollars worth of foreign

18

commerce during that time.

19

any instance in which Commerce ever before said that

20

when you have title to a good, and you send it abroad,

21

for even a big change in it, and then it comes back,

22

that that is a sale.

23

Yet I don't find cited here

Now, I might -- I don't know all the

24

Commerce cases; maybe they did.

But what I found here

25

is like a blank on that side, and on the other side the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tolling cases, Florida Power & Light, the pizza case, to

2

the point where I thought, if I was a lawyer advising a

3

client, and that client said if I keep title to the

4

good, am I home free, I would have to say, yes, you are.

5

MR. FARR:

Okay.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now that's the -- the

7

question I want responded to in the legal context of,

8

has Commerce made a significant change in its policy?

9

MR. FARR:

Several things about that,

10

Justice Breyer.

11

our brief, Commerce did have a policy prior to the

12

do I find all these cases?

16
17

First of all, as we have indicated in

But it's in But I will see a lot of

cases where MR. FARR:

Where we discuss Commerce's

24

tolling precedent.

And then it went and it essentially

25

decided that what it had done in that precedent, it
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wanted to reexamine that, because it thought in the end

2

what was happening in all of those cases is there was a

3

resale of the merchandise; and it thought it would be a

4

better practice to focus on that sale of the merchandise

5

for purposes of applying the statute.

6

When it did that, however, it found it had

7

created a loophole in the case where there wasn't a

8

further sale.

9

in terms of the precedent, Commerce has been on

So it has gone back to that.

So at least

10

different sides of that, but they have been wrestling

11

with exactly the problem that I outlined at the

12

beginning, which is dealing with a question that

13

essentially has no ready answer to it and trying to pick

14

among the plausible answers that were available to it.

15

Secondly, just about the specific situation

16

here, I don't believe that there is any chance that the

17

utilities and the enricher in this case could claim

18

unfair surprise or unjust reliance; because they say in

19

their own briefs, they did not set their transactions up

20

in this way in order to try to comply with prior

21

decisions of Commerce.

22

They say -- they make a point in their brief

23

in saying we have perfectly innocent intentions here,

24

that they set their transactions up purely for

25

historical and commercial reasons.

So -- now, the other question that

2

Justice Breyer raises is about the cases, and

3

Justice Ginsburg I think mentioned earlier the Florida

4

Power & Light decision.

5

Light is a case in which there is no agency that is

6

before the Court.

7

And again, Florida Power &

So at that point there is no question of

8

Chevron deference, no question of whether this is a

9

reasonable position; all that the Court had to decide

10

was, given the possible choices, which did it think was

11

the better choice under those circumstances?

12

particularly I think it's important in that case, is the

13

Federal Circuit said, this is a case that doesn't fall

14

readily into either of the two categories.

15

ahead and had to decide it on its own.

And

So it went

16

But it seems to me that when you say in a

17

case with an agency involved, and the agency has made

18

one determination, that a case could fall within either

19

of categories -- of categories -

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Farr, are there

21

earlier cases that applied Chevron deference to the

22

Commerce's determination of what a sale is?

23
24
25

MR. FARR:
that I am aware of.

No, there are not, Your Honor,
But -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You agree that the Chevron

case is not a substantial evidence case?
MR. FARR:

I do think so, although I must

3

say the line between the two is not enormously clear to

4

me, to be honest.

5

trying to figure out where on the side of the line it

6

goes, it seems to me that this is a case in which you

7

are talking about the application of a legal standard to

8

a particular set of circumstances.

9

you have the situation, is a certain kind of facility a

But -- but the fact is if I were

10

stationary source or whatever?

11

say, well, that is a factual question in some way, but

12

it seems to me ultimately the better way to think about

13

it is Commerce's responsibility is to interpret the law

14

in the light of cases that come up.

15

I mean that -- you could

I mean, an agency does not -- is not

16

expected by Congress just to sit back and imagine all

17

the possible situations that could be a sale of

19

is, confronted with the circumstance in a particular

20

transaction, to apply its judgment on the statutory

21

language and say, yes, we do think this is a sale of

22

merchandise or no, we don't.

23

I think what the agency is supposed to do

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If we are to defer

24

to the agency's interpretation, what -- how would you

25

phrase its interpretation, apart from "this is a sale"?
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FARR:

Well, I think -- the narrowest

2

interpretation, and it seems to me the one that is most

3

readily dealt with is, to say, in a situation where a

4

customer provides raw material that is the type of, but

5

not the precise raw material, used by a manufacturer to

6

make the good that it then delivers to the customer, in

7

that situation, we are going to treat the manufacturer

8

as having made a sale of that good for the consideration

9

of the cash and the raw material.

10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it doesn't matter

whether there is a substantial transformation or not?

12

MR. FARR:

I think it does,

13

Mr. Chief Justice, in this sense, that we are talking

14

about the sale of the merchandise and that is a new

15

good.

16

what moves the ball from -- from being the -- the raw

17

material supplied by the customer to something

18

different.

19

could Commerce reasonably think that the manufacturer

20

had sufficient control over the new good to be deemed

21

the owner of that?

22

So the substantial transformation is essentially

And the question would be in this case,

And I think it's important to look, if you

23

look at the -- there are two different commodities that

24

are being talked about in the case of this transaction:

25

One is the feedstock, the raw material; the other is the
23
Alderson Reporting Company

LEU.

And the idea that the Respondents posit is, well,

2

this is just a service performed on our material.

3

we are doing is getting our material back after a

4

service has been performed on it.

5

All

But as everybody agrees, as a matter of

6

fact, that is simply not so.

They are not getting their

7

material back with a service performed on it.

8

getting a product that has been produced, manufactured,

9

from raw material that is fungible and in the general

They are

10

inventory of the manufacturer.

11

seems to me, Commerce can say, we are going to disregard

12

the fiction of the parties' contracts that say this

13

really is made from our material, and say we are going

14

to look at the actual nature of the transaction.

15

the actual nature of the transaction, as I said, it is

16

not made from their material.

And in that case, it

position?

If the domestic entity provides wood,

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. FARR:

say that.

fungible raw material in substantial transformation

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's got to be

both?

8
9

I am to some extent speaking for them here.

MR. FARR:

I think that Commerce would say,

if you have both, that clearly can be regarded as a sale

10

of merchandise, and we will regard it as a sale of

11

merchandise.

12

substantial transformation but not fungibility, then I

13

believe Commerce would say, even in that situation,

14

because it's ultimately the effect on the domestic

15

competitor is exactly the same, we would retain the

16

discretion to treat even that as a sale of merchandise.

On the other hand, if you only have

I would emphasize that's not the

case.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you do that if you

21

thought it was clear as a matter of common law or under

22

the Uniform Sales Act, or something like that, that it

23

was not a sale?

24
25

MR. FARR:

I think because of the different

circumstances, under the common law, for example, I
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

should make very clear -- but I should make first my

2

answer to you, Justice Stevens.

3

the particular transaction we were dealing with here,

4

where it is not made from the identical material, is

5

clearly a sale under the common law.

6

Commerce were going to say, in a situation where it is

7

made from the identical material, we want to depart from

8

the common law, I think they would have to justify that.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

don't need deference.

11

MR. FARR:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Under the common law,

But if you -- if

Under common law, you

Pardon me?
I'm sorry.

If it were

13

clearly a sale under common law, you wouldn't need to

14

rely on deference.

15

MR. FARR:

Well, in the end, I think, in the

16

commercial setting, there is a reasonable chance, not

17

necessarily certain because you do have the UCC and you

18

have the possibility, in those situations, the courts

19

might say, in a commercial setting, we are going to pay

20

more attention to the parties' efforts to structure

21

their contracts in a particular way, so that between

22

them, we are going to treat the contract differently.

23

All our position is, is that Commerce, in applying the

24

antidumping law to protect a third party doesn't have to

25

observe the fictions in the parties' contract.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6

Thank you.

MS. HALLIGAN:

Ms. Halligan.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

I would like to start with Justice Breyer's
question about the way in which the Department of

10

Commerce has treated transactions for the processing of

11

goods and the uncertainty that their position in this

12

case will cause, not just in this industry but across

13

industries.

14

As you suggested, Justice Breyer -- you

15

referred to -- the Department of Commerce has treated

16

processors who are called "tollers", in the language

17

that Commerce uses, as performing a service.

18

transaction for the sale of that service has not been

19

treated as a cognizable sale under the antidumping law.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the

And those have been cases

21

where the very same product is returned with value

22

added, right?

MS. HALLIGAN:

that is the case, Your Honor, but not always.

25

example, in the Taiwan Semiconductors case, which Mr.

10

company and did not and could not treat the sale by the

11

processor as a cognizable sale, explained that the

12

statute itself requires Commerce to compare the U.S.

13

price, which is called the export price, the price at

14

which a good is sold or imported into the United States,

15

with the price at which the product is sold in the

16

company's home market.

17

and cannot either provide all the essential components

18

of the product, because it's only providing the

19

processing service and not the raw materials, and

20

because it does not and cannot set the price at which

21

the product is sold in the United States, it is

22

therefore not the appropriate sale to look at that in

23

terms of the antidumping statute.

24
25

The Taiwanese company, which was the

The Department of Commerce, in its

And because a processor does not

That's -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do about

the substance versus formality question?
28
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, if you

Official - Subject to Final Review

do have fungible raw materials, why should it make a

2

difference whether the domestic company supplies those

3

to the foreign company or simply says -- gives them

4

money and says, buy them yourselves?

5

case, you would say that's a sale, and in the former

6

case you would say it's not a sale?

7

MS. HALLIGAN:

And in the latter

First of all, the Department

8

of Commerce has not until this case suggested that

9

fungibility of goods might make some sort of a

10

difference.

11

regarding flanges which were, according to the

12

Department of Commerce, fungible, they concluded that

13

the processing service there was not the cognizable

14

sale, the downstream sale of that product was.

15

In fact, in one of the cases that we cite

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

The analogy would be, with respect to a

bag of feed, run it all the way through the elevator and

through the mill, and wait until the product comes out

5

at the end, and then run another farmer's bag of feed

6

through.

7

That's economically impractical and JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, old mills used to do

that.

The farmer used to take his harvest to the mill,

9

and it would be ground right there while he was waiting.

about the economic transaction that requires that it -

That does not occur here.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's only -- that's only

15

true because apparently they use up all the feed that

16

they get.

17

to enrich more efficiently so that some feed was left

18

over, I presume you would not be here arguing that they

19

could not sell that feed on the open market even after

20

they had delivered the enriched uranium to the buyer?

MS. HALLIGAN:

The price terms of the

pays them cash and walks away with the product.

There is a very small

The utility comes to the enricher,

By comparison, in these contracts, the

10

utilities are providing something that is very valuable.

11

The feed company -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but why are they

13

providing something that is very valuable that, in fact,

14

could not be obtained by the enricher on the open market

15

if those were the contract terms?

16

in the -- in the -- I forget the acronym in the case

17

that you just described -- and we don't know -- we have

18

no reason to believe the enricher couldn't go out on the

market and buy it if, in fact, the utility didn't supply

20

the feed.

21
22
23

MS. HALLIGAN:

The enricher buys it

Those are very different

kinds of contracts, though, Your Honor.
The contract in which the enricher simply

24

provides some amount of enriched uranium for a price and

25

procures the feed, which is a sliver of the total
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contracts -- it's 5 percent even for USEC -- is one in

2

which the enricher is bearing the cost of the feed and

3

the risk of those price fluctuations.

4

The reasons that the contracts are

5

predominantly, almost exclusively structured as services

6

contracts by distinction is that the utilities choose to

7

manage the process of procuring fuel themselves.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure.

They would rather

manage the risk of price fluctuation than, in effect,

10

pay the premium that the processor would have to charge

11

in order to hedge against price fluctuation -

12

MS. HALLIGAN:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

That's right.
That's why they are doing

that.

15

MS. HALLIGAN:

And so, they go out into the

16

market and procure the feed pursuant to whatever

17

arrangements they have with their feed suppliers.

18

comparison, all they are coming to the enricher for is

19

the service of concentrating that positional isotope

20

into the assay -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

By

That is a way of looking at

22

it.

But another way of looking at it is because they

23

choose to, in effect, take the risk of price fluctuation

24

as preferable to paying a higher ultimate price, they

25

are simply, for that reason, choosing to pay both in
35

cash and in a -- a valuable commodity, i.e., unenriched

2

uranium.

3

You can look at it either way.
MS. HALLIGAN:

They are.

But they are

4

choosing to pay two completely different entities in two

5

unrelated and two unlinked transactions.

appropriate for the Department of Commerce to do what it

4

has done in the past, which is to treat the sale of the

5

sweater by the U.S. companies for $20,000 as the

6

cognizable sale.

7

The only thing that makes this case -

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MS. HALLIGAN:

10

Say it again?
In your hypothetical -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm talking about the --

11

I'm talking about the sale from the European mills to

12

the American department store.

13
14
15

MS. HALLIGAN:

That would be a processing

transaction.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

A processing transaction.

16

It has changed a value of $1,000 into a value of -- what

17

did I say -- $20,000?

18

And that's just processing?

MS. HALLIGAN:

Let me give you an example of

19

what the Department of Commerce has looked at.

They -

20

they looked at the processing of pasta.

21

there the manufacturer came to a company -- this is a

22

place called Certain Pasta from Italy -- it's referenced

23

in the brief -- the company came to the processor with

24

wheat and presumably whatever other products went into

25

the pasta, some milk or eggs.

And the -

The pasta was processed

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and made into pasta from the wheat and given back to the

2

U.S. company.

3

The Department of Commerce concluded that

4

the appropriate sales target was not the making of the

5

pasta, the processing of the pasta, but the downstream

6

sale of the pasta in the United States.

7

And that is what the statute requires.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

sale.

10

MS. HALLIGAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

They said that -

MS. HALLIGAN:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

When the pasta was

imported, there was no sale into the United States.

13

15

They said there was no

No, they said that But that's what we are

talking about here.
MS. HALLIGAN:

We don't disagree, Your

17

Honor, that there is a product that comes into the

18

United States, it's low enriched uranium.

19

statute doesn't target the importation of products.

20

in that way it is distinct from the companion statute,

21

the countervailing duty statute.

antidumping statute, covers is the sale of merchandise

23

into the United States.

7

Was the holding of that case that there was no

MS. HALLIGAN:

The question before Commerce

8

was which transaction is the appropriate transaction for

9

us to treat as -- as the one that establishes the price

10

all over the United States.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a different issue.

12

We are not talking here about which transaction

13

establishes the price.

14

whether there was a sale into the United States.

15

We are talking simply about

MS. HALLIGAN:

It turns on the same issue,

16

Your Honor, and here's why.

17

cases that the Department of Commerce has looked at,

18

they have explained that the reason why the cognizable

19

sale is the sale of the finished product in the United

20

States, the pasta, the sweater, or whatever it may be,

21

is because the statute gets at price discrimination.

22

And it instructs the Department to look at the price at

23

which the product is sold in the United States.

24
25

In all of these processing

The price for the weaving of the sweaters,
even if it does add the sort of value that you are
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

talking about, is not the price at which the product is

2

sold, nor does it reflect all of the components of the

3

transaction, because there is some components that the

4

wool request.

5

discrimination, you have to look apples to apples at

6

which the product is sold in the United States.

7

So to determine whether there is price

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, wait.

Suppose these

8

knitting mills in my example, in fact, are selling their

9

sweaters for a much higher price in Europe.

Instead of

10

$20,000 for this batch of wool, in Europe they are

11

selling it for $40,000.

12

wool back into the United States for only $20,000.

13

And they nonetheless sell the

You are telling me that that transaction

14

doesn't -- doesn't count for purposes of our antidumping

law?

MS. HALLIGAN:

To the extent that it may -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That you have to look at

the price at which the department store then sells to

That's right.

It's -- it's the knitting mills that are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MS. HALLIGAN:

But the question, Your Honor,

2

is -- is the price at which the product is sold in the

3

United States.

4

and "constructed export price" as the price at which the

5

subject merchandise is first sold in the United States.

6

And that is what you have to look at.

7

Section 1677(a) defines "export price"

It may certainly be true that you may be

8

able to sell a product at less than its fair value to

9

the extent that you are obtaining processing services at

10

a price lower than what you could obtain them in a

11

foreign country.

12

to look at what the statute explicitly instructs, at the

13

price at which the subject merchandise is sold in the

14

United States.

15

But the -- the bottom line is you have

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

And accepting that,

16

you -- you have to begin the whole thing, however, with

17

a sale, with a sale into the United States, right?

18

MS. HALLIGAN:

A sale and I -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I thought this is -

purposes of calculating the price.

12

And so in choosing between those two, either

13

of which it could have chosen, it chose the latter sale,

14

the final sale, because that's how they could calculate

15

the price.

But in your case there is no such person A,

because the utilities are not people who could be

And then it starts an

invidious JUSTICE BREYER:

And what is the answer to

1

that?

2

MS. HALLIGAN:

And here is why that's not

3

sufficient.

It's the problem of the tail wagging the

4

dog, right?

What the United States is saying is that

5

because in this single circumstance we do not have a

6

downstream sale of pasta, or a sweater, or whatever the

7

item might be, and we can't go after that transaction,

8

that, therefore, we are asking this Court to sign off on

9

essentially rewriting the statute.

10

The statute refers to a sale of merchandise.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

But, remember, they

are saying in the tolling cases, in my words:

could have gone after the processor if we wanted -

Hey, we

concept of "sale" is the word "substantial"

18

transformation.

19

MS. HALLIGAN:

Two responses, Your Honor:

20

First of all, the statute doesn't allow

21

that, and I would recommend to the court the remand

I would like to -- to return to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't it true that in all

of identifying just which one here, but they wouldn't

care because they are all equally valuable, and if it

developed that it was actually a third party's product

that was being processed, then there would be a transfer

of ownership, and there clearly would be a sale.

that fact.

But, secondly, if you look at the common law

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, isn't it true, if

you can't tell, the odds are that there is some product

No, I -- I think you

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I would like to touch briefly, if I can, on

2

the purpose of the statute, because the government

3

relies very strongly on this notion that somehow the

4

processors' sales have to cognizable in order to further

5

the antidumping statute.

6

This law is not a boundless license to

7

protect domestic industry from any competition.

8

are other statutes that are are written much more

9

broadly in the trade laws; for example, the

There

10

countervailing duties law, the safeguards law which

11

allows the Department of Commerce to impose quotas or

12

tariffs on the import -- not the sale but the import of

13

any goods, statutes regarding the protection of

14

intellect0ual property rights, all of which are cited in

15

the -- in the briefs.

16

So the notion that somehow to protect the

17

integrity of the statute you need to rewrite it to allow

18

them to address processing sales exclusively is really

19

not -- not well-founded.

20

Finally, with respect to the loophole

21

question that the government has relied on, I think it's

22

important to focus on what is specifically at issue

23

here.

24

critical to address this case and these particular

25

transactions because of concerns about agreements with

think it's really a central theme of their brief, is
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that utilities come to the enricher for services and not

2

for goods.

3

acquire, I think it may be helpful to ask:

4

circumstances would the utility have a valid breach-of

5

contract right?

6

And to understand what it is that utilities
Under what

And it is very clear that the enricher's

7

obligation under the contract is to deliver a specified

8

quantity and assay of enriched uranium at a specified

9

time and place.

And if the enricher complies with that

10

obligation, it doesn't matter that the enricher decided

11

to -- what they call in the industry -- "overfeed"; that

12

is, use more feed staff stock and fewer SWU's to produce

13

the final product.

14

And the utility in that circumstance

15

couldn't file a breach-of-contract claim by saying:

16

paid for more SWU's than I actually received.

17

what the utility had contracted for was a given product.

18

I

Because

The second thing -- and I think the

19

corollary to that is -- it's potentially misleading to

20

say that every contract is either one for merchandise or

21

one for services, especially when you are contracting to

22

acquire ownership of a commodity that doesn't exist at

23

the time the contract is formed.

24

going to get to your ultimate objective is for somebody

25

to create it.

The only way you are

And that can generally be described as a
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

service, but it still results in the sale of goods.

2

With respect to the used-car analogy, I

3

understood Ms. Halligan to acknowledge that -- that that

4

would be a sale even though the consideration paid by

5

the customer is partly in cash and partly in kind.

6

if the customer and the car dealership characterize

7

their contract as one for car-refurbishment services and

8

said that the new car the customer receives shall be

9

deemed to be the used car that it traded in in

And

10

refurbished form, nobody would contend that that deeming

11

quality should be controlling.

12

Now here the -- the falseness of the

13

proposition that it's the same feedstock is less

14

apparent, but it's equally the case that the utility

15

doesn't receive back its original feedstock.

16

And finally the perspective of tolling

17

regulation in cases, Commerce has essentially said three

18

things:

19

First, we were dealing with a separate

20

question; that is, who is the producer, which sale is

21

relevant, and not whether the goods are covered at all.

22

Second, they said in those situations the

23
