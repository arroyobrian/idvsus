ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MS. WILLIAMS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The factfinding at issue in this case is

11

significantly different than the factfinding at issue in

12

this Court's recent Sixth Amendment cases, in which the

13

Court struck down changes in sentencing practice that

14

had the effect of removing factfinding from the province

15

of the jury.

16

meant that a defendant could be convicted by the jury

17

for one offense and then, based on nonjury factfinding,

18

the defendant could be sentenced for what appeared to be

19

an aggravated, more serious offense without the jury

20

having made all the factual determinations necessary for

21

that more serious offense.

22

In those cases, the change in practice

That doesn't happen in this case.

In this

23

case, the jury convicted Mr. Ice of six counts, and the

24

sentence imposed on each of those six convictions

25

satisfies the Apprendi rule.

There's no additional jury

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

factfinding that alters -- or nonjury factfinding,

2

excuse me, that alters a specific sentence for one of

3

the convictions.

4

case does is to significantly restrain the judge's

5

ability to decide how to administer those multiple

6

sentences for the multiple convictions.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Instead, what the factfinding in this

Well, but it -- it, by

8

reason of the unusual law at issue here -- -I think it's

9

unusual, I don't -- I'm unaware of any other State that

10

has one -- the sentences -- the defendant has an

11

entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently

12

unless a certain additional fact exists and that

13

additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than

14

by the jury.

15

we have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which

16

has the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the

17

defendant is entitled must be found by the jury -- if

18

you take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't

19

apply here.

20

So that if you take seriously what -- what

MS. WILLIAMS:

Justice Scalia, first on the

21

point in terms of how unique this statute is, there are

22

other States that have similar requirements, that there

23

is initial a presumption that multiple sentences will be

24

concurrent unless there is additional nonjury

25

factfinding that authorizes the judge to impose
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consecutive sentences.

2
3

So it's not entirely -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How many others?

Do you

know?

4

MS. WILLIAMS:

It's difficult actually to

5

come up with an exact count, and the numbers vary when

6

you look at how other courts have sort of combined

7

cases, but perhaps as many as 13, but as different

8

States have sort of changed their practice some of those

9

have fallen away.

It's clear that there's at least a

10

minority of States that have this kind of limitation on

11

what is otherwise inherent or a discretionary authority

12

of the judge to decide how to administer these multiple

13

sentences.

14

The difference is that what this Court has

15

been addressing in the Apprendi line of cases has always

16

been a specific sentence imposed on a specific

17

conviction.

18

expand that to say that, in addition to the statutory

19

maximum that this Court described in Blakely, there is

20

in effect a second statutory maximum that you must

21

consider when there are multiple sentences being imposed

22

for multiple convictions, and that's the total period of

23

incarceration that the defendant will serve with and

24

without the additional factfinding.

25

And what Oregon Supreme Court did was to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, this fact can 5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can turn out to be the most significant fact for the

2

defendant.

3

enormously.

4

facts that we leave to the jury.

5

I mean, it could lengthen his sentence
It's more important than many of the other

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, Your Honor, and in this

6

case, for example, the additional factfinding extends

7

the whole duration of the -- of Mr. Ice's period of

8

incarceration from 90 months to 340 months.

9

significant is that, as this Court said in Blakely, the

But what is

10

Sixth Amendment is a reservation of jury power; it's not

11

a limitation on judicial power.

12

not a limitation on legislative power, except to the

13

extent that that exercise of power removed something

14

from the province of the jury.

15

undisputed that the judge made this decision about how

16

multiple sentences would be administered.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I would submit it's

Historically, it's

But you could say the same

18

about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth

19

Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power

20

where at least there is an entitlement by law to a

21

certain lower sentence.

22

leave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that

23

trigger that law exist or not.

24
25

MS. WILLIAMS:

And there we said you can't

I think what's important is

the foundation for that holding and the foundation for
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Apprendi rule.

It wasn't simply that factfinding in

2

general that exposes the defendant to a harsher

3

punishment is something that should -- would be better

4

served by having it done by the jury.

5

because of the changes in sentencing practices, because

6

States and Congress have been taking what traditionally

7

had been elements of an offense and relabeling them as

8

something else, as sentencing factors, that the jury was

9

no longer finding what traditionally it would have found

It was that,

10

for each conviction.

11

would have been each element of an offense.

12

It was no longer finding what

So what the rule does is it provides a

13

bright-line way of testing what is the functional

14

equivalent of an element for a specific offense that

15

would have been within the province of the jury and

16

therefore that can't be removed without violating the

17

Sixth Amendment.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The rule -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The rule does bear on

20

culpability, and culpability sounds like part of the

21

definition of an offense or a more serious offense.

22

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, Your Honor.

23

And I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed

24

this case as in terms of -- that it may have simply been

25

happenstance that the Court was looking only at single
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

convictions and single sentences being imposed on those.

2

But I think that takes away the analysis that the court

3

used in reaching the conclusions that it reached.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't understand why

5

this happenstance is required to do it under the

6

statute.

I didn't quite understand that.

7

MS. WILLIAMS:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10
11

happenstance.

Well You said it's only

He has to do it under the statute if he

makes the finding.
MS. WILLIAMS:

No, what I'm trying to say is

12

that I think the Oregon Supreme Court viewed the fact

13

that so far in this Court's cases you had only been

14

dealing with a single offense and a single sentence, as

15

-- as not foreclosing the possibility that there would

16

be a different statutory maximum when you have multiple

17

sentences being imposed for multiple convictions.

18

so the supreme court, I think, treated it -- what I was

19

saying was it simply is happenstance that that had been

20

the -- the nature of the cases that this Court has

21

decided, but then drew from this Court's decision and

22

from discussion about punishment a broader meaning that

23

somehow the jury must be involved in any factual

24

determination that relates to the overall quantum of

25

punishment for multiple sentences being imposed.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, didn't we furnish the

2

premise for that broader reasoning?

3

out that the traditional role of the jury was standing

4

in effect as the buffer between the power of the State

5

and the individual, and our concern in the Apprendi

6

cases was that the concept of elements was being

7

manipulated in such a way that the jury no longer stood

8

in that -- in effect, that buffer position.

9

Because we pointed

And I guess the question here would be, is

10

there -- is there room for -- in effect, for

11

manipulation by the law in the consecutive sentencing

12

scheme or the potential consecutive sentencing scheme,

13

so that the jury in effect loses control over the

14

length, the ultimate length of time that an individual

15

is going to serve?

16
17
18

What is your response to that?

MS. WILLIAMS:

That the jury does not lose

anything that the jury historically had within its JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but isn't the problem

19

with that argument the problem that Justice Scalia

20

raised a moment ago, where you could have made the same

21

argument with respect to a mandatory State guideline,

22

but nonetheless, the change in the law brought to bear

23

on the new law an old concept.

24

the law, to be sure.

25

The judges -- once consecutive sentencing came in at

And this is a change in

I agree with you, historically.

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

all, they were free to, in effect, do what they wanted

2

to, subject to some kind of a rule of reason.

3

But we've got to apply the Apprendi concept

4

and the concern of the jury trial right to this new

5

situation.

6

well, the judge has never had such a -- such a power.

7

So I don't think it's an answer to say,

MS. WILLIAMS:

But there's something

8

different here in terms of looking back on history and

9

what we have presently, compared to when you are looking

10

at the offense-specific sentence associated with a

11

specific conviction, because the changes in practice

12

there had the effect of taking away the ability to find

13

an element or something that was the equivalent of an

14

element, of removing that from the jury.

15

historically, that is clearly what the jury's job was:

16

To stand in as a buffer between the defendant and the

17

government.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And,

So I gather from your

19

argument that you would -- you would be taking the other

20

side and you would be saying that it has to go to the

21

jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to

22

concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was

23

added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed

24

with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not

25

run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?

2

MS. WILLIAMS:

I think -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There it's attached to a

4

particular crime.

5

have a different result in that case from this one?

6

Do you really think that we should

MS. WILLIAMS:

No, Your Honor, I don't,

7

although I think that makes it a more difficult

8

situation to try to analyze, because there it is -- it

9

is focused on a specific sentence for a specific

10

offense.

11

adding to the penalty for that sentence, but adding to

12

how you are going to administer multiple sentences.

13

And the history here is very different.

14

Because what we have is, even though there wasn't a

15

statute when the Framers would have looked at this

16

issue, the issue did exist.

17

determination about how multiple sentences would be

18

administered.

19

have been a wide array of facts and without really

20

limitation other than -

21

But what is different is it still goes to not

Judges did make the

And what they would have considered would

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could say the same

22

thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up

23

to them and they considered a wide array of facts.

24

25

law and say they can't do more than this, once you do

So

We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, that fact has to be found by the jury.

2

what's going on here.

3

MS. WILLIAMS:

And that's

But I think what's different

4

is that the history at issue and underlying Apprendi

5

actually wasn't that the judge could simply make nonjury

6

factfinding and expand the sentence beyond what the

7

sentence was that was associated with the jury's

8

verdict; that, in fact, that was the problem.

9

once there was additional factfinding that permitted the

Because

10

judge to add to the penalty, that that had changed by

11

taking something away from what the jury's role was.

12

And so here we don't have that

13

same sort of situation.

14

exactly the argument this Court has rejected in those

15

cases of -- of -- where Faith and others have attempted

16

to suggest that historically judges were able to do this

17

and so it shouldn't matter now that we have changes.

18

But the Court rejected those arguments to say that, no,

19

because the sentencing practices have taken something

20

away from the jury, that is why we have the Sixth

21

Amendment violation.

22

I think that -- that that was

So if in this circumstance we

23

-- we have constrained judicial power -- and clearly

24

that's what this statute does, is it tells the judge

25

that, instead of being able to make this determination
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

based on this wide array of factual considerations, the

2

judge now is limited in what the judge must consider to

3

-- to then exercise discretion in administering these

4

sentences.

5

legislative restraint of judicial power without touching

6

in any way on the jury's historic role in -- in how to

7

deal with these multiple -

9

But all of that is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Am I right in -- I just

want to get the facts right.

Am I right, you did this

10

historical research, and if you start with Apprendi we

11

can go all the way back to Nebuchadnezzar and you

12

haven't found a single case ever where it was a jury

13

rather than a judge that made this question of how you

14

put together sentences for two separate crimes committed

15

on the same occasion?

16

overstatement?

17
18

MS. WILLIAMS:

It is an overstatement only

in the sense that I did not go back as far as -

Is that right, or is it an

I didn't say how far you

I said as far as you went back.

21

MS. WILLIAMS:

As far as I went -

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know what

Nebuchadnezzar found, but I take it you did look to see

24

what was true at the time of the writing of the

25

Constitution.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And at the time of the

3

writing of the Constitution, which sometimes some of us

4

feel is relevant, in that instance they did have the

5

judge, not the jury, decide how to create a total

6

sentence where the person had committed two crimes on

7

the same occasion.

8
9

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, exactly.

And that

difference in terms of the history of showing that this

10

was a judicial determination, that -- and now that the

11

factfinding -

12

I mean in both cases it was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. WILLIAMS:

But what this Court focused

2

on with the Apprendi rule is that, although judges made

3

decisions about sentencing within a range of possible

4

sentences, what judges could not do was to find

5

additional facts that were the functional equivalent of

6

an element of a greater offense.

7

happening with those new sentencing -

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that's what was

But we defined in effect

what was the functional element of the greater offense

10

in terms of the -- the power or the capacity of the

11

judge to increase the sentence beyond the range that

12

would have been -- that would have established the

13

maximum in the absence of that factfinding, right?

14

MS. WILLIAMS:

Correct.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

And aren't we

16

in exactly the same position here?

17

defendant here can correctly say:

18

to the more onerous -- under a more onerous scheme of

19

consecutive sentencing unless some fact is found which

20

has not been found by the jury in coming to verdicts of

21

guilty in any of these crimes; a further fact must be

22

found to expose me to the heavier penalty.

23

Because the
I cannot be sentenced

And that is exactly the same as the

24

situation in Apprendi with one possible exception; and

25

that is, do you accept, as I thought you did, the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proposition that consecutive sentencing is the heavier

2

penalty or is a more onerous sentencing alternative.

3

you accept that, I don't see how you would escape the

4

analogy with Apprendi.

5

MS. WILLIAMS:

Your Honor, I do not accept

6

that it is a -- an enhanced penalty for any of the

7

specific convictions.

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MS. WILLIAMS:

10

If

Everybody agrees.
And it would be -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you had a choice between

11

two concurrent sentences and two consecutive sentences,

12

you know which one you are going to choose.

13

know what is the heavier sentence or the heavier

14

sentencing option.

15

MS. WILLIAMS:

So we -- we

It does have certainly a

16

harsher effect on the defendant than serving each of the

17

sentences beginning at the same time.

18

same could be said in terms of mandatory minimum

19

sentences and the factfinding required for those.

20

But I think the

We obviously have cases where a defendant

21

facing a mandatory minimum sentence is going to be

22

confronted with a harsher sentence than he would face

23

without that additional factor.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the mandatory minimum

is at least within the range of sentencing possibilities
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the judge could impose anyway without any further

2

factfinding by the jury.

3

MS. WILLIAMS:

And depending on how you view

4

this in terms of if you are looking at it with an

5

offense-specific frame, each sentence imposed for each

6

of the six convictions is also within the range of what

7

the judge can impose.

8

those sentences begin does not take away from the jury's

9

role.

This additional piece of when

It does limit what the judge could otherwise have

10

done, and it does that limitation by requiring

11

factfinding.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the -- what

13

about restitution, forfeiture, taking a child and having

14

him tried as an adult?

15

about alternative drug programs?

16

I mean, I can think of five or six where there might be

17

a factual finding necessary to proceed to a situation

18

where the total amount of punishment is greater rather

19

than less.

20

What about probation?

MS. WILLIAMS:

What

What about diversion?

Yes, Your Honor, and we are

21

now litigating some of those very questions in light of

22

the Oregon Supreme Court decision about what is the

23

scope when you look beyond the specific sentence imposed

24

for a specific conviction and look at this greater

25

quantum of punishment 17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a lot easier to limit

2

it to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a

3

particular conviction as opposed to sentence for the

4

whole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles

5

that Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome

6

if -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to

7

sentences.

8
9

MS. WILLIAMS:

Although, Your Honor, some of

these Douse-Greene decisions that are made again by

10

nonjury factfinding do affect what the defendant's

11

period of incarceration is going to be.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And doesn't the sentencing

13

-- doesn't the Federal law define a sentence to include

14

restitution, to include what is the equivalent of

15

probation?

16

word "sentence" in the law which includes some of the

17

things that I mentioned, though not all.

18

I mean, there is a broad definition of the

MS. WILLIAMS:

Yes, Your Honor, and the same

19

is true for Oregon, that the sentence imposed and if you

20

-- the -- the judgments are set out in the joint

21

appendix in this case, that set out each of the

22

sentences imposed for each of the six convictions, and

23

you will see that there are a number of things in

24

addition to the term of incarceration that are a part of

25

that sentence being imposed.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you a question

2

that may seem totally irrelevant?

3

decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania was correctly

4

decided?

5

MS. WILLIAMS:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think our

I It seems to me under your

7

reasoning in your case you might say that case was

8

wrong.

9

candid and say so.

10
11

And I think it was wrong.

I will be perfectly

I think it was a very important

decision.
MS. WILLIAMS:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

12

that it is necessary to say that that decision is wrong

13

to be consistent with the position I am asserting here

14

or the decision in Harris, because there the Court made

15

a distinction between what the jury traditionally would

16

have been -- been doing and determined that that jury

17

role was limited to deciding facts that increased only

18

the -- the maximum penalty that the defendants faced.

19

And so factfinding tied to imposing a mandatory minimum

20

sentence is different.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, I understand.

But it

22

seems to me it is -- in the old common law tradition,

23

following sort of the reasoning in the case you relied

24

on, McMillan really should have come out the other way,

25

because the jury normally would be finding the facts
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that would allow the minimum -- the maximum to go up or

2

the minimum.

3

I forget which it was.

MS. WILLIAMS:

And -- and what I have done

4

is to start with the proposition that we have in place

5

the Apprendi rule as it has been construed in McMillan

6

and in Harris, but that this is a -- a very different

7

extension of that rule beyond anything that this Court

8

has addressed in these cases.

9

And it's an extension that doesn't have the

10

same historic support that the Apprendi rule has.

11

don't think that this Court needs to -- certainly this

12

Court doesn't need to consider what impact this would

13

have except for, I think, in accepting the Oregon

14

Supreme Court holding.

15

about the ongoing validity of McMillan and Harris.

16

-- and again, there are ways that you could certainly

17

distinguish that and retain those.

18

to focus more on the jury as factfinder instead of

19

focusing on what the jury's historic role was and the

20

Sixth Amendment as a reservation of the power that the

21

jury has, not somehow giving the jury additional power

22

beyond what it has whenever factfinding is involved that

23

is -- is related to a defendant's aggregate punishment.

24
25

So I

That to me does raise questions

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

But what it does is

And, of course, it's part

of your position that historically sentences were always
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consecutive, if you go way back.

2

MS. WILLIAMS:

But, Your Honor, in the older

3

cases we actually do find that they were -- there was

4

discretion for the judge to have the sentences be served

5

concurrently.

6

full effect to the jury's verdict of finding the

7

defendant guilty for multiple offenses, which

8

consecutive sentencing did give full effect to that

9

verdict.

10

It was viewed as in some ways not giving

And so it was in the nature really of a

11

mitigation that the judge could do to lessen the

12

severity of the punishment based on certain facts that

13

the judge would consider and then in simply exercising

14

the judge's discretion.

15

But what is important here, I think, is that

16

it was clearly something for the judge to decide.

Once

17

there were the multiple convictions, the jury's role was

18

at an end, and it was then up to the judge to make the

19

determination about how to administer those multiple

20

sentences.

21

jury's role in establishing that sentence for each of

22

the -- the six convictions in this case, then we have

23

not removed from the jury anything that would have been

24

incorporated within the Sixth Amendment.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so long as we are not changing the

You commit the crime in

You are then tried and found guilty
I -- I -- let's assume

Under the theory of the case that's
advocated by the Respondents, do you think that a jury
trial or some sort of finding would be required?
MS. WILLIAMS:

I think that if the -- the

12

law required the sentences be concurrent unless

13

additional factfindings were made, then under the -- the

14

rule announced by the Oregon Supreme Court and advocated

15

by Respondent that question would have to then go to the

16

jury even if it arises in -- basically in separate

17

proceedings.

18

So as you are sentencing in that separate,

19

second proceeding, it would still be a jury question of

20

whether those facts were -- were there that would allow

21

the judge to impose a consecutive sentence.

22

The Oregon statute treats that a little bit

23

differently.

It appears to give the judge discretion

24

when there is a previously imposed judgment.

25

States do it differently, though, and do require

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST G. LANNET

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10
11

MR. LANNET:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents yet another application

12

of the bright-line rule from Apprendi.

13

entitles a criminal defendant to a concurrent sentence

14

for each offense unless certain facts are found.

15

for three offenses a judge found those facts and imposed

16

a greater penalty of a consecutive sentence.

17

violated defendant's -- or the Sixth Amendment's jury

18

trial guarantee that the judge's authority to impose

19

criminal punishment must be limited by the facts solely

20

found by the jury.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Oregon law

Here

That

Mr. Lannet, there -

22

there is one significant difference, I think, between -

23

the-- in Apprendi it doesn't matter whether the State

24

labels something a "sentencing factor" or an "element."

25

Every one of those questions that goes into determining
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the maximum length of a sentence has to go to a jury

2

under Apprendi.

3

But when it comes to consecutive versus

4

concurrent, it's perfectly okay if a State says, our

5

main rule is consecutive, but the judge, if there are

6

certain mitigating factors, can make it concurrent.

7

it leaves the total things to the discretion of the

8

judge.

9

Or

And if we are looking at it from the point

10

of view of a defendant, the State says, well, we are not

11

going to make it totally discretionary because we want

12

to be more defendant-friendly; that is, we are putting

13

certain restraints on the judge.

14

seems odd to me about this case is the Sixth Amendment

15

is supposed to protect the defendant's right.

16

the State is saying, we want to give the defendant more

17

of a right.

18

but if you give me less of a right, it would be

19

perfectly constitutional.

20
21
22

So it seems -- what

And here

And he can say, that's unconstitutional,

It's that enigma that I think is very
disturbing about this case.
MR. LANNET:

Well, two points on that.

One

23

of them is that historically the jury trial -- the jury

24

found the verdict of guilt.

25

the potential penalty of a very significant consecutive

That, in itself, authorized

24
Alderson Reporting Company

sentence.

2

Oregon has made a different policy choice

3

here.

4

perhaps the context, that before this Oregon -- before

5

it had this statutory system in place, it had very

6

liberal rules regarding merger.

7

series of enactments in which antimerger provisions were

8

enacted so the defendant's criminal history would

9

represent more accurately the number of convictions the

10
11

And, to understand the full backdrop of it,

This was part of a

jury had found him guilty of.
Therefore, the defendants under -- in Oregon

12

law the defendant must receive a separate sentence for

13

each offense.

14

rise to the possibility of longer sentences through

15

consecutive sentencing.

16

an offense give rise to a discrete sentence, but whether

17

the -- the sentence is concurrent or consecutive is an

18

aspect of punishment for that offense.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the increased number of sentences gave

Because in Oregon not only does

In Oregon traditionally if

20

a burglar had broken into a house and while he was in

22

MR. LANNET:

I would be happy to submit some

I would need another day to do so.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Lannet, in -- in

7

connection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you

8

think that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute

9

which, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime

10

committed with a firearm, said that the penalty will be

11

30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not

12

commit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will

13

be 15 years?

14

Do you think if the -- if the statute were

15

framed in that way, that Apprendi would not apply and we

16

would leave it to the judge whether a firearm had been

17

used or not?

18

MR. LANNET:

I certainly it would raise an

19

issue about whether -- a different statutory

20

interpretation, of course, that if the State was merely

21

shifting a burden on a fact to the defendant to

22

disprove, I think that that would run into problems with

23

this Court's due process -- case law.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, regardless of who

proved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent

2

determination that he did not use a firearm could be

3

left to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?

4

MR. LANNET:

I think it would be very likely

5

if this Court looked at this State's interpretation of

6

the statute and found that the -- that the judge had no

7

authority to impose the greater sentence?

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't see a dime's worth

of difference between that and Apprendi.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

How are you to prove these?

I am always curious as to the defense policy as to why.

Stricter and stricter rules here, and I have a hard time

15

evidence that although you want to say that your client

fact they were just one thing and weren't separate

18

things?

19

detail in front of the jury?

20

If you have an actual case and you

I mean are you prepared to go into all that

MR. LANNET:

Well, again I think there would

21

be a question about whether that would be proper, if

22

that would be in fact shifting an element over to the

23

defendant to disprove.

24

create -

25

I think that that would

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, you are saying that the

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard they use here for a separate sentencing, that

2

it has to be a separate crime and so forth, has to go to

3

the jury.

4

MR. LANNET:

Yes, sure.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So I wonder if you

6

are prepared to put all those facts before the jury,

7

say, in a case where you want to say that it wasn't my

8

defendant who did it.

9

MR. LANNET:

Well, actually, Your Honor, a

10

decision affirming the Oregon Supreme Court at this

11

point would have little impact in Oregon.

12

to Blakely, the Oregon legislature enacted a statutory

13

scheme that gave back that enhanced sentence -- gave a

14

procedure by which they go to the jury, and it's either

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there historic evidence

2

that bifurcated proceedings were required before

3

Apprendi?

4

MR. LANNET:

No, but I think that this is

5

just a development of changing legislative choices in

6

identifying facts.

7

functional path to determine the scope of a jury

8

trial guarantee when the State attempts to relegate a

9

fact to a judge rather than a jury.

10

I think Apprendi articulated the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I get back to

11

the question Justice Scalia asked about Apprendi.

Is it

12

-- is it your position that if the offense, based on all

13

facts found by a jury, carried a maximum sentence of

14

30 years, but there was a provision that the judge could

15

determine that if a firearm was not used in the offense,

16

you would lower it to 10 years, would that pose a

17

problem under Apprendi?

18

MR. LANNET:

In Apprendi I am not sure

19

that -- that -- I mean it's a question of whether all

20

the facts have been found by the -- by the jury

21

authorize the maximum punishment.

So -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

the facts authorize a punishment of 30 years.

24

it's going to be a reduction, that's for the judge.

25

I would suppose it's not the problem -- we didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Then it does.

All

And if
But

Official - Subject to Final Review

interpose a jury between the defendant and the State

2

with respect to every element, but only those elements

3

that increase the punishment.

4

MR. LANNET:

Well, the potential penalty the

5

defendant faces -- and I think that if the penalty of

6

whether a gun is present or whether a gun is not

7

present, assuming that that would be enacted by a

8

legislature, I think that as long as -- I mean the core

9

question in Apprendi has been is the judge imposing a

10

penalty within the range authorized by the jury verdict.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The core question is is the

12

defendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a

13

certain penalty if a particular fact is found.

14

MR. LANNET:

Yes, sir.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the answer would be,

16

yes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't

17

use a gun to get a lesser penalty.

18

in the legal entitlement, as I understand Apprendi, it

19

means that it has to be found by the jury.

20

MR. LANNET:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And once you bring

Yes, Your Honor.
And in addition, it must be

22

true too that the defendant is entitled not to pay

23

restitution if the facts show that there was no money

24

taken.

25

You can convict him without finding that.

And you needn't, by the way, convict the person.

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So the same would be true of restitution.

2

We would have another jury to decide restitution,

3

another thing that has never been done; is that right?

4

MR. LANNET:

Well, if only because the

5

legislative scheme in place doesn't give the court

6

authority to impose restitutions based solely on the

7

jury's verdict.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

money was taken.

No, couldn't impose

MR. LANNET:

The Oregon appellate court

doesn't JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

The Federal

15

courts have not and I guess the same rule would apply.

16

Or what about forfeiture of a car used in the drug -

17

again, forfeiture, I guess, would take place with

18

another jury being impanelled to try the question of

19

whether there was a car; is that right?

20

MR. LANNET:

If -- if it was a fact that was

21

necessary for the punishment, I think that follows

22

within the rule of Apprendi.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. LANNET:

25

It's a punishment.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure which of these

11

things would actual follow from your rule and which

12

wouldn't.

13

MR. LANNET:

I think legislatively that the

14

general statutes would set the maximum penalty as being

15

punished as an adult and the juvenile system would be a

16

different type of system.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But they will say no one

can get this lower punishment for the juvenile system

MR. LANNET:

Yes.

But this Court looked at

20

that practice and decided that what was not at issue was

21

the legislative identified elements as being found by

22

the jury, rather the underlying concern, the core

23

concern, the position that this Court thought that the

framers wanted to enshrine in the Sixth Amendment is

25

that the judge's authority to punish is both created and

agency, you are subject to the policies of that agency

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the -- what

if the rule were that all sentences should be concurrent

unless the defendant has been convicted of a prior

7

federal offense and then the sentence runs consecutive

9

MR. LANNET:

Well, if that was -- if the

10

Almendarez-Torres prior conviction exception is a Sixth

11

Amendment issue, which the Court has stated that it is,

12

then I believe that there would not be required a jury

13

finding, much like if the legislature identified facts

14

that would be reflected in the jury's verdict, or

15

reverted back to the common law rule which gave the

16

trial court authority to impose consecutive sentences

17

merely on the basis of if there was a conviction.

18

think that the facts identified by the Oregon

19

legislature here are quite different than what would

20

qualify as the Almendarez-Torres exception.

21

exception -- the basis that it has if we rationalize

22

consistence with the rule is that a fact of a prior

conviction has already been established in accordance

with the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.

5

instructs that when the legislature does so, the

6

defendant has a right to have a jury find that fact

7

beyond a unreasonable doubt before the State can rely it

8

on and impose that greater penalty.

So, these are facts about the event

MR. LANNET:

Well, I think that it would

send a message to legislatures that they can enact

16

statutory schemes that have -- that allow for many

17

instances where consecutive sentences are authorized

18

based on the facts and that those facts do not implicate

consecutive sentencing the same sort of thing that they

5

were trying to do or some legislatures, Congress was

trying to do by the sentencing factors?

MR. LANNET:

I believe there's at least a

I mean, it seems to me patently

MR. LANNET:

Well, I think this Court should

15

not find those errors harmless beyond a reasonable doubt

16

for several reasons:

17

proof that it's harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and

18

has not attempted to do before the Oregon courts, the

19

appellate courts; it has not done so before this Court.

20

I think the Oregon Supreme Court necessarily concluded

that this -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I mean, is there any doubt

that he wanted to commit an offense twice?
MR. LANNET:

I think that praises an issue

of statutory interpretation.

I think that that is one

of the issues JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But statutory

interpretation questions aren't for the jury.
MR. LANNET:

You are right, Your Honor, but

5

they are the ones for the Oregon Supreme Court in this

6

instance, and the Oregon Supreme Court narrowly

7

concluded that the findings of the jury found -- did not

8

establish the factual predicate to impose consecutive

9

sentences; however, they did not go into a comprehensive

10

analysis of what precisely those facts are, and in fact

11

the State -- the Petitioner here is actively litigating

12

the meaning of the statutory provisions at this point.

13

So it really is unclear what precisely are the facts

14

meant by this -- by the statutory terms.

15

I think it would put this Court in a

16

position to interpret the State statute in the first

17

instance, and disagree with the Oregon Supreme Court's

18

implicit conclusion, because it's under a State

19

constitutional requirement and also this Court's

20

requirement that it cannot reverse a lower court unless

21

it concludes that an error is harmless beyond a

22

reasonable doubt.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It held as far as the

24

State constitution went, this is fine.

25

Federal Constitution that stops the legislature from
41
Alderson Reporting Company

It's only the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

doing this.

2

MR. LANNET:

Yes, I would acknowledge that

3

there is no analysis in the written decision, and that

4

is part of the problem because it didn't identify the

5

particular facts and conduct a harmless error analysis

6

for the benefit of this Court.

7

However, the court heard this case with a -

8

in a consolidated argument with State v. Gray, in which

9

it did address the State's harmless error argument and

10

recognized that, in Washington v. Recuenco, this Court

11

had said that a -- is subject to harmless error

12

analysis.

13

So, I think necessary in the Oregon Supreme

14

Court reversing the lower court's decision is that

15

conclusion that this error was not harmless beyond a

16

reasonable doubt.

17

Oregon Supreme Court decided State versus Hagburn -- and

18

I have a citation for that, if you like.

19

that is identified -- it addresses the State's harmless

by the victim, they could not conclude that a jury would

6

have found that.

7

And in light of the vague testimony

So I believe that the -- that to the extent

8

that the Oregon court has analyzed the statute, that I

9

think that it would -- it backs up the conclusion that

10

it found this not to be harmless beyond a reasonable

11

doubt.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One way of -- if you are

13

right about the application of Apprendi -- the Oregon

14

legislature could say as a main rule is we leave it to

15

the judge's discretion.

16

a sentence consecutive, the judge should take account of

17

the following factors.

18

MR. LANNET:

However, before the judge makes

That would be okay?
I believe so, if that kind of

19

statutory provision was interpreted like you are

20

suggesting, that the court has authority based solely on

21

the jury's verdict and is merely exercising its

22

discretion and there is no requisite factfinding or the

23

-- even the requirement to find a fact to impose a

24

consecutive sentence, then I think it wouldn't praise an

25

Apprendi issue.

MR. LANNET:

That doesn't give

Not an entitlement that is

I don't believe it would.

16

Ultimately, this case was just an

application of the Apprendi rule.

The State asked this

Court to replace that bright-line functional rule with

19

some yet unidentified criteria for identifying

constitutionally protected elements.

offered this Court with any suggestion of what those

22

constitutionally protected elements are except to say

23

that that fact at issue in this statute are not those.

24

At a minimum the State asks for an exception to the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARY H. WILLIAMS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MS. WILLIAMS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

What the State is advocating for here is not

24

an abandonment or a modification of the Apprendi rule,

25

but a limitation of the Apprendi rule to the cases in
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which this -- the circumstances in which this Court has

2

applied it so far.

3

as a bright-line test for deciding when a sentence for a

4

specific condition has satisfied the Sixth Amendment.

5

And the way it operates is the rule itself tells us what

6

are the necessary facts that the jury must find, and so

7

there doesn't need to be a new rule to determine what

8

are those constitutionally protected facts.

9

Apprendi rule does that for us by saying that any fact

The Apprendi rule has been applied

The

10

that exposes a defendant in a particular conviction and

11

sentence to a greater penalty based on -- that -- based

12

on a fact that the jury has not found, is the functional

13

equivalent of an element if we had looked historically

14

at what the jury's role was.

15

additional factfinding, if it exposes the defendant to a

16

-- a longer penalty, a greater penalty for a specific

17

conviction, it must be found by the jury.

18

how the Court has applied the rule to this point.

19

And so, therefore, that

And that is

So all we are asking is that the Court

20

clarify that that is the full scope of the Apprendi

21

rule.

22

what this Court said in Blakely, that the Sixth

23

Amendment is only a reservation of jury power.

24

what we have here is something that is entirely a

25

judicial determination -- that historically has always

And the reason for that is again, going back to

46
Alderson Reporting Company

And here

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

been a judicial determination -- and the only overlay we

2

now have is a legislative effort to regulate that

3

judicial authority through the mechanism of requiring

4

factfinding.

5

It's something that the legislature often

6

does, is to try to regulate judicial discretion by

7

requiring factfinding and by limiting the kinds of facts

8

the judge may consider.
