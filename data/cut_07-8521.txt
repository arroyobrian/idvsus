CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument this afternoon in Case 07-8521, Harbison v.

5

Bell.

6

Ms. Chavis.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANA C. HANSEN CHAVIS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. CHAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

This case is about a logical reading of the

12

statute's plain language, and section 3599(a)(2) that's

13

printed on page 1 of the blue brief provides that when a

14

state death row inmate seeks 2254 relief he shall be

15

represented by counsel, he shall be appointed counsel by

16

the federal court.

And that representation is governed

17

by subsection (e).

Subsection (e) that is on page 2a of

18

our blue brief defines the scope of counsel's

19

representation and also divides that representation by

20

two clauses that begin with the word "shall."

21

This case is controlled by the second

22

"shall" clause, which appears about four lines up from

23

the bottom of subsection (e).

24

that:

25

proceedings for executive or other clemency as may be

And that clause says

"Counsel shall also represent the defendant in

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

available to him."
We know that this means state clemency

3

proceedings because of the words "available" and the

4

words "or other."

5

like Mr. Harbison, the only type of clemency that is

6

available to him is state clemency, and in order to give

7

effect to the words "or other" that were used by

8

Congress we know that that must refer to state clemency

9

because the only type of clemency that the Federal

10
11

For a 2254 petitioner or defendant

Government provides is executive clemency.
Now, not only is the interpretation of this

12

statute controlled by the plain language, but this

13

interpretation makes sense, and it makes sense that

14

Congress would provide for continuous representation for

15

a capital defendant in that it fills a need, a gap in

16

representation, it's efficient, and it also helps to

17

improve the reliability of the death penalty as it's

18

administered in this country.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your interpretation

20

would make all of the provisions of subsection (e)

21

applicable in state proceedings, so long as there's been

22

a 2254 petition filed?

23

MS. CHAVIS:

No, Your Honor.

And if I may,

24

I would like to discuss the structure of subsection (e).

25

And I believe your question would go to the very first
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"shall" clause, which begins at line 3 of subsection

2

(e), and that would -- in that counsel that is appointed

3

under (a)(2) "shall represent the defendant in

4

subsequent stages of judicial proceedings."

5

(a)(2) lawyer, the lawyer appointed under subsection

6

(a)(2), that stage of proceeding that the representation

7

begins with is described in (e) as "all available

8

post-conviction process."

9

remainder of the statute, together with the applications

10

And for the

And then it goes on for the

--

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

12

are you reading, the first part, "available

13

post-conviction process"?

14

MS. CHAVIS:

Right.

Where

It begins at the "and,"

15

which is eight lines down or about seven lines up, right

16

in the middle of subsection (e).

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that doesn't

18

modify what comes before it, does it?

19

appeals?

20

proceeding things start all over then presumably the

21

appointed counsel represents the defendant throughout

22

all those new proceedings?

23

New trial,

In other words, if at the end of the habeas

MS. CHAVIS:

No, Your Honor.

With respect

24

to the habeas attorney the representation would begin

25

with the "all available post-conviction process."
5

Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that attorney did obtain relief for the defendant or the

2

federal court granted relief for the capital defendant

3

and that case were to return to state court, then of

4

course we're not talking about continued representation

5

of the federal habeas counsel because -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. CHAVIS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10
11

Why not?

Why not?

Well, because, Your Honor That would be a subsequent

-- a subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings,
his retrial in state courts.
MS. CHAVIS:

Your Honor, the retrial and the

12

trial proceedings that's referred to in subsection (e),

13

those are duties of counsel appointed under (a)(1) of

14

the statute, which is on page 1a, which would be trial

15

counsel for those defendants charged with a federal

16

capital crime.

17

We would not -- a habeas lawyer would not

18

participate in a retrial because -- for a few reasons.

19

The first reason is because of the statute and the

20

structure of the statute, which sets out the ordinary

21

course of the capital case, so that there's nothing

22

subsequent, no duties listed here that are a subsequent

23

stage for habeas counsel.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't see how that's

possible a plain reading of the statutory language.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

started out by saying you're relying on the plain

2

meaning of the statutory language.

3

MS. CHAVIS:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5
6

Yes, Your Honor.
How do you get that out of

the statutory language at (e)?
MS. CHAVIS:

It's in context with the whole

7

of the statute.

8

(a)(2) for that context for subsection (e).

9

With respect, we look at (a)(1) and

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -

So now you're out of the

10

plain language of the (e) and you're looking at the

11

context of the whole statute.

12

MS. CHAVIS:

Your Honor, I would submit that

13

looking at the context of the whole statute is in

14

accordance with also looking at the plain language used

15

by Congress.

16

in order to inform our -

17

And we do look at the statute as a whole

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's your answer to the

18

plain language of (e)?

That was your prime -- that was

19

the argument you started out with, that this fell under

20

the plain language of (e).

21

MS. CHAVIS:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do you explain under the

23

plain language of (e) why -- how you avoid the result

24

that once habeas counsel is appointed in federal court,

25

the counsel has to appear in all of these other

proceedings?

2

MS. CHAVIS:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

Yes New trial in state court,

etcetera.

5

MS. CHAVIS:

"In all subsequent stages of

6

judicial proceedings" is exactly what subsection (e)

7

states.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are including

then -- suppose that the result of the federal habeas is

10

that the State -- that relief is granted unless the

11

State retries the defendant in X number of days.

12

your reading I think would be the appointed counsel on

13

federal habeas would be responsible for representation

14

in all available post-conviction process, and that would

15

be an available post-conviction process.

16

MS. CHAVIS:

And

Respectfully, Your Honor, the

17

State retrial would be an entirely new case that would

18

not fall under "all available post-conviction process."

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would?

Tell me,

20

what would fall under "all available post-conviction

21

process" in addition to clemency and competency

22

proceedings?

23

MS. CHAVIS:

Your Honor, "all available

24

post-conviction process" I submit would be defined by

25

the 2254 or 2255 proceeding, now these together with

Counsel, please return to state court and

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but he couldn't find

13

it inappropriate, could he?

14

about the plain language of the statute, I don't see

15

there's much room for the district judge to say:

16

now, I'm not going to say that you have to participate

17

in further state post-conviction proceedings, the

18

unexhausted claim.

19

the statute the appointed counsel, say in an unexhausted

20

claim instance, would have to under the statute

21

represent the defendant in further State collateral

22

post-conviction proceedings.

23

If you're again talking

Well,

It seems to me under your reading of

MS. CHAVIS:

Well, Your Honor, again the key

24

here is that Congress used the word "appropriate" and

25

that's an easy legal standard for the federal judge to
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

determine.

2

post-conviction process or State post-conviction case.

3

It indicates "appropriate motions or procedures."

4

that would be for the federal judge -

5

The statute does not say State

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

So

I'm sure

6

I'm missing something here, because the statute does say

7

"all available post-conviction process."

8
9

MS. CHAVIS:

Yes, Your Honor, and I submit

that that is a reference to, if we look at (a)(2), where

10

it says, the very first line, "post-conviction

11

proceedings under 2254 and '55."

12

available post-conviction process, describes the 2254 or

13

2255 proceedings.

14

So that describes all

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're just

15

saying a new trial because you succeed on habeas is not

16

post-conviction process?

17
18

MS. CHAVIS:

No, Your Honor, not by a plain

definition of that.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well then, if you

20

look up earlier in the statute, it says "shall represent

21

the defendant throughout every subsequent stage of

22

available judicial proceeding."

23

MS. CHAVIS:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Yes.

under that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Why doesn't it fall

MS. CHAVIS:

4

back in the state court.

5

Yes.

Well, that's the key,

And a retrial would not be a
That would be an entirely new case

There's also a second reason why federal

6

habeas counsel would not represent the defendant in many

7

retrials or resentencings, and that would be -

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

subsequent stage of available judicial proceedings?

10

MS. CHAVIS:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12
13
14
15

Why would it not be a

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
Why is it not a "subsequent

stage of available judicial proceeding"?
MS. CHAVIS:

Well, under the structure of

the statute there's nothing subsequent JUSTICE ALITO:

Without using the word

16

"structure of the statute," because there I think you

17

get into lots of trouble -- and you started out by

18

saying the plain language of (e) and I'm still

19

struggling to understand what you're doing with the

20

plain language of (e).

21

MS. CHAVIS:

Okay.

Well, there is another

22

reason why federal habeas counsel would not do a State

23

retrial, and that's because under (a)(2), the clause or

24

the part of the statute that does provide for the

25

appointment of counsel, if there is already counsel
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

available then that appointment clause would not be

2

triggered.

3

If we look at (a)(2), which is on page 1a,

4

the trigger for the appointment of counsel is that we

5

have an indigent defendant.

6

7

financially unable to obtain adequate representation

8

shall be appointed a lawyer."

It says "a defendant who

No, no, no.

That

The language you just quoted is simply to

14

MS. CHAVIS:

Yes.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You are financially

16

unable so you get somebody appointed.

17

and say that person shall represent you through every

18

subsequent stage.

19

suddenly get somebody else appointed, you know, then you

20

can -- then he doesn't have that obligation.

21

Then you go back

It doesn't say that, oh, if you

MS. CHAVIS:

Your Honor, I would submit that

22

these circumstances that trigger the appointment do

23

carry through the appointment process in that, if you

24

look at the language used by Congress, it says "any

25

defendant who is or becomes financially unable."
12
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress was -

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the remand is for

3

State post-conviction review, and there is no attorney

4

available under State law for State post-conviction

5

review?

6

MS. CHAVIS:

Yes, Your Honor, then we would

7

be looking again at the first clause of subsection (e),

8

and we would be looking at the language used by Congress

9

-- "any appropriate motions and procedures."

10

And again, appropriateness is an easy legal

11

standard applied by the courts.

12

overseeing the case could determine whether to -

13

whether returning for that State post-conviction process

14

is appropriate.

15

determining that in order to aid its decision-making

16

process, it needs to certify a question back to the

17

State courts.

18

It would be just like a federal judge

those stages.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. CHAVIS:

And then we are at four lines

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. CHAVIS:

7

Yes, right.

Right.

I'm sorry.

Five lines up from

"Other appropriate," but as

13

far as what's covered by the first clause is concerned,

"appropriate" doesn't apply to that.

MS. CHAVIS:

The habeas proceeding.

Yes,

Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then why don't

16

we interpret the clemency provision the same way, as

17

being limited to Federal?

18

MS. CHAVIS:

Well, because, Your Honor,

19

Congress doesn't use the word "Federal" here, and if we

20

were to interpret it as -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But then the use of

"Federal" -- we were just talking about.
MS. CHAVIS:

Honor; however, when we look at post-conviction process

25

in (e), we have the context of (a)(2), that talks about
15
Alderson Reporting Company

post-conviction proceeding under section 2254 and 2255.

appointed who helps you on the Federal habeas -

7

presumably they do a lot of work, they get up to speed

8

on everything -- they ought to represent you through the

9

next stage of available proceedings.

10

MS. CHAVIS:

That doesn't seem to me a Once have you somebody

Well, Your Honor, and that's

11

true.

The interpretation of this first clause of

12

subsection (e) doesn't impact the second -- the

13

interpretation of the second clause, which says

14

specifically counsel shall represent the defendant in

15

those clemency proceedings that are available to him.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you see why --

17

I mean, if you say, well, the first part is implicitly

18

only federal, that makes it very hard for you to argue

19

that the second part is not also implicitly only

20

federal.

21

MS. CHAVIS:

Respectfully, Your Honor, I

22

would disagree, and that's because the words are

23

different, used by Congress.

24

in stating other clemency as may be available to the

25

defendant.

Congress is very explicit

Your Honor, that is my

16

position.

However, of course, again, the interpretation

17

of this first part of this statute is separate from an

18

interpretation of the clemency clause, but for two

19

reasons the answer would be no to that question, because

20

this statute -- number one, (e) does not specifically

set that out as a subsequent stage of judicial

23

"appropriate motions or procedures."

The very beginning of (w)

MS. CHAVIS:

Because, Your Honor, we're -

13

when we're talking about an exhaustion proceeding or

14

returning to State court, it can only fit under this

15

part of (e) that says that it would be an appropriate

16

motion or procedure.

17

could define a State proceeding under in this statute.

18

That's the only thing that you

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you step back and

19

look at the structure, it seems to me unusual that your

20

interpretation would be correct.

21

would be more likely that Congress wanted this counsel

22

to continue on in State proceedings, trials.

23

It seems to me that it

The clemency thing seems a little bit more

24

removed.

It's a different argument -- you know, we're

25

guilty, but show us mercy -- than what may well be the
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

same sort of argument on the subsequent State proceeding

2

as was raised in the Federal habeas.

3

writing this, I would want them to continue in the

4

subsequent State proceedings before I would want them to

5

continue -- before I would want to have them represent

6

the defendant in clemency.

7

MS. CHAVIS:

I mean, if I were

And I understand that, Your

8

Honor, but I think also, if we look at the

9

representation as it does occur in the real world, we

10

have the AEDPA, we have this Court's decisions that

11

structure the -- the capital litigation so that State

12

court exhaustion normally comes before the Federal

13

habeas process.

14

But, again, there are these two separate

15

clauses.

16

second clause goes to -- to nonjudicial proceedings,

17

including competency, because the Court in Ford v.

18

Wainwright indicated that we need not have a judicial

19

proceeding, a judicial determination of competency so

20

Congress has separated out competency and separated out

21

clemency, knowing that those are stages of a capital

22

case that come at the very end of Federal habeas, that

23

the Federal habeas counsel would be in the best position

24

to represent that defendant at that -

MS. CHAVIS:

However, in our -- my

reading of the statute, when we look at the subsequent

stage, exhaustion ordinarily comes before Federal

habeas.

contemplated that the Federal lawyer continue to

Would you argue that it says "in every criminal action,

it to Federal trials.
MS. CHAVIS:

Well, Your Honor, in this case,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

in (a)(1), we would -- because (a)(1) sets out the

2

factors that trigger the appointment of counsel, we have

3

to have a defendant who is charged with a capital crime,

4

who is indigent, and who otherwise doesn't have a

5

lawyer.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

It says he "shall

7

be entitled to the appointment of one or more

8

attorneys."

9

MS. CHAVIS:

That's correct, but, Your

10

Honor, for a State capital trial, for a State capital

11

direct appeal, the States do provide counsel, and

12

Congress would know that States have to provide counsel

13

under -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it still

is -- is unqualified.

16

MS. CHAVIS:

No.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And part of your argument,

18

not your only argument but a large part of your

19

argument, is since it is unqualified in (E), the last

20

clause, it has to include State.

21

the same about (a)(1).

22

MS. CHAVIS:

Well, you could say

Your Honor, certainly last

23

clause of (e) is unqualified and unambiguous; however,

24

(a)(1) there is a qualifier in that it says "unable to

MS. CHAVIS:

Oh, but -- but -

If the State provides

representation, then you don't have a federally

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -- so if the State

6

doesn't provide counsel, the Federal Government will

7

provide it, and the States can recede from their

obligation to provide counsel, right.

would have problems under Gideon -- if the States cannot

So long as he

that it says "executive or other clemency."

there -- there seems to be no federal clemency except

executive clemency, I guess.

Can Congress declare something that has been

authority for clemency.

weight on -- I mean, the problem arises because Congress

21

did not specify whether it was limited to federal or

state.

23

clearly meant to do when they said "executive or other

First, as Justice Scalia pointed out during

experience practicing in federal court and it requires

that federal judges exercise significant oversight of

the attorney's representation.

requirements for qualifications and federal requirements

for oversight make sense only if the proceedings that

We think, Your Honor, that a -- a

21

habeas petitioner who is coming to federal court under

22

section 2254 has available to him no proceedings for

clemency because the term "proceedings" -

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Even though the statute

says so in so many words?
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. JAY:

Well, it's -- I -- it's -- the

2

menu of services, if you will, set out in subsection (e)

3

applies both to lawyers who are appointed under (a)(1)

4

who are doing work in federal court for federal

5

defendants facing a federal capital charge and also for

6

attorneys appointed under (a)(2) who are representing

7

habeas petitioners under section 2254.

8
9

Because the term "proceedings" -- it is our
position -- each time it appears in subsection (e)

10

refers to federal proceedings before a federal officer,

11

a 2254 petitioner has available to him no proceedings

12

for executive or other clemency.

13

the services that are -- that are available to him under

14

subsection (e), which includes representation throughout

15

the 2254 proceedings.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That person can obtain

Now, supposing on the eve

17

of execution he wanted to apply for a stay of execution.

18

He'd be entitled to representation before a federal

judge, right?

That's correct, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But what if the federal

judge says, you have to -- under our practice you can't

get a federal stay without first exhausting your attempt

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

federal limitation is apparent from a number of aspects

12

of the statute, including the fact that Congress didn't

13

use the "federal" modifier anywhere else in the statute.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It could have used the

15

"federal" modifier very easily just by inserting the

16

word "federal" in places.

17

MR. JAY:

Well, if it had inserted the word

18

"federal" in some places and left it out in others, that

19

might be probative intent -- probative evidence that

20

Congress intended the -- the other instances to be

federal and State as well.

be federal only in nature such as every criminal

for that.

bar the lawyer from doing that.

13

There might be other sources of funding available; and

14

indeed, the same lawyer who need not be a federal

15

defender -- he may be a panel attorney appointed -- who

16

is in private practice appointed from the district

That -- does it seem reasonable to

impose that burden on the public defender?

11

MR. JAY:

Well, Your Honor -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Since you know as a

13

practical matter, because of professional responsibility

14

that person is going to represent the defendant in the

15

State court proceedings.

16

MR. JAY:

Well, Your Honor, the limitations

17

in subsection (e) are there for a reason, and it's

18

precisely because the State -- the State post-conviction

19

process that would become available under Petitioner's

20

reading of the statute is certainly not limited to a few

21

hours spent on the eve of execution in State court.

22

potentially could include returning to State court for

23

any form of post-conviction process at any time after

24

the Federal habeas application is filed.

2

that you've said.

3

any place it says Federal.

4

I mean, I don't understand three things
You said it says Federal; I don't see
It doesn't use that word.

Then you say it doesn't say Federal and State; in my

5

copy it does say Federal and State.

It talks about 2254

6

and 2255.

7

that once you appoint the person, and it's either State

8

or Federal, 2254 or 2255, that person shall also

9

represent the defendant in such competency proceedings

10

and proceedings for executive or other clemency as may

11

be available to the defendant.

So if I just read this in English, it says

QED, end of the case.

12

All right, now why isn't it?

13

MR. JAY:

I think it isn't, Justice Breyer,

14

because 2254 is not a reference to proceedings in State

15

court.

16

involves Federal constitutional issues and a Federal

17

constitutional challenge to the legitimacy of the -

18

A 2254 proceeding is in Federal court, it

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.

That's

19

right, because they are referring to people who are

20

under State death penalty or Federal death penalty, and

21

what it says is that they shall get a person to

22

represent them in these later habeas proceedings.

23

10

MR. JAY:

Well, Your Honor, let me answer

11

your point about Congressman Conyers first, because I

12

think that the suggestion in Petitioner's brief is that

13

Congressman Conyers was -- had misinterpreted the text

14

of his own amendment, and as we have shown, the text of

15

the amendment proposed by Congressman Conyers in the

16

House and the text of the amendment proposed by Senator

17

Levin in the Senate using the same -- using virtually

18

the identical language, each of them provided no funding

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think you are wrong about

that.

The reason I think you are wrong about that is

22

that that language to which you refer is language that

23

Congressman Conyers himself introduced in response to a

24

bill by Representative Gekus, and in Representative

Gekus's bill he referred, just like this one, to both

for the Gekus amendment, was to extend, not to limit,

4

what Gekus has done.

information, all of which referred almost uniquely to

6

State defendants.

That's then picked up in the Senate, and the

Senate, which is Levin, is trying to do precisely what

Conyers was trying to do in the House, which we know

from the fact that he said it.

11

Now, I can't find anything in that

legislative history that supports the statement that you

made on page 21 that this initially was meant to refer

21

is to be as capacious as possible when a Federal

that the proceedings for clemency in which counsel might

State clemency, because as we pointed out in our brief,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Jay, would you comment

4

on this general reaction I had when I read the statute?

5

I had the impression that most lawyers appointed under

6

this statute would be to represent defendants in State

7

execution cases, and there are a few cases where there

8

are Federal death penalty cases, but not very many

9

across the whole spectrum.

10
11
12

MR. JAY:

Am I right about that?

In terms of the numbers of

clients, yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you're primarily

13

dealing with the representation of State defendants in

14

capital proceedings, and the number of cases in Federal

15

proceedings where at the last minute there is a plea for

16

executive clemency is very rare.

17

particular provision we are debating here was really

18

intended just to take care of the rare case where a

19

Federal defendant is on death row seeking executive

20

clemency, and not even to consider all the cases in

21

which -- in State -- before -- that originate in State

22

trials, where there is a lot of applications for

23

executive clemency.

24

on that very narrow category?

25

And you think this

You think it was intended to focus

MR. JAY:

Well, we think the entire statute
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is intended to focus on when Federal rights and Federal

2

interests are at stake in the administration of the

3

death penalty.

4

clemency does not actually -- does not involve the

5

vindication of a Federal right -- or a constitutional

6

right at all, the number of instances where the clemency

7

process actually involves such a Federal case is a

8

limited -

9

And in the clemency context, because

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There are occasionally

10

Federal constitutional question and sometimes arguments

11

made in Federal clemency -- I mean, in State clemency

12

proceedings and Federal clemency proceedings.

13

MR. JAY:

There are sometimes such arguments

14

made but there is no such thing as a Federal

15

constitutional right to clemency, and indeed the

16

governor is -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But arguably there is

18

Federal right or constitutional right to a fair

19

proceeding in a clemency application?

20

MR. JAY:

Well, there is a -- in a capital

21

clemency proceeding, the Court has recognized a limited

22

due process right, but that is not the sort of right

23

that would be vindicated in a habeas proceeding at all.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Jay, I assume that

(a)(1), which provides for the appointment of counsel to
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conduct the trial in a capital case, would not have very

2

much application either, would it?

3
4

MR. JAY:

applies only in federal proceedings.

5
6

That's right, Your Honor, (a)(1)

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Only in federal capital

cases, of which there are very, very few.

7

MR. JAY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

So

8

many of the -- many of the provisions -- even on

9

Petitioner's reading, which places great reliance on the

10

subsequent stage language -- many of these provisions

11

such as pretrial proceedings, trial sentencing, would

12

apply only to the limited number of federal death

13

penalty defendants.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The government's principal

15

concern in this case is the possibility to potential,

16

assuming the Petitioner prevails, of appointment of

17

counsel in State post conviction collateral proceedings,

18

i.e., when there are unexhausted claims.

19

Sixth Circuit in bank addressed this, and in your brief

20

you indicated there is a number of additional claims.

21

Is that the principle thrust of your concern rather than

22

clemency?

23

MR. JAY:

Apparently the

It is the principle thrust of our

24

concern, I think that's fair to say, Justice Kennedy.

25

And that's because the word "proceedings," which appears
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

three times in subsection E, we think that either that

2

is limited to federal proceedings each time it appears

3

or it's not each time it appears.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You think there is no way

5

to interpret that the statute so that it could include

6

state clemency proceedings but only federal post

7

conviction review proceedings in judicial -- before

8

judicial tribunals?

9

MR. JAY:

We don't see a way to have a

10

federal limitation before judicial proceedings and not

11

have it before -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Surely, you could.

You

13

could put all I don't remember weight on the other

14

executive or other -- and you could say that's the only

15

provision where it's apparently clear from the text that

16

State proceedings were included.

17

Assuming you are wrong, that there are

18

non-executive State clemency proceedings, you are sure

19

that there aren't?

20

MR. JAY:

Well, our position, Your Honor, is

21

that in every State with the death penalty, the clemency

22

decision is made either by -- in most cases, by the

23

governor or gubernatorial appointees or by other

24

executive officials.

25

that gubernatorial appointees for that purpose might be

2

able to find no instances of, for example, legislative

3

clemency in the capital case.

4

But, there is -- there are no -- we have been

That is limited.

The constitutional provisions that the Tenth

5

Circuit relied on that there is such an institution of

6

legislative clemency, that's limited to treason against

7

the State, a noncapital felony or mostly noncapital

8

felony that we can't find a treason against the State

9

prosecution since the 1940's.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Of course, it would have

11

made sense for Congress to use to other -- as a way of

12

referring to the states simply because it would have

13

been a matter of indifference to Congress whether a

14

State process was executive or was other in some way, in

15

effect, just leaving the issue open as an irrelevance.

16

MR. JAY:

I think if your premise,

17

Justice Souter, were right, that Congress intended to

18

fund proceedings on both levels, then I suspect that

19

that is right, that it would be a matter of indifference

20

to Congress which form the State clemency process took.

21

But we think that Congress intended to fund only those

22

proceedings in which there are federal rights or federal

23

interests at stake, and State clemency proceedings do

24

not meet that qualification.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That still leaves you with

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the question that the -- what the words "or other" can

2

possibly refer to, given the present state of federal

3

law and federal constitutional law, unless they refer to

4

State proceedings.

5

MR. JAY:

Well, the phrase is -- the phrase

6

is ambiguous.

7

partially resolve that ambiguity, because as we have set

8

out in our brief and I alluded to earlier, they were

9

added -- they were added at a time when funding wasn't

10

We turn to legislative history to

contemplated for 2254 proceedings at all.

11

Even if that -- even if that weren't the

12

case, we would think that because of the impact on the

13

federal-State balance that would result from funding the

14

State proceedings, that that's not the kind of clear

15

statement that would qualify.

16

one of the two possibilities that we see for what "or

17

other" might mean -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I mentioned before,

Excuse me, what do you mean

19

by the federal-State balance?

20

somebody to argue against the interests of the State,

21

isn't it?

22

MR. JAY:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because this is funding

It is, Your Honor.
I mean, assuming the state

24

has convicted somebody, you are arguing against the

MR. JAY:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

That's true, Your Honor.
And the federal government

is funding that.
MR. JAY:

The federal government would be

funding that.
We see another instance in which there is an

7

impact on the federal-State balance, which is the fact

8

that if, on Petitioner's reading, the attorney must

9

return -- must go to State court or go into State

10

proceedings and continue the representation there, they

11

still answer to the federal judge who supervises their

12

appointment, supervises their qualifications, and

13

determines whether and to what extent they will be paid.

14

And of critical importance, the federal judge determines

15

when the attorney will be permitted to withdraw.

16

the federal judge may not permit such a withdrawal,

17

unless and until the federal judge can find another

18

attorney who meets the same qualifications for a federal

19

appointment.

20

And

So you would have, on Petitioner's reading,

21

an attorney appointed by federal court who would go into

22

State judicial proceedings and would be unable to ask

23

the State tribunal before whom he or she was appearing

24

for permission to withdraw from the engagement.

25

she would have to return to the federal court for that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just be clear on one

4

thing on your position, Mr. Jay?

5

the federal judge may not allow the lawyer to do

6

anything in an unexhausted claim, or does he have some

7

discretion?

position on that issue?

a -- have a position on that issue, because it JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that issue

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would arise more often than the issue we are fighting

2

about in this case.

3

MR. JAY:

It -- it might, Your Honor,

4

because the Criminal Justice Act applies to noncapital

5

cases as well.

But I have not seen it litigated.

And

6

so, I don't think we have taken a position on it.

But

7

that is -- that is a potential source for discretionary

8

funding.

9

But the suggestion that subsection E permits

10

some exercise of discretion because of the inclusion of

11

"and other appropriate motions and procedures," I don't

12

think that works in this case to cabin the necessary

13

implications of Petitioner's reading, because the three

14

categories of proceedings are judicial proceedings,

15

competency proceedings and proceedings for executive or

16

other clemency, and each of the examples from pretrial

17

proceedings down through applications for stays of

18

execution and other appropriate motions and procedures

19

fall into the category of judicial proceedings.

20

It is our position that those are to be

21

federal proceedings, not proceedings in State court.

22

Anything that is on that list, from -- again from

23

pretrial proceedings down through -- at least to all

24

available post conviction process, that is not

25

discretionary, and we don't think that the district
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court could decide that even though something were

2

available post conviction process, it was not to be

3

funded because the district court deemed it not to be

4

appropriate.

5

And many of the filings that a habeas

6

counsel might wish to make in State court, if the

7

Petitioner's reading were adopted, would fall under the

8

category of available post conviction process, a

9

successive writ of habeas corpus or a writ of coram

10

nobis, such as the one that Petitioner litigated in the

11

Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals while its federal

12

habeas proceedings was pending.

And if he

And I thought in the

There are some funds on the State

21

level, and I would like to come back to how Tennessee

22

handles that in a moment.

23

your question, the statute does not make clear that if

24

25

that he is no longer eligible for federal counsel under

But as a general answer to

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this provision, because he, after all, would still be

2

indigent.

3

in the Tennessee courts highlights the difficulty that

4

would be raised by creating a -- by permitting funding

5

for State proceedings.

6

And I think the situation that occurred here

The Tennessee post conviction defender is

7

authorized by statute to represent inmates under a

8

sentence of death in post conviction and clemency

9

proceedings in State court, and he has discretion over

10
11

the clemency portion.
The post conviction defender in this case

12

declined to use his -- to use his resources to represent

13

Petitioner in the clemency proceedings, because he

14

determined that he didn't have the resources and he was

15

focusing on other cases.

16

matter of Tennessee law that that option was available

17

to him but it's not been suggested that he was not

18

himself financially unable to obtain counsel.

19

So, there -- at least as a

So, in any instance like that in which there

20

is -- there are, in some circumstances, State-funded

21

counsel available, I think he would set up -- you would

22

create a powerful incentive for the State to say it

23

wishes to go second that allow federal -- allow federal

24

funding to come first and state funding to come second,

25

and for the federal government to respond in like
54
Alderson Reporting Company

measure.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's the government's

3

position, under this provision, even if -- even if State

4

funding -- well, as you say State isn't covered anyway.

5

MR. JAY:

6

Justice Scalia, is -

7

Right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Our position,

Assuming State funding is

8

covered, assuming representation in the State is

9

covered, it does seem to be the case that the test of

10

whether you get some Federal lawyer appointed is not

11

whether you don't have a State lawyer, but rather

12

whether you can pay for counsel, right?

That's strange.

And the ultimate test for

19

appointment is also based on when the defend -- at the

20

time the defendant is or becomes financially unable,

there is no reference in the statute to when -- to the
