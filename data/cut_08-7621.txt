CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

Mr. Stevenson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. STEVENSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

Joe Sullivan was 13 years of age when he was

11

arrested with two older boys, one 15 and one 17, charged

12

with sexual assault, ultimately convicted, and sentenced

13

to life without parole.
Joe is one of only two children this age who

14
15

have ever been sentenced to life without parole for a

16

non-homicide, and no child has received this sentence

17

for non-homicide in the last 18 years.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

Mr. Stevenson, there’s a

19

serious question before we get to the particulars of

20

this case.

Justice Kennedy suggested it in the last

21

argument.

This -- the time ran out for postconviction

22

relief in 1993, and this petition is brought in 2007.

23

There’s a 2-year statute of limitations.

24

said there’s a procedural bar; we don't get to the

25

merits of this case.

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, there are two

2

responses.

3

challenges to sentences, Florida law, under Rule 3.850,

4

makes it very clear that a challenge to a sentence can

5

be brought at any time.

6

I mean, first of all, with regard to

What the trial court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They said there's a

7

question whether that means an illegal sentence, like

8

the judge gave more than the maximum punishment.

9

have any indication in Florida law that correcting a

10

sentence any time overtakes the limitation on

11

postconviction relief?

12

MR. STEVENSON:

Do you

Yes, we cite in our brief

13

Summers v. State, which is an example of someone

14

challenging their sentence after this Court's decision

15

in Apprendi long after the time would have run.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

applied 39(a) and said:

18

it hasn't been made retroactive.

19

Except the court there

Yes, it's a change in law, but

MR. STEVENSON:

That -- that's correct.

But

20

the propriety of that determination is exactly what can

21

be -- is engaged in by the State courts, and that’s

22

what we simply sought here.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't that what the

24

court said here?

It said, first of all, Roper doesn't

25

command the results you are seeking; and, second, it

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't make its application retroactive.

2

really consistent with 39(a), the Florida court?
MR. STEVENSON:

3

So wasn't it

No, Justice Sotomayor.

The

4

only thing the judge said here was that I don't

5

think the reasoning of Roper can be applied to someone

6

serving life in prison without parole.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, that's an unfair

8

characterization.

What the judge said was Roper didn't

9

say that it applied to life without parole.

That's a

10

very -- vastly different thing than saying that the

11

reasoning shouldn't be applied.

12

choosing to, but that's not what Roper said.

13

MR. STEVENSON:

It said that we are not

But our argument -- and I

14

accept that.

15

dealt with the death penalty as opposed to life without

16

parole, but our argument was that the reasoning of Roper

17

is similarly applicable to someone sentenced to life

18

imprisonment without parole.

19

Our argument was we recognized that Roper

The trial judge could not evaluate the

20

procedural question without analyzing Roper, and that's

21

what the trial court did.

22

if Roper applies, Joe Sullivan is entitled to review.

The trial court conceded that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

But Roper was decided under

24

a regime, which I -- I think still exists, that death is

25

different.

How could it possibly be thought to apply to

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this case, which is not a death case?

2

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, because -- because

3

what the Court said in Roper categorically for the first

4

time is that kids are different, and in this context we

5

were arguing --

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

for purposes of the death penalty, which is different.

8
9

It said kids are different

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I think our argument

was that they are different for the purposes of

10

sentencing.

And what triggered this -- and this is why

11

this is relevant to this procedural question -- was that

12

the State of Florida did apply Roper to juveniles who

13

had been sentenced to death after this Court's decision.

14

And the case we cited to the Florida appeals

15

court, Bonifay v. Florida -- it's on page 38 of our

16

joint appendix -- was a case where Florida implemented

17

that law, and the law under Florida was that death row

18

prisoners sentenced at the time of Joe Sullivan --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. STEVENSON:

21

reduced to life in prison with parole.

-- had their sentences

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

Let me -- let me --

But this judge said:

23

Yes, there’s a Federal question in this case:

24

Roper render unconstitutional life without parole for

25

juveniles?

He answered that question: no.

And then he

said:

There is no other Federal question in the case; I

2

do not reach the question that you are raising, that is,

3

life without parole being cruel and unusual.

4

only Federal question that, under our rules, I reach is,

5

does Roper cover this case?

6

procedurally barred.

No.

Anything else is

7

What was wrong with that?

8

MR. STEVENSON:

9

All -- the

Well, because under your

precedent, if the question -- if the judgment of

10

procedural default is dependent on an analysis, an

11

assessment of Federal law, in any context, then it is

12

not an independent and adequate State ground, and that's

13

the basis on which we -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

Well, suppose arguendo we

15

assume that the judge is right, that Roper did not

16

establish a rule that applies in this case.

17

position are you in with reference to the procedural

18

bar?

20

Then what

Do you have any other arguments that overcome the

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, that is the rule would

21

still allow us to challenge the sentence under the no­

22

time restriction as it relates to the sentence --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no.

The only Federal

24

question in the case now -- or at least the preliminary

25

Federal question, the threshold Federal question, is

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

simply whether the State court was right about what

2

Roper did.

3

what Roper did, then the State's bar automatically

4

applies and that's the end of the case.

5

And if we agree with the State court about

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, yes, but if you agree

6

with the State court about Roper did, then we don't --

7

we are not entitled to relief under -- under either

8

theory, under a merits theory or a default theory, but

9

the point is --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, I don't -- I don't know

11

about that.

We -- is the argument here that, unless

12

Roper mandates this result, you don't urge that the

13

Constitution requires it?

I don't think so.

MR. STEVENSON:

14

No.

Our argument simply is

15

that the question that the trial judge dealt with here

16

was, in part, dependent on an assessment of the Federal

17

Constitution, whether the Eighth Amendment does

18

constrain a sentence like this.

19

We relied on Roper.

The court found that Roper was not available

20

to Mr. Sullivan when his case was on appeal, prior to

21

1993.

22

engaged in an analysis.

23

this -- and I just want to make this really clear, that

24

death row prisoners after Roper in Florida got a better

25

sentence than Joe Sullivan.

Based on that determination, the court then

They got life with parole eligibility after

2

25 years.

3

reasonable basis for Joe Sullivan –-

4

The argument was that that established a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought -- I thought

5

Simmons got life without parole.

6

Simmons's sentence was life without parole.

7

MR. STEVENSON:

I thought that

Simmons did, Your Honor, in

8

Missouri.

But in Florida, at the point at which these

9

sentences were being imposed, there was no life without

10

parole for capital murder.

11

murder could -- could only be sentenced to life in

12

prison, with parole eligibility after 25 years.

13

People convicted of capital

And so the question was generated by this

14

Court's decision in Roper, how is it constitutional

15

under the Eighth Amendment for the death sentence

16

prisoner to get life with parole after 25 years, and Joe

17

Sullivan at 13, convicted of a non-homicide -JUSTICE ALITO:

18

Your argument is that

19

because the -- the State judge had to decide whether

20

Roper dictated or required the result that you were

21

asking for, that -- that it's not an independent State

22

ground.

23

That's the argument?
MR. STEVENSON:

My argument is that if Roper

24

applied -- if Roper is relevant -- because what the

25

State courts of Florida have said is that when you are

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

looking at this question there are three things.

2

is it a rule from the Florida Supreme Court or United

3

States Supreme Court?

4

Two, is it a rule of constitutional -- of a

5

constitutional nature?

6

Three, is it a rule of fundamental significance?

7

all.

Which, obviously, this would be.
That's

We don't have to establish that --

8
9

One,

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but I'm -- I'm

interested in how we decide whether it's independent.

10

If you had cited -- if you said Marbury v. Madison

11

dictates this result, well, the judge would have to

12

decide what Marbury v. Madison required.

13

Federal -- that can be characterized as a Federal

14

question.

15

the State law ground not an independent ground?

That would make the -- that would make it --

MR. STEVENSON:

16

That’s a

No, Your Honor.

I mean, we

17

could say that -- that some rule that has to do with

18

antitrust applies, but the judge wouldn't have to

19

consider that, wouldn't have to evaluate that; it

20

wouldn't be determinative.

21

reject our claim without an analysis of Roper.

Here, the judge could not

The judge engaged in that, and let -- let

22
23

me just point out, this is not a case of procedural

24

default, State court ruling, we are now in Federal

25

habeas.

This is a question about jurisdiction.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The question that the State is raising is:

2

Does this Court have jurisdiction to review the Federal

3

question that was presented below, when the trial court

4

itself engaged in an analysis of Roper?

5

doesn't lose its jurisdiction to deal with a Federal

6

question when the State court analyzed that question to

7

reach its --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This Court

Well, that's true, but once

we analyze the question, if we decide, as the trial

10

court decided, that in fact Roper does not demand the

11

result in this case and, therefore, there is no

12

exception to the procedural bar of Florida, which makes

13

an exception where the fundamental constitutional right

14

asserted was not established within the period provided

15

for, once we decide that in fact Roper didn't establish

16

it, you're out of court, it seems to me.

17
18
19

Then -- then, automatically, the -- the
procedural bar of Florida applies.
MR. STEVENSON:

No, Justice Scalia.

The

20

other provision of 3.850 would still allow us to

21

challenge this sentence because it is a challenge to a

22

sentence, and Florida says that there is no time

23

limitation on the challenge of a sentence.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Then that would

completely overtake the specific provision.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, if

Official

1

you say the catchall illegal sentence, open to

2

challenge at any time, then there’s nothing left to

3

the specific provision that says 2-year statute of

4

limitations, unless three things.

5

MR. STEVENSON:

That's correct, Justice

6

Ginsburg.

Florida applies the provision, the construct

7

that, with regard to challenges to sentences, at least,

8

there is no time limitation.

9

We contend that the more relevant challenge

10

is generated by this Court's decision in Roper.

11

even without that, we are entitled to merits review, and

12

no one has argued against that.

13

But,

I mean, it's worth stating here that there

14

was no responsive pleading filed by the State in the

15

trial court.

16

asserted an affirmative defense arguing that these

17

procedural defaults be --

18

There was no responsive pleading.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No one

And you say the -- under

19

Florida law, the question is not whether the right was,

20

to use the phrase, "clearly established"?

21

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

or not -- it had -- what was your phrase?

24

significant bearing"?

25

MR. STEVENSON:

That's correct.
But the right is whether

That's right.

Alderson Reporting Company

"A

That comes

1

from Summers v. State, which is cited in our brief,

2

Justice Kennedy, where the court has made it clear,

3

because they have to sometimes engage in these questions

4

about what's retroactive, how does it apply?

5

They have done that with regard to Apprendi.

10

that in context, I don't think there is any real

exception for challenging -- for vacating sentences,

18

19

rule of 2 years’ limitation?

20

argument below?

21

MR. STEVENSON:

Did you make that

No, because at no point did

22

the State make any argument that we were barred or

20

particularly one as young as -- as your client, 40 years

moral development within a reasonable period?

23

MR. STEVENSON:

Why won't the next

Mr. Chief Justice, you may

24

get that case and this Court will have to evaluate that.

25

But I think here what we haven't resolved, which I think

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we have to resolve, is the question of whether life

2

without parole is unconstitutional, whether that's

3

excessive.

4

evidence to support that this Court should make that

5

finding, in part because of its lack of consensus.

6

There are only nine kids in the entire

And I think there’s a great deal of

7

country that have been sentenced to life without parole

8

for any crime.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but -- I mean,

10

you look at the Federal Government allows this sentence,

11

right?

12

don't understand how you can say there is a consensus --

Thirty-eight States allow this sentence.

13

MR. STEVENSON:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15
16

I just

Yes.
-- that this type of

sentence is unconstitutional.
MR. STEVENSON:

I think with regard to very

17

young kids, I -- I don't think we can say that the

18

States have adopted or considered or approached this

19

kind of sentence, in part because --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All you have established is

21

that there is a consensus that that sentence should be

22

rare, not a consensus that that sentence should not be

23

available, because most States make it available.

24
25

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I think, Your Honor,

that -- that the judgment that they have made it

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

available in some conscious way can't really be

2

defended, because no one who has set the minimum age for

3

imposing a sentence of life without parole has set it as

4

young as -- as 13.

5

question, they have never said that a child of 13 should

6

be subject to life without parole.

What they said is --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it would be -- it

8

would be reasonable under your approach to have

9

a different result in these two cases?

When States have taken up this

A difference in

10

terms of consensus or when sentencing is allowed would

11

result in a different result in your case than in

12

Mr. Graham's case?

13

MR. STEVENSON:

It would be conceivable.

I'll concede that.

It

14

wouldn't be desirable.

But, yes,

15

it's conceivable only in the sense that we know that

16

States like Florida that have created no minimum age for

17

trying children as adults, but have created life without

18

parole for these adult sentencers have created this

19

world where these things are possible.
But if you accept that Florida has adopted

20
21

life without parole for a child of 13, you also have to

22

accept that they have adopted it for a child of 6 or 5,

23

because --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
-- excuse me.

Alderson Reporting Company

It seems to me, once

It seems to me that

3

one way to take that into effect is through our normal

proportionality review and in a case by case.

5

your client -- his crime is horrendously violent.

23

permitted under State law, has worked well for children.

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, but -- but I -- I

And I think the problem with the

7

individualized review, as Justice Kennedy wrote actually

8

in Roper, is that in this context, age can actually be

9

an aggravating factor.

I mean, the Court could have

10

said in the death penalty context, let's deal with this

11

on a case-by-case basis.

12

proportionality review that's enshrined in our capital

13

jurisprudence.

14

We actually have a

States have to do that.

But we didn't, because we recognize that

15

there are distinctions between kids and adults that have

16

to be respected by our Constitution, that have to be

17

reflected in our constitutional norms.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I think --

Well, that's because

19

death is different, is what we said, and because death

20

is reserved, as this Court said in Roper, for the worst

21

of the worst.

22

not reserved for the worst of the worst.

23

And we know that life without parole is

MR. STEVENSON:

But I think it is, Your

Honor, for -- for -- for the kinds of crimes that we are

25

18
Alderson Reporting Company

1

reserved for the worst of the worst.

That's what this

2

Court effectively created with its decision in Kennedy.
And in that context, the same difference

3
4

that can be made between kids and adults in the death

5

penalty context, we believe, needs to be made here.

Murderers are the worst

Yes, they do,

does with homicide.

There could be distinctions that could be

The reason why we make that distinction is

because that there are legal distinctions.

There are

States that have set the minimum age for trying kids or

6

imposing these sentences of life without parole at 16 or

17.

We do recognize long traditions on the age of 14.

8

In the Court's opinion in Stanford v.

was a rebuttable presumption that children 14 and

12

younger could not be tried for felonies, that they were

13

incapable.

14

distinctions can be made.

And so, we are just arguing that these

What -- what about a

homicide, a 13-year-old?
MR. STEVENSON:

It’s our position that,

18

based on the incidence of these sentences, that even

19

between non-homicide and homicide, no child of 13

20

should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.

21

That is, only -- in 44 States, no child for any kind of

22

crime has received that kind of sentence.

notion that we -- we have to think about who children

are in the context of this -- for the crime of rape, the

MR. STEVENSON:

perspective and from a consensus perspective an absolute

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think in our construct, where we don't

always impose these sentences even for those horrible

offenders, to not recognize the difference between a

12

child and an adult is cruel and unusual.

parole, but to the 17-year-old you get 4 years and

you are released in 6 months, or to the 15-year-old

17

difficulty we have with the absence of a categorical

20

think that the States are capable of implementing them.

We cite Gerstein v. Pugh as an example where this Court

violative of constitutional norms, and the States were

empowered to implement that.

16

Annino study upon which they rely, which was generated

just this past summer, doesn't count a non-homicide

18

offense that happens to also be bundled with a homicide

19

offense.

dramatically.

And in addition, the States -- this is not

20
21

an easy issue.

The States have primary offenses and

22

secondary offenses.
JUSTICE BREYER:

23

So -- so in your example,

24

Mr. Smith was sentenced to life without parole for a

25

robbery.

Then you said Mr. Smith also killed someone.

30

Now, was he convicted of killing someone?

2

MR. MAKAR:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, and he was -Yes.

judge have in front of him the conviction for the

5

killing of the person as well as for the burglary or

6

whatever?

MR. MAKAR:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

could count that as a homicide offense.

10

Yes.

So I think I
I understand

your point.
Now, let's suppose that we take those out of

it; in other words, for argument's purpose, concede

13

that where there is also a homicide offense, it counts

14

as homicide, not in the set I am asking you about.
I’m asking you about the set of those

15
16

non-homicide offenses, life without parole, and they

17

were under the age of 18 when committed.

10

consider under proportionality analysis, how do you come

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your adversary

6

provided statistics to show that other people who have

committed rapes have gotten much smaller terms of

8

imprisonment, the average being, I think we were told,

9

10 years.

10

So explain to me why someone who commits a

11

rape is getting 10 years and this 13-year-old -- it’s

12

the most heinous crime for a 13-year-old that justifies

MR. MAKAR:

Well, when we look at the data

all kinds of factors underlying each of those

sentences, and we have hundreds of sexual battery

determination about the sentence.

Each one is unique, and each one

And there are very harsh sentences,

certainly, for some offenses and not for others.

take the notion that one could average them together and

and I think the fact that he took a quick look at the

law -- this Court said in footnote 10 in Harris v. Reed

18

that the trial court shouldn't be fearful of looking at

21

then in Tyler v. Cain, this Court had a retroactivity

And

In any case, there is a

circularity point here, I guess.

1

that there is a fundamental constitutional right which

2

we extend to this case and it applies here, and it

3

applies to the -- retroactively to those whose --

4

certainly those who are raising the issue, then we would

5

send it back and Florida now would not bar it under this

6

statute, because it would fall squarely within the

7

exception.

8
9

Is that right?
MR. MAKAR:

Breyer.

That's exactly right, Justice

If in the Graham case you have a categorical

10

rule that says 18 and under, then prospectively that

11

line is established, and Sullivan could file a

12

postconviction motion under 3.850(b)(2) and pursue it.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You did say in -- in your

14

brief that if Graham should prevail in his petition,

15

that Sullivan would get the benefit of that decision.

16

How, if we -- if we say -- just say there was an

17

adequate independent State ground and we have no

18

authority to do anything more, how would -- how would

19

Sullivan get the benefit of the --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

Would -- would

5

the standards applied in that situation be any different

6

than the standards that would apply if you prevailed on

7

his reading of the procedural bar?

8

MR. MAKAR:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm –I'm just trying to

10

see if this jurisdictional issue makes any difference.

11

If you are saying -- it sounds to me like you're saying,

12

well, if he wins, he wins, and, if he loses, he loses.

13

I don't think he cares whether it's under the procedural

14

bar or some other basis.
MR. MAKAR:

15

Well, I think that -- but his

16

winning would be hinging upon Graham, rather than

17

winning in this forum today, on a new claim, that the

18

trial court had no jurisdiction to consider in the first

19

instance.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If I understand you

21

correctly, you are saying he could lose here on the

22

procedural bar, and then win later in the State courts.

23

Is that right?

24
25

MR. MAKAR:

But that's premised upon this

Court establishing a new fundamental right in Graham, a

correct?

MR. MAKAR:

Well, I don't think that a court

establish the precedent.

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Carter v. State of the Florida Supreme Court, which I

2

think has a pretty good recitation of how the rule

3

operates.

4

And it may be that there’s a Fifth District

5

case they rely upon, where the -- the language is a

6

little squishy, but those are -- those are anomalies,

7

and they are not the rule in Florida.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, if it's not

consistently applied, then it's not an adequate ground.

10

If so -- if the citations are correct and Florida

11

sometimes treats it as rigid and sometimes doesn't,

12

then it's not a consistently applied -- not an adequate

13

State ground.

14

MR. MAKAR:

Well, there is no question that

15

3.850(b)(2) is consistently and regularly applied.

16

These other rules, I would submit, are consistently and

17

regularly applied.

18

The one -- the two Fifth District opinions

19

they cite -- I have looked at them and the language

20

there, it's ambiguous, it's not exactly clear, but I

21

don't think that the lower court, the lower appellate

22

court's rulings would override the Florida Supreme Court

23

who controls the rules.

24

They have rulemaking authority.

25

would throw out the adequacy of the -- of the State law

That, somehow, that

2

In conclusion, if there are no other

3

questions, we ask that the Court dismiss this on

4

jurisdictional grounds.

5

this case and the others, that -- that the questions

presented should be addressed and answered, which is

an interest in a case?

20

Should this Court intervene where a child of 13 has been

sentenced to life without parole, and there may never be

another example?

1

Frankly, we thought that the jurisdictional

2

question was a question that was pretty clear -- plain

3

on its face because the trial court's disposition of the

4

this case was completely dependent on its interpretation

5

of Roper, and I think that's what gives this Court

6

jurisdiction.

7

You have said, repeatedly, in

8

Ohio v. Reiner, in Ake v. Oklahoma, when the analysis of

9

a State procedural rule does depend on an assessment of

10
11

the Federal law, you have jurisdiction.
And I think that jurisdiction should be

12

exercised in this case to declare that this sentence is

unconstitutional.
