CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Case 06-562, United States versus

5

Atlantic Research Corporation.

6

Mr. Hungar.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In Section 113(f) of CERCLA, Congress

12

created a precisely drawn detailed mechanism for

13

potentially responsible parties to recover their

14

response costs from other PRPs.

15

circumvent the limitations that Congress imposed on that

16

remedy by manufacturing a parallel mechanism for

17

contribution-like relief under Section 107.

18

Respondent's theory should be rejected because it

19

violates fundamental canons of statutory construction,

20

renders Section 113(f) superfluous, makes a mockery of

21

the textual limitations enforced by this Court in Cooper

22

Industries, and would frustrate Congress's clear intent

23

to encourage settlements with the government in order to

24

achieve supervised effective cleanups.

25

Respondent seeks to

Respondent essentially asks this Court to
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

create a shadow contribution scheme under the guise of

2

Section 107(a) by borrowing all of the features of the

3

Section 113(f) remedy except the one that Respondent

4

can't satisfy, namely the requirement that contribution

5

be sought only during or following a civil action or

6

settlement.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hungar, was this

8

Court wrong in your view, it wasn't dispositive of the

9

case in Key Tronic when it said, "Section 107

10

unquestionably provides a cause of action for private

11

parties to seek recovery of cleanup costs?"

12

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, we agree that

13

Section 107(a)(1) through (4)(b), subparagraph (b)

14

creates a cause of action for private parties, in

15

particular the private parties who are not PRPs, who are

16

therefore other persons other than the PRPs who are the

17

subject of that statutory sentence.

18

sense.

19

the particular private parties who are trying to sue in

20

this case, that is PRPs.

21

So we agree in that

We don't think it creates a cause of action for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you think that when

22

the Court says this, it didn't contemplate that PRPs

23

would be included among private parties?

24
25

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, in Key Tronic, obviously

the Court was facing a different question so I don't
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think it was trying to in any way authoritatively

2

resolve this issue, as the Court held in Cooper

3

Industries.

4

Cooper -- excuse me, in Key Tronic that can be read to

5

suggest that the Court assumed or thought there was some

6

sort of remedy for PRPs.

7

referring to contribution or some other remedy.

8

Cooper Industries, the Court made clear that that was

9

dicta and that's in our view correct, because the Court

But I -- certainly there is language in

It's not clear whether it was

10

in Key Tronic was faced with a different question

11

altogether.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in

Who were the PRPs, or who

13

are the individuals other than PRPs who are likely to,

14

to avail themselves to the cause of action under Section

15

7?

16

to be someone other than owners of the land now, owners

17

of the land then.

18

actions?

19

That's one of the problems I have.

I mean, it's got

I mean, who's going to bring these

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, people who are -- who are

20

excluded by other provisions of Section 107 from the

21

category of liable parties would be entitled to bring

22

such an action if they don't -

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But can you give me an idea

of generally MR. HUNGAR:

A city that cleans up a site
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and that is not itself -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's not -- you know,

3

that's not a private party within the meaning of the

4

quotation.

5

MR. HUNGAR:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. HUNGAR:

8

under subparagraph (a).

9

No, it is, Your Honor.
Pardon?

It is, because a city can't sue
Only the State can sue.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's not the United

10

States of America, but we wouldn't normally refer to it

11

as a private party.

12

up in that, but can you think of any individuals or

13

corporations who are not likely to come in to one of the

14

four categories in 7 who would, who would take advantage

15

of this?

16

And -- but I don't mean to get tied

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

And first of

17

all, just let me make clear:

18

refer to private parties only; it says any other person.

19
20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Subparagraph (b) doesn't

No I realize that.

I'm

trying to -

21

MR. HUNGAR:

But with respect to private

22

parties in particular, any private party who was a

23

so-called innocent person under the statute, who because

24

--

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

Those are people who

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have a defense under the later sections of -

2

subsections of Section 7.

3

would fall within the first four categories.

4

MR. HUNGAR:

They are still people who

I think, Your Honor, that you

5

have to read the statutory sentence in Section 107(a) as

6

a whole, and what it says is that the people in these

7

categories, owners, operators, arrangers and so forth,

8

collect in the conjunctive, shall be liable for -- and

9

then under (b), any other necessary cost or response

10

incurred by any other person.

11

And that the other provisions of the statute

12

such as subparagraph (b) with respect to the third party

13

defense, subparagraph (d), subparagraphs that create -

14

I mean, I'm sorry, subsections that create various

15

defenses, what they say is if you satisfy this defense,

16

you're not liable.

17

liable parties, the category that is the subject of this

18

statutory sentence.

19

become an other person.

20

satisfy the defenses are other persons, and that's what

21

the lower courts have held in cases where this has come

22

up.

23

You are taken out of the category of

And therefore in our view, you
So people who are able to

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you know that when

24

they go into court.

Let's assume they bring the action

25

and the answer is well, you fall into one of the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

categories one through four, and the person says oh, but

2

I -- I'm not liable because ultimately I will have an

3

innocent party defense.

4

trial on the innocent party defense in -- in the cause

5

of action for, for reimbursement?

6

MR. HUNGAR:

7

collateral trial.

8

case.

9

Would we then have a collateral

Well, I don't think it's a

It's just one of the issues in the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I mean if that would be

10

the first issue, we'd have to try the innocence of the

11

person who was bringing the action?

12

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, I think the court could

13

obviously structure the issues as it saw fit but

14

certainly that would be one the issues in the case, but

15

again people in that category aren't the only -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well the -- the trouble

17

with having, I mean the trouble with that approach is

18

that whatever you, whatever may be the ultimate effect

19

of subsection (b) is referred to as defenses.

20

way you're using it the so-called defenses would be an

21

-- an affirmative element in the action for, for, for

22

cost reimbursement with is just -- and I mean it

23

certainly at the least would involve a very odd language

24

usage in the statute.

25

MR. HUNGAR:

And the

Well I don't think so because
8


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what the statute says is people, the people who are the

2

subject of the sentence shall be liable to other

3

persons.

4

rendered not liable -

And if someone by virtue of the statute is

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR.

7
8
9

HUNGAR:

Well, but you -

-- they are not in the

subject; they are in the other category.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well you've glided

over the great difficulty which is it doesn't say that

10

people identified in the statute shall be liable to

11

other persons.

12

certain circumstances, the United States, a State or an

13

Indian tribe and they are liable for -- for other costs

14

incurred by any other person.

15

the most natural reading of that construction is that

16

the other refers to other than the United States or a

17

State or an Indian tribe.

18

It says they will be liable to, under

MR. HUNGAR:

And it just seems that

Your Honor, that would

19

certainly be a -- a permissible reading of the statute,

20

were it not for the other "other."

21

in subparagraph (b) refers to any, provides a cause of

22

action or refers, really imposes liability for any

23

"other" necessary costs.

24

that other, the only other costs that that "other" can

25

refer to are the costs of governmental entities, the

The -- the statute

The other necessary costs -

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

United States and the States and Indian tribes under

2

subparagraph (a).

3

(b) makes clear that it's not talking about the

4

subparagraph (a) claims; it's talking about other

5

claims, because by definition the United States or a

6

State cannot recover under (b) by virtue of the first

7

other.

8
9

So the first other in subparagraph

Congress in the development of this
language, the first other was already in the statutory

10

language.

11

change, a compromise in order to get the bill passed and

12

reduce the onerousness of its provisions, and they added

13

the second other.

14

only way to give effect to the second other is to

15

construe it as we do.

16

Congress, at the last minute there was a

The only logical explanation and the

JUSTICE ALITO:

In the years since CERCLA

17

was enacted have there been any real cases in which a

18

party that you would regard as an innocent party has

19

brought a cost recovery action?

20

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, sir.

And actually there's

21

an annotation that, that collects the cases.

We haven't

22

done an exhaustive survey, but certainly the annotation

23

is -- which is at 12 A.L.R. F.2d 161 -- collects a

24

number of such cases.

25

addressed these questions and have, and adjudicated them

And the lower courts have

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

so this is not a novel suggestion.

2

has arisen because, because remember, under the well

3

established law of every circuit that had addressed the

4

question prior to the Cooper Industries decision, a PRP

5

could not sue solely under Section 107(a).

6

sue, they had to comply with the, the Section 113

7

mechanism, and the courts held that in order to avoid

8

the disastrous consequences that would ensue if

9

respondents or the court of appeals -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it's one that

They had to

What are -- what are they?

11

I mean as I read this, I can't get anything out of the

12

language.

13

more clear.

14

about contribution and it says you can get contribution

15

if there has been a lawsuit, and so forth, or if there

16

has been a settlement.

17

I mean the two "others" might just make it
So we have another Section 113 that talks

Fine.

Now the question comes up, well, suppose

18

there hasn't been a lawsuit or a settlement.

19

look at the language here, at least my initial reading

20

of it, it does not say.

21

These PRPs are liable to this other PRP or person there.

22

But it doesn't just say explicitly bring a suit, and it

23

doesn't say explicitly you can't bring a suit.

24
25

Now if we

It says that they are liable.

So I think well, why can't he bring a suit?
If he brings a suit how is the sky to fall?
11
Alderson Reporting Company

On the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other hand, if you don't let him bring a suit, they say

2

well, maybe the Government just -- will just stay out of

3

this.

4

because the Government is a big polluter.

5

not like to get sued often, so they will stay away from

6

the settlement and be home free.

7

The Government won't enter into settlements
And it would

So that's what they say on your -- on their

8

side, I think, primarily.

9

How will the sky fall if in fact they win and they can

10
11

What do you say on your side?

bring suits under 107?
MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, the sky will fall

12

because under that interpretation PRPs can evade the

13

settlement bar that Congress enacted in order to

14

encourage settlement, and Congress's clear goal in

15

providing a contribution remedy and providing an

16

explicit opportunity for PRPs to sue was to encourage

17

settlement with the Government.

18

reduce litigation, encourage settlement and Government

19

supervised cleanups, and so it created the settlement

20

bar in Section 113(f)(2), which, if a PRP settles with

21

the Government, the United States or a State, settles

22

for a response cost liability, it then has a

23

contribution action to -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Congress wanted to

How does it work with "or

a State" because I thought that there was some
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suggestion that States, they don't want to bother with

2

the Federal legislation, so they'll say you're okay

3

under the State legislation.

4

-- to take on that responsibility.

5

MR. HUNGAR:

You can't force a State to

Well, Your Honor in our view

6

what Section 113(f)(3)(b), the settlement contribution

7

provision, requires is that a State settle, the parties

8

settle with the State and resolve its liability to the

9

State for response costs which is a defined term under

10

CERCLA.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The States, we have a

12

brief from the States telling us look, we don't want to

13

put our money on that kind of thing.

14

high-risk sites and we want to spend our resources

15

making sure those are cleaned up.

16

MR. HUNGAR:

We've got very

Well, Your Honor, every State

17

has a voluntary cleanup program which encourages parties

18

to settle, and under many of those programs there is an

19

opportunity if they do the settlement to required

20

standards to obtain a discharge of liability from the

21

State for response costs.

22

those settlement agreements can't be written and they

23

often are.

24
25

And there is no reason why

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they -- they can.

Of course they can but the States are telling us that
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

this puts a burden on them that they don't want.
MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, the States already

3

have these programs in existence.

There is no reason

4

why the settlement language can't be written

5

appropriately and moreover, in many States, I suspect

6

most States, the PRPs are required to pay the costs of

7

the State that it incurs in monitoring and in ensuring

8

that the settlement agreement is appropriate.

9

of Washington, for example, which is here today, if you

The State

10

look at the web site of its Department of Ecology, it

11

has extensive procedures, extensive opportunities for

12

parties to come to the State, present the information,

13

obtain a settlement if they want -- if they will pay the

14

State's costs in monitoring and making sure that what

15

the PRP is doing is an appropriate cleanup.

16

what CERCLA should encourage.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's

There are Well, let's just go back

18

to Justice Breyer's question, because it was I think a

19

major point of the Eighth Circuit.

20

the United States, the United States is a big polluter,

21

could avoid its own responsibility by not bringing any

22

enforcement action and by not settling, and you -- you

23

said there would be a disincentive for the PRP -- a

24

disincentive to settlement, but you didn't answer the

25

question of why wouldn't the United States when it is a
14
Alderson Reporting Company

That is, they said

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

polluter and it would be responsible on this site, to

2

say well, we are going to, we are not going to settle?

3

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, two -- two responses.

4

Number one of course, if that happened, there is always

5

the State option, the States settled thousands of cases.

6

Number two, that's just not the way it works in

7

practice.

8

respect to these private, the private sites that we are

9

talking about.

10

EPA has the enforcement authority with

EPA has no incentive not to do its job

and every incentive to do its job.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, what about the -

12

what about the statement in the red brief that -- that

13

there is presently in existence a directive that EPA not

14

proceed against any Federal agency?

15

MR. HUNGAR:

I -- I think what Your Honor is

16

referring to is a directive perhaps that requires EPA to

17

obtain the Attorney General's approval before it will

18

issue a unilateral administrative order.

19

doesn't apply to Section 107, excuse me, Section 106(1)

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes.

We cite a number from the

Federal Register.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Now, has EPA during

7

the pendency of that directive gone directly against any

8

Federal agency?

9
10

MR. HUNGAR:

If Your Honor means filing a

lawsuit the answer is no -

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR.

HUNGAR:

No.

-- because in our view EPA

13

can't sue the United States.

14

mean definitely there are enforcement actions or -

15

proceeding.

16

clear, is that when it learns of a site, it learns of a

17

release of hazardous materials, it does a preliminary

18

assessment to find out whether this is a problem or not,

19

whether it's a problem that they should pay attention to

20

or if they should instead refer to the State.

21

it's of sufficient magnitude that it's for the EPA

rather than the State to deal with, they proceed to

Then why this case -

there's a point that was made by the Eighth Circuit, and

What they were trying to do was

not going to settle these things because they want to

Don't worry about it.

All right.

On your side, you're saying well, you know,

20

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.
What are they?

I'd just

Well, the first and foremost

21

way in which the sky is falling is that the court of

22

appeals approach, Respondent's approach would eviscerate

23

the settlement bar, because the whole point of the

24

settlement bar is to give parties an incentive to settle

25

with the Government knowing that they will be protected

from contribution claims.

I mean, isn't that something of a disincentive?

Before you can sue?

11

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, but the claim here is

12

that the parties want to pay the costs and incur

13

voluntary cleanup costs anyway.

14

settle first.

15

They just don't want to

So if I'm understanding your question -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

It would be one thing

if you skip away from a settlement without having to pay

17

any money.

have to, they have to shell out the money.

19

But in order to come under, under 9607, they

MR. HUNGAR:

Maybe I'm not understanding.

20

My point, Your Honor, is that there are tens of

21

thousands of parties who have already settled, shelling

22

out some money or not, with the EPA in reliance on the

23

unanimous view of the courts of appeals that PRPs could

24

not sue them because the contribution bar protected

25

them, Section 113(f) would protect them.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how sure are

2

you -- how sure are you that it doesn't protect them

3

still?

4

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, Your Honor, what it

5

applies to is contribution claims, and respondent and

6

Respondent's amici are very clear that they want is not

7

a contribution claim because they recognize that the

8

settlement bar would preclude their claims, but a cost

9

recovery claim, and Section 113(f)(2) says

10

"contribution," not "cost recovery."

11

clearly -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Those are very

Well, when one

13

responsible party has paid out the cost and is seeking a

14

cost recovery claim from another responsible party, it's

15

not too much of a stretch to call it a contribution

16

claim, is it?

17

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, Your Honor, if you want

18

to call what the PRP is seeking a contribution claim,

19

then we submit that it should be governed by the

20

traditional understanding of contribution and by

21

Congress's explicit terms defining what it wants

22

contribution claims to be.

23

some sense Section 107 imposes liability on PRPs to

24

other PRPs, it doesn't say what to do with that

25

liability and how you litigate it.

Even if you assume that in

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Section 113(f) is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

how Congress explicitly, carefully addressed that

2

question and when Congress has done so this Court

3

normally assumes that what Congress specifically said as

4

the remedy and delineated as the remedy, including the

5

limitations thereon, are what apply.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're not worried

7

about any of that when you're dealing with an innocent

8

party, the person you say can bring this action under

9

107(4)(b).

10

Don't all those same concerns and objections

apply in that case as well?

11

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor, because the

12

normal rule in American law is that innocent victims get

13

to sue the people who have injured them for recovery,

14

but the defendants, the liable parties, don't get to sue

15

each other except in contribution when it has been made

16

available.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you don't know,

18

you don't know, that you're dealing with an innocent

19

party until the end of the litigation.

20

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, that might be true in

21

many circumstances, Your Honor.

22

that we don't give someone who can establish they are

23

innocent party a right to full recovery and someone who

24

is not an innocent party is relegated to contribution.

25

But that doesn't mean

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Do you have another

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

example of an innocent party who can bring an action

2

under 107(4)(b) other than a governmental subdivision?

3

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

A party who

4

qualifies, who can show that under the third party

5

defense the hazardous release was not due to any, any

6

fault of their own, and can satisfy the requirements of

7

that defense.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

affected by the hazardous release.

10

MR. HUNGAR:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12
13

But they're somehow

I'm sorry?
But they're still

somehow affected by the hazardous release.
MR. HUNGAR:

Well, yes.

They could be a

14

subsequent owner, for example, under the bona fide

15

purchaser exemption or the third party exemption.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But my point is that

17

subsequent owner, EPA is going to start looking at him

18

as a PRP, not as an innocent party.

19

there is going to have to be an awful lot of litigation

20

before he can establish that he is not a PRP and is

21

instead an innocent, innocent party.

22

MR. HUNGAR:

In other words,

Well, they could also just

23

resolve it through settlement, Your Honor.

24

they could then proceed with their lawsuit or, if they

25

want to admit some minimal liability and obtain a
25
Alderson Reporting Company

And either

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contribution claim, they could proceed in that fashion.

2

But there are solutions to the problems that have been

3

identified under our interpretation, but there is no

4

plausible solution to the problems that their

5

interpretation produce, including eviscerating the

6

settlement bar.

7

largest polluters in America have lined up in support of

8

this view, because this will allow them to reopen

9

settlements and go after parties who thought they had

It's no surprise that some of the

10

paid up their liability and obtained settlement

11

protection by virtue of the Section 113(f) settlement

12

bar.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The person who settled,

14

wouldn't that person be protected?

15

say, this person has made a bargain with the EPA and

16

we're not going to extract any more from them?

17

MR. HUNGAR:

Wouldn't the court

Not if the claim is a cost

18

recovery claim under Section 107, because section -- the

19

settlement bar applies only to claims for contribution.

20

This is Section 113(f)(2), which appears on page 9a of

21

the appendix to our brief.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but to make the

23

statute work in harmony, to harmonize 107 with 113, it

24

seems to me that would be an altogether reasonable

25

position for a court to take.

If someone has settled

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and is protected by virtue of that settlement, then when

2

someone else tries to go after that same person the

3

court could say:

4

we're going to honor the settlement.

5

We have to make the statute work and

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, I submit if the

6

court were seeking go harmonize Sections 113 and 107 the

7

way to do it would be to give effect to the limitations

8

that Congress imposed on PRP remedies, but not merely

9

the settlement bar, but also the requirement that

10

actions be brought during or following civil actions and

11

settlements, and also the statute of limitations, which

12

the Respondent's theory would also permit them to evade.

If I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF OWEN T. ARMSTRONG, JR.

20
21
22

Thank you,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. ARMSTRONG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I would like to address the settlement bar.

23

One thing that the Court should keep in mind is that a

24

cost recovery action under 107(a)(4)(B) is an action for

25

restitution.

This is an equitable action.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

There is no

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jury trial under CERCLA.

2

as a court of equity.

3

pointed out, the court is empowered in any case, any

4

107(a)(4)(B) case, to accord settlement protection to a

5

settling party as a matter of equity.

6

simply as a matter of equity or, as we pointed out in

7

our brief, it may do so by virtue of a contribution

8

counterclaim by the settling party.

9

The district court is sitting

And as Justice Ginsburg just

It may do that

So the court, a district court, is empowered

10

to give full protection to any party who has settled so

11

long as the matters addressed a portion of 107 -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

How?

I'm not so sure

13

because -- unless you want to stipulate that that

14

restitution -- if you want us to write in the opinion

15

that in fact in a 107 action if one of the parties sued

16

has entered into a settlement he shall have precisely

17

the same protection from suit as if it were a 113

18

action.

Do you want to say that or not?

19

MR. ARMSTRONG:

Well, Your Honor, I believe

20

the district court as a matter of equity should accord

21

in most cases -- now there may be exceptions -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I would worry about

23

the equity.

I just want to know if you want to

24

stipulate that that's the proper interpretation, because

25

I could easily imagine a case where your client bought a
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beautiful golf course and he wants to turn it into a

2

golf course.

3

there and he spends $10 million on that.

4

the real fault is the Union Oil Company and I'm going to

5

sue them because they're the ones who dumped this and

6

they've cost me $9 million.

7

through precisely good luck and a brilliant attorney has

8

settled this very matter for one dollar with EPA.

9

Barred?

10
11
12

Unfortunately, there's a little mess under

MR. ARMSTRONG:

And he says

And it turns out that Union

No, Your Honor, it would not

be barred in that case.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah, that's what I thought,

13

and that's what he's saying.

14

that's why he has brought his second acorn, because he

15

said there's a huge difference here.

16

is if you get this 107 action you'll argue to the court

17

as to what's fair, but what 113 says is once you settle

18

with the Federal Government you're home free.

19

MR. ARMSTRONG:

That's what he's saying,

What you will do

Well, Your Honor, in your

20

hypothetical, spending one dollar, there is no question

21

that the court sitting in equity and also as a matter of

22

a contribution counterclaim would be entitled to review

23

the settlement and if that matter is in the matters

24

addressed, if it has been resolved by the Government -

25

and I should point out that in a settlement, settlements
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are publicly noticed, so parties have an opportunity to

2

object to any settlement which they feel is unfair.

3

presumably our golf course owner would be identified in

4

that circumstance.

And

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but there's

6

nothing, there's nothing unnecessarily unfair.

7

out that the Union Oil Company is bankrupt and in part

8

of the settlement they agreed to turn over all the

9

documents listing whoever it was that gave them the

It turns

10

chemicals.

11

we're dealing with people often in these cases that

12

don't have assets and only limited responsible parties

13

have the assets.

14

can from the others.

15

And it's a very complicated thing because

So they're trying to recover what they

MR. ARMSTRONG:

That is correct, Your Honor.

16

That would not be unfair any more than it would be

17

unfair in a contribution action, in which case the court

18

is directed to apply principles of equity in allocating

19

responsibility.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, almost by definition

21

a settlement is for the full amount that you'd have to

22

spend without the settlement, almost by definition.

23
24
25

MR. ARMSTRONG:

Well, that is correct, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

You don't usually settle

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for 100 percent of your liability.

2

MR. ARMSTRONG:

That is correct, and I think

3

Congress did write that into the contribution part of

4

the statute -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that means that in

6

every settlement agreement you'd have to engage in this

7

analysis to see whether or not it was fair.

8
9

MR. ARMSTRONG:

Well, I believe in every

settlement agreement the court would have to engage in

10

an analysis as to what matters addressed are for

11

purposes of the settlement.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

How are you going to choose

13

this?

14

a slightly awkward position because the Government is

15

saying that one of the reasons that you're stuck with

16

113 is because Congress didn't really want through 107

17

to give parties like your clients an opportunity to

18

review for fairness or equitable principles, whatever

19

you like, the settlements that had taken place with the

20

defendant in EPA.

could say, one, well, that's the way it is, we should

have a 107 action and we should review these settlements
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for fairness; or two, you could say one of the

2

principles of fairness is the principle that's written

3

into 113 about no review, and we're happy with reading

4

that into 107.

5

say?

6

So which is it that you would like to

MR. ARMSTRONG:

Well, Your Honor, that's

7

absolutely true, because I think one of the principles

8

of fairness is to solidify the settlement agreement.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

When you say that's

10

absolutely true, you mean absolutely true that you have

11

that choice, or is it -

12

MR. ARMSTRONG:

I believe that a reviewing

13

court should in each instance -- if a district court

14

decides to avoid the settlement, if it says that it's

15

not fair, I believe that would undercut the finality of

16

a settlement so long as it's contained within the

17

matters addressed.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, so then he's

19

wrong in thinking that the motivating force behind this

20

action is to permit people to get equitable review of

21

prior settlements?

22

not interested in that; you'll go with no equitable

23

review of private settlements.

MR. ARMSTRONG:

That is absolutely correct

2

in our case, Your Honor, and I think we've stipulated to

that.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But to talk about the

5

other polluter or the other in this case, where the

6

other polluter is not someone who is going to settle

7

because it's the Government itself -

8

MR. ARMSTRONG:

Yes, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So I don't think you're

10

in a position to concede anything one way or another

11

because that's not your case.

12

MR. ARMSTRONG:

That is correct, Your Honor,

13

because in our case, I think as we have made it quite

clear, all we are seeking in this case is to recover a

15

proportion of our response costs.

16

because we are not confronted with the issue that has

been posed -- I would not object as a matter of a bright

MR. ARMSTRONG:

107(a)(4)(B) would include

7

both PRPs and what we might call non-PRPs.

I believe

8

one of the amicus parties studies 364 cases between the

9

years of 1995 and 2000 and there was one case out of

10

that 364 that involved precisely your hypothetical, Your

11

Honor.

12
13
14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if we rule in

your favor presumably there will be a lot more, right?
MR. ARMSTRONG:

PRPs will certainly be able

to seek cost recovery under 107(a)(4)(B).

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. ARMSTRONG:

What about non-PRPs?

There are very few non-PRPs.

18

The only non-PRPs that I can think of is perhaps the

hypothetical you just advanced, because as has been

pointed out, the so-called innocent adjoining landowner

is a PRP, is a covered person under 107(a)(4)(b), and

between the time that CERCLA was passed in 1980 and the

13

held without exception, without exception, that covered

14

persons or PRPs indeed do have a right to bring a cost

15

recovery action under 107(a)(4)(b).

16

Courts

And Congress when it passed 113, was looking

17

at those cases only that had some doubt about whether

18

contribution could also be brought.

19

whether a party could seek restitution despite the fact

20

that it was compelled to do a cleanup via a lawsuit.

21

And some courts found that there was an implied right to

22

contribution, some found that there was a common law

23

right, but Congress in 1986 specifically said, we are

24

only concerned with the implied right to contribution,

2

that there would be no right to contribution unless it

3

codified that right, which it did in 1986.

4

the legislative history makes it quite clear that

5

Congress did not intend to disturb or to cut back on the

6

rights that courts had found consistently in that

7

six-year window between 1980 and 1986, all of which held

8

that PRPs indeed do have a right to bring cost recovery

to the extent, or at least you would agree that it was

affected to the extent that if there is a settlement

that correct?

once again, settling is not a disincentive in the sense

13

MR. ARMSTRONG:

I believe it does, Your

14

Honor.

I mean, I can't imagine language more broad than

15

that.

I do believe the first use of the word other that

16

opposing counsel referred to is to make it quite clear

17

that there can't be a duplication of liability.

18

Obviously a PRP that is exposed to liability in a case

19

cannot be required to pay both the Government and the

20

other party who is cleaning up the site.

21

And I would say that the second use of the

22

word other, which has become quite critical in the

Government's argument, the Government I think concedes

24

that the way the statute initially read in the first

And the addition of the word other, the

second other in 107(a)(4)(b) was to make it clear.

12

Otherwise, you're going to have a statute that says the

13

government can recover under (a)(4)(a) and (a)(4)(b).

14

So I do believe that the addition of the second word

15

other simply explained and clarified that the Government

16

was to bring its action under 107(a)(4)(a), not under

17

107(a)(4)(b).

18

And I think as Justice Scalia has mentioned

language that's in 107 now had been interpreted

4

unanimously by the courts?

5

MR. ARMSTRONG:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.
So that part of your case

7

is that, is to say that it's limited by 113 is to say

8

that there's been an implied repeal.

9

MR. ARMSTRONG:

10
11

That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Unless all those cases were

wrong.

12

MR. ARMSTRONG:

That is absolutely correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's not just a

14

legislative history point you're making, it's not just a

point as to what Congress's expectations were.

also -- it's also a point that relates to implicit

repeal.

MR. ARMSTRONG:

It's

It would be tantamount to a

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if the Government's

21

only strong point is that 113 is meant to coerce

settlement, and 113 didn't exist before, then it must be

23

very clear that previously 107 did give them a cause of

The States recognize that to

limited resources, and that's one of the reasons why we
