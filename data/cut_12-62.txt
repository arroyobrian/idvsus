We'll hear argument

5

States.

Mr. Kinnaird?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. KINNAIRD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KINNAIRD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In sentencing Petitioner Marvin Peugh, the

12

district court applied the 2009 guidelines sentencing

13

range of 70 to 87 months, rather than the 1998 range of

14

37 to 46 months applicable at the time of his offense.

15

Retroactive application of harsher guidelines passed

16

after the offense violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if

17

it -- if it creates a significant risk of increased

18

punishment.

19

Now, the government here objects that a

20

guidelines amendment does not change the law, but that

21

is incorrect.

22

define a term of a mandatory statute, namely subsection

23

(a)(4) of Section 18 USC --

MR. KINNAIRD:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

A mandatory schedule, you

say?

4
5

Excuse me?

MR. KINNAIRD:

No, it's a term of a -- of a

mandatory statute, subsection --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. KINNAIRD:

Oh, okay.
-- (a)(4) of -- of 18 USC

8

3553.

That provision requires the district court to

9

consider the guidelines sentencing range, and I'll

10

quote, "established for the applicable category of

11

offense committed by the applicable category of

12

offender."

13

So, in 1998, the guide -- that statute, the

14

law mandated that the district court shall consider, as

15

applied to Peugh's offense and offender category, a

16

sentencing range of 37 to 46 months.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's say you prevail,

18

and the case is remanded for resentencing.

19

anything that would prevent the district court from

20

saying -- you know, before the promulgation of the new

21

guidelines, I thought the range in the old guidelines

22

was about right for this offense.

23

Is there

But, now that I've seen the new guidelines,

24

I think that those really fit best under the factors

25

that I have to consider under the statute in determining
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the correct sentence, so I'm going to reimpose exactly

2

the same sentence, not because it's required by the

3

guidelines, in fact, I'm going to go outside the

4

guidelines.

5

the new guidelines have provided me, that that's the

6

best sentence.

7

I just think, with the enlightenment that

Now, would that be -- would there be an ex

8

post facto problem there?

9

MR. KINNAIRD:

No, it would not, Your Honor.

10

You would, under the statute, have to follow all the

11

steps in the Rita/Gall framework, but the district court

12

is always able to consider any new developments that it

13

wants.

14

And that was the point I was just getting to.

What we're talking about is the change of law.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not a change of the

16

law if -- if the law does not require the guidelines to

17

be imposed.

18

proposition you stated at the outset, which is that the

19

Ex Post Facto Law applies -- prohibition applies -- if

20

there is a substantial possibility of -- of a higher

21

sentence -- was that the language you used?

22
23
24
25

Your -- your case rests upon the

Significant risk.

9

punishment has to be tied to the guidelines?

10

MR. KINNAIRD:

Yes, I do accept that the
But

Well, the Court said, in

11

Morales and in Lynce, that -- and then when it was

12

reconciling two different formulations of the

13

standard -- and, in Lynce, the Court said it's the same

14

test whether you increase the penalty or whether you

15

determine if there's a sufficient risk of increasing the

16

penalty because that --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The real formula is --

18

19

prolonging the defendant's incarceration.

20

standard you would like us --

21

MR. KINNAIRD:

That's the

That's the standard of Garner

22

and Morales, yes, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And is -- is the heart of

24

your argument that there really isn't much difference at

25

all in what district judges are doing, now that the
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

guidelines are discretionary, than what they did when

2

they were mandatory; that is, most of them will start

3

with and stop with the guidelines.

4

I think that's --

5

MR. KINNAIRD:

Yes.

That -- that is

6

certainly one element of it, but the -- the fact -- it's

7

not exactly the same, but the fact is that, even under

8

the advisory guidelines, the change in law creates a

9

significant risk.

10

And when you're evaluating significant risk,

11

I think you have to start from the premise that the

12

ex post facto violation prohibits an increase in

13

punishment of any quantum, even of 1 day.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your -- your brief spent

15

some time on statistics, how often this happens.

16

take it you're not saying that our inquiry is a

17

statistical one.

18

statistics bear out that, as an objective legal matter,

19

the framework that you are explaining to us is and must

20

be followed?

21

But I

You're simply saying that the

MR. KINNAIRD:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- and

22

that's -- the inquiry in Garner -- in Garner, the Court

23

said, you can demonstrate significant risk either by

24

showing that the risk is inherent in the rule or as

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if you have a

4

law that sentencing judges must consider these factors,

5

and one of the factors is whether the defendant has

6

strong family ties that will be -- you know, jeopardized

7

or whatever, if he's incarcerated.

8

take him away from his family because that will penalize

9

other people.

10

You don't want to

And then Congress thinks that's not a

good idea and they take that away.

11

Is that an ex post facto violation?

It

12

increases the factors of -- or the risk that the

13

defendant will get a higher sentence.

14

take advantage of the fact that he had -- you know, a

15

particular family situation; later, he could not.

16

That's a change in what the sentencing court must

17

consider and is to his prejudice.

18

MR. KINNAIRD:

Before, he could

I think, if it is simply a

19

change in the mix of factors, even the mandatory

20

factors, it wouldn't necessarily create a significant

21

risk.

22

But the guidelines -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, under -- under

24

just a list of factors that the Court should consider --

25

or must consider?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. KINNAIRD:

Well, Your Honor, I think the

2

guidelines are distinctive because they are the actual

3

benchmark, and they must -- and the starting point for

4

any sentencing.

5

start your sentencing analysis, it's going to affect the

6

analysis, whether you're starting at a range of 20 to

7

30 months or 120 --

8
9
10

It is critical at what range you

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that -- is that what --

who says that they're the benchmark that you start with?
Where -- where is that writ?

11

MR. KINNAIRD:

That's in Gall, so that's

12

in -- a construction -- what's implied in the sentencing

13

format.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A court -- a court must

begin with that?

16

MR. KINNAIRD:

Yes.

Yeah, that's the -- and

17

the court not only must begin with it, it must be

18

cognizant of it throughout the process.

19

any --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And any --

So what if the --

21

what if the law said the court must begin with a

22

comparison of what the average sentence is across the

23

country, okay?

24

becomes more sophisticated, and they can give you a more

25

accurate number for what the average sentence is.

And the data collection, over time,

11

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

it turns out it's higher than what their informal survey

2

was before.

3

Is that an ex post facto violation?

4

MR. KINNAIRD:

I don't think necessarily so,

5

but this is a -- a requirement to actually consider a

6

range.

7

So if -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

It'd be the

8

same -- it'd be the same thing.

One of the things that

9

the Sentencing Commission considers is, of course, what

10

the average sentences were around the country.

11

let's say that the law says that's something you have to

12

consider, and the technology or the range of -- of

13

judges that they can survey becomes more sophisticated,

14

the number goes up.

15
16

MR. KINNAIRD:

And

I think it may be, if you had

the exact same Rita and Gall framework --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. KINNAIRD:

Yes.

-- and that -- that framework

19

is that that range actually is the benchmark and the --

20

and the starting point.

21

any deviation from that range -- and this is language

22

from Gall -- with "sufficiently compelling

23

justifications to support the degree of the variance."

The district court must justify

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

MR. KINNAIRD:

And so the answer --

And it is then reviewed on
12


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appeal --

2
3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so the answer to

my question is?

4

MR. KINNAIRD:

It would be -- I think it

5

would be likely if it were -- if it were within the same

6

framework, if it's the mandatory benchmark with

7

appellate review for substantive reasonableness and a

8

presumption --

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Go ahead.

11
12

Just -- I'm sorry.

MR. KINNAIRD:

And a presumption of -- of

reasonableness on appeal would attach to that standard.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So just getting more

14

accurate information violates the Ex Post Facto Clause,

15

in the framework that you've set forth?

16

MR. KINNAIRD:

I think if it's -- if you

17

could -- if it's an actual -- well, I don't -- the

18

distinction I was trying to draw is that, if you

19

actually -- if the -- if the statute has effectively

20

delegated the specification of a specific range, as

21

opposed to just a data factor that might change over

22

time, and that's the key change in law here.

23

As I mentioned, 1998, had to consider 36 to

5

And then you go to the test of significant

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the -- what if the

6

statistics showed that nationwide only -- let's say,

7

25 percent of defendants were being sentenced within the

8

guideline range; would that change your argument?

9

MR. KINNAIRD:

I think it makes the -- well,

10

we have an argument that's specific to our sentencing.

11

But if the -- if in a particular case, a defendant were

12

making an empirical analysis, that may diminish the

13

chance of significant risk, but with a caveat because

14

it's not just sentences within the guidelines range,

15

it's the fact that the district court, even if it

16

sentences out of the guidelines range, the ultimate

17

amount that it sentences to is going to be partially

18

determined by that mandatory benchmark.

19

that's an important point.

20

And that --

And, as I said, the significant risk is a

21

risk of any increase in the quantum of punishment.

22

it's really is there a significant risk that, had he

23

been -- had the old guidelines been in place as the

24

benchmark, that he would have gotten a sentence of less

25

than 60 -- 70 months.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think there's a fair

chance that, as time goes by --

3

MR. KINNAIRD:

-- I think it's clear --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- we're going to see fewer

5

and fewer sentences within the guidelines.

6

who began their careers during the guidelines, the

7

8

come in who never had to deal with the mandatory

9

guidelines, I think we're going to see fewer and fewer

guidelines sentences.
And -- and the percentages in some districts

12

are -- are really quite striking.

14

York, now, only 30 percent of the defendants receive

15

within-guidelines sentences.

16

So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

I'm told that, in the

You're assuming that's

changed over time.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

court of appeals we thought it was our responsibility to

22

ensure that the district courts were complying with the

23

Sentencing Reform Act.

24

across the river, but --

25

That might not have been true

(Laughter.)
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

It wasn't.

Let's say this case comes

4

back in 20 years and the statistics show that --

5

only a distinct minority of defendants are being

6

sentenced within the guidelines; would the case come out

7

differently?

8
9

MR. KINNAIRD:

Perhaps, but, again, this is

an as-applied challenge, so we look to current data.

10

There has been a very slight, gradual decline, but

11

there's still 80 percent of the sentences are either

12

within the guidelines or they're below the guidelines

13

range, pursuant to a guidelines sanction departure

14

motion from the government.

15

So it's an -- even the Sentencing Commission

16

attributes that relationship to the fact that it's the

17

initial starting point in the 2012 Booker report.

18

think it has a profound effect.

19

So I

Now, if the Court wanted to rule more

20

narrowly in this case on significant risk, it could.

21

And it could adopt a rule that, when the new and the old

22

guidelines ranges do not overlap at all, so that any

23

sentence that would be in the new guidelines range would

24

have required an upward variance, and, here, a

25

50 percent upward variance, those are as rare as hen's
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

teeth in the -- in the district courts -- that at least

2

shows, at a minimum, a significant risk, absent any

3

indication that the judge, as the question was posed,

4

wasn't going to apply them at all.

5

Here, the judge specifically and expressly

6

deferred to the 2009 guidelines.

7

significant risk was increased by this change in the

8

law.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's clear that the

Your -- your case depends,

10

it seems to me, upon the proposition that significant

11

risk is only applicable at the sentencing stage.

12

I'm not sure that that's true.

13

why would that be so?

And

I mean, what -- why --

14

What if -- what if you have a new law that

15

permits evidence to come in, in a criminal trial, that

16

previously was not allowed to come in?

Let's say the

17

testimony of a wife or -- or whatever.

I think the law

18

is pretty well established that that change in procedure

19

does not violate the ex post facto law.

20

And -- and your response to that is, well,

21

that's not sentencing; it's trial.

22

if -- certainly making a conviction more likely is -- is

23

even worse than making a higher sentence more likely.

24
25

MR. KINNAIRD:

So what?

I mean,

I think my response would be,

Your Honor, that's not -- that particular change would

Miller said -- in Miller v. Florida, the argument was

This is the

That is applied.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's a

But that was in the --

22

that Florida case was the mandatory -- almost mandatory

23

guideline, and I think our starting point is -- your

24

starting point, too -- is that, when the guidelines were

25

mandatory, it was ex post facto because our decision in
19

Alderson Reporting Company

3
4

the Florida case said it was.
Is this sufficiently different now that the
guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory?
MR. KINNAIRD:

No, Your Honor.

I think it

5

would still be a substantive standard, regardless of

6

whether it's binding or -- or whether it's advisory.

7

It's still a substantive standard.

8

in the substantive sentencing law, you go to significant

9

risk analysis.

So, if it's a change

10

And there you either look to the inherent

11

risk -- and I think there is an inherent risk in this

12

framework, that there's going to be some increase of

13

some quantum of punishment beyond what they would have

14

done if they'd applied the older guidelines as the

15

mandatory benchmark.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But saying that the

17

sentencer has to consider testimony from the victim or

18

from relatives of the deceased, that -- that change in

19

sentencing law is okay?

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would have thought you

would have gone back to Calder and Bull.

And Calder and

10

Bull, which this Court refers to all the time, in these

11

kinds of cases, has four categories, and the only one

12

that fits this case is a law that changes the

13

punishment --

14

MR. KINNAIRD:

Right.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and inflicts a greater

16

punishment than the law annexed to the crime when

17

committed.

18

they do not involve -- they are not laws that change the

19

punishment, but yours is a law that changes the

20

punishment.

So whatever these other hypotheticals are,

21

MR. KINNAIRD:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

It is a law that changes -Does it "affix a higher

punishment," in the words of Calder v. Bull?

24

MR. KINNAIRD:

I think it --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think that's a

23

question at all.

2

does not affix a higher punishment, does it?

3

The answer to that is quite easy.

MR. KINNAIRD:

It

But -- but the Court in

Garner, in Lynce, have equated that with increased risk

5

of significant punishment.

6

of Garner is that it recognizes that the Ex Post Facto

correctness that attaches to guidelines sentences on

I was getting to that,

Yes.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, this has, one would

think, great legal consequence.

18

MR. KINNAIRD:

It is.

And the second step

19

is substantive reasonableness review, and the Court has

20

held that an appellate presumption of reasonableness may

21

attach, so that -- it attaches only to this guideline

22

range.

23

you -- if you go outside the guidelines --

25

And that makes the risk of reversal higher if

sentences each year that are reversed by the courts of

MR. KINNAIRD:

deviations --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, even the fact of

2

unreasonable?

3

MR. KINNAIRD:

reviewed all those cases, Your Honor.

5

I'm not sure.

I haven't

I'm not sure.

So the -- returning to the -- the question

6

of this particular sentencing, I think if the Court were

7

to rule on a narrower ground, based on non-overlapping

8

ranges, which is not going to be particularly common,

9

here, is unquestionably a significant risk.

You

10

have a defendant who, prior to this course of conduct,

11

had lived an exemplary life.

12

His threshold -- his -- the loss in his case

13

barely crawled into the 2.5 to 5 million.

14

was about 40,000 over 2.5 million.

15

court sentenced at the bottom of the guidelines range,

16

agreeing with the policy of increasing sentences with

17

the amount of loss.

18

not the same level of increase, in the 1998 guidelines.

19

It

That same policy was present, but

So I think there's clearly, as applied to

20

his sentence, the significant risk he would not have

21

gotten 70 months, which would have been an upward

22

variance of 50 -- of -- of 50 percent from the old

23

guidelines range.

24

And -- but I think, if the Court does wish

25

to consider the broader ruling, I think it's also true
27

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that it is inherent in this system, in the Rita and Gall

2

framework, which provide for a mandatory benchmark,

3

which provide for the substantive reasonableness review,

that you're going to have some significant risk of some

increased quantum of punishment as a -- as a result of

this change in law.

25

If the starting point doesn't matter,

Why this whole Supreme Court case?
MR. FEIGIN:

Well -- well, Your Honor, we -­
28


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we opposed certiorari largely on that ground.

2

think the guidelines impose a constraint on a district

3

court's exercise of sentencing discretion; that is, if a

4

judge decides that a guidelines range that the

5

Commission has suggested at some other time suggests a

6

more appropriate sentence or if the judge believes that

7

some sentence that's unrelated to any guidelines range

8

is the most appropriate sentence, the judge has

9

discretion to impose that sentence.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We don't

Practically speaking, do

11

you believe it makes no difference?

22

error.

23

The government confessed

The government said the district judge

24

should have used the guidelines that were in effect at

25

the time the offense was committed, and the government
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

came to the Seventh Circuit and confessed error.

2

So there was not even an argument until the

3

Seventh Circuit and Judge Posner wrote the opinion that

4

included all the hypotheticals that -- that were aired

5

earlier about the victim impact statement and all of

6

those are in that opinion.

7

after the Seventh Circuit opinion that the government

8

changed its position.

9

MR. FEIGIN:

So it was only after --

Your Honor, the government

10

changed its position in response to this Court's

11

decisions in Gall, Kimbrough, and Irizarry because,

12

before those decisions came out, there was an argument

13

that the guidelines still imposed some substantive legal

14

constraint on a district court's sentencing discretion.

15

After Gall, Kimbrough, and Irizarry, after Nelson and

16

Spears, that argument no longer exists.

17

Rita makes clear that district courts cannot

18

presume a guidelines range to be reasonable.

Irizarry

19

makes clear that a defendant is constitutionally on

20

notice that he can get sentenced anywhere within the

21

statutory range.

22

And Gall makes clear that courts of appeals

23

should apply the same deferential standard of review to

24

every sentence, regardless whether it falls within the

25

guidelines range, just outside the guidelines range, or
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

far outside the guidelines range.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The guidelines range gets

a presumption of reasonableness at the appellate level.

4

MR. FEIGIN:

That's right, Your Honor, and I

5

think Rita actually supports our position, not

6

Petitioner's.

7

presumption of reasonableness on appeal that this --

8

that courts of appeals can choose to apply, but need

9

not, has no legal effect.

10

The Court made clear in Rita that the

Rather, it reflects the commonsense

11

proposition that when the Commission recommends a

12

particular sentencing range as to a particular class of

13

defendants and the district court, in its discretion,

14

actually imposes the sentence within that range, that

15

the sentence is likely to be reasonable.

16

The entire premise behind the presumption of

17

reasonableness that was adopted in Rita is that district

18

courts are, in fact, exercising their discretion when

19

they impose sentences, and that's the same premise on

20

which we'd ask you to decide this case.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is the reason that

22

miscalculating a guideline is considered a procedural

23

error?

24
25

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, it's very

clear, from 3553(a)(4), that Congress wants district
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

courts to start with the right mix of information, which

2

includes the most up-to-date recommendation of the

3

Sentencing Commission.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That begs the question.

5

Obviously, if we hold it's a procedural error to

6

miscalculate the guidelines, using the guidelines has

7

some significant importance in the process.

8
9

MR. FEIGIN:

It has importance, Your Honor,

and as I've said before, they can be very influential to

10

judges, but the reason why it's an error if -- to

11

miscalculate the guidelines is not because the

12

guidelines impose any substantive constraint on the

13

district court's discretion.

14

After reversal for miscalculating the

15

guidelines, the judge is free to impose the same

16

sentence anyway, and there's no constraint on the

17

judge's discretion that arises from the guidelines

18

frame.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what that suggests is

20

that the guidelines are -- serve as an anchor and are

21

supposed to serve as an anchor and that the reason why

22

the miscalculation is error is because you've picked the

23

wrong anchor and that's going to affect or -- or has a

24

significant likelihood of affecting your ultimate

25

decision.
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And isn't that, really, what we've

2

suggested?

3

the way you think the guidelines ought to work, that it

4

serves as an anchor for sentencing decisions; yes, you

5

can vary, you can deviate, but it's your anchor.

6

Is the way the guidelines ought to work and

MR. KINNAIRD:

Your Honor, there are two

7

things you could mean when you use the word "anchor."

8

One, you could mean that there's some sort of legal

9

anchor, and we think that the Court's decisions that

10

I've just described, in particular, the Court's repeated

11

insistence that district courts cannot presume a

12

guidelines range to be reasonable, means the district

13

courts cannot treat them as a legal anchor.

14

Second, you might be suggesting that they

15

serve as some sort of psychological anchor.

16

a concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

17

Facto Clause doesn't guarantee defendants a right to a

18

judge who has a particular sentencing philosophy --

That's not

22

right.

23

place that you've started and, if you -- if you've ended

24

up there, has to grant a presumption of reasonableness.

25

I think I'm saying you start in

The appellate court looks at the particular

But the rules are all geared towards saying,
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

yes, you can deviate, but you have to understand that

2

there's -- that deviation requires some kind of thought

3

process and some kind of reason.

4

where you should be.

5

MR. FEIGIN:

Otherwise, this is

Well, Your Honor, the Court

6

made clear in Pepper, two terms ago, that the district

7

court's overarching legal duty is to impose a sentence

8

sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to meet the

9

statutory purposes of sentencing in Section 3553(a)(2).

10

The guidelines are one of several factors

11

that inform the district court's exercise of discretion.

12

If a district court treats the guidelines as some sort

13

of legal constraint this Court's decisions say it

14

can't be treated as, that would be statutory error --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it isn't, but that, I

16

think, is an undecided question at best.

17

case on that ground, I would say that what the

18

guidelines and the Sentencing Commission are best at,

19

gathering information from across the country, and

20

saying a typical person who commits this crime in a

21

typical way should be sentenced to the typical range

22

that applies -- let's say 18 to 24 months.

23

That would be down the drain.

If you won the

And I think

24

that Rita, in fact, and the other cases have, at the

25

very most, left open and maybe decided against you the
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question of when a court of appeals gets the sentence

2

from a judge who does not apply the guideline because he

3

doesn't like the policy judgment.

4

That's a different matter from when he

5

applies it then when he thinks he shouldn't apply it

6

because the person in front of him doesn't meet the --

7

the policy conditions.

8

Commission has the expertise in the first, the judge in

9

the second.

Those are different.

The

And so there is at least a question as to

10

whether the court of appeals should give more leeway to

11

the guidelines in the first and more leeway to the judge

12

in the second.

13

Now, I think Rita is consistent with that,

14

and I think every opinion we have written is consistent

15

with that.

16

and changed in a way I think is inappropriate in this

17

case.

18

And I'd hate to see that suddenly decided

So have you all thought that through?
And is the position of the government, now,

19

that we think the guidelines, even if it's a policy

20

matter that they have gathered evidence on, are entitled

21

to nothing, if they run across a district judge who

22

happens to think, though he was an outlier, that the

23

outliers were right as a matter of policy, which, of

24

course, will always be true.

25

outlier thinks the outliers are right.

Every judge who is an

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Otherwise, why

Official

1

would he do it?

2

You see?

Now, I didn't know that issue was in this

3

case and that changes the case dramatically for me.

4

I thought we could decide this just on the ground that

5

this is a law that changes punishment.

6

It's a regulation.

7

And

It's a law.

And Justice Scalia, I thought, was

8

completely right.

The question is whether it inflicts

9

greater punishment.

And there is a test on that, and

10

the controlling inquiry is whether retroactive

11

application of a change in a law that affects punishment

12

created a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of

13

punishment attached.

14

what I thought the -- the framework of law was in this

15

case.

All right?

And that's -- that's

16

Now, this is sort of tough for you on oral

argument because I'm just, perhaps, bringing it all up

18

to get it all out there and see what you think.

21
22

I disagree with all that,

by the way.

MR. FEIGIN:

25

Let me start at the end there,

Well, Your Honor,

Justice Breyer, beginning with what you said at the end
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there, I think it's -- it would be inappropriate to

2

untether the significant risk test from the requirement

3

that there be an ex post facto law; that is, there has

4

to be a significant legal risk, a risk that is traceable

5

to some sort of change in the decision maker's authority

6

with respect to sentencing, and we don't have that here.

7

A district court has the same authority and

8

the same obligation to impose an appropriate sentence

9

the day after the guidelines are amended as the judge

10

had the day before the guidelines are amended.

11

judge who forgets that is going to be committing

statutory error, and the sentence could be reversed on

appeal for violating the Booker remedy.

within the guidelines.

the exercise of discretion.

20

MR. FEIGIN:

The court of

That's how it begins to measure

Well, Your Honor, as I -- as

21

I've explained, the reason why courts -- the only way in

22

which courts of appeals can apply a different standard

23

of review to a sentence, depending on where it falls in

24

the guidelines range, is the presumption of

25

reasonableness the Court recognized in Rita.
37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And I think Rita makes quite clear that that

2

is a practical presumption.

3

acknowledges the common-sense proposition that when a

4

district court, exercising its discretion, reaches a

5

judgment that accords with the Commission's expertise,

6

it's likely that sentence is reasonable.

7

I don't think --

question -- a judge comes in and says, I know child

12

pornography is criminal, but I don't think what the

13

guidelines are imposing are fair, to any defendant, so

14

10 days in jail.

crime?

16

why the court of appeals would find it substantively

unreasonable and not because it varies too far from the

that one of the questions the judge had to answer was

which set of guidelines were provided -- were the set of

guidelines that he had to calculate under

MR. FEIGIN:

Justice Ginsburg, it's --

the Court considers these as two separate questions, one

is which is the set of guidelines I'm required to

13

calculate under Section 3553(a), and, second, having

14

calculated those guidelines, what sentence should I

impose, with the guidelines as one of the factors that

the Court considers.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feigin, you're sounding

awfully like according deference to the guidelines

counts as reversible error.

20

MR. FEIGIN:

No, Your Honor, that's not what

21

I'm trying to say.

I'm saying treating the guidelines

22

as some sort of legal constraint on the district court's

23

sentencing discretion is reversible error.

24

district court chooses, in its own discretion, to give

25

weight to the guidelines, that's within the realm of
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, if the

Official

1

choice that 3553(a) provides.

2

There are many circumstances --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is reversible error, is

4

it not, simply to blindly apply the guidelines without

5

considering the factors in 3553?

6

isn't it?

7

MR. FEIGIN:

8

And, Justice Kagan --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's reversible,

That's correct, Your Honor.

But, surely, you do not want

10

judges living in a world where they think that they

cannot give deference to the guidelines, isn't that

right?

You want them to give appropriate deference to

guidelines, that's because the judge is exercising its

discretion to decide that a guideline's range sentence

21

is appropriate in that particular case.

We

Now, there are many instances in which

a nongovernment-sponsored below-range sentence than to

4

get a within-range sentence; 48.4 percent

5

nongovernment-sponsored below-range, 32.7 percent within

6

range.

7

If we want to talk about fraud for a minute,

8

which is what the Petitioner in this case was charged

9

with, if you look at page 67 of the Commission's

10

post-Booker report -- and I'd encourage the Court to

11

read that report in full -- because it makes very clear

12

the variations in sentencing practices among --

13

depending on the crime, depending on the particular

14

circuit, depending on the particular district, and even

15

depending on the particular judge.

16

I believe --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was Judge Randolph wrong

18

when he said -- quoting the Sentencing Commission --

19

that within-guidelines range, even after Booker, is the

20

standard?

21

sentencing has been minor, and, for that minor, he cites

22

the Sentencing Commission.

23

Indeed, the actual impact of Booker on

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, I think the

24

post-Booker report refutes that in the respect I just

25

suggested.

It says that there are actually very
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different sentencing practices, depending on the

2

particular crime, depending on the particular judge.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this statement comes

4

from Final Report on the Impact of the United

5

States v. Booker on Federal Sentencing.

6

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, the Commission says

7

many things in its report.

8

that, in the aggregate, guidelines do -- actual

9

sentences do tend to track the guidelines.

10

One of the things it says is

But, if you look beyond that one aggregate

11

statistic and you start to look at the variations in

12

sentencing practices in courts across the nation that

13

vary, not only by judge, but by guideline, you see that

14

the system is actually operating the way you'd

15

expect to --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see -- I see, now, where

17

you're going.

18

the sentence is, I am the judge, I read the guidelines.

19

Now, I may think that I am more likely to get reversed

20

if I -- I substitute a different view than the

21

Commission had on a matter of policy.

22

What I think you're saying is, whatever

That's all true.

But, still, I don't have to do it.

No

23

matter what it is, I can not use the guidelines.

24

if I get reversed on other grounds, or the sentence is

25

not reasonable, da, da, da, da, da.

And,

But there's no

6

MR. FEIGIN:

That's your point, I think.

That's exactly my point, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If that's

exactly your point -MR. FEIGIN:

I'd like to add two -- two

7

observations to that, first of which is, as an empirical

8

matter, it is extremely unlikely for a sentence to get

9

reversed on substantive reasonableness grounds.

10

The Commission's post-Booker report -- and

11

I'm talking about the one that they just issued a few

12

weeks ago that's cited in the reply brief -- states that

13

substantive unreasonableness reversals are very rare.

14

Petitioner, on page 30 of his brief, cites a database

15

that contains 38 such reversals post-Gall.

16
17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But, now, I can

narrow what the question I think is.
MR. FEIGIN:

And the second point I'd like

19

to make, Your Honor, with respect to that, is that I

20

don't think this Court should assume that district

21

courts are actually going to change what sentences they

22

impose and not impose the sentence they believe is

23

sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to meet the

24

purposes of sentencing, just because they --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that -- that

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gets back to -- to your argument.

2

that you want me to leave the bench saying the

3

guidelines just don't make any difference.

4

the -- suppose the district judge said, you know, if it

5

were just up to me, I would give this lower sentence,

6

but the guidelines are an important institutional part

7

of our system.

You're -- I sense

Suppose

Uniformity in sentencing is desirable.

For

us to take into account the experience of other -- of

10

other courts and what the Sentencing Commission does is

very important.

12

these guidelines.

Therefore, my discretion is guided by

MR. FEIGIN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

Your Honor, I absolutely -You don't want me -- you

don't want me to say that.

16

MR. FEIGIN:

I absolutely do not want you to

17

leave the bench with the impression that the guidelines

18

are unimportant.

19

impression that the guidelines don't impose any legal

20

constraint on a judge's exercise of discretion.

21

Different judges -- not only does it vary by guideline,

22

but --

23

I want you to leave the bench with the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

implement -- is the appropriate one to give effect to.

21

Is that -- can that possibly be right?

22

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, I think I'm saying

23

something slightly different.

I think, under 3553(a),

24

the Court would calculate the current guidelines.

25

the defendant would have a very good argument in that
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

Official

1

case, that the current guidelines range would simply not

2

be appropriate for him, and I think a district court

3

would do well to listen to that argument in that

4

particular case, if it thought that the sentences that

5

the new guidelines range was suggesting were out of

6

whack with the statute at the time the offense was

7

committed.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Feigin, I'm under the

impression -- more than the impression I know -- that

10

the Sentencing Commission can make a revision of the

11

guidelines retroactive.

12

Can it only do that for revisions that --

13

that lower the -- the suggested penalty?

14

that for revisions that increase it as well?

15

MR. FEIGIN:

16

revisions that lower --

Or can it do

I believe it's only for

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. FEIGIN:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Only for lower, okay.

Yes, Your Honor.
Because, if it could

20

increase it, then it would be violating, according to

21

your -- your friend, the Ex Post Facto Clause.

22

MR. FEIGIN:

And, Your Honor, getting back

23

to how the -- the advisory guidelines are working in

24

practice for a minute -- which, again, is I don't think

25

what this -- what the focus should be.
50

Alderson Reporting Company

The focus should

Official

1

be on whether there's actually been a change in the law

2

that either increases or decreases a sentencer's

3

discretion.

4

If you imagine two States, for example, each

5

of which had exactly the same advisory guidelines system

6

that the Federal government has and, in one of them,

7

judges are -- you know, tend to find the guidelines very

8

persuasive, they sentence within the guidelines 70

9

percent of the time.

In the other one, judges

10

exercising their discretion don't find the guidelines

11

very persuasive, and they sentence within the guidelines

12

10 percent of the time.

13

I don't think it makes sense that, under the

14

exact same legal regime, an amendment to the guidelines

15

in one State would be an Ex Post Facto Law and an

16

amendment to the guidelines in the other State wouldn't

17

be an Ex Post Facto Law.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But your -- your statement

19

to me was -- and to us earlier -- was that the -- there

20

is no legal constraint on the exercise of discretion.

21

agree, the judge -- everybody knows the judge can go

22

lower, but that overlooks the fact that discretion is

defined by legal standards.

That provision is

Now, it just says that the sentence should

Does that violate the Ex Post Facto Clause?
MR. FEIGIN:

case, you have something we don't have here, which is

11

that the decision maker has less discretion than the --

MR. FEIGIN:

The reason I -- the reason I

18

said "might well" is I think, at that point, the Court

would have to look at the significance of the increase

21

whether that was a significant enough increase or

22

decrease to trigger the --

Alderson Reporting Company

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

How would a

court go about answering that question?

3

MR. FEIGIN:

I think that's where the

4

significant risk test comes in.

5

significant risk test, you can either see whether it

6

facially has that effect -- we know that's not true of

7

the Federal Sentencing Guidelines because the Court's

8

made clear they don't impose any legal constraints.

9

you could see whether it has that effect as applied

10

And, under the

Or

under Garner.

11

But We know that --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's a

13

statistical evaluation of the kind we were talking

14

about.

15

blue moon that a judge invokes the manifest injustice

16

provision, so it's not increasing the risk.

17

You look, and you say, well, it's only once in a

On the other hand, well, every four out of

18

five judges do, and, therefore, it is an increase.

19

that how you --

20

MR. FEIGIN:

Is

I think it's fundamental -- the

21

decision in Garner doesn't precisely describe exactly

22

how the significant risk inquiry works.

23

fundamentally, a legal inquiry because the bottom-line

24

question the Court's always trying to answer is whether

25

there has been an ex post facto law.
54

Alderson Reporting Company

I think it is,

Official

1

And I think, to the extent it's okay to look

2

at empirical data -- and I don't think the Court in

3

Garner expressly says that that's the kind of data it

4

was contemplating -- it would be to inform how the legal

5

framework actually operates in practice.

6

And, if the Court found it necessary to look

7

at that here, in the -- the post-Booker report makes

8

clear that sentencing practices vary over the districts,

9

over the circuits, and with respect to particular

10
11

guidelines.
So Justice Alito brought up the example of

12

the Eastern District of New York.

13

any further than the Northern District of Illinois,

14

where Petitioner was sentenced here, where the latest

15

2012 statistics that came out on Friday show that the

16

defendant actually has a slightly higher probability --

17

very slightly higher probability -- of getting a

18

non-government-sponsored below-range sentence than of

19

getting a sentence within the guidelines range.

20

We don't have to look

I think all these variances show two things.

21

One, they show that the system is working exactly as

22

you'd expect an advisory system to work; and, two, I

23

think they show that some sort of narrow focus on

24

empirical data, which is what you are left with, once

25

you divorce the ex post facto inquiry from a change in
55

Alderson Reporting Company

You have to --

more goes into it than empirics.

unbelievable chart, really, in one of the green briefs

about -- you know, where there's one line, which is what

7

happens to the guidelines, and there's this other line,

9

each other identically, exactly.

from this than -- from Mr. Kinnaird's point of view.

mandatory benchmark did was to alter the legal framework

12

in a way that channeled and redefined the exercise of

13

discretion in the direction of greater punishment.

14

Secondly, what range is the -- is the

15

mandatory benchmark under the statute matters greatly,

16

as Justice Kennedy alluded to, to appellate review for

17

substantive reasonableness.

factor in determining whether a sentence is reasonable,

19

and it's the standard to which a presumption of

20

reasonableness may attach.

21

You have -- it's the key

Third, as far as the record, there's --

22

there's no analysis in the record of the 1998

23

guidelines, other than to -- to set them aside.

24

and what you have to have, under the Constitution, is he

fraud offenses, when the guidelines' minimum goes up,

10

the average sentences go up, and that's a very

11

compelling point of evidence.

12

And, finally, I would point out here that

13

one of the amendments here was actually a response of

14

the Commission to a congressional directive in the wake

15

of the Enron scandal and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, where

16

there was great public and legislative outrage over

17

light fraud sentences, to reconsider the fraud -- fraud

18

guidelines.

19

And that puts this in the core of the Ex

20

Post Facto Clause, that it violates fundamental notions

21

of retroactivity for a legislature to be able to alter

22

the law of punishment after the offense.
