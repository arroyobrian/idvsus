 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (10:03 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

this morning in Case 121038, United States v. Apel. 
 Mr. Horwich. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. HORWICH: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

10

 Section 1382 makes it a misdemeanor for a 

11

person to reenter a military base after having been 

12

ordered not to do so by the commanding officer.  Now, 

13

the Ninth Circuit here added another requirement for 

14

conviction, which is that the defendant must be found in 

15

a place that, as a matter of real property law, is 

16

within the exclusive possession of the United States. 

17

 That requirement isn't anywhere in the text 

18

of the statute, no court has ever given an explanation 

19

of where it comes from, and Respondent no longer defends 

20

that requirement. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it is  it is in the 

22

Air Force manual and in a JAG opinion, was the exclusive 

23

possession criterion. 

24
25

 MR. HORWICH: 

Well, I think I would say a 

couple things about those sources, Justice Ginsburg.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

First of all, the  they reflect, essentially, 

2

conservative legal advice that recognizes that some 

3

courts had made a reference to such a requirement.  So 

4

the responsible thing to do if you're in a JAG rendering 

5

an opinion on what the right way to structure a lease is 

6

or whether a particular place is, in fact, covered by 

7

1382 is to confirm that, yes, this would meet the 

8

criteria the courts have established. 

9

 But that doesn't  certainly doesn't make 

10

it binding on this Court and other courts have held to 

11

the contrary. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Has  since this case 

13

has been pending quite a while, has the manual changed, 

14

has  to  to delete the exclusive possession? 

15

 MR. HORWICH: 

If Your Honor is referring to 

16

the  the U.S. Attorneys' manual, no.  It hasn't been 

17

altered.  Although I  I would say that the very first 

18

section of the U.S. Attorneys' manual makes clear that 

19

it  it doesn't  it's not intended to create rights, 

20

it's not intended to bind the Department of Justice or 

21

otherwise modify the meanings of criminal statutes. 

22

It's simply a reference guide. 

23

 And it is a reference guide that certainly 

24

would be accurate in some circuits, we think incorrect, 

25

and that's what, of course, this Court is now in a

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position to resolve the disagreement between the courts 

2

on that  on that subject. 

3

 So what Respondent does argue  because, of 

4

course, Respondent isn't even defending that requirement 

5

here, is that  and what the case then comes down to, I 

6

guess, is that Vandenberg Air Force Base is not a 

7

military installation.  Now, we think it is.  And we 

8

think all of it is. 

9

 And the reason for that is that the statute 

10

refers comprehensively to a long list of places, 

11

reservation, fort, post, arsenal, yard, station, 

12

installation, that covers the range of places that are 

13

subject to military command.  And Vandenberg is, of 

14

course, a place that's subject to military command.  And 

15

in particular 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

How do we tell that, 

17

Mr. Horwich?  What's the test for determining when a 

18

place is subject to military command? 

19

 MR. HORWICH: 

Military command is a question 

20

of lawful authority.  What might be thought of, in a 

21

civilian context, as the extent of the commanding 

22

officer's jurisdiction.  And so what  the way things 

23

are set up is that the civilian leadership in the 

24

Department of Defense defines bases, and then the 

25

military commanders who are appointed by the president,

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then, through appointing subordinate commands, will have 

2

units assigned to particular bases, and the commanding 

3

officer of the unit will be the commanding officer of 

4

the base to which the unit is assigned. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, some military 

6

installations are located in very rural areas.  Now, 

7

suppose you have an installation in such a place and 

8

there are buildings and  and facilities that you can 

9

see in one part of this territory, but there's a lot of 

10

open  there are a lot of open fields around it. 

11

Would  and suppose there's  it's not posted.  Would 

12

that still be a military installation if somebody goes 

13

on that? 

14
15

 MR. HORWICH: 

It  it would, although let 

me say a few things about that. 

16

 Your description, actually, is pretty apt as 

17

to Vandenberg itself.  It's in a rural area.  There are 

18

large areas of what you, I think, accurately described 

19

as open fields, that are there precisely to serve as 

20

a  kind of a buffer zone around these enormous rocket 

21

launches.  And some parts of it are particularly posted; 

22

other parts aren't. 

23

 We do think that there would  that a 

24

defendant needs to be put on notice in some  in some 

25

respect.  We refer to it, I think, inartfully in our

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

brief as actually that the defendant would have 

2

knowledge.  I think it's more the defendant needs to be 

3

on notice. 

4

 And like ascertaining the extent of any 

5

geographic place, the place to look, for starters, is a 

6

map.  If you look at a if you go  nowadays, you go on the 

7

Internet, pull up any map, it will show you an area 

8

marked off as Vandenberg Air Force Base. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But a map, presumably, 

10

reflects who owns the property, and you, yourself, say 

11

that that's not what's significant.  And I took your 

12

point in your brief to suggest some kind of more 

13

functional test, is this property being used for 

14

military purposes?  Am I  am I wrong in ascribing that 

15

to you? 

16

 MR. HORWICH: 

Yes, yes.  We don't  we're 

17

not suggesting a functional test.  What we're suggesting 

18

is that the coverage of 1382 should be coextensive with 

19

the commander's authority, which is, essentially, as I 

20

sort of suggested, in the nature of a jurisdictional 

21

test.  Where does the commander's regulatory and barment 

22

authority extend to as a matter of military law? 

23
24
25

 It should be backed up by the misdemeanor 
sanction in 1382. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But I'm not sure that I

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can  that I follow that completely.  When I look at 

2

the list of items mentioned in the statute 

3

reservation, post, fort, arsenal, yard, station, or 

4

installation  I don't think of command separate from 

5

operational control or being run by and used by the 

6

military.  Each of those terms has an operational 

7

quality to it that mere ownership, which I equate with 

8

command, doesn't. 

9

 It makes no sense, in answer to Justice 

10

Alito's question, to say you need notice, unless that 

11

facility has a military flavor to it that someone could 

12

know about.  And you talk about this particular camp, 

13

but you've got a whole green line around it to tell 

14

people which sections you are actually considering the 

15

camp, and he was found outside of that green area. 

16

 You've got a public school, a public 

17

highway.  I'm not quite sure how you can keep a person 

18

off of lands that the military is not using in its 

19

operations. 

20

 MR. HORWICH: 

Well, I guess, just to take 

21

the last point there, I would disagree with the premise 

22

that the military is not using these lands in their 

23

operation.  I mean, to take  to take one example, 

24

there will be  there's a launch tomorrow at 

25

Vandenberg, and the other highway that's kind of

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indistinguishable from Highway 1, for these purposes, is 

2

going to be closed down because it's in the area that's 

3

dangerous because it's in the potential impact zone 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, you close down 

5

you close down roads for parades.  You close down areas 

6

for other public needs. 

7

 MR. HORWICH: 

Certainly.  But I would be 

8

clear that the reason that is being closed down is 

9

because the commanding officer at Vandenberg has 

10

determined that that property, which is owned by the 

11

United States, is placed under his  placed under his 

12

authority as a commanding officer, is  is  is 

13

assigned to the Department of the Air Force for 

14

administration, he has determined that his military 

15

needs require closing that  that part on that day. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And that's confirmed in 

17

the terms of the easement, if you look at the easement 

18

between the U.S. and the County of Santa Barbara. 

19

 MR. HORWICH: 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Precisely so, Justice Kennedy. 
The  it makes it very 

21

clear that the military commander has authority to 

22

exercise control over the easement property. 

23

 MR. HORWICH: 

The  precisely so, Justice 

24

Kennedy.  And I think that gets to the bigger picture 

25

point here, which is that it would be a very odd result

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to say that a  that a military commander has to 

2

maximally inconvenience the public by shutting a place 

3

down at all times in order to preserve the misdemeanor 

4

sanction that backs up his authority. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

If  if your position is 

6

right, then I  I think there would be nothing left of 

7

Flowers, because Flowers, the government owned that area 

8

as well.  Is there anything left  I mean, that  in 

9

this case, the  the property is used as a public 

10

highway, and people go back and forth. 

11

 In Flowers, it was a street. 

12
13

So are you 

urging that Flowers is essentially overruled? 
 MR. HORWICH: 

No, not at all, 

14

Justice Ginsburg.  In fact, I think Flowers is 

15

supportive of our position here, on the statutory point, 

16

precisely because the Court thought to resolve Flower on 

17

the constitutional grounds. 

18

 And there was no question there that it was 

19

covered by 1382, notwithstanding the fact that it is 

20

that it could be described as a public street, it was 

21

also property that was under the command of the 

22

commanding officer at Fort Sam Houston in that  in 

23

that case.  And so the Court went to the constitutional 

24

question. 

25

 I'm happy to talk here, if the Court is

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interested, about the  the constitutional differences 

2

between this case and Flower.  But Flower does  does 

3

strongly imply that coverage of 1382, which the Court 

4

would ordinarily address first before reaching the 

5

constitutional question, wasn't in doubt there, nor was 

6

it in doubt in any of the cases that this Court has 

7

decided under 1382, each of which has involved a 

8

military installation that is, to some greater or lesser 

9

extent, in some places or other, open to the public. 

10

 So 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Suppose that the Respondent 

12

in this case didn't want to protest.  He just wanted to 

13

take a drive up to Santa Barbara or  I don't know 

14

maybe it's  I don't know  if it's not illegal to 

15

walk in Southern California, maybe he wanted to walk 

16

along the Pacific Coast Highway. 

17
18
19

 Would he  would he commit a misdemeanor by 
doing that? 
 MR. HORWICH: 

So his  the terms of his 

20

barment order and the ordinary terms on which barment 

21

orders are issued at Vandenberg is that there's an 

22

exception carved out for him to traverse along the 

23

easement, which, again, is in the nature of a concession 

24

to public convenience, which it seems quite unfair to 

25

sort of  to say that, well, the military has wound up

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

worse off by trying to accommodate its  trying to 

2

accommodate itself, to the extent consistent with its 

3

security needs, to public use and convenience. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And where is this?  Where 

is the exception?  Is it  was it in the bar order? 
 MR. HORWICH: 

Yes, it's on page 64 of the 

7

Joint Appendix.  And it's in the middle of paragraph 2 

8

on 64.  It says, "Effective immediately, you are ordered 

9

not to enter onto Vandenberg Air Force Base, except to 

10

traverse," meaning to travel "to or from Lompoc and 

11

Santa Maria on Highway 1 and to and from Lompoc and 

12

Amtrak Surf Station on Highway 246," which passes 

13

through Vandenberg's property. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

He couldn't go to the 

15

public school, though?  Or the stores or any other 

16

facilities that the public's invited to? 

17

 MR. HORWICH: 

That's  that's correct. 

18

But, of course, there's a reason for that, which is that 

19

he has been individually identified as posing a threat 

20

to the order and security of the base.  Now, we would 

21

point out, he was barred 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It seems such an odd 

23

thing for a Class B misdemeanor to be used to protect 

24

the national security; that Congress has determined that 

25

the threat is so great, that the only thing you need is

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

a Class B misdemeanor to protect the U.S. 
 MR. HORWICH: 

Well, it's certainly not the 

3

only thing.  In our  in our opening brief, we have a 

4

footnote that runs through kind of the hierarchy of 

5

sanctions that might be 

6
7
8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There are some pretty 

severe ones. 
 MR. HORWICH: 

There are some severe ones. 

So we think of this as being sort of a first line of 

10

defense, if you will. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Are there no sanctions for 

12

trespassing upon Federal property that is not a military 

13

base? 

14

 MR. HORWICH: 

Justice Scalia, absolutely, 

15

there are.  There's a statute like that for the National 

16

Park Service.  There's a statute like that for the 

17

Bureau of Land Management.  There's a statute like that 

18

for the  for the Forest Service. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you think, Mr. Horwich, 

20

that there is any point at which a military installation 

21

can lose its character as such?  I mean, I'll give you 

22

an example.  Suppose  you know, that in this  in 

23

this base area, the government  the military decided 

24

to allow four private condo buildings and six 

25

restaurants and three movie theaters, and it really just

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

turned into a regular old town. 

2

 And  and it entered into agreements 

3

whereby all the policing was being done by local law 

4

enforcement officers, rather than by the military.  Is 

5

there any point at which it just becomes too much not 

6

like a military base, where you lose the ability to do 

7

this, even though it's under the formal command of a 

8

military officer? 

9

 MR. HORWICH: 

Well, I think, if it's still 

10

under the formal command of the military officer and the 

11

military officer is empowered to issue regulations and 

12

issue barments, which this Court has long recognized is 

13

the necessary concomitant of the functioning of a 

14

military installation, then, no, it continues 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I assume it would be 

16

contrary to  to his orders to permit such 

17

installations, without his ability to control them. 

18

 MR. HORWICH: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Exactly 
Including by issuing 

20

debarment orders.  He has no authority to do that, does 

21

he? 

22

 MR. HORWICH: 

No, that's exactly right.  So, 

23

for example, to Justice Kagan's hypothetical  and, 

24

Justice Sotomayor, you referred to the  the school 

25

that  that is on the base.  There are couple 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

actually, a couple of schools on the base. 
 One of them is leased to a school district, 

3

but it is, nonetheless, still subject to the commander's 

4

command authority.  The commander does respond to 

5

dangerous weapons or drugs being brought there.  And 

6

that's necessary.  It's right 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So what happens, for 

8

example, at  at the school if there's an assault on 

9

school premises?  Who deals with that? 

10

 MR. HORWICH: 

In the  in the school 

11

premises, I  I believe  I don't want to be quite 

12

certain about this, but I believe that the  well, 

13

certainly, the elementary school and I believe, also, 

14

the middle school is within the area that is  within 

15

the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the United 

16

States.  It's been ceded to the United States. 

17

 So the  the proper response there would 

18

need to be by Federal law enforcement.  Crimes would be 

19

prosecuted under the Assimilative Crimes Act. 

20
21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Federal  I'm sorry.  Is 

that military police or is that 

22

 MR. HORWICH: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No. 
Who  who comes 

24

in  is it  is it members of the military?  Or is it 

25

members of the county police force?  Or is it 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HORWICH: 

No.  If  if we're talking 

2

about an area that's under the exclusive Federal 

3

jurisdiction, the military  the military police or 

4

or security forces, as they're now  as they're now 

5

called, are not empowered to make arrests in that formal 

6

sense.  They can  they can detain so that law 

7

enforcement officers who are empowered to make arrests 

8

can then respond. 

9

 So, for example, if you have the more common 

10

things, a traffic stop, maybe, on one of the roads off 

11

the highway or something like that, they will need to 

12

detain and wait for an appropriate  an appropriate law 

13

enforcement official to respond. 

14

 So, again, there is somewhat of a  of a 

15

different situation obtains on the highway, because 

16

there  there is authority for the  the county 

17

police, for the county sheriff, for example, to respond.  So 

18

there's  there's a different status there.  But 

19

that's 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I guess I'm just 

21

wondering with respect to each of these places, I mean, 

22

the highway, the school, the Amtrak station, who's 

23

actually in control when something goes wrong in these 

24

places? 

25

 MR. HORWICH: 

Well, let me bracket off the

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Amtrak station because we don't think the Amtrak station 

2

is under military command, and I'll  I can explain 

3

why. 

4

 In the other places, it's often the case 

5

that the first response will be by the security forces 

6

because they are in the area, and they will be 

7

patrolling. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The security forces 

meaning 

10

 MR. HORWICH: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 MR. HORWICH: The military Now, they will detain 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

14
15

The military. 
 the military. 

So do military personnel 

actively patrol this entire area? 
 MR. HORWICH: 

Yes.  Yes.  The  the Amtrak 

16

station I should say, though, is  is different 

17

because, there, the station and the tracks that actually 

18

run  you know, to and from the station, are actually 

19

on a narrow strip of land that is owned in fee by a 

20

railroad. 

21

 It is  it is not owned by the United 

22

States.  It's not under Air Force Department 

23

administration.  It's not part of the military 

24

commander's command authority there.  So that  that 

25

part's not covered.

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So in the situation of  you know, somebody 

2

asks, well, can somebody go to the train station and 

3

take a train, if they've been barred, well, yes, they're 

4

allowed to travel on the highway that goes there, and 

5

they're allowed to wait at the train station and go. 

6

 And that arrangement, obviously, has been 

7

determined by the appropriate officials to be sufficient 

8

to protect the  the military's interests.  If it  if 

9

it weren't, I imagine we would see a different 

10

arrangement, but the accommodations have been made. 

11

 I think the larger point here, though, is 

12

that, if the commanding officer has the authority to 

13

issue these regulations and has the authority to issue 

14

these barments, it seems  across the whole area, which 

15

I think is not really subject to dispute here, the command  as 

16

Justice Kennedy points out, the easement says he can 

17

regulate the use of the highway. 

18
19
20

 If you have that authority, why put the 
sanction there. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It could have said  it 

21

could have said that Apel can't use the highway.  That 

22

would  that dispensation was a matter of grace? 

23

 MR. HORWICH: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

Yes. 
Is that what you're 

saying?

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. HORWICH: 

Yes, it would be, in  in 

2

in the same way that the commanding officer can 

3

determine that any particular use of the highway is 

4

inconsistent with the military's needs.  That's why the 

5

reservation is in there, precisely to  to reserve, as 

6

Justice Scalia suggests, the appropriate authority to 

7

the commander to do what he needs to do to run the 

8

installation. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I suppose, if the 

10

commander thought it was necessary, he could stop trucks 

11

with flammable materials from coming through at the time 

12

when a launch is being prepared and so forth? 

13

 MR. HORWICH: 

Precisely so.  And  and if 

14

he  and the odd result here, under Respondent's 

15

reading, because, of course, Respondent's reading turns 

16

on the coverage of what "military installation" means, 

17

and that covers the first paragraph of Section 1382 as 

18

well, which deals with the  with enforcing 

19

regulations, the oddity of his reading is that, if a 

20

truck then did drive on the highway bringing the 

21

flammable materials, the truck would be in violation of 

22

the regulation. 

23

 But it's sort of the sound of one hand 

24

clapping because it wouldn't actually be a misdemeanor 

25

because the statute wouldn't cover that part of the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

commander's command area.  That incongruity is very 

2

strange. 

3

 We wouldn't say  say, in the national 

4

parks context, if the Park Service has a rule that says 

5

you can't feed the grizzly bears, it means you can't 

6

feed the grizzly bears anywhere in the park.  It doesn't 

7

mean, yeah, you're not supposed to, but it won't be a 

8

misdemeanor if you feed them on the road, but you  you 

9

can't feed them off the road, and it is a misdemeanor. 

10

 That's  that's essentially the regime that 

11
12

Respondent suggests this statute 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. Horwich, can I ask you 

13

this, which is  this question is stimulated by what 

14

Justice Kagan asked. 

15

 Is it  my understanding is that, if you 

16

look at many military reservations, you may need a very 

17

detailed map to figure out  and a crime is committed 

18

someplace on there or other Federal lands  you may 

19

need a very detailed map to determine whether criminal 

20

jurisdiction over that particular offense is exclusively 

21

Federal or Federal and concurrent. 

22

 Now  and I would assume that that could be 

23

true of a military base that is completely sealed off to 

24

the public. 

25

 MR. HORWICH: 

That's  I could 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Now, do you understand that 

2

the  the Ninth Circuit's holding to be based on access 

3

or to be based on jurisdiction over crimes that are 

4

committed there? 

5

 MR. HORWICH: 

No, I understand it to be 

6

based on neither of those things.  I understand it to be 

7

based on a real property analysis, which says, at this 

8

point, where Respondent was found, there is an easement, 

9

so there is a real property interest that is held by 

10

someone other than the United States; therefore, the 

11

United States does not exclusively possess it. 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But that's not Respondent's 

theory here. 
 MR. HORWICH: 

No, it's not Respondent's 

15

theory here.  But if I might just say one word about the 

16

absurdities  the kind of absurdities that the Ninth 

17

Circuit's position seems like it might lead to is that 

18

it doesn't seem like it's limited to easements.  I mean, 

19

Respondent, of course, as we know, wasn't using the 

20

easement for its purpose, so it's just sort of 

21

coincidence he's also on the easement. 

22

 And so, on the Ninth Circuit's approach, 

23

maybe there's a utility easement, or maybe there's a 

24

subsurface mineral rights that has with them an entry 

25

and egress rights or something, and I guess that also

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would defeat on the Ninth Circuit's approach the 

2

application of 1382, which seems very strange. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, there may be 

4

suppose property is leased to  I don't know whether 

5

this actually ever occurs  but suppose it's leased to 

6

the United States and used for a military reservation. 

7

 Would there be exclusively Federal criminal 

8

jurisdiction there, or would there not be concurrent 

9

jurisdiction? 

10

 MR. HORWICH: 

Well, the way  that's  that's 

11

a matter that is decided under the  the Enclaves 

12

Clause of the Constitution, it says that the State has 

13

to cede to the United States 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15

 MR. HORWICH: 

Right. 
 that jurisdiction.  So the 

16

State has ceded to the United States that jurisdiction 

17

over  over the base.  The United States, I believe 

18

it's correct, the United States retroceded that 

19

jurisdiction back to the State as to the highways, so 

20

that highway patrol officers could  could go along 

21

those  could go along the highways. 

22

 But that's really a separate issue from 

23

what's presented here because that would control the 

24

application of the Assimilative Crimes Act, for example, 

25

but this statute  this statute is not  this statute

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

is a freestanding Federal statute. 
 And I would say, in the example that you 

3

give, I think this  it's worth talking for a moment 

4

about the situation, where the United States leases 

5

property and places it under military jurisdiction and 

6

gives it to a military command. 

7

 There certainly are such places, and that's 

8

why an ownership test isn't quite right.  I think an 

9

ownership test, Justice Kagan, is sort of right about 95 

10

percent of the time because it's usually true that the 

11

United States is going to want to own the places that it 

12

puts under military command, but it's not perfect in the 

13

leasing context. 

14

 It's also  it's also problematic in the 

15

situation that comes up in some of the courts of appeals 

16

cases regarding Coast Guard or naval security zones, 

17

which are designated waters adjacent to a base that are 

18

appurtenant to the commander's authority over the base, 

19

and those aren't kind of owned in  in exactly the same 

20

way. 

21

 But they're, nonetheless, under military 

22

command, and the courts of appeals had no difficulty 

23

seeing that they're covered. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I  I had thought that, 

in your brief, you thought that the ownership test was

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

both underinclusive and overinclusive. 
 MR. HORWICH: 

Yes, I think that's correct, 

3

too, because there are certainly property that the 

4

United States owns  plenty of property  most 

5

property that the United States owns isn't under 

6

military command. 

7

 And so it's not just Federal ownership, 

8

it's  although I would  I would point out that, with 

9

respect to these other statutes that deal with other 

10

agencies of the government that  that administer 

11

lands, it is generally true  I can't say that it's 

12

exclusively  it's true across the board  but it's 

13

generally true that there's a statute, something like 

14

this one, that corresponds to the regulatory authority 

15

of a land management agency. 

16

 So  and, again, we wouldn't punch holes in 

17

the misdemeanor sanctions that back up those other land 

18

management agencies' authority, so I don't see why we 

19

would punch holes in this statute, either. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could I just ask you what we 

21

should make of this  what we should make of this green 

22

line? 

23

 MR. HORWICH: 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

Yes. 
What is the significance of 

the green line?

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HORWICH: 

The  speaking outside the 

2

record, it seems like it was probably drawn to guide 

3

road crews in the parts of the road they should be 

4

resurfacing because one of the terms of the easements is 

5

that California is responsible for maintaining the road. 

6

 And so  you know, when the California 

7

Department of Transportation road crew comes out to 

8

repave it or something, they need to know how  how 

9

wide, how far are we supposed to go, so there is 

10
11

there's this green line. 
 There are some other green lines scattered 

12

on other places of the base in various shades of being 

13

worn down.  But they're  I think they can be taken to 

14

demarcate the extent of the easement.  So  so on the 

15

Ninth Circuit's approach, the green line is significant 

16

for that reason because it tells you which side is 

17

which. 

18

 But I would point out that this particular 

19

place does just lie within a road that is miles inside 

20

the actual perimeter  outer perimeter of the base. 

21

It's a couple of miles, as the crow flies.  It's several 

22

miles as you travel on the road.  So it's  it's not as 

23

if it sort of lies out  outside of the edge. 

24

 If I could reserve?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY 

3
4
5
6

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Good morning, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 This is a case about the right to peacefully 

7

protest on a fully open public road, in a designated 

8

protest zone.  For decades, every lower Federal court, 

9

and, for that matter, the United States itself, 

10

interpreted 18 United States Code Section 1382 to apply 

11

only if there's exclusive Federal possession.  Any other 

12

interpretation would raise grave First Amendment issues. 

13

 As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, this case 

14

is indistinguishable from this Court's prior holding in 

15

Flower v. United States.  Flower involved a street that 

16

was on a military base.  It involved an individual, John 

17

Flower, who was subjected to a bar order 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that  that was a 

19

First Amendment case and the  and the problem there 

20

was that he was barred for a peaceful protest the first 

21

time around, and that's not  that's not this case. 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Flower  Flower was with 

the street. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It was not argued in that 

case that the statute didn't apply, and that's what

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

you're arguing here. 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor, there are two 

3

arguments here.  One is that 1832  1382 does not apply 

4

because military installation requires exclusive 

5

possession.  The second argument 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

On your Flowers point, I 

7

think Mr. Horwich said that  that there was no doubt 

8

that 1382 applied.  It was only a constitutional 

9

question 

10

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

That's correct. 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 in Flowers. 

12

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg. 

13

But there's no dispute in Flower that 1382 would apply 

14

because it was a street within the military base. 

15

 But to go to Justice Kennedy's question, 

16

this Court in Albertini was very clear that what Flower 

17

means is that, when there is a fully open public route, 

18

there is a right to use it for speech activities. 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, that  that's a 

20

First Amendment case.  But let's concentrate first on 

21

on the argument you make under this statute.  It seems 

22

to me that the statute should be construed according to 

23

normal rules of easements, and the owner of the 

24

subservient easement, the easement holder, cannot 

25

overburden that easement.

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 It cannot  I've got an easement on the 

2

back of my property for the utility company.  They can't 

3

hold a picnic there.  They can't do that. 

4

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That's overburdening the 

6

easement, and this is standard stuff.  And it's right in 

7

the easement agreement with the City of Santa Barbara, 

8

that the police  that the military commander can make 

9

reasonable regulations. 

10

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Now, you may  you have a 

12

First Amendment argument.  I understand that.  But let's 

13

just concentrate on the property ownership. 

14

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Yes.  In terms of the 

15

easement, when an easement goes towards a public road, 

16

that easement includes the right to use the public road 

17

for speech activities.  You're right, Your Honor, that 

18

the rule in paragraph 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You're back on the First 

20

Amendment case.  It  it may or may not.  If the  if 

21

the commander wants to close the base for a rocket 

22

launch, he certainly  he certainly can.  That's set 

23

forth in article  or a condition of paragraph 4 of the 

24

easement. 

25

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Paragraph 4 says that

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there can be rules and regulations with regard to the 

2

easement.  Your Honor, those rules and regulations must 

3

be consistent with the Constitution.  For example, the 

4

commander couldn't exclude African Americans from that 

5

road.  And that's why the 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You keep sliding into the 

7

First Amendment issue, which is not the issue on which 

8

we granted certiorari.  We're only interested in whether 

9

the statute applies. 

10

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

But, Your Honor, in 

11

interpreting the statute, it must be done so as to avoid 

12

constitutional doubts.  That's why the First Amendment 

13

comes up.  Also, of course, as this Court repeatedly has 

14

held, Respondent can raise any issue that was raised 

15

below to defend the judgment, which is also why the 

16

First Amendment is here. 

17

 But Your Honor 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You can raise it, but we 

19

don't have to listen to it. 

20

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Of course, that's right. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's  that's what I'm 

22

saying. 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

25

To go back to 
Of course, Your Honor, and 

I will address the meaning then of "military

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

installation." 

2

 Yes, Justice Breyer? 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The difficulty that I'm 

4

having is the Ninth Circuit said the reason that your 

5

client won is because the  the piece of grass between 

6

the road and  and the sign was not  it was subject 

7

to an easement and the government lacked the exclusive 

8

right of possession. 

9

 All right. 

When I saw that, I thought, 

10

well, there  there are thousands of different kinds of 

11

easement, as Justice Kennedy just said.  They're there 

12

for utilities.  They're for  they're there for people 

13

might want to  I mean, I can imagine a million, as 

14

you can, too. 

15

 So not all of those would involve First 

16

Amendment anything, and  and, yet, the  the Ninth 

17

Circuit would seem to say that your client could go and 

18

demonstrate, as long as the utility company had an 

19

easement. 

20

 So how are we supposed to interpret the 

21

statute to avoid the First Amendment problem without 

22

getting into an interpretation that, to me, would seem 

23

ridiculous. 

24
25

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor, the question 

is what does the phrase "military installation" mean?

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

One way of defining it would be all of the property 

2

that's owned by the United States.  But as Justice Kagan 

3

pointed out, the United States rejects that 

4

interpretation in Footnote 1 of its reply brief. 

5

 The alternative interpretation is exclusive 

6

possession, and that's the one that all of the lower 

7

courts 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, why does the First 

Amendment allow a person to go to the heart of the 

10

military base, put on any demonstration they want, the 

11

statute doesn't apply for the reason that, once every 

12

four months, the PG&E has an easement to go out and read 

13

the meter. 

14
15
16
17

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor, we would not 

take that position.  We would 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, that's exactly  I 

know you wouldn't 

18

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
 and that's why I want to 

20

know what your position is as to the interpretation of 

21

the statute that avoids my absurd PG&E result, but, 

22

nonetheless, does what you want, which is to protect the 

23

First Amendment interests. 

24

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

25

And I think that's exactly 

Justice Kennedy's question of the difference between an

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

easement for a public road and an easement for your 

2

backyard or the easement for a utility, and that's why I 

3

don't think that the First Amendment aspect of this case 

4

can be separated from the statutory aspect. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why are you buying into 

6

the real property being the definition here at all?  I 

7

mean, it seems to me that when I read the  the other 

8

definitions of the statute, I keep going back to that 

9

it's a function analysis and not a real property 

10

analysis because that would answer why this particular 

11

electrical meter reading  that area still being 

12

operated by the military for a military function, that's 

13

what forts do, reservations, yards, I don't know why we 

14

would read installation any differently. 

15
16
17

 But you're buying into this real property as 
being the defining term. 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No, Your Honor, I'm not. 

18

I completely agree with what you just said.  I think it 

19

is a functional analysis.  Here, the military has built 

20

a fence perimeter around Vandenberg.  They have drawn a 

21

green line where they said that the control begins.  On 

22

the other side of the green line is Highway 1 that 

23

anyone can drive down.  There are no signs that indicate 

24

that you're part of the military base, and where 

25

there's a 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They don't say control 

2

begins at the green line.  To the contrary, they say 

3

they have control over the whole installation.  Do you 

4

deny that, that the  that the commanding officer has 

5

the right to control the entire installation? 

6

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor, there is a big 

7

difference between the authority of the commanding 

8

officer within the close confines of the base and 

9

outside the base.  For example, civilians cannot be 

10

prosecuted for what they're doing on that public road. 

11

They're under the memorandum of understanding that 

12

California Highway Patrol 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Because  because the 

14

commanding officer agreed to that, because that's the 

15

term of the  of the easement. 

16

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Yes, Your Honor, but I 

17

will go back to what Justice Sotomayor said.  There is a 

18

functional difference between the public road and the 

19

designated protest zone. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There may well be, but is 

21

there  is there a difference in the authority of the 

22

commanding officer?  That's what's crucial. 

23

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Well, under the memorandum 

24

of understanding, the high  the commanding officer has 

25

ceded control over that public road to the Highway

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Patrol  the United States wants it both ways.  They 

2

want the benefits of having an easement there, in the 

3

sense that the State is responsible for maintaining the 

4

road, the State is liable for any harms on the road, the 

5

State enforces crimes on the road, but they also want to 

6

claim that they have all of the control over that public 

7

road as they would within the base. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They're entitled to have it 

both ways.  It's their base.  And if that's the deal 

10

you know, take it or leave it, State.  We  we'll give 

11

you this easement, but the  the terms are what we have 

12

said.  What's wrong with that? 

13

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

But, Your Honor, they 

14

shouldn't have it both ways.  Once they've created a 

15

public road, once they've created a designated protest 

16

zone, it is different, functionally, than the rest of 

17

the base. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does 

that mean 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you raised a 

21

you  you mentioned the green line, and Mr. Horwich 

22

represented some facts about it outside the record, 

23

quite properly alerted us that it was outside the 

24

record, I just want to give you a chance to respond to 

25

that.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Sure.  We know that the 


2


United States treats its easement as  its control as 


3


beginning within the green line area.  So, for example, 

4

when Mr. Apel crossed the green line previously, that 


5


was the place at which he was convicted for trespassing. 

6

 In other cases that are cited in both of our 

7

briefs, lines on the road were taken as defining the 

8

area where military jurisdiction begins.  So the Sixth 

9

Circuit's McCoy case, it was a white line, and the 

10

military said, once somebody crossed the white line, 

11

that's where Section 1382 began. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But if  if your colleague 

13

is correct, that the green line marked the edge of the 

14

easement, it would be entirely proper not to  not to 

15

arrest him for violating the base until he left the 

16

easement; that is, when he crossed the green line.  It 

17

has nothing to do with the  the commanding officer 

18

saying this is the only part of the installation that we 

19

care about. 

20

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

21

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

No, it's not about 
It marks the end of the 

easement. 
MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Well, you're absolutely 

24

right, Your Honor.  The green line is taken by the 

25

United States marking the end of the easement.  And the

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

United States, therefore, can enforce 1382, once 

2

Mr. Apel or anybody else crosses the green line. 

3

 But, when it is on the public side of the 

4

green line, on that public road, in that protest area, 

5

to go back to what Justice Sotomayor said, 

6

functionally 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Chemerinsky, does 

8

that mean that the  the government could not have 

9

issued this barment order in the first place? 

10
11
12

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No, Your Honor, we do not 

challenge the barment order. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, then I'm  I'm 

13

perplexed because if the government has sufficient 

14

commanding authority to issue the barment order to say, 

15

notwithstanding that Mr. Apel had not crossed the green 

16

line, that  you know, he just can't be here, and he's 

17

excluded, then why don't they have sufficient authority 

18

to prevent him from reentering? 

19

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

In both of the instances 

20

that led to barment orders, he crossed that green line 

21

that was on the military base side, and if he does that, 

22

then 1382 applies. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

I see.  So 
But the  but the 

barment order that Mr. Horwich just read to us says that

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he can use the road, but that's not  because the road 

2

is outside the statute, that's because the government, 

3

as a matter of grace, said right in the order, right in 

4

the bar order, you can use the road. 

5

 So there's a sharp difference. 

The 

6

government says the road is under military control, if 

7

the commander so chooses, but we're going to let him use 

8

the road.  The government treats the  the domain as 

9

including the road, as including this protest area. 

10

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor, there is a 

11

difference between the road and the area within the 

12

green line.  And so what I was saying to Justice Kagan 

13

is the reason why the barment orders were permissible is 

14

he crossed the green line. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But you're saying that if he 

16

had not crossed the green line, he could not have been 

17

excluded? 

18

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That's correct. 
And you're saying that the 

20

military cannot exclude any person from any of this area 

21

outside the green line? 

22

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

That's correct.  1382 only 

23

applies to that which is in the exclusive possession of 

24

the United States, which is the area in the green line. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So we're back to the real

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

estate test.  I  I thought that you were not relying 

2

on the  on the exclusive ownership test.  You are? 

3
4

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Our brief very much doubts 

the exclusive possession test. 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Oh, okay. 
Though I do believe, as 

7

Justice Sotomayor said, there's a functional reason for 

8

this.  It is the difference between the public road and 

9

the area inside 

10
11
12
13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you're defending the 

Ninth Circuit's? 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

We're very much 

defending 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, that's what I don't 

15

understand.  Let me press  at the risk of repetition, 

16

the reason I'm asking this question is the record is not 

17

developed.  I looked at the Google maps. 

18

 It looked to me like this area is sort of a 

19

suburban house with a lawn in front of it, and you drive 

20

along the street, and you suspect that the street may 

21

belong to the city a little way up the lawn; but beyond 

22

that, it probably belongs to the homeowner. 

23

 And when you try to see where does the green 

24

line cross that grassy area, you can't easily tell, 

25

and  and it may be just a foot or two.  So it may have

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

been inconceivable that your client didn't cross the 

2

green line or maybe he didn't.  I don't know. 

3

 So, therefore, you're back to a more basic 

4

test, and you say, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that, 

5

if they do not have exclusive control, the military 

6

can't enforce this statute. 

7

 But what do we do, which was my question, 

8

about instances where the military does not have 

9

exclusive control, but the reason it doesn't has nothing 

10

to do with roads, nothing to do with green lines, it has 

11

to do with thousands of other easements that have 

12

nothing to do with this case; therefore, I'm pressing 

13

you to get a definition of this statute that will serve 

14

your ends without getting into all these other kinds of 

15

easements. 

16

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

And I think the functional 

17

approach that Justice Sotomayor suggested is exactly 

18

that. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And what is that, in your 

understanding? 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

I think, here, it is the 

22

area that the United States government has determined by 

23

where it's built a fence and drawn the green line, that 

24

it has exclusive possession. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Really, Mr. Chemerinsky, I

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't mean to interrupt your sentence.  But, I mean, I 

2

may own a parcel of property, and I may put up a fence 

3

around my property, and I may not put the fence right at 

4

the very edge of the property.  I may leave a little 

5

border between the edge of my property and the place 

6

where the fence is. 

7

 Now, are you saying that I have ceded 

8

exclusive control over this area between the fence and 

9

the end of the property? 

10

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No.  And, in fact, that's 

11

exactly the situation here, and it goes to answering 

12

what Justice Breyer began a moment ago.  Here, what you 

13

have is a fully fenced perimeter.  About 200 yards from 

14

that fenced perimeter, where there is a gate, a green 

15

line was drawn on the ground. 

16

 On just the other side of that green line is 

17

a designated protest zone in Highway 1.  And that's, of 

18

course, where these activities occurred.  And what I was 

19

saying to Justice Breyer is there are reasons why every 

20

court of appeals that has considered this has adopted 

21

the exclusive possession tests. 

22

 It serves the interest of the public in 

23

giving clear notice for when they're on a military 

24

base 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What do you mean by,

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"exclusive possession"?  Does the fence have any 

2

relevance?  What is the relevance of the fence? 

3

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Well, the fence is 

4

tremendously relevant, in determining where the 

5

government believes the military installation begins, 

6

and also, it's very important in terms of national 

7

security. 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But there are bases that 

have no fences.  So what, there?  None of that is under 
the exclusive possession of the government? 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No, Your Honor.  The 

12

government gets to decide the area of exclusive 

13

possession.  So take the Greer case as an example.  In 

14

Greer, this case emphasized that Fort Dix, even though 

15

it was open, still was in the exclusive possession.  In 

16

fact, the first paragraph of this Court's opinion in 

17

Greer says, "exclusive possession." 

18

 Maybe the analogy that is closest to this 

19

case, then, is this Court's decision in United States v. 

20

Grace, where this Court drew a distinction between the 

21

sidewalks that run outside this building and the 

22

building itself. 

23

 And the Court said, as to those sidewalks, 

24

even though they abut the Supreme Court, it still is 

25

open for speech purposes.  Sidewalks, public roads are

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2


inherently open 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I'm still completely 


3


confused about the test that you are asking us to  to 

4

apply.  Either  either fences are relevant or they are 

5

not relevant.  If you can have exclusive governmental 

6

exclusive military possession of a base where there are 

7

no fences, I don't really see what the significance is 

8

of the fence here. 

9
10

 That's just  that's just for starters. 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Obviously, the fence is 

11

significant, in terms of answering the government's 

12

concerns with regard to national security.  I think the 

13

fence is also important to go, to Justice Sotomayor's 

14

point, with regard to the functional approach.  My 

15

answer to your question 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  What about the 

17

portion of the base on the other side of the road 

18

easement, where the government does have exclusive 

19

possession? 


20

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 


21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 


22
23

24
25

Well 
Is that okay?  That's still 

part of the base. 

But what's interesting, as 

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 
was pointed out 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes or no, under your

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

theory? 

2

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

The government does not 

3

have not exclusive possession there.  There is a public 

4

school there, for example, that anyone can drive and go 

5

to. 

6

 One of the consequences of the government's 

7

interpretation of 1382 is that, if Mr. Apel had a child 

8

attending that public school, he could not go pick up 

9

his child at school, but you or I or anyone else could 

10
11

drive 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That may be very bad, but 

12

is it bad because the government does not have exclusive 

13

possession of every 

14

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
You know, when you talk 

16

about the road, they've given an easement, so you can 

17

say, oh, yeah, they don't have exclusive possession. 

18

But the other side of the road, that vast tract, you are 

19

saying the government, what, does or does not have 

20

exclusive possession? 

21
22
23

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

The government does not 

have exclusive possession.  The 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Then the word "possession" 

24

means nothing.  You are  you are applying solely a 

25

functional test.  It only possesses that which it is

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

using for military purposes.  That is not a possession 

2

test.  It's a purely functional test. 

3

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

But, Your Honor, Congress 

4

didn't, in 1382, say, "all land owned by the military." 

5

It used the phrase "military installation," and whenever 

6

that phrase has been defined, it always refers to the 

7

area that is reserved to be used for military purposes. 

8
9

 The United States can draw the green line 
and build the fence wherever it chooses.  Here, it 

10

decided to do so in a particular place, leaving open a 

11

fully open public road with a designated protest zone. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I have the 

13

same problem that Justice Breyer has.  PXes belong to 

14

the military, generally, the land, but they are run by 

15

outside contractors, sometimes.  Are you saying because 

16

they've given up exclusive control of the PX, that they 

17

fail your test? 

18

 So does the utility company. 

I don't know 

19

if it's possible that military bases generate their own 

20

utilities, but I presume that, somewhere, they don't, 

21

and they have an easement to drive up and read their 

22

meters. 

23

 There may be easements for repairs of 

24

certain underground things that  that supply the base. 

25

That's not exclusive control, so I'm  or possession.

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

So what  what does your test mean? 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

It is where the United 

3

States chooses to exercise exclusive possession.  The 

4

United States, for example, in Greer, said, we are 

5

claiming we have exclusive possession over the entire 

6

area of Fort Dix, even though there was a public road. 

7

If the government wants to say, even as to the PX within 

8

Vandenberg, that's within our exclusive possession, they 

9

can do so. 

10

 But the government, by granting the easement, by 

11

allowing the public road, by creating the designated 

12

protest zone, has done something very different than 

13

exclusive possession. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So that  that road for 

15

the public utility for which there is an easement of 

16

travel is not exclusive to the U.S.?  So anybody can 

17

travel into the base at any time they want to? 

18

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No, Your Honor, because, 

19

in order to come on to that utility easement, you would 

20

need the express permission of the base commander.  So 

21

that utility easement would still be an exclusive 

22

control, to go to Justice Breyer's question 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You need the express 

24

permission of the base commander to drive down the road. 

25

It's just that he has given it to  to the public at

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

large. 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Well, Your Honor, everyone 

3

has the authority to drive down that road.  Somebody 

4

who 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Because it's been 

6

ceded by the United States for the convenience of the 

7

traveling public. 

8
9

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Exactly.  And then the 

question is, once the United States has ceded the 

10

easement, under 1382, can a person be prosecuted?  And, 

11

once the United States has ceded that easement, does it 

12

violate the First Amendment, in light of this Court's 

13

decision in Flower, to prosecute 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I thought you just 

15

answered the question from Justice Sotomayor by saying, 

16

no, no, the utility easement doesn't work because the 

17

military commander has not granted permission to anybody 

18

else to use that easement. 

19

 Here, we have a public road easement, and 

20

you said that's different.  And my question was:  No, 

21

it's not, because the military commander has given 

22

permission to use that easement.  Now, I want to know 

23

what distinguishes the two cases. 

24
25

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

And this goes to 

Justice Kennedy's question, earlier, if we are talking

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about an easement.  An easement that is created for a 

2

public road inherently has free speech rights attached 

3

to it. 

4

 In fact, many lower court cases have always 

5

said an easement for a public road includes the right to 

6

use it for speech purposes.  That is very different than 

7

an easement that exists for purposes of the utility. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It seems to me a First 

Amendment argument and not an argument that goes to the 

10

scope of Section 1382. 

11

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No, Your Honor, because 

12

you need to interpret the statute to avoid the 

13

constitutional issues.  If you interpret the statute to 

14

allow excluding speech on this public road easement in 

15

the designated protest zone, then interpreting the 

16

statute that way would raise grave First Amendment 

17

issues. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you are saying we should 

19

read the statute to say it only applies when it doesn't 

20

violate the First Amendment.  Of course, we'd read it 

21

that way. 

22
23
24
25

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Of course, you should read 

it that way. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But not because it has 

anything to do with the scope of authority of the

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

government.  It's what the government can do.  I  I 

2

don't know how to read that  that text, in such a way 

3

that it will avoid all First Amendment problems.  There 

4

is no way to do that. 

5

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

I disagree, Your Honor.  I 

6

think that the reason that every lower court and the 

7

United States government itself have read "military 

8

installation" as exclusive possession is that, 

9

otherwise, it would raise First Amendment problems. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you are arguing that 

11

the military cannot grant an easement across a military 

12

installation for the purpose of allowing the public to 

13

drive from a point, let's say, to the south to a point 

14

to the north, without also granting an easement that 

15

would allow people to linger along the road and engage 

16

in First Amendment activity.  That  is that your 

17

argument? 

18

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, it is not, Your Honor. 
Because I can understand why 

20

the military might be willing to say, well, fine, we 

21

understand that it would be very inconvenient to make 

22

everybody drive around the installation.  We'll allow 

23

them to drive through, but we do not want people 

24

lingering here because that does create security 

25

concerns.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No, Your Honor, that is 

2

not my position.  If the government wanted to have a 

3

closed base and say, we're going to allow this road to 

4

go through, but there were signs to let everyone know 

5

they were still on the closed base, there were guards 

6

that were there, that is Greer.  That is not this case, 

7

and that's not Flower. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Your  your argument is 

sort of a use it or lose it argument, is that  is that 

10

correct?  That the government has this commanding 

11

authority, unless the government uses it to its full 

12

extent every day of the week, it loses it? 

13

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Well, in a sense, yes, 

14

Your Honor.  The sense is that the government gets to 

15

decide where to draw the green line.  The government 

16

gets to decide where to put the fence.  And when they 

17

decided to create a public road with a protest zone 

18

outside of it, then to interpret 1382 applied, as I said 

19

to Justice Scalia 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

One of the arguments that 

21

the government makes is, look, what the military wants 

22

to do here is something very sensible.  It keeps tight 

23

what it needs to keep tight, but it allows to be more 

24

open areas that can  that it  it doesn't have an 

25

interest in securing entirely.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And that's for the convenience of military 

2

personnel.  It's for the convenience of other people who 

3

live around the base.  What's wrong with that? 

4

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor, what's wrong 

5

with that is there is no need to exclude peaceful 

6

protesters from the public road in a protest zone, in 

7

order to achieve the national security interest of the 

8

government. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's usually 

10

the sort of determination that's left to the military 

11

commander.  I can think of a lot of reasons why the 

12

commander would not want a gathering of people on the 

13

road, but would be willing to let people drive through 

14

the road. 

15

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

That's exactly right, Your 

16

Honor.  The military commander gets to decide that.  But 

17

by creating a designated protest zone outside of that, 

18

it's indicative that the military commander doesn't 

19

perceive any national security threat from allowing a 

20

gathering there. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it indicates, 

22

as the  the barment order does, that he does see some 

23

kind of threat by allowing somebody in there who's 

24

vandalized the base in the past. 

25

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Your Honor, but we  this

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court has never said there's a permanent forfeiture of 

2

First Amendment rights because somebody misbehaved at 

3

one time. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is there  can 

5

there be a temporary forfeiture of First Amendment 

6

rights? 

7

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Of course, there can be. 

8

People can be in prison and lose their First Amendment 

9

rights.  There can be restraining orders issued. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I'm talking 

11

about what this case is about, which is the temporary 

12

exclusion.  Would your case be the same if Mr. Apel was 

13

barred for one year? 

14

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Well, he can be barred 

15

from coming onto the base, as drawn by the green line, 

16

for one year of 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, he can traverse 

18

it.  He can traverse.  There  there's no question of 

19

that.  Could he be barred from participating in protests 

20

for a year because he vandalized the base? 

21

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

Yes, Your Honor, a 

22

sentence could include that.  There's no doubt that 

23

there could be  or if somebody was perceived 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Now, here, as I 

understand it, he was barred permanently, subject to the

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

right of him to apply for removal of the barment. 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

That's correct, Your 

3

Honor.  There is the ability to appeal a bar order to 

4

the commander. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's more than that.  It 

6

says I mean  you know, if you wanted to take someone 

7

to school.  It said  first, if you need medical 

8

treatment, you can just go in, and then it said you 

9

you have to receive prior written approval from me, the 

10

commander, or my designee, but if you get it  so I 

11

suppose if he had a child at the school, he would ask 

12

and they'd give it to him. 

13

 I mean, it didn't seem to me an absolute 

14

bar.  It seemed to me a bar for purposes of going to 

15

that particular 

16

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

He can ask the commander 

17

of the base who issued the bar order for permission to 

18

use it.  Your Honors

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do we have to get into any 

20

of that?  Do we  just like I don't know where he 

21

really was physically.  I don't know whether that grass 

22

strip is within something, without something.  These all 

23

sound like First Amendment relevant matters. 

24
25

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

But they're also relevant 

to the statute.  They're relevant to interpret the

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute to avoid constitutional doubt.  They're relevant 

2

because 

3
4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

To avoid  just to 

interrupt  to avoid grave constitutional doubts. 

5

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

6

 And, Your Honor, also, since every other 

Yes, Your Honor. 

7

court has interpreted the statute, as we're suggesting, 

8

there's at least ambiguity, which, under the Rule of 

9

Lenity, means it has to be construed in favor of a 

10
11

criminal defendant. 
 Like so many cases to come before you, this 

12

one is about where do you draw the line.  Here, the 

13

government has drawn the line, and it's a green line. 

14

Now, on this side of the green line, there is a First 

15

Amendment right to speak. 

16
17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

of Lenity, you said in favor of a criminal defendant. 

18

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

20
21
22
23

I'm sorry.  The Rule 

Yes, Your Honor. 
We're talking about 

barment here.  Is that a criminal sanction? 
 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

1382 is the criminal 

statute that he was convicted of violating. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right, but this 

24

doesn't  you're not allowed to collaterally attack the 

25

barment decision.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. CHEMERINSKY: 

No, Your Honor.  What 

2

we're saying is you have to interpret the words 

3

"military installation."  There are two different 

4

interpretations or perhaps more has come out.  What 

5

we're saying is you have to choose the interpretation 

6

that favors the criminal defendant. 

7

 So we are using the Rule of Lenity, relative 

8

to interpreting the statute, and that's why we believe 

9

that both, in terms of the statute and in terms of the 

10

First Amendment, the Ninth Circuit should be affirmed. 

11

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Horwich, five minutes remaining.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH 

15
16
17
18

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. HORWICH: 

Thank you.  Just a couple of 

points. 
 I  I think the colloquy with my friend 

19

sort of shows that taking this functional approach to 

20

where the statute applies daytoday, placetoplace, is 

21

really just not going to prove workable.  And we have 

22

to, remember, this is a misdemeanor prosecution.  This 

23

is not something that should entail an extremely 

24

extensive subtle inquiry that is going to vary from 

25

placetoplace.

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And So I think that that shows the wisdom of 

2

what the Court said in the Benson case, which we quote 

3

at page 15 and 16 of our reply brief, which explains. 

4

It says that, "When a tract has been legally reserved 

5

for military purposes, courts follow the action of the 

6

political department of the government and will not 

7

inquire what the actual use is to which any portion of the 

8

reserve is temporarily put." 

9

 As for the Ninth Circuit's approach, which 

10

is this sort of real estate based analysis, I think 

11

there have been a number of hypotheticals offered that 

12

show why that's going to produce some borderline absurd 

13

or entirely absurd results. 

14

 And so that's why we come back to, again, 

15

respecting the decision to place  to place the 

16

installation under military command and that 

17

Section 1382 provides the sanction to enforce the orders 

18

entered pursuant to that lawful command. 

19

 I might say one word about the green line 

20

and its  its relevance.  My friend says that it is 

21

sort of the threshold across which 1382 applies or 

22

doesn't apply.  The relevance in a 1382 prosecution of 

23

the green line comes in a prosecution under the first 

24

paragraph for violating a regulation. 

25

 At Joint Appendix 51, there's the

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

commander's order closing the base, and what it says is, 

2

"Pursuant to my authority, Vandenberg Air Force Base is 

3

a closed base.  General rule covering the entire command 

4

authority." 

5

 Paragraph 2, "The roadway easements through 

6

Vandenberg have limited use as provided," et cetera, et 

7

cetera.  "Use and occupation is for these purposes only 

8

and is subject to any rules and regulations the 

9

installation commander may prescribe," and so forth. 

10

 So what the green line is, is it's defining 

11

the boundary between the closed base  the generally 

12

closed base  and the road, which is open.  So that is 

13

what ensures that someone who is driving on the road is 

14

not committing an offense against the commander's 

15

regulations, if they are just an ordinary member of the 

16

public. 

17

 And, of course, if they cross over the line, 

18

then they are violating the closed base regulation if 

19

they don't have the commander's permission to cross that 

20

line. 

21

 So the  what is different, of course, 

22

about Respondent is that he's been barred from the base, 

23

so the rules that apply to the general public don't 

24

apply to him.  Of course, that's the very purpose of the 

25

second paragraph of Section 1382, is to recognize that

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

commanders can make individualized determinations that 

2

the rules that work, generally, for the public don't 

3

work for particular people who show themselves to be 

4

willing to vandalize government property or disobey the 

5

instructions to remain within the areas that they may 

6

lawfully be present in. 

7
8
9

 And, of course, that's the basis for why 
Respondent was barred. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

May I just ask a background 

10

question, Mr. Horwich?  What's the history of this First 

11

Amendment area?  What  when did this speech area come 

12

into being? 

13

 MR. HORWICH: 

There  there was a 

14

settlement of litigation with the commander in the late 

15

1980s.  It's in the  it's reproduced  part of it is 

16

reproduced in the Joint Appendix  which I guess shows 

17

a couple things  in which the commander agreed that there 

18

would be a place on the base where 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Was the litigation 

20

essentially like this one, basically saying that this 

21

was not under military command? 

22

 MR. HORWICH: 

To be honest, I'm not familiar 

23

with the particular legal contentions there.  But I 

24

think what the settlement does show is that if it's the 

25

commander who is authorizing this, the commander remains

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in charge of this. 
 And, of course, the current protest policy, 

3

which is reproduced in the Joint Appendix, is quite 

4

clear that the commander retains authority to  and 

5

control the time and place of the protests and, of 

6

course, makes it clear that people who are barred can't 

7

come back. 

8
9

 So on that point, with respect to the 
constitutional avoidance argument, I think, as the Chief 

10

Justice pointed out, it needs to be a serious 

11

constitutional doubt.  And I think what this Court has 

12

said in Virginia against Hicks puts any of those doubts to 

13

rest. 

14

 The Court said, in that  in that case, 

15

that the First Amendment permits, quote, "The punishment 

16

of a person who has, pursuant to lawful regulation, been 

17

banned from a public park"  so I think a fortiori a 

18

military base  "after vandalizing it and who ignores 

19

that ban in order to take part in a political 

20

demonstration." 

21

 The Court has  so the Court I think has 

22

already settled this. 

23

 Thank you. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 The case is submitted.
