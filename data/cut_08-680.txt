CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

5

Maryland v. Shatzer.

General Gansler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. DOUGLAS F. GANSLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GANSLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

This case is here from the Maryland Court of

12

Appeals.

In that case, the court of appeals suppressed

13

a statement that was given by Respondent following what

14

the trial court found to be a valid waiver of his

15

Miranda rights and following a free and voluntary

16

confession.

17

The reason why the court did so is because,

18

two years and seven months prior to that, the defendant

19

was in a different custodial interrogation and at that

20

time invoked his right to counsel.

21

Court reverse the Maryland Court of Appeals.

We ask that this

22

It is our position that a break in custody

23

from custodial interrogation should be the bright line

24

that this Court adopts in order to end the irrebuttable

25

presumption that this Court created in the Edwards case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

the time?

3

that should be enough?

4

Without regard to

A break in custody of one day, do you think

MR. GANSLER:

Your Honor, we do think one

5

day should be enough, as long as it is not in the

6

pretrial detention category.

7

that have come before this Court, Edwards, Minnick and,

8

Roberson, all -- two of them were three days, and one of

9

them was one day, but those defendants were in the

10

Obviously, the three cases

pretrial detention status.

11

So if in fact a defendant is brought in,

12

questioned, and then released back to his or her daily

13

routine, and away from the isolation of the custodial

14

interrogation, we feel that that should be the bright

15

line for a break in custody.

So what if it's

repeatedly done?

Miranda rights.

know, just sort of catch and release, until he finally

breaks down and says, All right, I'll talk.

You let him go.

He says, I don't want to

You bring him in, give him his

He says, I don't want to talk.

MR. GANSLER:

You

There is parade of horribles

24

of catch and release and Your Honor just went through

25

one of them, and there are obviously a number of
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hypotheticals that one could posit.

2

that the break of custody would be the end of the

3

Edwards irrebuttable presumption.

4

still three responses to that.

5

defendant could still say that his or her Miranda rights

6

were not given voluntarily and willfully.

7

due process jurisprudence that this Court had prior to

8

Miranda still is in existence, and therefore the

9

defendant could argue that that confession was given in

10

We would suggest

However, there are

The first would be the

Secondly, the

an overborne way, that his will was overborne.

11

But finally and I think most relevant,

12

because this is sort of the other side of this case, is

13

that there has been -- since 1982 eight Federal circuits

14

and over 20 States have had the break of custody rule in

15

effect.

16

albeit in dicta and parenthetically, assumed a break in

17

custody as the rule.

18

opinion, at least that we could find, that has this -

19

that has that scenario -

20

And in fact this Court in the McNeil case,

There has not been one published

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is the rationale for the

21

break in custody that there is a likelihood of

22

non-coercion?

23

rule?

24
25

Is that the reason that you offer for the

MR. GANSLER:

Your Honor, it goes to -

yes, this Court has said, most recently again in
5

prevent badgering.

10

11

that there has been no break in custody.

12

a very difficult rule that you are proposing.

13

MR. GANSLER:

I think that's

Well, the courts -- the lower

14

courts have shown that there is a difference between

15

police interrogational custody and correctional custody.

16

What we are suggesting is once the person -- in our

17

case, for example, in the second interview, the

18

defendant was in what's called -- what's called a

19

maintenance room in the room, with a metal table and the

20

two chairs.

21

When that person is released from that, some people are

22

habitual criminals and they're put back into the general

23

population amongst -- that's where they live for that

24

time period.

25

custody for Edwards purposes ought to end at the end of

It was clearly an interrogation context.

Other people go home.

But the break in

2

Now, could there be an interrogational

3

situation while the person's in prison?

4

You can envision a correctional officer coming to the

5

cafeteria when there's, the public is there, the public

6

being other inmates, and that would not be deemed to be

7

an interrogation atmosphere.

8

9

blocking the doors and saying no one's allowed to come

10

in here, that could then become interrogation custody.

11

Absolutely.

If, however, they cleared

And this Court and other courts, the courts

12

all the time, have to decide in the Edwards context

13

whether or not the defendant was in custody when the

14

statement was given.

So, if the whole idea is to protect his right to

MR. GANSLER:

Your Honor -- well, first of

21

all, the defendant while they're in prison can contact a

22

lawyer in some circumstances.

23

two years and seven months between these two

24

25

called.

For example, during the

But let's say that that was unavailable to

that particular defendant.

It's our position that what

could get a lawyer?

MR. GANSLER:

It didn't -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you're in prison and

they give you the Miranda warnings, what would that tell

2

the average prisoner with respect to access to a lawyer?

MR. GANSLER:

It would tell them they have a

right to counsel and if they couldn't get one one would

be provided to them.

provided a lawyer to him right away if they had -- he

There is no meaning to Edwards in that situation,

and find some arbitrary number, but after all, Edwards

is an arbitrary rule.

9

MR. GANSLER:

The reason why I think break

10

in custody is not as problematic, and this goes to the

11

Justice's earlier question as well, is because literally

12

the year after Edwards, 1982, was the first of the eight

13

Federal circuits that found the break in custody rule.

Obviously,

in different cases there's different lengths of time.

2

But if -- in Justice Kennedy's question, if we were

3

going to adopt a time limit, I -- we would suggest,

4

like, for example, a seven-day time limit.

5

suggests that is arbitrary.

6

seven days is, right now the rule is three days, and you

7

cannot envision the situation, at least I can't, where

8

somebody would be held without being presented for more

9

than three or four days, so -

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:
three days?

12

The Court

The reason why I would pick

Why do you say the rule is

What rule is that?
MR. GANSLER:

Because right now, if you look

13

at Edwards being the next day, Minnick and Roberson

14

being three days, that that is the only cases from this

15

Court which says when the Edwards presumption goes.

16

we don't have -- whether -- what Respondent's rule would

17

do is, in our view, extend it right now from the

18

three-day limit -- now, many have suggested that's in

19

perpetuity.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

Yeah, but you -- you are

21

not arguing for a seven-day limit no matter what, even

22

if he is held in jail, are you?

23

MR. GANSLER:

If he is held in jail on his

24

own case -- see, the most difficult scenario, in our

25

view, is one that we don't think the Court needs to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reach here, which is actually the Green case from the

2

District of Columbia, where he is held on his own case

3

in a pretrial detention -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. GANSLER:

Right.

-- scenario, because then he

6

does have different incentives to cooperate or not

7

cooperate with the police and then the question would

8

be, well, does that -- is the break of custody there at

9

conviction or at sentencing?

10

And we can quibble about

that.

11

We don't need to get to that in this case.

12

But if he is held in jail on another case, that's where

13

he lives.

14

15

and put there with different officers in a metal room -

16

MR. GANSLER:

Suppose it was the same

Well, I actually think for -

21

in this case, with Detective Blankenship and Detective

22

Hoover, the Court should assume it's one and the same.

23

In fact, Roberson said just that, that within the same

24

department -- but it is instructive in this sense.

25

Respondent's -- if Respondent's rule were to be adopted,
16

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is no way that one police department can know what

2

happened in front of another police department, in front

3

of another police department, while that person is being

4

detained -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you could limit it

6

to the same police department, the same investigation,

7

so you are not covering the waterfront of every

8

interrogation about any crime, any place.

9

MR. GANSLER:

Except for right now, we live

10

in a world of Roberson, where we do.

11

if a defendant invokes in California for a shoplifting

12

case and then is transported to Iowa and then to

13

Maryland, the Maryland authorities have no idea whether

14

he invoked in one of the other two.

15

So in other words,

What is worse is right now, since we don't

16

have a break in custody rule, this defendant, Shatzer

17

himself, could have invoked counsel 20, 25 years ago in

18

some other State.

19

We have no way of knowing that.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, the

20

hypothetical you are positing is an investigation about

21

unrelated crimes.

22

it's what Justice Ginsburg was pointing to, it was an

23

invocation on this crime, on this criminal activity, not

24

one in another State or another police department.

25

so that's a substantially different question.

Roberson did not draw a

MR. GANSLER:

That's exactly right, and

12

that's what creates the problem that if defendant -- if

13

we don't have a break in custody rule, a defendant who

14

invokes anywhere at any time is forever immune from

15

being questioned by the police, regardless of what would

16

be a sort of a wholly irrational view and an absurd

17

result, which I think is where we live right now.

18

And it becomes, obviously, greater in a

19

world where we have DNA.

20

1981, but with these cold cases coming back 15, 20, 25

This Court has repeatedly made clear that

16

Edwards v. Arizona is a prophylactic rule designed to

17

implement the protections of Miranda v. Arizona, and it

18

does so by operating as an anti-badgering rule.

19

facts of this case, I don't think there is any colorable

20

argument that Mr. Shatzer was badgered into waiving his

21

Sixth Amendment rights.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

On the

Now, I know that you're

23

going to go into the question of how we shape a rule,

24

and I would like you, and perhaps on rebuttal your other

25

counsel, to comment on the following:
20
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't see -- as

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Kennedy had a problem, so do I have a problem

2

with anything that just says break in custody, and

3

taking time seems fairly arbitrary.

4

Suppose you -- could you try to shape a rule

5

on the civil situation, the codes of ethics, where you

6

are not supposed to talk to a client who is represented

7

by a lawyer?

8

best I could do at the moment is you would say:

9

due to a breach in custody and the passage of time, the

That's where my mind is going.

And the
When,

10

questioner did not and would not reasonably believe that

11

the suspect was looking for or was represented by

12

counsel?

13

What I've tried to do is take the purpose of

14

the civil rule, the ordinary ethical rule, and then use

15

it to shape a standard.

16

comments on that thought.

17

MR. HEYTENS:

So I would appreciate any

Justice Breyer, I think there

18

is a few problems with that approach.

First of all,

19

this case is not about the Sixth Amendment right to the

20

assistance of counsel.

21

right against compulsory self-incrimination, and this

22

Court has said several times that rules of legal ethics

23

are not relevant to the Fifth Amendment

24

self-incrimination rule.

25

case, for example.

It's about the Fifth Amendment

It says that in the Burbine

That is the case where, although the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

questioner knew that the suspect had an attorney who was

2

trying to reach him, the Court said that is not a Fifth

3

Amendment self-incrimination problem, because we have to

4

look at things from the perspective of the suspect.

5

The question is whether the -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Quite a lot of what I read

7

was about the problems of counsel.

8

to do with this, nothing at all?

9

MR. HEYTENS:

Counsel has nothing

Counsel has something to do

10

with it, but the Court has made clear going back to

11

Miranda that when we're we are talking about the Fifth

12

Amendment right to counsel, the only reason that counsel

13

matters is to help to make sure that -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- are we interested in

15

counsel or not?

If we are interested in whether he's

16

represented by counsel, and Miranda covers both, then I

17

would repeat my question.

18

MR. HEYTENS:

We are not -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

If we are not interested in

20

representation by counsel, then I would withdraw my

21

question and you don't have to answer it.

22

MR. HEYTENS:

We have -- in the Fifth

23

Amendment context, we are interested in counsel only as

24

a derivative of his right not to be forced to

25

incriminate himself.

It is in this context a purely
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

derivative right, and we need to look at it from his

2

perspective.

3

I think the reason that this case matters in

4

an intensely practical way is, there are approximately a

5

million and a half prison inmates in this country right

6

now, many of whom are serving extremely long sentences.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, couldn't we say that

8

in -- in the situation where there is a change from

9

pretrial status to post-conviction status, the Edwards

10

rule is no longer an irrebuttable presumption, but it's

11

simply a rebuttable presumption?

12

the rule would not apply if the prosecution could show

13

that under the circumstances the reason for the rule,

14

the concern about law enforcement badgering, was not

15

present?

16

MR. HEYTENS:

And that there -- that

That would certainly be open

17

to the Court to say that, Justice Alito.

18

this is a -- a second-order -

MR. HEYTENS:

And, Justice Scalia, that's -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But carrying -- carrying

3

that analysis one step further, if you are just talking

4

about people who were inmates pursuant to prior

5

conviction, why wouldn't the better rule be that if the

6

inmate is given the opportunity to say no, I don't want

7

a visitor today, and then if he accepts the visitor, you

8

would say he is no longer in custody?

9

don't want to, then he -- then he is in custody and you

10

But if he says, I

preserves the presumption.

11

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, Justice Stevens, I

12

suspect that's what the police would do, if you ruled

13

against the State in this case.

14

that you shouldn't do that is you have to ask yourself

15

what is the benefit that such a rule is trying to

16

accomplish.

17

But I think the reason

The Court has made clear again JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, that -- such a rule

18

would accomplish the benefit when he really wants -

19

willing to talk, he would say:

20

to the officer.

21

MR. HEYTENS:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23
24
25

I would be glad to talk

Well, Justice Stevens If he doesn't want to, he

should just say no.
MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Stevens, if he didn't

want to talk to the officer, there was nothing to
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prevent him from invoking his Fifth Amendment right to

2

counsel.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it is a little

4

different when the man first comes, says, will you talk

5

to officer.

6

in the room with two or three people around in a

7

different setting, then he is still in custody.

8
9

He can very clearly say no.

MR. HEYTENS:

But if he is

He is in custody, Justice

Stevens, but the premise of Miranda is that a person who

10

is given the Miranda warnings can choose to decide

11

whether to talk or not to talk.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

this case was important.

15

that?

16

If the change You started to tell us why

Would you -- would you finish

You said there were MR. HEYTENS:

Certainly.

The reason this

17

case is important, Justice Scalia, is that because under

18

the Maryland Court of Appeals decision no police

19

officer, no corrections official, can approach any

20

prisoner without first attempting to determine if at

21

some point, to someone, at some place, during the period

22

of continuous incarceration he has ever invoked his

23

Fifth Amendment right to counsel.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's not true, because

my hypothetical, if you told him you don't have to talk
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the officer, and you could produce something, they

2

could question every -- everybody in jail all over the

3

country.

4
5

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, they can't approach him

for questioning.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They can't force him to

7

attend the questioning.

But if they give him an

8

opportunity to say, I -- I'm a prisoner, I just want to

9

stay in the prison population and not go to an

10

interrogation room.

And if he is willing to go, you

11

could question him.

You do not have the example of no

12

possibility.

13

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Stevens, the problem

14

in that situation, again, though, is that ultimately the

15

only basis for applying this presumption at all is if

16

it's appropriate to apply an irrebuttable presumption

17

that, even though we gave him the Miranda warnings and

18

even though he said, I am happy to talk to you, we

19

should presume that when he said that, that wasn't the

20

truth.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I thought that you

22

couldn't approach him.

I thought that once he's invoked

23

his right to counsel, you can't approach him and say,

24

would you like to talk now?

25

that the rule?

Right?

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Isn't that -- isn't

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, under Rhode Island v.

2

Ennis, you are entitled to -- to update him on the

3

status of the interrogation, but you are not entitled to

4

resume custodial interrogation unless there has been a

5

break in custody or something has terminated Edwards.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if the incarceration

7

is a continuation of custodial custody, to be redundant,

8

if it is a continuation of the custody, then why

9

wouldn't asking him whether he would like to see

10

visitors who want to ask him about a particular crime,

11

why wouldn't that be a violation of Edwards?

12
13

MR. HEYTENS:

I think defendants may well

argue that it was -

that Justice Stevens proposes wouldn't work.

be violating Edwards when you asked him if he wanted to

19

see interrogators.

20

MR. HEYTENS:

You would

I think there would be a risk

21

of that happening.

I think the other reason is -

22

again, this is a second order prophylactic rule that the

23

Court has adopted solely in order to prevent people from

24

being coerced, coerced into incriminating themselves

25

when they don't want to.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

which seems to me the only thing that would work.

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, I think as a practical

3

matter, though, there are so -- as you point out,

Justice Kennedy, there are so many exceptions to that.

5

We think that would be far longer than would be

6

necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

In this -- in this case

it's two years and seven months.

Why should the Court

10

take that -- a period of that length and say, well, we

11

are going to now rule for all future cases it should be,

12

say, six months.

13

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, I think that is another

14

potential defect in adopting a pure passage of time

15

approach, though I think this case is particularly easy.

16

And I think the fact that the Maryland Court

17

of Appeals in this case concluded that two years and

18

seven months is covered by an anti-badgering rule just

19

shows at some point how far this has departed from the

20

original purposes of Edwards in the first place.

21

So, I do think -- I mean, the Court could

22

simply say this case is too long, though at that point

23

the Court isn't providing a great deal of guidance to

24

the lower courts that have to deal with these problems

on a day-to-day basis.

to decide whether they can interrogate or not.
MR. HEYTENS:

Absolutely.

years and seven months is too long.

6

why we think an approach that is either -- either

tethered to the break in custody, which as I think I

have said, we think better maps on to the concern that

motivated Edwards -

Let me address for a moment the catch and
release situation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't want to

interrupt that, but there were two aspects to Edwards.

One was the coercion, but the other was the respect for

17

the respect for the invocation of counsel.

MR. HEYTENS:

2

MS. DAVIS:

Yes, it does, Justice Alito.

3

The Edwards rule provides two ending points as it stands

4

right now.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you don't think that's a

6

ridiculous application of the rule?

First of all, how

7

are the authorities in Montana possibly going to know

8

whether this person was interrogated previously on a

9

crime for which the person was never convicted in

10

Maryland, and that invoked the right not to be

11

questioned without -- without an attorney?

12

think there is badgering in that situation?

13

MS. DAVIS:

And you

14

badgering in this context has become a term of art.

4

MS. DAVIS:

Yes.

Because -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MS. DAVIS:

Okay.

-- if they have invoked the

7

right, then the second approach means an attempt to

8

persuade the person to change their mind about having

9

counsel.

10

And where they haven't done so in the interim,

that amounts to -

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me pose you my

12

hypothetical again, the same joy riding questioning, and

13

then 40 years later after the person has gotten a law

14

degree and become an entrepreneur and made $20 million,

15

he's taken into custody and questioned by the Federal

16

authorities for stock fraud.

17

right that was invoked back in adolescence continues

18

forever.

19

MS. DAVIS:

Forever, you know, this

It should.

But let's look at

20

this case, Your Honor, because here this suspect was

21

questioned about the same allegations by detectives from

22

the same police department and while he was in custody

23

continuously.

24

the rationale of Edwards should apply strongly.

25

And under those circumstances Edwards and

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just in case -- just in

34
Alderson Reporting Company

case we don't -- we want to put a time limit on it,

2

which I know you don't want us to do.

3

and I would like your comment, if you want, of a

4

combination of what Justice Alito said and what I said,

5

that is, that there are two parts to the Edwards thing.

6

One is the lawyer part, and the other is the

7

incriminating self part.

8
9

I'm now thinking

Now the lawyer part would be handled by
shaping a rule based on the rules of evidence, along the

10

lines I suggested.

11

then the Miranda part could be handled by saying:

12

the suspect retains the right to show that this

13

questioning is badgering without the question marks.

14

other words what they are really up to is to try to get

15

him to change his mind.

16

And that would give you a time.

MS. DAVIS:

And
but

Now would that work?
I -- I believe the Court could

17

adopt a type of rebuttable presumption under these

circumstances but it shows the difficulty that courts

would have and police officers, too, in measuring

it was when he was initially questioned.

6

MS. DAVIS:

But here, the reason that

It's not the same situation that

Well, I think from the suspect's

7

point of view it is the same situation.

He was in the

8

same position, facing the police in 2003 as he was in

9

2006, in that he was accused of committing crime and in

10

the interim he had no access to counsel and I think that

11

this is significant in this case, because it's not clear

12

that even if he had been able to call out of the prison

13

he would have had representation, because the public

14

defender's office was under no constitutional or

15

statutory duty to provide counsel for a person who's not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

"I don't want to talk without counsel," the one thing he

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MS. DAVIS:

Well, that's possible -- well,

2

the rationale that was extended in the Greene case is

3

that, if questioning is about a different time, the

4

perception, from the suspect's point of view, that the

5

police are badgering him, would be less.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, this isn't fanciful.

7

We just were asked to take a case involving a statute of

8

limitations issue for a murder that was committed like

9

30 years ago, and it said suppose somebody is questioned

10

by State authorities for a murder and taken into custody

11

and then released and then, 30 years later, taken into

12

custody by Federal authorities and questioned for a

13

civil rights violation, based on the same underlying

14

transaction.

16
17

You would say the Edwards rule applies in
that situation?

Yes.

It does.

Now, a police

officer in that situation, really, has three

alternatives.

MS. DAVIS:

8

this Court, in Miranda, was concerned with the limits

9

that society must impose, consistent with the

10

Constitution, in prosecuting crimes, and I think Edwards

11

strikes the balance between the individual faced in

12

captivity questioned by interrogators and the State.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you say, "in

14

captivity," but you think the rule applies, whether they

15

are in captivity or not.

16

hypothetical, the person was free for 40 years, so

17

captivity is not a limitation on your -- your proposed

rule.

MS. DAVIS:

Yes.

I -- I think what he said

The police can't even approach him, according to you,

They will make arrangements quickly for that to happen,

Breyer's question, the ethics rules do not apply to the

The confusion seems to be, in a lot of the

questions, regarding what is custody?

3

don't argue -- we are talking about interrogational

4

police custody, which is different than being in jail,

5

lying on your cot, watching cable television.

6

this is -- in our scenario, the three days that now

7

exist, whereas no one questions in the Roberson,

8

Minnick, and Edwards cases, those three days were

pretrial police custody situations.
