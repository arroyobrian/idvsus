ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FALZONE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Section 514 did something unprecedented in

11

American copyright law.

It took millions of works out

12

of the public domain, where they had remained for

13

decades as the common property of all Americans.

14

violated the Copyright Clause and the First Amendment.

15

Let me turn first to the Copyright Clause.

That

16

In Eldred, this Court held Congress gets to pick the

17

date on which a copyright expires, and it can extend

18

that date before we reach that date.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said that Congress

20

can set a time limit.

In this case, we're dealing with,

21

let's say, Aaron Copeland, who gets the benefit of

22

copyright, and Congress says:

23

should be treated just like Copeland.

24

of our own when we weren't part of the world community,

25

but now we are.

No, we think Shostakovich

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes, we took care

And so, all that Congress is doing is giving

2

Shostakovich works the same limited time as Aaron

3

Copeland.

4

prescription?

And why does that violate the limited-time

5

MR. FALZONE:

The problem is Congress is now

6

setting a second limit long after the first one has come

7

and gone.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the person -- the

person we're talking about, the work we're talking

10

about, never got the first limit.

11

was no time, there was no time when that work could have

12

been protected.

13

Copyright Clause to say, you are entitled to limited

14

time protection?

15

you've had the protection, enjoyed it, and then it

16

expired, and then Congress says we'd like -- we like

17

your work so much we're going to give you another term.

18

There was no -- there

So, why isn't it consistent with the

We're not talking about a case where

What's affected here are people who were

unprotected.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They didn't get the

equivalent of what a U.S. author -- but let's take the

3

large category, because it's the ones that you feature.

4

You're talking about Shostakovich, Stravinski, and I

5

say, well, what's wrong with giving them the same time

6

that Aaron Copeland got?

7

MR. FALZONE:

Congress has been setting the

8

limited time at zero since 1790.

In the 1790 Act,

9

Congress set the limit at zero for a wide array of

10

works, those that did not comply with formalities, those

11

that were written by foreign authors --

12
13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
time.

That's not a limited

That's saying you have no time.

14

MR. FALZONE:

Well, but saying you have no

15

time is itself picking the limit because the language of

16

the Copyright Clause forces Congress to pick a limit

17

that constrains copyright by marking its end.

18

-- if a limit does not mark the end once reached, then

19

there is no limit; there is no end.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it has to have a

21

beginning, too.

22

unprotected, because we didn't recognize their

23

copyright, there's no beginning.

24
25

And that's -- for these people who were

MR. FALZONE:
a beginning.

And when

No, there does not need to be

It is within Congress's discretion.

Remember, this is permissive.

Congress may grant

2

exclusive rights, but it can also say your limit is

3

going to be zero; we decide that you're not going to get

4

any exclusive rights.

5

And every Congress since 1790, every time it

6

went to add subject matter, every time it went to extend

7

the duration of copyright, respected that choice to give

8

no time.

foreign authors ineligible is a decision that Congress

Because the -- the -- if you want to know

If Congress wanted to reach that

work, here's all it has to do on the Government's theory

and even under the mechanism of section 514:

23

needs to do today is extend existing terms a hundred

Isn't that different from not

11

having had the opportunity at all and being given a term

12

to exploit your work and protect it?

13

MR. FALZONE:

The answer is no, it's not

14

different; and Congress treated those situations exactly

15

the same in all 19 amendments over the span of 200

16

years.

In 1790, counsel, there

That was true of most States.

7

And some States

So, it took a whole body of public works and

8

gave them copyright protection the day they decided to

9

pass the copyright law.

So, what are you doing telling

10

us that there has never been a historical experience

11

with Congress taking public works out of the public

12

domain?

13

MR. FALZONE:

Well, let me be clear about

14

what happened in 1790.

The 1790 Act did not remove

15

anything from the public domain.

16

because insofar as it applied to works already printed,

17

it presupposes existing copyrights explicitly in the

18

text of the Act.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. FALZONE:

The text is clear,

Read those words to me.

So, I'm looking at section 1

21

of the 1790 Act, and at the beginning it talks about

22

"after the passing of this act, the author and authors

23

of any map, chart, book or books already printed within

24

The Naxos v. Capitol Records case, highest

11

protection for published works right up to the point

12

where the Federal Act cut it off.

13

And if you look -- and if -- if the question

14

is whether the first Congress intended to take anything

15

out of the public domain in 1790, the answer is you

16

simply cannot reach that conclusion, because everything

17

contemporaneous with the first Congress, the history of

those limits were a work gets no time whatsoever, based

MR. FALZONE:

I'm --

Well -- so, to be precise, our

11

position is once Congress calls the limit, that is, once

12

it says this work is unprotected, whether it's the

13

expiration of 28 years or a decision to give it no

14

protection, it's creating affirmative rights in every

member of the public.

phrase -- so, the public domain is simply a conclusion

Once again, it's just a

I think that's the operative

That's right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think you gave an

8

analogy to the statute of limitations, and I thought you

9

were quite right about that.

You can extend the statute

10

of limitations before it's expired, but once it's

11

expired, it's over.

12

The problem with you using that as an

13

analogy is that there was a beginning.

14

and you're trying to deal with a situation here where

15

you say, you know, the time was limited for the U.S.

16

work, but it's unlimited, that you -- you cannot treat

17

the foreign work -- you cannot give it a limited time,

18

the same limited time that you would give a U.S. work.

19

You're saying these people had no time, and they may

20

never get time.

21

MR. FALZONE:

Time ran out,

They had no time because

22

Congress decided that their works were going to be

23

ineligible, and a limit of zero is one Congress has been

24

setting since 1790 and respected consistently.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it isn't -- it isn't

quite -MR. FALZONE:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- quite so because there

8

are these examples of the people who couldn't get

9

copyright because of wartime both after -- after both

10

World War I and World War II, and -- so, those people

11

were allowed to get the protection that they couldn't

12

get because of the war.

13

MR. FALZONE:

That's correct.

That's what

14

those statutes did.

They were never challenged.

15

make no mistake, our position is, insofar as they

16

removed anything from the public domain, they are

17

unconstitutional.

And

18

But even if the Court doesn't want to go

19

that far, I think the wartime statutes and the other

20

small handful of exceptions the Government points to fit

21

quite well into a very limited exception for eligible

22

authors who show nothing more than the familiar concept

23

of excusable neglect, which has operated -- and, again,

24

in very narrow situations -- to relieve people of the

Let's assume I'm a

patron of the arts because I have furthered the arts by

giving several million dollars to someone who has

MR. FALZONE:

Potentially, but the problem

17

here, if I can move a little bit to the First Amendment,

is the mechanism Congress chose to use here.

to create that reward by taking away core public speech

20

rights from the American public and transforming them

21

into somebody's private property.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

exactly the thing Congress refused to do 19 times over

triggers First Amendment scrutiny here.

to ask the First Amendment question, you can't ignore

Is that right or wrong?

MR. FALZONE:

I think -- I think that it

13

could possibly incentivize him to bring a work to the

14

United States, depending on how the statute worked --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, see, that's what --

16

-- isn't that the question?

The question is, now that

17

Smith has the same protection in the United States that

18

Germany gave him, doesn't that give him an incentive to

send his book to the U.S.?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin by picking up on a point

13

that my friend made in response to Justice Ginsburg

14

suggesting that with respect to foreign works what

15

Congress has done is set the copyright term at zero.

16

don't really think that's a fair description of the

17

situation, and it obscures what Section 514 actually

18

does and what Congress is all about here.

19

I

Since 1891, Congress has concluded as a

20

matter of copyright law that foreign works are entitled

21

to the same protection as domestic works.

22

with respect to the authors that section 514 covers is

23

not that Congress set the copyright limit at zero; is

24

that as a matter of foreign relations, we did not have

25

treaties with these individual countries.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

The problem

And what 514

Official

1

does is remedy that problem.

2

respect to a defined set of foreign authors, they get

3

the remainder of the copyright term that they would

4

otherwise have gotten, and nothing more, had they lived

5

in countries where we had -- with which we had copyright

6

relations at the time they published, or had they

7

complied with the formalities that we used to enforce

8

but no longer do to perfect and renew copyrights.

9

That's what it does.

10

What 514 says is, with

It doesn't grant anybody a perpetual term.

11

It does not renew a copyright term that has run its full

12

course and create a new one.

13

which doesn't -- doesn't reflect anything about a

14

congressional judgment setting the copyright term at

15

zero for foreign works.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

It rectifies that problem

Could Congress grant

17

copyright protection to works that had lost that

18

protection due to the expiration of the period that was

19

provided for under then -- under previous law?

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

We think that the --

21

there isn't an ironclad limit that can be derived from

22

the text of the Copyright Clause or from history that

23

would say that Congress is forbidden in any circumstance

24

from doing that.

25

limits in the text of the Copyright Clause that would

We do think that there are significant

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

restrict any ability Congress might have to do that.

2

But one thing I think is important here is that section

3

514 is not a statute in which Congress did that, and

4

we'd respectfully suggest that any assessment by this

5

Court of whether Congress had that power should await a

6

concrete context in which Congress exercises it, if it

7

ever does.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
-- that you're referring to?

10
11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Excuse me, Justice

Sotomayor.

You said there are

limits.

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.
What -Well, one limit I think

17

is a quite important one is that the Copyright Clause

18

says that you can only grant copyright in authors, to

19

authors.

20

talking about Shakespeare and Ben Johnson, there really

21

at that point isn't an author in which you could vest

22

the copyright.

23

long-expired work like that would really, I think, raise

24

the problem that the Framers were addressing by

25

restricting copyright to authors, which -- which was to

And as a work gets older and older when you're

2

publishers who weren't the authors could claim the

3

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

But doesn't this -- doesn't

5

section 514 provide copyright protection for works that

6

were created by people who are long since dead?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

So, I don't understand the

limit that you were just suggesting.

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, because they --

Do they have to be dead for

12

some period of time before --

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

Yes, it does.

No, but --

-- Congress is unable to

give them back their copyright?

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

What 514 does, Justice

17

Alito, is provide copyright protection to works of

18

foreign authors whose works still have copyright

19

protection in their own country, whether they're dead or

20

alive.

So long as the work has protection in the

And the reason it does so is to ensure our

23

compliance with the Berne Convention.

25

to Justice Scalia's question about how 514 contributes
31
Alderson Reporting Company

And so, the why

Official

1

to the progress of arts and sciences.

What 514 does --

2

514 is, in essence, the price of admission to the

3

international system.

4

branches of our government, the executive and the

5

Congress, decided that we needed to be -- and it was in

6

the national interest -- to be part of the international

7

copyright system and to join the Berne Convention to

8

accomplish that.

9

intellectual property is subject to very serious levels

We decided, the policymaking

The reason we did so was because our

10

of piracy in many foreign countries because of

11

under-enforcement.

12

By joining Berne, what we did was commit

13

ourselves to the international standards.

14

enacting Section 514 to implement the Uruguay Round

15

Agreements in 1994, what we did was say to the world

16

that we are going to ensure compliance in this country.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And by

General Verrilli, I do not

18

find that an appealing argument.

19

Congress either had the power to do this under the

20

Copyright Clause or it didn't.

21

powers that Congress does not have under the

22

Constitution can be acquired by simply obtaining the

23

agreement of the Senate, the President, and Zimbabwe.

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me

I don't think that

I do not think a treaty can

32
Alderson Reporting Company

expand the powers of the Federal Government.

I mean,

2

this is either okay under the copyright clause or it

3

isn't.

Now --

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We completely --- it would be nice to know

6

the reason for it, but you would still have to establish

7

that it's within the power of the Federal Government --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

The Petitioners have also raised the First

15

Amendment argument.

interest on the part of Congress in -- in ensuring

3

5

benefit given to anything at all that is not already

6

created.

And in this case, by definition, there is no

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

I disagree.
By -- how?

How does it

give any benefit to anything that isn't already created?

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Because it creates

11

additional incentives for authors today and going

12

forward, because they know that there's a much greater

13

likelihood that whatever intellectual property they

14

create will be better protected in foreign countries as

15

a result of our joining the Berne Convention.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

How does this provision do

17

that?

I think maybe there are other provisions, but I

18

thought this provision is talking solely about books,

19

for example, that are already created.

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but -Is it not?

I may have been

22

misreading, it but I certainly got that out of, like, 42

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

4

Oh, oh.

You say --

-- in which we get to

choose options.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well then, you know, as you

6

also know from the 42 briefs, that there's a lot of

7

argument that you could comply in other ways that are

8

less restrictive.

9

that -- there what you're saying is -- if I parody it,

And whether that's true or not, is

10

it's not a fair reading I'm going to give -- but what

11

you're saying is we are -- here have a law which says

12

that libraries, music lovers, book buyers will either

13

pay more money for things already in existence or will

14

simply be unable to get them if they're orphans, on the

15

one hand, so that other countries will impose similar

16

kinds of restrictions upon their music lovers, music

17

goers, libraries and -- so that they pay more for our

18

works that are already in -- that are already produced,

19

or simply can't use them because they can't find who

20

owns them.

21

Now, that's in parody form, for

22

succinctness, what I think the argument is on the other

23

side --

24

GENERAL VERRILLI:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right, but --- and they'll say no

purpose.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

But --- but not by copyright

law.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

But there's another way

8

of looking at that, Justice Breyer, of course, which is

9

that the -- but for the fact that these individual

10

authors lived in countries that didn't have copyright

11

relations with the United States, they would have the

12

protection of our copyright law, and they would have the

13

term of copyright --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not necessarily.

There are

15

three categories.

One is the category of the people who

16

you couldn't, because of the country; that's Egypt, I

17

think, and Russia.

18

people -- of sound recordings, and their third is the

19

category, which is not the null set, of people who did

20

not comply with certain registration requirements.

21

example, I believe that the widow of Samuel Brittan

22

failed to renew her copyright.

23

many that failed to renew the copyright after 28 years,

24

and the reason that they didn't is because they didn't

25

think there was much money in it.

The second is the category of the

There just is

That's true but for one

They say that text has to do with progress.

And

10

when they read it historically in light of Macaulay, in

Venice and the copyrights, in light of going back to

there is not one new thing.

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And here

And -- yes.
All right.
Yes, there is.

First,

19

with respect to section 514, it's part and parcel of

20

joining Berne, and Berne gives protection not only to

21

the previously created works but to newly created works,

22

and it creates additional economic incentives in

23

foreign -- by assuring better protection in foreign

24

countries for newly created works.

25

many more than one new work.
37
Alderson Reporting Company

So, it creates many,

Official

1

And I think it's also quite reasonable,

2

Justice Breyer, to read the incentive structure here in

3

a way parallel to the way the Court did in Eldred, which

4

is to say that, just as in Eldred the Court assumed that

5

there was an implicit guarantee to an author making a

6

creation that that author would get the benefit not only

7

of the existing term of copyright but any extension, I

8

think here, with respect to American authors, it's an

9

implicit guarantee that they get the benefit not only of

Doesn't that present a serious First

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I don't think so, Mr.

Chief Justice, and I do think -- for a host of reasons.

23

One is I think that it's -- it's just not so simple, and

24

I think the question that I think Your Honor asked my

25

friend was what about when Congress expands the scope of

exclusive rights for existing works?

2

done that many, many times, and musical composition is a

3

really good example of that.

4

exclusive right in the publishing and vending of musical

5

compositions, but not in their public performance.

6

from 1831 on, once I bought the sheet music, the public

7

performance was, to borrow the Petitioners' way of

8

thinking, in the public domain.

9

time you wanted without having to get --

10
11

GENERAL VERRILLI:
money.

You could do it any

All right.

Well,

-- a license to pay any

But -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's -- one answer

is that Congress has done this before.

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But then, in 1897,

17

Congress granted an exclusive right in the public

18

performance of musical compositions --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

that's --

-- and made it applicable
And so --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

Well, do you

23

have an argument other than that they've -- they've done

24

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, that they've done

it many times before, and it's a process -- I think it

2

reflects -- and -- and the point is that no one has

3

thought with respect to any of those significant

4

adjustments of the boundaries, that it was an occasion

5

for First Amendment scrutiny.

6

because of the wisdom of the Court's opinion in Eldred,

7

that these are --

8
9

And I think that's

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But we have -- but

it's pertinent under the First Amendment in other areas,

10

right?

15

It's a different analysis if your claim is the

Maybe they can do

So, why isn't this a different question,

16

from whether they can extend copyright protection that's

17

already there?

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think -- because I

19

think there is -- once the Court gets into the business

20

of First Amendment analysis, there's no stopping point,

21

because all of the adjustments of the boundaries could

22

have the same kind of effect, I think, as the musical

23

composition example shows.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
what about Jimi Hendrix, right?

Well, what about --

He has a distinctive

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rendition of the national anthem, and all of a --

2

assuming the national anthem is suddenly entitled to

3

copyright protection that it wasn't before, he can't do

4

that, right?

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

What copyright does, by

6

definition, is provide exclusive rights in expression;

7

and so, if the First Amendment is triggered whenever

8

copyright provides exclusive rights in expression that

9

it didn't used to provide, then heightened scrutiny will

10

apply any time Congress exercises its copyright power.

11

And what the Court said in Eldred --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, he's just out of

13

luck?

14

take existing works and you have a derivative work or

15

something that is distinctive to you.

16

are just out of luck?

17

And that's just one example of many, where you

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, those people

Well, of course, under

18

section 514, they're not out of luck because it has

19

significant protections and accommodations for

20

derivative works.

21

be heightened First Amendment scrutiny, we think, Eldred

22

answers, that -- that the First -- the Copyright Clause

23

already contains very significant accommodations of

24

First Amendment interests, the idea/expression

25

dichotomy, fair use.

The question of whether there should

And -- and that is going to
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provide -- maybe -- maybe Jimi Hendrix could claim fair

2

use in that situation.

3

And those are at the core of the traditional

4

contours of copyright.

So, if Congress were to try to

5

extinguish fair use, I'd say yes, we'd have a First

6

Amendment issue there.

7

provide exclusive right in the ideas that are expressed,

8

as opposed to the expression itself, yes, we'd have a

9

First Amendment issue there.

If Congress were to try to

If Congress were to, say,

use the copyright power to engage in viewpoint

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it seems to me what

13

you're saying, and I'm glad you gave this answer because

14

originally I thought I was going to put in my notes the

15

First Amendment doesn't apply to the copyright area --

16

and that just can't be.

17

What you're saying is, is that this law will

20

that.

Now, maybe -- say it isn't immediate scrutiny but

something else.

Amendment is implicated.

12

But -- but certainly the First

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

And what Eldred

13

said, as I read it, Justice Kennedy, is that unless

14

Congress alters their traditional contours of copyright,

15

then rational basis scrutiny, rather than any heightened

16

form of First Amendment scrutiny, applies.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even under -- even

18

under rational basis scrutiny, it seems to me that you

19

run into Justice Breyer's concern that the government

20

interest is vanishingly small when it comes to promoting

21

progress under the Copyright Clause, so that the

22

interest weighed on the other side of the -- the

23

restriction of free speech rights -- it's hard to say

24

that that's necessarily going to tip the balance in

25

every case.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think it is going to

2

tip the balance, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- I --

3

the reason Congress enacted section 514, at the urging

4

of executive branch officials who were charged with

5

trying to ensure that we could integrate ourselves into

6

the international system of copyright protection, was

7

that if we didn't have this provision, then we were not

8

going to be taken seriously; our works were not going to

9

be protected in these foreign countries; and that it

10

would defeat the purpose of joining Berne in the first

11

place.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

It couldn't have been.

13

That must be somewhat overstated, mustn't it?

14

the only concern is not about protecting new works in

15

the foreign countries.

16

was that we've had things in copyright for many years,

17

and we want retroactive protection there.

18

that didn't give it, like Japan, were not kicked out of

19

important.

Now, that's the argument that's made on

What do you say?

21

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, two points:

First,

22

with respect to the interest in what foreign countries

23

will do, I think it's incorrect to assume that this will

24

be tit-for-tat, that if we don't enforce article 18, the

25

only thing other countries won't do is enforce article
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

18 with respect to our works, as opposed to believing

2

that we're not an --

3

enforcing their copyright laws for the whole corpus of

4

our works.

5

an effective partner and not

Second, Justice Breyer, that problem that

6

you identified just exists as a feature of copyright

7

law.

8

respect to those works, it's going to create that issue.

9

The problem here is just the result of a fortuity that

Copyright law exists for a certain time.

With

10

those works might have been published in a country that

11

at the time they were published didn't have copyright

relations with the United States.

13

does is address that fortuity by putting those authors

14

in the same position they would have been in had their

15

country had copyright relations with the United States.

16

And so, I don't think that's a principled objection on a

17

constitutional basis to section 514 --

And what section 514

it still exists.

It may be diminished in the United States, but

GENERAL VERRILLI:

that if you're not a reliance party, then there would be

13

there's something to that point.

14

think that's a result of the fortuity of the countries

not having copyright relations with the United States.

infringement by having a library book on the shelf, and,

9

of course, there are protections for libraries built

11

into the Copyright Act in all events.
And I do -- if I could in my remaining time,

12

I want to go back to the history that we started with,

13

because I do think it is important that there is no --

14

as a matter of text, I think it's clear -- there is no

15

unyielding requirement that you cannot restore copyright

16

to works in the public domain.

17

really does bear that out.

18

I think the history

I think Justice Sotomayor had the history

19

exactly right, that in 1790, you had three States with

20

no copyright statutes.

21

statutes, you had 7 that did not provide copyright to

22

maps and charts, which the Federal statute did.

23

think this is the key point:

24

enact copyright statutes to -- in the 1780s, in advance

25

of the 1790 Federal Act, at least four, and depending on

4

5

They did that at the urging of the

So, I don't think there's any doubt that

6

when Congress enacted the Copyright Act in 1790, it made

7

a conscious choice to take a different approach, to

8

grant copyright protection to existing works, including

9

many, many, many works that were freely available for

10

exploitation in those States --

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't that show at most

12

that retroactive protection can be granted when there is

13

an enormous interest in doing so, namely, the

14

establishment of a uniform copyright system at the

15

beginning of the country?

16

done that and had said -- the alternative would be to

17

say things can be copyrighted going forward, then you

18

would have different copyright laws in all of the

19

States.

20

Because if Congress had not

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think -- I don't think

21

so, Justice Alito.

I think they could have followed the

22

model nationally of prospective copyright only and

23

extinguishing the prior copyright --

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

-- and -- but they didn't

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

make that choice.

2

my friend suggests that the 1790 Act was just a

3

transition.

4

true in an important sense of section 514.

5

a tradition -- of a transition of the United States into

6

the international system, which has required an

7

adjustment of our rules in order to bring us into

8

conformity with the international system.

9

They made a different choice.

Now,

But, of course, the same thing is really
It's part of

And beyond the example, of course, of the

10

1790 -- and by the way, with respect to that language in

11

the 1790 copyright -- who hath or hath not have

12

copyright -- that's just a rerun of an argument that the

13

Court rejected in Wheaton v. Peters.

14

Court said that that language in the 1790 Act was

15

referring to pre-publication common law copyright, not

16

post-publication common law copyright.

17

In Wheaton, the

Beyond that, it seems to me pretty clear

18

that what that language was referring to -- of course,

19

Congress presupposed the existence of copyrights.

20

were all these State statutes that created some

21

copyrights.

22

broadly.

23

There

But what Congress did was act far more

And -- so, I do think -- and then when one

24

looks at the examples of patents -- and I think the

25

Oliver Evans example and that case is an important
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

example.

Early in our history, Congress creates a new

2

patent term to an expired patent.

3

signs it.

4

Justice Marshall upholds it as a circuit justice, and

5

the Court upholds it against a charge that it's

6

impermissibly burdening people who act in reliance on

7

the expiration of the prior patent.

8
9

President Jefferson

Secretary of State Madison issues it.

Chief

There wasn't a word in this Court's decision
in that case about any potential constitutional

10

infirmity with doing that.

11

was such a significant and viable principle of

12

constitutional law, that someone would have brought it

13

up in those cases.

14

reading the Evans decision is that the Court clearly

15

looks at this all as a matter of legislative policy

16

judgment.

17

might have been an argument, a good argument in favor of

18

creating some reliance interest here, but that's a

19

judgment Congress should have made if anybody was going

20

to make it.

21

-- there's no required reading of that statute that has

22

to protect the reliance party.

23

And one would think if this

In fact, the striking thing about

It says, you know, yes, you're right, it

It didn't -- and there is no reading of the

So, I don't -- I just think when you look at

24

the patent protection, when you look at the 1790 Act,

25

when you consider the fact that when Congress expands
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exclusive rights, as it did for example with respect to

2

musical compositions but did in the 1976 Act with

3

respect to lots of exclusive rights, it does so with

4

existing copyrights.

5

And all of that points up the wisdom of what

6

this court said in Eldred, that within very wide

7

margins, these are matters for legislative choice.

8

These are policy calls that require the balancing of a

9

complex set of interests, the drawing of a complex set

10

of lines made even more complex by virtue of the fact

11

that we are now trying to make a transition into full

12

participation in an international system, which is of

13

vital importance to protecting one of our most valuable

14

economic exports, intellectual property.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY T. FALZONE

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. FALZONE:

Thank you.

I have -- I have

21

four points to make:

First one, refusing to provide any

22

protection for a work is setting the term at zero.

23

point of the limited times restriction is it -- excuse

24

me -- it forces Congress to tell us when the end has

25

come.

And if Congress is forever free to change its
52
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

mind, then we can never know if the end has come.

2

Point number two, this statute does not and

3

cannot promote progress, that is, the creation and

4

spread of knowledge and learning.

5

in 1988, we got all of its prospective benefits or, as

6

the Government put it, secured the highest available

7

level of multilateral copyright protection for U.S.

8

artists, authors, and their creators.

9

not about that.

10

This statute is

It's simply about rewarding people who

made things long ago.

11

When we joined Berne

It's --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At the time we joined

12

Berne, there was an appreciation that we deferred the

13

article 18 issue.

14

that we satisfied it.

15

There wasn't any -- anyone who said

MR. FALZONE:

No.

There was an express

16

finding -- explicit finding written into the statute,

17

that -- and Congress found explicitly that we could

18

comply with all Berne obligations without removing

19

anything from the public domain.

20

Now, third point --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there were many

22

people who read article 18 in a different way, and

23

Congress was later persuaded that that was right.

24
25

MR. FALZONE:
finding.

Congress never revisited that

So, no, they found what they found in 1988,
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and they never revisited it.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They -- they found that

3

compliance with article 18 was appropriate for us to

4

become a full member of the international copyright

5

community.

6

MR. FALZONE:

Congress did not make that

7

finding, and I don't think you can even glean that from

8

the testimony that was presented to Congress.

9

problem here is the -- the right to use works in the

The

10

public domain has defined the freedom of speech that the

11

public has known since 1790.

12

freedoms clear by placing works unambiguously and

13

clearly in the public domain, including all foreign

14

works.

15

that has defined the freedom of speech that the public

16

knew.

The 1790 Act made these

So, even since before we had a First Amendment,

17

And that right has also made sure that the

18

copyright sequence provides ever-increasing protection

19

for public speech rights.

20

for some public speech interests during any initial

21

period of protection, but that blossoms into complete

22

protection for all public speech interests, once we

23

reach the limit Congress picks, once they place the work

24

in the public domain.

25

It gives partial protection

The burden on speech that this statute
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

imposes is remarkable.

2

right, which is central to my clients.

3

any doubt, as I think Chief Justice Roberts got at, that

4

the performance has a huge amount of original expression

5

bound up in it.

6

7

reason it's different when John Coltrane plays a jazz

8

standard.

9

Let's start with the performance
There can't be

It's the reason it's different to see

Huge amount of expression.
But even if you put performances aside, this

10

Court has recognized in case after case that there is a

11

critical speech interest in publishing the work of

12

another author, in showing a film created by another, or

13

for that matter, performing the work of another.

14

the -- the burden here is it took speech rights of 250

15

million Americans and turned them into the private

16

property of foreign authors, all on the bare possibility

17

that might put more money in the pocket of some U.S.

18

authors.

21

So,

All this rides on

accepting your argument that zero is a limited time.

22

Amendment side.

23

No.

No.

Not at all.

Not on the First
No, no, no.

That is -- the First Amendment argument

24

is completely independent of that.

25

Congress could do this on the Copyright Clause, we still
55

Even if you find

have that First Amendment problem, and the -- there is

2

no way the Government can pass intermediate scrutiny

3

here.

4

This was not required by Berne.

The

5

Government does not even contend Section 514 was

6

required by Berne, nor could it, because that would

7
