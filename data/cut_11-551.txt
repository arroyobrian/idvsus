ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. FREEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The funding dispute in the -- in this case

12

is the result of two distinctive features of the ISDA's

13

statutory scheme.

14

required the Secretary of the Interior to accept every

15

self-determination contract proposed by an Indian tribe,

16

provided that the contract meets the requirements of the

17

Act, without regard to the total number of contracts

18

into which the Secretary must enter.

19

On the one hand, Congress has

On the other hand, in every fiscal year

20

since 1994, Congress has enacted an explicit statutory

21

cap on the amount of money that the Secretary may use to

22

pay contract support costs under the ISDA and under

23

those contracts.

24
25

Now, we think under the circumstances,
Congress intended the Secretary to resolve these -- the

relationship between these provisions in exactly the way

2

that the Secretary has.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could the Secretary have

10

There's an allegation that the

pro rata share, that it pays some nothing --

11

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

effect acting -- I don't want to use the word

"arbitrarily" -- but acting in whatever its best

15

interest is.

17

correct?

It was my understanding

15

that that system that has been described as arbitrary

16

was not the one that was applicable to the years in

18

MR. FREEMAN:

That's right.

At -- at the

19

time of the district court's ruling in this case, from

20

1994 to about 2006, the Secretary followed a uniform pro

21

rata distribution methodology according to the needs of

22

each of the individual tribes.

thought the tribes wanted.

that lawful binding agreement was entered, agency

4

officials decided in their discretion that they'd prefer

5

not to spend the money on that, and they instead built a

wharf or something.

7

And what the Court said in Ferris -- and

8

this is -- we're not -- we have no quarrel with this

principle -- is that when the funds are lawfully

this question of what Ferris means.

2

there's a government program, and it's to purchase

airplanes.

4

this is subject to appropriations, in the same way that

5

this language does.

6

program, enters into 10 contracts of a million dollars

7

each to buy 10 airplanes.

8

Congress appropriates only $9 million, not $10 million.

9

So suppose that

And it's -- the authorization language says

And the government, under this

But then it turns out that

So my question is:

Now there are 10

10

contractors and -- but there's a shortfall of a million

11

dollars --

12

MR. FREEMAN:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

Right.
-- do those contractors have

contractual rights under Ferris?

15

MR. FREEMAN:

I -- Your Honor, it's going to

16

depend on a couple of things.

17

explain.

18

hypothetical we're entering into the contracts in

19

advance of appropriations, there is no right to be paid

20

until the appropriations are made.

21

23

And let me -- let me

I think, because by hypothesis in your

JUSTICE KAGAN:
has been made.

Yes.

So the appropriation

It's a $9 million appropriation.

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

And in that

24

circumstance, the agency cannot pay more than

25

$9 million, and there is no binding obligation,
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contractual obligation, on the government to pay more.

2

Let me add something, though, in response --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so either one of these

4

airplane manufacturers is going to not have what he

5

contracted for, or all of them are not going to have

6

what they contracted for, because everybody is going

7

to -- their contract is going to be sliced.

8

MR. FREEMAN:

And, Your Honor, the reason

9

why this is not a problem in real life is that there are

10

other provisions in your ordinary procurement contracts,

11

under the ordinary kind of contracts that this case is

12

not, that take care of that.

13

And the principal one is --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

My understanding,

15

Mr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that

16

Ferris said in that situation where it turns out that

17

there's a shortfall but where there are contractual

18

commitments, that -- that the government is bound to

19

live up to those contractual commitments.

20

there's a shortfall, then it comes out of the Judgment

21

Fund.

22

MR. FREEMAN:

No.

And if

Your Honor, it -- there

23

are a couple of things there.

But let me first explain

24

why as a practical matter that doesn't happen in

25

circumstances that are -- are not like this scheme where
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we're required to enter into every contract.

2

ordinary government procurement scheme, there are

3

termination for convenience provisions.

4

In your

And, in fact, what happens in the

5

circumstances in which Your Honor posits is the

6

government terminates for convenience enough of the

7

contracts to make sure that we have the money to pay.

8

And if we didn't do that, it would be a violation of the

9

Antideficiency Act.

10
11
12

And this Court has said many

times -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. FREEMAN:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Yes.

MR. FREEMAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
How do they know that

until they know what they're getting?

19

MR. FREEMAN:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

-- that they've

contracted to?

16

18

So do the tribes have

Well -Meaning they don't know

what they're getting.

22

MR. FREEMAN:

Well, they do know.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They signed a contract

24

that says you're going to pay them for their services to

25

their members and for their administrative costs.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

They

Official

1

incur that cost, and then at the end of the year, the

2

government now says to them you've honored your part,

3

but we're not going to honor ours.

4
5

MR. FREEMAN:

No -- no, Your Honor.

That's -- that's not correct, and let me explain why.

6

First, every contract that the -- every

7

member of the Respondent class signed in this case says

8

that the contractor's obligation to perform the services

9

that are at issue is subject to the availability of

10

appropriated funds.

11

model agreement that is read into every ISDA contract.

12

That's Section (1)(c)(iii) of the

They further have the availability under

13

Section (1)(b)(v) of that model agreement to stop at any

14

point if they're worried that there's not going to be

15

enough money, and seek assurances from the Secretary

16

that there will be.

17

Now, as to whether they know and when they

18

know how much money they're going to get, that was the

19

point of the 2006 distribution policy that the Secretary

20

adopted.

21

first many years, the tribes said, look, we don't know

22

how pro rata is going to work out.

23

with the tribes, and, indeed, with the aid of several of

24

the counsel for the Respondent class, we drafted a

25

policy that -

Under the pro rata system that we used for the

14

So, in consultation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What does the system do

2

to the 50-odd contracts that Arctic Slope, in its amici

3

brief, points to that are similar to these?

4

now mean that moving forward, that every government

5

contractor who has a "subject to appropriations"

6

language takes the risk that at some point in the middle

7

of the contract, the government's going to dishonor its

8

obligation and pay it less than it said it would?

9
10

MR. FREEMAN:

No, Your Honor.

And this

is my --

11
12

No.

Does this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do -- how do we

differentiate those 50 other contracts?

13

MR. FREEMAN:

Well, I think they were citing

14

a number of different statutes in which the statutes

15

provide that funding is subject to the availability of

16

appropriations.

17

Now, it's important to underscore, that's

18

why I started with this point.

19

of those statutory schemes is the government obligated

20

to enter into every contract that comes in the door.

21

And --

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't believe in any

Well, but that's partly why

23

I asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort

24

of wanted to see whether you would distinguish the

25

hypothetical on that basis -
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- but you didn't.

You said

3

no, it really doesn't matter.

4

not obligated to enter into contracts, if the government

5

has entered into too many, too bad; we can't make those

6

additional appropriations.

7

MR. FREEMAN:

Even if the government is

And, Your Honor, it is -- the

8

unique features of this statutory scheme are absolutely

9

important, but I want to -- I took Your Honor's question

10

to be under the general appropriations principles that

11

we are describing, what would the result be?

12

think I'm right, but I should also add, as I said

13

before, there are very strict fiscal controls in 31

14

U.S.C. 1501, et sequitur, that make clear and prevent

15

the circumstance that Your Honor describes --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I

I'm sorry, I'm not clear on

17

what this hypothetical is.

I thought her

18

hypothetical -- Justice Kagan's -- was a situation where

19

the statute says, Mr. Secretary, you can spend no money

20

beyond what is appropriated.

21

MR. FREEMAN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

mention it.

Right.
But the contract doesn't

That's Ferris.
I thought that the -- the real world is, in

contracting, you typically have both a statute that says
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't pay more than is appropriated --

2

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and in the contract, it

4

says, "subject to appropriation," putting the

5

contracting party on notice.

6

MR. FREEMAN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9

That's right.

And -- and --

So which were you

answering?
MR. FREEMAN:

I -- with respect to

10

Justice Kagan, I believe we had a colloquy in which I

11

said that because in her hypothetical we were entering

12

into the contracts in advance of appropriations, they

13

would have to be made express -- the contracts

14

themselves would have to be subject to the availability

15

of appropriations in the contracts.

16
17
18
19

JUSTICE BREYER:

The words in the contract

are "subject to appropriations."
MR. FREEMAN:

Yes.

And without that, it

would be a violation of the Antideficiency Act --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. FREEMAN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

-- yes.
Okay.

So in that world --

23

now we get to the question -- in that world, what

24

happens when 15 people each enter into such a contract

25

for $100,000 each, and the appropriation turns out to be
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

too small to pay all of them, but big enough to pay

2

some?

3

MR. FREEMAN:

Because, Your Honor, what I was

4

trying to answer is that, in your ordinary contractual

5

scheme, the government solves that problem in a very

6

straightforward way.

7

contracts -- enough of those contracts to ensure that we

8

have no obligations beyond the available appropriations.

9
10
11

We terminate for convenience the

Now, we can't do that here, which is why
this is ultimately a question of congressional intent.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't we let

12

Congress fix it?

There are so many ways that

13

Congress could fix this problem directly.

14

line item allocation, it could take away the obligation

15

to enter into these contracts and fully fund.

16

be much more direct --

By doing a

It could

Your --- than it's being,

given the interpretation that you're advancing.
MR. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, I think it's

21

important to understand what -- and maybe it would help

22

if I took a minute to explain this -- what Congress was

23

trying to do in this statutory scheme.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It was trying -- it was

trying to tell the tribes, we're honoring our obligation
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

by paying you the costs, but we're really not going to

2

do it because we're going to let the government give you

3

less?

4

MR. FREEMAN:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Congress intends what it says.

7

you to enter into contracts that -- that give -- make

8

you commit to paying their costs, correct?

9

MR. FREEMAN:

No.

Look, Congress could -I have to assume
It intends to obligate

Not with -- yes.

But

10

450j-1(b) says, "notwithstanding any provision of this

11

Act, all funding under this Act is subject to the

12

availability of appropriations."

13

And let me explain why Congress would

14

have wanted to enact this statute that has some unusual

15

features.

16

to give every tribe the opportunity to enter -- to

17

provide services in its own name to its own people, but

18

we're going to do this on a regular contract basis,

19

meaning we'll just give us -- some to the Secretary.

20

The Secretary signs contracts as they come in until he

21

22

23

says no, we don't have the money to do it.

24
25

Congress, of course, could have said, we want

And then any tribe after

But Congress chose a -- a different
approach.

Congress wanted, as a matter of

self-determination, to require the Secretary to give

2

every tribe who wants the ability to do this the

3

opportunity to do it.

4

funding is subject to the availability of

5

appropriations, the result would be that the government

6

would be exposed to a liability that Congress could not

7

estimate, because the ability of these tribes to pay for

8

overhead costs and whatever varies tremendously from

9

tribe --

10

But if it didn't then say all

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

To what extent do you --

11

do you rely on -- you haven't mentioned it up until now,

12

but Congress, in these appropriations, said "not in

13

excess of."

14

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It wasn't just a general

16

"subject to appropriations."

17

the Secretary shall not pay in excess of a certain

18

dollar amount for these costs.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It was a specific amount,

I had exactly the same

20

question.

The "not to exceed" language, which I think

21

is the word, "not to exceed," hasn't been mentioned by

22

you yet because -- maybe you haven't had time.

MR. FREEMAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

But -- but I thought that

Yes.
-- was the critical -- the

difference between this and even the Cherokee case.

6

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so my question is --

8

is the same as Justice Ginsburg's.

Isn't a principal

9

part of your argument that this contract said not to

10

exceed, and then the sums differ from year to year, but

11

let's say $95 million?

12
13

MR. FREEMAN:

That -- that's exactly right,

Your Honor.

14

I mean -- and what I -- what I tried to

15

answer to a question earlier, it is absolutely clear

16

what Congress was trying to do here.

17

to exceed a specific sum from year to year --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Congress said not

When the Congressional

19

Budget Office, or whatever agency it is that figures out

20

whether there's a deficit and, if so, of how much, do

21

they look at "not to exceed," and do they take that

22

amount seriously?

23
24
25

Or --

MR. FREEMAN:
Your Honor.

Oh, oh, absolutely,

And -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the -- but the

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position of the Respondents is that it makes no

2

difference.

3

MR. FREEMAN:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

No difference at all.
So Congress is saying nothing

at all.

6

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, yes.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It really -So the consequence

9

on the ground is that, if I'm a tribe and I want this

10

money, and I figure out that this is going to cost me

11

$80,000 --

12

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- I sign a contract

14

and say, this is going to cost me $100,000, because I

15

know there isn't going to be $100,000.

16

going to be $80,000, and that's what I need, right?

17

MR. FREEMAN:

There's only

Well, in fact, it can't work

18

that way, Your Honor, because the amounts are limited by

19

statute to the reasonable and allowable costs that are

20

not duplicative of the principal program funds, the

21

funds to run the program --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but it's --

23

well, if 80,000 is reasonable, the only way to get that

24

is to ask for 100?

25

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

And if a tribe thinks

22

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that we haven't put in to the -- we haven't offered them

2

enough money for their contract support costs, they are

3

allowed to decline the offer that we make.

5

file a separate lawsuit before entering into the

6

7

Mr. Freeman, where did

8

these caps come from?

Did the agency initiate them?

MR. FREEMAN:

11

No, it is not.

No.

It is not

That's right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What I don't understand is

12

why the language "not to exceed" is any different from

13

Congress appropriating $900,000.

14

changes if -- if Congress, instead of just appropriating

15

$900,000, authorizes the Secretary to expend not to

16

exceed $900,000?

17

You mean the world

Why --

MR. FREEMAN:

I don't think in that

18

circumstance there would be any difference.

19

reason why it's different is that this is ultimately a

20

question of what Congress was trying to do.

21

constitutional argument that Congress can't enact these

22

kind of caps, and we know from the "not to exceed"

23

language that Congress was being as emphatic as it

24

could.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Here, the

There's no

Well, I -- I would think

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

$900,000 is pretty emphatic, if that's all you

2

appropriate.

3

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

And just -- it's just

4

this is the way, as an ordinary matter, that in

5

appropriations Congress expresses an internal cap.

6

said --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It

But that runs you right into

8

Ferris.

Then you're saying that there's no difference

9

between the standard Ferris-type appropriation, which is

10

just an amount of money, and this kind of appropriation,

11

which is up to or not to exceed that amount of money.

12

MR. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, Ferris we think is

13

inapplicable just to this type of statutory scheme where

14

we're required to enter into the contracts, and there's

15

a limited sum available.

16

17

the moment and address Ferris directly.

18

That's Judge Dyk's reasoning
But let me put that aside for

As I said before, Ferris is about the

19

circumstance in which there are enough available funds

20

in the first instance to pay the contractual

21

obligations.

22

Now, Ferris does not and cannot stand for

23

the proposition that an executive officer, looking at

24

the amount Congress made available in the first

25

instance, can bind the Treasury to pay more than
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress has expressly stated he may bind it to.

2

Court has said many, many times --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This

I take it the Respondents'

4

position is that the contracting officer says, now, this

5

is going to go over the not to exceed amount, but not to

6

worry, just sue us under the Judgment -- just sue us

7

under the Judgment Act.

8

MR. FREEMAN:

Right.

And there is no reason

9

to think that Congress contemplated such a scheme, which

10

would amount to essentially giving full contract support

11

cost funding, but only for the tribes who have the

12

resources and sophistication to sue, minus litigation

13

costs.

14

"not to exceed," a certain amount of money may come out

15

of the Treasury --

That makes no sense at all.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When Congress says

It makes sense if

17

you're looking at the reality of the budgeting process

18

because in one case, that line item appears on the

19

Department of Interior budget; and in the other case, it

20

appears somewhere else in the Judgment Fund budget.

21

they can say it's not our fault.

22

the Court made us do it --

23

MR. FREEMAN:

And

The Judgment Fund --

Well, I don't think so,

Your Honor.

The Judgment Fund is not a new thing.

25

Judgment Fund is available only to pay judgments validly

That's where I'm getting stuck on what your
The Antideficiency Act says you can't spend

17

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So every single

19

contractor, under your logic, should know that when they

20

sign a contract, the government can break it because if

21

it doesn't have enough funds, it can't pay.

22

MR. FREEMAN:

And, Your Honor, that --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- so there's no

24

real logic to your argument, other than to say we

25

can't -- we're -- if the contract says "subject to
27

appropriations," let's do away with Ferris, let's do

2

away with Cherokee Nation, and --

MR. FREEMAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

No, no --- it just means that we

pay you what we can.

6

MR. FREEMAN:

No.

That -- that is

7

emphatically not true.

As -- as an initial matter, as

8

I've tried to explain before, there are very strict

9

requirements in the government's contracting processes,

10

such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that limit

11

the ability of the government to make promises it

12

can't keep, particularly with regard to funding.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what you're saying

14

is you make two promises on the ISDA.

15

pay you your support costs, your administrative costs,

16

in full, and we're going to retain the right to break

that promise.

says.

language where it says we're going to pay you X amount,

all the law that says you have to be reimbursed -- the

tribes have to be reimbursed for all their costs.

5

All of that is going to be ignored.

6

MR. FREEMAN:

Well, it's not that it's

ignored, it's that section 450j-1(b) says,

"notwithstanding any other provision of this Act," and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I guess I'd like to start on the Ferris

17

doctrine, because it seems to me that is the fundamental

18

issue in this case.

19

And the principle of Ferris -- and it's

20

interesting to me that counsel for the government never

21

once makes any reference to the Comptroller General's

22

interpretation of the Ferris doctrine, which in the

23

Redbook says, as plain as day, that in circumstances

24

like this one, where the government has more contractors

25

than it had -- than one, and those contractors are
29

Alderson Reporting Company

1

subject to an appropriation, and it cannot exceed that

2

appropriation -- I think all of that language, frankly,

3

is implied anyway -- the contract --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you think now -- you

5

say you don't want us to mention "not to exceed" in our

6

opinion --

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Oh, no.

This --

-- other than to say that

it's irrelevant?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

"Not to exceed" has a

11

very significant role to play, Justice Kennedy,

12

because --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does the Redbook talk

14

about "not to exceed" as being any different from

15

general appropriations?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

The place where "not to

17

exceed," I think, carries particular significance is

18

that in the ordinary situation, we would be entitled to

19

seek injunctive relief to take money from other sources

20

within -- within the budget and get an injunction.

21

that's very unique to the -- to this context.

22

Ordinarily, government contractors cannot seek

23

injunctive relief.

This "not to exceed" language --

Well, here, 6-45 says, "if a

contract is but one activity under a larger

appropriation, it is not reasonable to expect the

13

contractor to know how much of that

14

appropriation remains available."

Now, I would like you right now to tell me,

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it says, if Congress

22

23

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry?

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

They're trying to use that

3

to distinguish Sutton from Ferris, and it's filled with,

4

well, we're not sure about this because Sutton, which is

5

Brandeis, which comes out the opposite way, did have a

6

line appropriation.

7

the fact that because there's a line appropriation, the

8

contractor's on notice.

And when you do business with the government

Well, again, the only notice

20

it gives is that there has to be enough money when you

21

look at the appropriation to cover your contract.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ferris did not say, as I

23

recall, that you can't expect the contractor to have

24

notice that appropriations have been limited.

25

you can't expect them to have notice as to how much of

the expenditures under that appropriated act have been

Isn't that the only thing it required notice of?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's --

I would think, if you sign

5

a contract, you better be sure that there are

6

appropriations for it.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Clearly.

And that -- I mean,

8

and, Justice Breyer, the Court's opinion in Cherokee

9

said that the primary purpose of the subject to

10

availability clause is to deal with the situation where

11

you enter into the agreement ahead of the fiscal year,

12

and so everybody knows that if Congress, for whatever

13

reason, decides not to appropriate any money, there's no

14

deal, and nothing happens.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, in your view, if the

16

tribe comes to the government, and they say, look, we've

17

been looking at what you've done with the other tribes,

18

you've appropriated $95 million, and the appropriation

19

says "not to exceed $95 million," but go ahead and make

20

this contract with us anyway, no one cares.

say, go ahead and make it.

I don't think it gets the government anywhere

And then the question is, what do you do

18

with the "not to exceed" language.

And what I would suggest

19

there is that, that's no different, frankly, from Ferris

20

or any other situation, because what the -- Congress

21

operates against the backdrop of Ferris, which is a

22

120-plus-year-old doctrine that has been allowed to stay

23

in place by Congress for that entire time.

25

contractor takes as an article of faith in dealing with

And as the

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, am I correct that

3

what the government is arguing is that the fact that

4

this limitation was included in the particular contract

5

makes it different from Ferris?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it's hard to make that

7

argument because the -- the "not to exceed" language, at

8

least, that comes out of the -- that's in the

appropriations provision.

12
13
14

That's not in the contract

The contract itself simply says "subject to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which Ferris did not.

Did

the Ferris contract say that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

It's -- Ferris doesn't have

15

the "subject to appropriation," but the Ferris contract

16

says the appropriation limit is X.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does?

Where do you

18

get -- I couldn't find the contract.

19

Ferris is, "a contractor who is one of several persons

20

to be paid out of an appropriation is not chargeable

21

with knowledge of its administration."

22

The language in

True.

Now, Dyk says, in his opinion, that one

23

difference from Ferris is they wrote the idea into the

24

contract, saying you're subject to appropriation to

25

get to make that lawyer chargeable with knowledge.
40

Alderson Reporting Company

1

And the second thing in Ferris is that it

2

was an individual who went off on his own in the

3

administration and paid money that he shouldn't have

4

paid.

5

It should have been over here for the contract.
In this case, it is an instance where

6

Congress itself required the money to be paid, as it was

7

paid, and didn't provide enough.

8
9

Okay.

So that's where I am with Ferris, which is a
big question mark.

And I guess you could talk about

10

that, but all I wanted to know is what is well

11

established in this field.

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -I don't want to write

something that suddenly upsets what is well established.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay.

Well, I take this,

then, straight from the Redbook again.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Phillips, this is an

unusual situation with the tribes, because in the normal

to the contrary, are forced to accept these contracts.

And on the other hand,

give you.

proposition whether the tribes, when they entered into

So the reality

recognize, because of Ferris, and because of the way the

2

Comptroller General has interpreted Ferris, that they

3

are under a duty to make sure that there is an

4

appropriation that covers this contract, that the

5

amount, purpose, time requirements are all satisfied

6

with enough money to accomplish that.

7

And then, of course, we have the obligation

8

to perform, which, of course, that's the other half of

the equation here.

that way and has it all done, then they can just

18

incorporate it into the statute anyway.

20

There are broader ways to do it.

Mr. Phillips, do you

want.

12

exactly what the government says it wanted.

13

answer might be something different, that actually,

14

Congress wanted there to be unlimited funds for these

15

tribes, but that it wanted to shift the costs of some of

16

those funds to the Judgment Fund outside of the Interior

17

budget.

And what -- one answer might be Congress wanted

But another

Right.
Do you -- I mean, do you

20

contest the government's view of what Congress wanted

21

here?

22

And if so, how?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the question is

23

it's unclear what Congress really wanted in this case,

24

and therefore, you ought to construe the -- the scheme

25

in a way that is most favorable to the tribes.
57

Alderson Reporting Company

And if

that means that the scheme operates so as to protect the

2

integrity of the appropriations process and the spending

process for a particular year, and prevents us from

4

being able to seek relief outside of this contract

support cost appropriation limitation, that makes

6

perfect sense to me, leaving open obviously the

7

availability of the Judgment Fund at the end of the day

so that the tribes do not in fact have to bear the full

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK R. FREEMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23

MR. FREEMAN:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Do you dispute

Mr. Phillips' statement that the tribes don't know how

much they're getting until some point further into the

2

performance cycle?

3

MR. FREEMAN:

In part, Your Honor.

Let me

4

explain.

As I mentioned earlier, for the first many

5

years in this scheme, we did a uniform pro rata

6

distribution methodology.

7

said, look, that's a problem for us because we don't

8

have any budget transparency; we can't see how much

9

we're going to get.

The tribes came to us and

So we adopted this policy in 2006.

10

And one of the principal elements of that policy is that

11

it guarantees that, if -- as long as Congress

12

appropriates as much money as it did in the previous

13

fiscal year, which it generally has, the tribe will get

14

immediately, like within 2 weeks, the exact amount of

15

money that it received in the previous year.

16

money comes immediately.

Now, the question then becomes what to do

21

with any additional money that Congress has

22

appropriated, and the policy provides for distribution

23

of that money on what we call a bottoms-up basis.

give it to the tribes that are the farthest away from

100 percent of funding.

It's, we think -- and I might be wrong

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There

I guess what I don't

7

understand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman,

8

is exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes

9

become.

I mean, as I -- this is supposed to be a

10

contract, and we've held that it's a contract, and

11

usually contracting parties have rights to something.

12

MR. FREEMAN:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14
15

18

Yes.
So what do they have a right

to, in your view?
MR. FREEMAN:

Well, first of all, let's make

clear -- let's make sure that we're not -JUSTICE KAGAN:

That was -- that was a

straightforward question.

MR. FREEMAN:

Well, they have a right, Your

21

Honor, in the first instance to the principal promise

22

that's under any ISDA contract, which is we give the

23

amount of money that the Secretary would have provided

24

for the program funds, for operational --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, but what do they have a

right to with respect to these additional overhead

costs?

MR. FREEMAN:

Contract support costs.

They

5

dollar that Congress appropriates, and for every

6

contractor --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What does each individual

tribe have a right to?

A proportionate share based on

the Secretary's policy for the distribution of these in

light of the caps.

Secretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have

17

been doing a better job, so we'll give it to them; or

18

these tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them.

19

You think that there's a contractual right to a pro rata

share.
