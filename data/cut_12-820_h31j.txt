 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 12820, Lozano v. Alvarez. 

5

Mr. Regan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAWN P. REGAN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. REGAN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

10

 I represent Manuel Jose Lozano, a father who 

11

loves his daughter.  Respondent kidnapped that daughter 

12

and concealed her from Mr. Lozano, first in the United 

13

Kingdom, for nearly eight months; then in France, then 

14

in the United States. 

15

 In Abbott, this Court recognized child 

16

abduction to be one of the worst forms of child abuse 

17

and that the Convention, therefore, aims to deter and 

18

prevent child abduction from occurring in the first 

19

instance.  Equitable tolling furthers that aim.  By 

20

contrast, the rule adopted by the Second Circuit 

21

provides a playbook for thwarting the Convention 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr.  Mr. Regan, you 

23

you want us to apply equitable tolling in a field, 

24

family law, where the interest of the child is always of 

25

paramount importance and running all through family law

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is  is that concern.  And changed circumstances figure 

2

very large. 

3

 So decrees that might be final in another 

4

area of law are not because, if circumstances change, 

5

then the child custody may change.  So it seems to me 

6

that this area is hugely unfit for equitable tolling 

7

that would leave out consideration of the child's best 

8

interests. 

9

 MR. REGAN: 

Justice Ginsburg, we believe 

10

that equitable tolling does provide, within the context 

11

of the Convention, consideration  the opportunity for 

12

courts to consider the interests of the child.  And 

13

that's most poignantly illustrated by some of the cases 

14

in which it has been applied. 

15

 If I may provide an example, an example in 

16

Respondent's brief, Mendez Lynch v. Mendez Lynch, on 

17

page 31 of their brief, it's a case in which the Court 

18

found equitable tolling is available, and it found 

19

equitable tolling applied factually.  The Court, 

20

however, considered the facts and circumstances of the 

21

child's life, including those facts and circumstances 

22

that relate to the extent to which the child is settled. 

23

 But it considered those facts and 

24

circumstances within the rubric of the Article 13 

25

analysis, and that is consistent with what other courts

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have done in what I would  what I would term more 

2

natural Article 12 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is that equitable 

4

discretion, or is that still equitable tolling? 

5

Because, as I understand equitable tolling, if it 

6

applies and, say, there's a 6month suspension, the 

7

child must go back, so that there's  so that the 

8

that the weighing that you're talking about just 

9

doesn't  doesn't come into play. 

10

 MR. REGAN: 

Thank you, Justice Kennedy.  And 

11

I think this is important because I think this  this 

12

illustrates how foreign courts have miscomprehended 

13

equitable tolling, how it would operate  how it 

14

operates within the context of the convention. 

15

 Equitable tolling would prevent the 

16

abducting parent from taking advantage of the Article 

17

12.2 exception, that  that the child should not be 

18

returned because the child is now  because the parent 

19

has met that minimal routine showing of the child is now 

20

settled.  He's going to school, he or she is  has some 

21

friends, so on and so forth, that they are living a 

22

normal life here. 

23

 What it does not prevent  and Mendez 

24

illustrates this, as do other cases  it does not 

25

prevent the Court from looking at the Article 13

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

considerations.  So, for example, as in Mendez and other 

2

cases, the Court will still consider if the child  if 

3

the child is of sufficient age and maturity to testify, 

4

such that, if this Court should take into account his or 

5

her views or objections to return, the Court can do so. 

6
7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 
we can look at it? 

8

 MR. REGAN: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg? 
Where is it in the 

materials? 

11

 MR. REGAN: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

Where is Article 13, so 

Mendez v. Lynch? 
Article 13, which you're 

referring to. 

14

 MR. REGAN: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. REGAN: 

Oh, Article 13. 
I'd like to read it. 
I'm sorry.  Article 13 is  it 

17

is at  I'm sorry.  It's at 135a of the Petition 

18

Appendix.  Excuse me.  Article 13 is at 136a.  Excuse 

19

me.  135a is 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And  and it does 

21

provide  just while people are looking at it, it does 

22

provide that, even though there's, in your view, 

23

equitable tolling, there are still circumstances in 

24

which the child would not go back, if there's a grave 

25

grave risk?

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. REGAN: 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

3
4
5
6

Grave risk of harm. 
Grave risk of harm to the 

child. 
 MR. REGAN: 

Or if the court finds that it 

would be an intolerable situation. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But, again, as Justice 

7

Ginsburg questions, it seems to me indicates, there are 

8

two different axes here.  One is the best interest of 

9

the child, and the other is an adequate deterrent so 

10

that parents don't abduct.  But those axes don't cross 

11

very often, if at all. 

12

 MR. REGAN: 

I respect, Justice Kennedy, it's 

13

difficult to balance them.  They're somewhat 

14

incommensurate or  you know, competing considerations 

15

or  but both very important.  We think that equitable 

16

tolling properly balances them within the structure of 

17

the Convention because equitable tolling, again, it 

18

it prevents this Article 12.2 exception, but it doesn't 

19

prevent the Article 13 exception. 

20

 In fact, in many ways, what we're talking 

21

about is not inconsistent with what the English court 

22

does or did in Cannon.  In Cannon, the court said if 

23

where there is concealment and subterfuge, there will be 

24

a heightened burden for establishing settlement. 

25

 Now, in this 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that still  but 

2

Article 13 still is different from what's in the best 

3

interest of the child. 

4

 MR. REGAN: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I think 
Now, it's true that all 

6

we're talking about is for the  during the time in 

7

which the hearing takes place, but these hearings take 

8

years, and expert witnesses are not available or readily 

9

available. 

10

 MR. REGAN: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, to your 

11

point about timing and essentially provisional return, I 

12

do think  you know, courts  district courts have 

13

shown great adeptness at dealing with those issues. 

14

They've entered conditional orders that require the 

15

child be returned at a time when the proceeding  when 

16

the testimony is necessary. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Excuse me.  Let me give you 

18

this example.  Suppose a child is abducted at  at age 

19

one and is concealed for 10 years, and then the location 

20

of the child is discovered.  The other parent files a 

21

petition.  So that, if there's equitable tolling, the 

22

petition was filed within one year. 

23

 But during those 10 years, the child has 

24

become very well settled in the new country, has learned 

25

the language of that country, the customs developed,

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

gone to school, developed relationships, and so forth. 

2

 Under  if there is no equitable tolling, 

3

but the abduction can be taken into account under the 

4

doctrine of equitable discretion, that's  that's one 

5

thing.  But the way you read this, the way you read the 

6

Convention, the equitable tolling would mean that the 

7

petition was filed within a year, and unless one of the 

8

conditions in Article 13 was met, for example, a grave 

9

risk that the child's return would expose the child to 

10

physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the 

11

child in an intolerable situation, then there would 

12

be  then the child would have to be removed. 

13

 So there is that major difference, isn't 

14
15

there, between those two positions? 
 MR. REGAN: 

There is a significant 

16

difference.  And we think that that significant 

17

difference is warranted and necessary in order to 

18

achieve the effect of deterrence because the Second 

19

Circuit's rule essentially says to abducting parents, if 

20

you abduct your child and you conceal your child for 12 

21

months, you will be rewarded. 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's true.  The 

23

position of the Respondent and the government would give 

24

a great incentive for parents to abduct children and 

25

hide them for a period of time.  But on the other side,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as my example, I think, illustrates, your rule would 

2

mean that a child who is very well settled in a 

3

particular location would have to be returned to the 

4

other country for purposes of the custody determination. 

5
6
7

 So why do you think the Convention should be 
read one way, rather than the other? 
 MR. REGAN: 

Justice Alito, I hope to make 

8

abundantly clear that our position, equitable tolling, 

9

would not mandate that that child be returned.  All it 

10

does  but it's significant 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12

 MR. REGAN: 

Well, how would it not? 
It  it changes the question 

13

that the court asks.  Absent equitable tolling, the 

14

courts  the question on which  the question before 

15

the court is, is this child settled?  And the factors 

16

the courts looked at  the courts have looked at it, 

17

and it really  they're  you know, "settlement" is 

18

not defined in the Convention, and Congress has left it 

19

to courts to decide. 

20

 And courts look at 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, which of the 

22

articles  which of the provisions in Article 13 

23

would  would prevent the return in the hypothetical 

24

that Justice Alito just gave you? 

25

 MR. REGAN: 

Courts have looked at  and

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

I'll say it  in the decades 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, what  what does 

3

Article 13 allow the court to consider?  It says, "It's 

4

not bound to order the return if the person, 

5

institution, or other body having care of the person of 

6

the child was not actually exercising the custody rights 

7

at the time of removal or retention." 

8

 Well, you know 

9

 MR. REGAN: 

10

That's known as acquiescence. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That wouldn't have  or 

11

had consent to or  that wouldn't apply in his 

12

hypothetical or in this case. 

13

 MR. REGAN: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's really B. 
B, "There is grave risk 

15

that his or her return would expose the child to 

16

physical or psychological harm."  I mean, we have no 

17

reason to believe that  that your client would 

18

would harm the child or  or that the parent in Justice 

19

Alito's hypothetical would harm the child, "or otherwise 

20

place the child in an intolerable situation." 

21

 I don't see how any of those things would 

22

would come to the assistance of the child in  in 

23

Justice Alito's hypothetical. 

24
25

 MR. REGAN: 

If I may explain by way of 

illustration, in some of the cases, what courts have

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

looked at.  And let me give  Blondin is another 

2

example cited in our brief, cited by the Solicitor 

3

General, a Second Circuit  the wellknown Second 

4

Circuit case.  That's a natural Article 12.1 case. 

5

Petition is filed before the period of one year expires. 

6

 The Second Circuit looked at  or Judge 

7

Chin  thenJudge Chin in the district court, looked at 

8

the child's facts and circumstances related to 

9

settlement as part of that grave risk analysis.  There 

10

was expert testimony, as there often is in these cases, 

11

that the child was suffering from potential  from 

12

posttraumatic stress disorder. 

13

 Experts testified that return of the 

14

child  the child should not be returned because it 

15

presented a grave risk of harm to the child. 

16
17
18
19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Physical or psychological 

harm. 
 MR. REGAN: 

That's correct.  And there are 

cases, Mendez v. Lynch and others. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It might be now and then, 

21

but in the routine case that Justice Alito just gave 

22

you, I don't see how there's any  any reason at all 

23

not to yank the child back from wherever he's been for 10 

24

years. 

25

 MR. REGAN: 

If I may answer in two ways, in

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the example Justice Alito gave.  With a 10yearold 

2

child, it's  it's very likely that the court would 

3

hear from that child.  I think the more difficult 

4

example is  let's make that child 7 or 8.  But 

5

and  and there's no evidence these cases have 

6

occurred. 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Which court?  Which court? 

To use the 
 MR. REGAN: 

United States court. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but Article 13 does 

11

not say the child  the child can state  well, let's 

12

see.  "The child objects to being returned."  I guess 

13

you could limit to that.  "May also refuse to order the 

14

return of the child if it finds that the child objects 

15

to being returned." 

16
17
18
19
20

 MR. REGAN: 

That's been universally adopted 

by the courts hearing testimony. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So that's the one 

exception, yes. 
 MR. REGAN: 

But  but the grave risk 

21

exception, and courts have applied this, it really  it 

22

really just  it  it changes the question, like in 

23

Cannon. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in a sense, what 

you're saying is that it's not an automatic  it's not

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an automatic rule.  The more you argue that Section 13 

2

is applicable, the more you're watering down the very 

3

rigid rule that you want, in order to say that there has 

4

to be deterrence. 

5

 MR. REGAN: 

I understand that point. 

6

However, there is a difference.  And so what we're 

7

trying to balance here, and I think  it's not we. 

8

What the Convention balances  what courts applying the 

9

Convention have found is the proper balance, is not for 

10

courts to say, well, let's try and figure out what the 

11

best interests are. 

12

 In fact, the Convention couldn't be clearer, 

13

and Congress couldn't have been clearer that that is not 

14

where it  that's where it least wanted courts wading 

15

into those waters. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The Convention says, in the 

17

preamble, that the parties  that's countries  are 

18

firmly convinced that the interests of the children are 

19

of paramount importance in matters relating to their 

20

custody.  Okay?  Paramount importance.  So the provision 

21

you're talking about, Article 13, says, well, would 

22

returning the child lead to physical harm, psychological 

23

harm, or otherwise put the child in an intolerable 

24

position.  So they mean intolerable. 

25

 So I think this would be a pretty typical

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case.  The husband says he was fine.  The wife says, no, 

2

he kicked me in the stomach and did a lot of other 

3

things.  The judge hearing the two sides says I can't 

4

say the husband's right. 

5

 MR. REGAN: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
So we don't know.  Now, 

7

your idea is to send the child back to the husband 

8

unless the child gets up there and chooses between 

9

parents.  That's pretty tough on 8 or 9 or 10yearold 

10

children and  very tough.  And you're going to keep 

11

the  you're going to send it back to the father in 

12

this situation, unless the mother can prove it's 

13

intolerable, either because of physical  I mean, my 

14

goodness, a physical or psychological, you have all the doctors 

15

saying he should stay in New York.  A typical problem 

16

for a family court judge, really tough. 

17

 So you have the Convention, which says in 

18

the preamble, look to the interests of the child.  You 

19

have every other country saying, that's what it really 

20

means; in other words, they're against you.  You have 

21

the Department of State, in charge of the treaty, saying 

22

that's what it really means and otherwise against you. 

23

And so what do you have going for you?  That isn't your 

24

fault that there isn't too much going for you, but 

25

nonetheless, I'd like to know what it is.

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. REGAN: 

I think we have a lot going for 

2

us.  You've asked  I think you've hit, Justice Breyer, 

3

on just about every issue that I could possibly want to 

4

address today.  But  and  and let me say, I  I 

5

respect the position of the 8 or 9yearold child, the 

6

difficulty.  I was that child before a judge on the 

7

giving that sort of testimony, so I certainly appreciate 

8

it. 

9

 But on this  this question of best 

10

interests, the Convention makes the decided choice if 

11

courts  the Convention defines how courts are to 

12

determine that best interest.  It doesn't say courts 

13

should determine what is in the best interest of the 

14

child.  It says look at whether the child is settled 

15

under Article 12 or, if that's not applicable, you may 

16

look at Article 13.  Other than that, the presumption is 

17

the best interest of the child is for return. 

18

 You mention that the State Department is 

19

against us, which I'm happy to take the opportunity to 

20

address here.  We don't believe that the State 

21

Department's views should be accorded great weight in 

22

this situation.  Their brief does not speak to the 

23

diplomatic consequences of equitable tolling.  It 

24

doesn't speak to  it doesn't speak to the idea that 

25

equitable tolling will somehow impair our ability to

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

recover children abducted from the United States. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, Mr. Regan, aside 

3

from the position of the United States, which  which 

4

has changed, you made that point, the determination 

5

that's being made at this stage is really one of venue. 

6

It's where the main bout will be fought out.  And so we 

7

don't want that to linger for a long time.  We want that 

8

decision to be made with dispatch. 

9

 And as one of the amici brief informs us, 

10

many of these what you call kidnappers happen to be 

11

badly abused women and if you  if they had to go under 

12

Article 13, then they would have this fullblown, was he 

13

really the abuser?  Doing it without equitable tolling, 

14

that question is reserved for the main  for the main 

15

bout. 

16

 I suppose if we had a case where the judge 

17

isn't certain was the father abuser or not, that judge 

18

would feel an obligation to stretch out this venue 

19

determination, to see if it's an Article 13 situation. 

20

 MR. REGAN: 

I think, Justice Ginsburg, the 

21

domestic violence situation, which I am entirely 

22

sensitive to and appreciate, illustrates the difficulty 

23

of these cases and  and that courts can't really 

24

figure out what's  who's right or who did what in 

25

these circumstances.  Most of  usually all of the

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

evidence is overseas on that issue. 
 What the Convention  the approach the 

3

Convention decides on taking is that, first, there is no 

4

selfhelp remedy certainly for concealment, that  that 

5

nothing excuses concealment of the child.  And, in fact, 

6

to the extent you said there's a goal and a value of 

7

shortening these proceedings, to the extent equitable 

8

tolling disincentivizes concealment, it does that. 

9

 I mean, the opposite rule says, if you 

10

conceal, i.e., you extend that period of time during 

11

which there's no relationship, you'll be rewarded. 

12

 It's an enormous incentive. 

And our point 

13

is there is the proper safety valve.  The standard under 

14

Article 12.2 is so pedestrian, it is essentially have 

15

you failed to be  aside from abducting your child, 

16

since then, have you failed to be a normal parent?  Is 

17

your child in school?  Does he or she go to ballet 

18

class?  Do you take him or her to church?  Do they have 

19

friends?  All those things were satisfied here.  Can you 

20

be employed?  What's your legal  what's your 

21

immigration status? 

22

 Now, this case illustrates just how simple 

23

and routine that is to achieve.  And here, she didn't 

24

have a job.  She's not here legally.  I guess the 

25

court found that she had the depth and quantity of

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

friendships that your typical prekindergartner has, and 

2

that was enough for her to defeat return. 

3

 The Convention properly balances these 

4

things by saying where it presents  and courts have 

5

done this.  The district courts are doing this.  No one 

6

says  you know, the State, the Solicitor General and 

7

our Respondent  points to a single case where they 

8

say, here's equitable tolling and boy  you know, the 

9

court got it wrong. 

10

 Here was the wrong outcome because they 

11

applied equitable tolling as they have been doing for 

12

nearly two decades.  Courts can do this.  But the 

13

question, as it is in Cannon, can't be as simple as 

14

well, are you  are you doing fine here in the United 

15

States. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Regan, Justice Breyer 

17

pointed out that all other countries seem to disagree 

18

with you.  That's obviously a concern of ours when we 

19

interpret a treaty, that all other countries interpret 

20

it in a  in a single way.  Do you contest that?  Are 

21

there any other countries that apply equitable tolling 

22

rules? 

23

 MR. REGAN: 

We believe that it's neither 

24

surprising nor momentous that foreign courts have failed 

25

to adopt equitable tolling.  It's not surprising because

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they lacked the presumption that we do.  It's not 

2

significant for two reasons.  One, we think  as I've 

3

alluded to, I think they miscomprehend equitable 

4

tolling.  The Cannon court calls it "too crude," that it 

5

won't allow for an accounting of the child's interest. 

6

And as  as the courts in the United States have been 

7

clear, it does. 

8

 It provides 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But they may be wrong.  Who 

10

cares if they're wrong?  The point is a treaty should be 

11

interpreted uniformly by all the parties to it.  And 

12

you're telling me, well, all the rest of them interpret 

13

it another way, but they're wrong  you know, everybody 

14

is out of step, but me.  That's  that's just not 

15

right. 

16

 MR. REGAN: 

Not at all, Justice Scalia.  And 

17

it was actually  your question relates to my third 

18

point. 

19

 What those decisions reflect is that the 

20

Convention leaves room within Article 12 for the 

21

operation of domestic law.  Article 12 speaks to 

22

commencement of proceedings.  You must commence 

23

proceedings within one year.  It speaks to settlement. 

24

The Convention  it is Congress in ICARA that defines 

25

how one commences proceedings.  It says you must file in

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a court that has jurisdiction.  That's Section 11603(b) 

2

and (f)(3), which are at 117 through 121a of the 

3

Petition Appendix. 

4

 Congress decides that's how you  how you 

5

stop that period, by filing in a court having 

6

jurisdiction.  Other countries provide nation  courts 

7

of nationwide jurisdiction.  Some countries provide that 

8

the central authority itself will file the petition for 

9

the applicant or will file in its own interest on behalf 

10
11

of the child. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

None of that is covered by 

12

the treaty.  Yes, each State may apply its own law with 

13

respect to matters not covered by the treaty, but I do 

14

not read that to say  to mean that each State may apply its 

15

own law in interpreting the provisions of the treaty and 

16

so can create exceptions on the basis of equitable 

17

discretion when the treaty has none or because its 

18

courts use that in another  in other contexts or 

19

create an exception on the basis of equitable tolling. 

20

 This is a matter of interpreting the treaty, 

21

not of bringing into effect some other principle of 

22

of State law that overrides the treaty.  That's how I 

23

read that provision. 

24

 MR. REGAN: 

25

Our position is that, if you 

look at the drafting history here, the drafting history

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was preliminary draft Article 11 provided for two 

2

periods, automatic return, if you will, return subject 

3

to the Article 13 and 20 defenses, if you filed within 6 

4

months; or for a period  a discovery rule capped at 

5

one year, if you didn't know the whereabouts of the 

6

child. 

7

 Some countries said those periods are too 

8

short.  Some said they're too long.  Some said we don't 

9

want to have to deal with this discovery rule issue, we're 

10

concerned about the evidentiary burdens.  What's 

11

important is what the drafters did. 

12

 They extended that first period to a year, 

13

and then, with respect to this discovery rule concept, 

14

they said, we're going to give you Article 18, it 

15

provides for return at any time; we're going to provide 

16

Article 34, which the explanatory report highlights, is 

17

meant to provide for invocation of domestic law or 

18

rules, particularly where 12.2 is implicated.  And it 

19

left for countries to define the  to define key 

20

elements of Article 12.2. 

21

 In doing 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  That's 

23

turning legislative history, in my mind, on its head. 

24

 They considered directly, if you study the 

25

SG's brief, a discovery rule that would have codified

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

equitable tolling.  And there was lengthy discussion 

2

about it and a decision that they wouldn't do that, 

3

that, instead, they would expand the period to a year 

4

where automatic return was required, and they introduced 

5

the best interest of the child after that year, and that 

6

that was now a balancing of all interests, the parents' 

7

and the child's. 

8

 And you're right, they had other provisions 

9

that would affect the possible return or lack thereof, 

10

and they never wanted to stop a court from returning a 

11

child if it in its equitable discretion decided it was 

12

appropriate.  But you're turning that legislative 

13

history on its head a little bit. 

14

 MR. REGAN: 

Justice Sotomayor, we believe 

15

that the State Department's reading of that history 

16

of that drafting history, is oversimplified because 

17

there were objections to that period, to that  to that 

18

discovery rule that weren't simply to a discovery rule 

19

as a general matter.  It was that some countries said, 

20

we don't want to have to deal with that.  Other 

21

countries said, it needs to be longer. 

22

 And so the choice that was made was a choice 

23

to give countries flexibility to determine how they want 

24

to calculate that period, when it should be set, and 

25

potentially to employ equitable tolling.  The

10

Thank you, counsel. 

I'd like to reserve my time.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

 MS. MOSKOWITZ:

it please the court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

13

 To reverse the Second Circuit's holding and 

14

to apply equitable tolling to Article 12 would be 

15

squarely at odds with the Convention's text, purpose, 

16

and drafting history, as well as contrary to the 

17

postratification understanding and interpretation of 

18

every other signatory state to consider the issue. 

19

 Your Honors, we ended on a note of drafting 

20

history, and to return to Justice Sotomayor's question 

21

about turning that a bit on its head, I agree.  The 

22

drafting history specifically shows that the countries 

23

considered two periods, one of prompt return, return 

24

forthwith within 6 months of the removal; and 6 months 

25

from the discovery of the whereabouts of the child, if

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the child were not known. 
 And what the drafters thought  some 

3

thought the period needed to be longer, but there were 

4

countries that wanted it to be shorter.  There were 

5

countries that were very concerned that the child would 

6

become settled in the new environment, such that 

7

uprooting that child again, just for purposes of having 

8

a custody determination in the  in the former country 

9

of habitual residence would be contrary to that child's 

10
11

interest. 
 So they struck a balance. 

They  they 

12

negotiated over  over several drafts and finally 

13

arrived at a single period of one year, but that wasn't 

14

going to be a cutoff.  Instead of having a statute of 

15

limitation  statute of reposed construct, they said 

16

the obligation is going to continue, and it's going to 

17

continue until the child turns 16, unless it is 

18

demonstrated that the child is now settled in her  in 

19

its new environment. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But what  what troubles me 

21

about your position is that it undermines the best 

22

interests of children in a very powerful way, insofar as 

23

it does not deter and, indeed, encourages  provides a 

24

great incentive for parents to abduct their children. 

25

And that was the central purpose of the Convention, to

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prevent harm to children and also to parents, but 

2

centrally to children who are abducted. 

3

 And if you have a rule that says if you can 

4

abduct the child and you can hide for a year, which 

5

isn't very difficult, then all you have to do is provide 

6

some evidence of settlement, and you are going to  you 

7

are going to win, you are going to deter return. 

8

 Am I wrong to be concerned about that? 

9

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, your concern is 

10

not wrong, but I think it's not founded on what  what 

11

will happen here.  I don't think it encourages abduction 

12

and concealment because that  those facts of 

13

concealment are going to be taken into account into 

14

whether the child, in fact, is settled. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, all right.  Perhaps 

16

that's the solution to the problem then.  I wonder if 

17

you would accept that, that there is no equitable 

18

tolling, let's assume for the sake of argument, but 

19

abduction is a strong factor that weighs against the 

20

return, that weighs against the failure to return the 

21

child, not just something that can be disposed of in a 

22

sentence, which is basically what the district court did 

23

here, but a very strong factor that has to be taken into 

24

account in the exercise of equitable discretion. 

25

 Would you disagree with that?

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

A bit, Your Honor, and 


2


it's  the abduction itself is the  what triggers the 

3

Convention to begin with.  Every single case that is 


4


heard under the Convention involves a wrongful removal 


5


or retention.  There will be illegal abduction every 


6

time.  And the drafters in fact absolutely were trying 


7

to address that harm to children. 


8
9
10
11

 And they  the paramount interest of the 

children were designing this Convention, and they did 

state that there were two 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think they had it in 

12

mind, not just the interest of children, but the 

13

interest of parents.  It's simply not true that, in all 

14

cases involving children, the paramount interest of the 

15

child governs.  That's not the case, or else, we would 

16

remove many children from their parents in this country. 

17

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Absolutely, Your Honor. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Parents have rights. 

19

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21
22

Absolutely. 
And that is one of the 

things that this treaty considers. 
 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, it does not 

23

consider, ultimately, the custody determination and with 

24

which parent the child should live.  That is expressly 

25

not part of the Convention, and that is what 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the 

2

whether or not the child is settled in a particular case 

3

is certainly going to be a significant consideration in 

4

the custody determination, isn't it? 

5

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Yes, Your Honor, I would 

6

presume so.  But as well as any wrongful acts of either 

7

or both parents would be taken into account in a 

8

fullblown merits best interest of the child custody 

9

determination.  What the Convention is trying to address 

10

in the instances of where a child is now settled in a 

11

new environment after having been at least one year in 

12

the new environment is, should the child be uprooted in 

13

anticipation of that fullblown hearing. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What's the fairness 
The problem is 

16

you're each  you're each using the child as the tool 

17

in the objective that you have in representing the 

18

parents.  On the one side is the allegation of 

19

inequitable conduct in concealment.  On the other side 

20

is the interest in settlement.  That's a dispute between the 

21

two parents, and the child is being used as  as  I 

22

don't know what  you know, a tool in implementing 

23

those conflicting considerations. 

24

 And to the extent that the Convention was 

25

designed to deter that kind of kidnapping, it adopted

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a  a fairly strict rule.  And you're each trying to 

2

say, oh, the rule doesn't mean what it means because, 

3

don't worry, we'll take those considerations into 

4

account in addressing custody; and on the other side, 

5

well, don't worry because there's not that much 

6

difference between 12 and 13. 

7

 So how are we supposed to decide between 

8

those two conflicting considerations of the parents 

9

while maintaining the paramount concern, certainly not 

10

the exclusive one, but the significant one, in the 

11

interest of the child. 

12

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And just 

13

to address the one point that the Petitioner raised of the, 

14

don't worry about Article 12 because there's Article 13, 

15

those are completely different constructs.  In fact, 

16

Congress recognized that, when it set a different burden 

17

of proof for defenses under Article 13, as opposed to 

18

the well settled  settled analysis under Article 12. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But that cuts 

20

against you in some respects.  You say there is such a 

21

big difference, and therefore, it is very important that 

22

the kidnapping parent do the best he or she can to 

23

conceal the child's presence, so they get beyond 13 and 

24

into 12. 

25

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

No, Your Honor, because if

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the parent is concealing the child  for example, if 

2

the parent is moving from place to place to evade 

3

detection or changing the child's name or not enrolling 

4

the child in school to avoid detection 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

My gosh, all it takes is 

6

moving to Peoria.  I mean, I don't mean to denigrate 

7

Peoria, but all it takes is moving to a place that has 

8

no connection to

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Justice Sotomayor is from 

New York. 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, obviously. 

Obviously. 
Those are us from 

15

the Midwest think it's actually easier to hide a child 

16

in New York. 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
I do have a point  a 

20

question though.  What sense does this make when  that 

21

a child who  a suit is filed within the year, but the 

22

litigation takes two or the child who  the filing is a 

23

day after the year, and the litigation takes a year and 

24

they're both in the same situation.  Why should those 

25

two children be treated differently?  Why should one

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have the benefit of settled now and the other not have 

2

it? 

3

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Your Honor, I think 
What sense does it make 

5

when, as Justice Alito indicated, part of the central 

6

purposes of the Convention is to avoid the kidnapping of 

7

children? 

8
9

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, absolutely, that 

is one of the objectives of the Convention, and it 

10

exists because that was presumed to be contrary to the 

11

interest of children, and I don't dispute that in the 

12

majority of the cases, that's true. 

13

 But the concept that the drafters had to 

14

grapple with this issue  they wanted to deter child 

15

abductions, absolutely, but they also recognized that, 

16

at some point in time, it wasn't going to be just about 

17

children at large. 

18

 It was going to be about 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why isn't Article 13 

20

enough protection?  It has to do with  and unlike 

21

Justice Scalia, I don't think it's psychological or 

22

physical harm necessarily by the parent, but by the 

23

situation. 

24

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right. 
The return.  You agree

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

with that? 
 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  I do think 

3

it  it should be broader than that.  I think there are 

4

courts that  the Article 13 defense is supposed to be 

5

narrow, just like the Article 12.2 settled exception, 

6

but the settled exception isn't enough  excuse me, 

7

Article 13 isn't enough because the drafters wanted 

8

Article 12, too. 

9

 They wanted to be able to take into account 

10

the situation of the child after this one year.  And why 

11

one year and not one year including the hearing, I think 

12

it was a balance.  The drafters were concerned both that 

13

it was going to be too long and that it was going to be 

14

too short. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Moskowitz, going back to 

16

Justice Alito's question.  Could you tell me how you 

17

think this works?  You said, in response to Justice 

18

Alito, that sometimes concealment can be a factor in 

19

determining whether a child is settled.  And I presume 

20

you mean if somebody conceals the child by moving the 

21

child from place to place, the child would not be 

22

settled. 

23
24
25

 Is it also a factor in determining whether a 
settled child should nonetheless be returned? 
 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, I  I  that's

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the question of whether and to what extent there is 

2

discretion to return a child  a settled child under 

3

Article 12.  And I think 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Or under Article 18. 

5

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, Article 18  my 

6

understanding of Article 18 and the government's 

7

interpretation of Article 18 is that Article 18 was 

8

designed, not as a duty or something arising under the 

9

Convention, but a recognition that the Convention is not 

10

an exclusive statement and not intended to occupy the 

11

space on child abduction and return. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think your answer to 

13

Justice Kagan's question has to be no, or else I don't 

14

understand what we're doing here. 

15

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, I struggle with 

16

this because I think that there is a reading of the 

17

plain language that says no, but it's  there is a 

18

general feeling that there should be some sort of escape 

19

hatch 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, what is the answer? 

21

I'd like a straight answer in your opinion because 

22

Justice Kagan's case, the mother kidnaps the child. 

23

They live in a grain elevator  a nicely refurbished 

24

grain elevator, in Peoria for a year.  And after the 

25

year, a month later.  The father finds both of them,

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

goes to a family judge  a very tough job by the way 

2

and the family judge reads this, and he says, well, I 

3

have to admit the child is settled here now in Iowa. 

4

All right.  It's settled. 

5

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
But send the child back to 

7

London, he's going to be just about as settled.  I mean, 

8

really, it's not that much difference, but I can't say 

9

the child is not settled. 

10

 The father says this is the most unfair 

11

thing I've ever seen.  She hides out for a year.  The 

12

child would be just as well back in London.  Almost as 

13

well.  Who knows?  Maybe better.  But now, what can the 

14

family court do  judge do?  That's the straight 

15

question we've been trying to get your answer to that, 

16

and it isn't an answer to say  you could say, if 

17

that's the answer, I don't know. 

18

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, in  in that 

19

question, there's  there's the question of what can 

20

they do under the Convention and what can they do. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, what can they do?  I 

22

just want to know if the family court judge will say 

23

please settle this, and the two of them won't. 

24

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
And so, now, what can the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

judge do?  Is the father simply out of luck or not? 
 MS. MOSKOWITZ:

No, but prior to that.

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Prior to. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If you could go back to 

10

do you agree with Justice Scalia, that, really, at that 

11

point, there's nothing to do?  Once the determination 

12

has been made that the child is settled, there is no 

13

remaining discretion that the judge has? 

14

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, I think there is 

15

some discretion under Article 12 to return the settled 

16

child, but it cannot be under a set of facts that were 

17

completely within the minds of the drafters when they 

18

chose the oneyear period.

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you say  I don't 

understand what you're saying.  Give us an example.

22

come up with a specific example, but there can't  it

 of concealment are taken 

to  into account, there  there should remain some 
discretion 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Under 13, right?  Is that 

the discretion you're talking about? 
 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

No, Your Honor.  It's the 

14

discretion under Article 12, but it's in the same vein 

15

of there is discretion under Article 13 and 20, as well. 

16

The way that the language is written in Article 13, for 

17

example, states that the State is not bound  I'm on 

18

136a of the Petition Appendix  that the State is not 

19

bound to order the return if it is established. 

20

 So it  it's not saying that the return 

21

must be denied if these defenses are established. 

22

There's slightly different language in Article 12, which 

23

I think is a reflection of the different drafting 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you  you're 

confusing me.  Let's say I'm the judge who has to decide

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this.  The oneyear period has just past, and I have 

2

evidence that this child who is now two years old has 

3

some friends, goes to play with the friends, goes to the 

4

park, has become accustomed to some American customs, 

5

knows the neighborhood. 

6

 So the child is settled to that degree. 

And 

7

you say even if there's been very elaborate  a very 

8

elaborate effort of concealment, no proffered 

9

justification for the abduction, no indication that 

10

there would be any serious harm if the child were sent 

11

back to the U.K., you say that's just too bad.  That's 

12

your answer? 

13

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

No, Your Honor.  I think 

14

some of the factors you pointed out, for example, that 

15

there would be no serious harm if the child were 

16

returned, not necessarily physical harm or intolerable 

17

situation under Article 13, but there  Article 12 

18

settlement does take into account roots.  It's not 

19

routine, it's not 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But can you give me any 

21

authority?  I read that exactly in Article 12, but 

22

you've now given me a different impression.  What 

23

Article 12 says is that, if it's less than a year, the 

24

child is returned forthwith.  If it's more than a year, 

25

the child shall be returned forthwith, unless  unless

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it is demonstrated the child is now settled in its new 

2

environment. 

3

 It doesn't say you don't return it if the 

4

child is now well settled in the environment.  It just 

5

says you don't have to return it forthwith. 

6

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
So I would have thought 

8

that that would have opened room for discretionary 

9

factors, but you have not given me a case that said that 

10

that's so.  You have not given me anybody who said that 

11

what I thought was the natural reading and which you'd 

12

like to be the natural reading, you've not given any 

13

support for the proposition that it is the natural 

14

reading. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And I  I assumed from 

16

your brief that that was not the reading you were giving 

17

it.  And that is not the reading it has to be given, 

18

frankly.  I read it the other way, "shall order the 

19

return unless it is demonstrated that the child is now 

20

settled." 

21

 I assume that to mean in which case you 

22

shall not order the return.  Isn't that the way you've 

23

been reading it? 

24
25

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

No, Your Honor.  We do in 

our 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, it is not.  Okay. 

Well, then, gee, we don't have a lot to argue about here. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, if that's the case, if 

4

you're reading it that way  I mean, I was reading it 

5

Justice Scalia's way, too. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Of course. 
The first clause says, 

8

"shall" and the second clause says, "shall not."  But 

9

there is an alternate reading where the first clause 

10

says, "shall," and the second clause essentially says, 

11

"may or may not at your discretion."  But, boy, that 

12

would open up a big discretionary hole if you read it 

13

that way, wouldn't it? 

14

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

No, Your Honor.  It 

15

shouldn't be read that broadly.  It's certainly  and 

16

the House of Lords in England, in In re:  M, did find 

17

that there was a residual discretion after finding a 

18

child was settled. 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So I should read that case 

20

because the language says, "Unless it is demonstrated 

21

the child is now settled, you return it forthwith, 

22

unless it is demonstrated the child is well settled." 

23

Well, now, it's demonstrated well settled.  Does that 

24

mean I cannot return it?  Or does it mean I don't have 

25

to return it?

39

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Your Honor, I 
And I say  or you say I 

3

read that case in the House of Lords, and I will 

4

discover it means you don't have to return it. 

5
6

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 
Lords interpreted it. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

Article 18, didn't they? 

9

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

10
11

That's the way the House of 

And they relied on 

No, Your Honor.  They found 

the discretion within Article 12. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Ms. Moskowitz, what do you 

12

do about Article 13 in that case, which begins, 

13

"notwithstanding the provisions of" Article  "of the 

14

preceding Article 12, the judicial or administrative 

15

authority requesting is not bound to order the return of 

16

the child if the person"  blah, blah, blah. 

17

 That says to me that, under 12, you are 

18

bound, and you're telling me, well, you're really not 

19

bound under 12.  You have discretion anyway. 

20

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Your Honor 
I, frankly, didn't 

22

understand that that was your argument in this case, and 

23

it  it puts the whole case in a quite different light. 

24
25

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Article 12, you are 

absolutely bound to return the child, unless you meet

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

one of these exceptions within the one year, forthwith 

2

return.  Prompt  prompt return is the idea of the 

3

first clause of Article 12.  Article 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

That's the one year. 
Correct.  And under Article 

6

12.2, that's saying the child  the court shall 

7

shall also order the return after this 1year period, 

8

unless it is demonstrated.  And the question is what 

9

happens if it's demonstrated, and that's do you have to 

10

return still, or can you  or do you have to keep the 

11

child here?  And I think what the  generally, the 

12

courts have found  and it's not unanimous 

13

internationally; it's not. 

14

 Hong Kong says 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In many cases, this would 

16

be an example.  The cost of experts to testify about the 

17

child's adoption or adaption or settlement in New York 

18

would be very substantial.  The experts who had examined 

19

the child, the experts who knew about the school, the 

20

school's officials themselves, would all have to go to 

21

England to testify.  Is that a factor that the courts 

22

consider, or is that not  not relevant? 

23

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

Your Honor, I think those 

24

facts are exactly why the settled exception exists.  It 

25

recognizes that the  the reason to get the child

41

Alderson Reporting Company

immediately back under the 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In other words, 

3

"settlement" is a code word for saying ease of producing 

4

witnesses? 

5

 MS. MOSKOWITZ: 

No, Your Honor, it's not, 

6

but it certainly is a recognition that the  the 

7

justification for return and prompt return is in part to 

8

return to the status quo ante of where child was for 

9

purposes of having a custody determination. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

May I  may I ask you, I 

11

think your brief  I may not be remembering it 

12

correctly, but I think you  you said no equitable 

13

tolling, and everybody in all the other countries agree 

14

on that, but there is equitable discretion.  I think 

15

that you  and the question is, is there this equitable 

16

discretion notion?

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

8

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

9

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Mr. Chief Justice 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Justice Scalia. 
What's the government's 

12

position on  on this question we've just been 

13

discussing, whether Article 12 is absolute or whether 

14

there is discretion even within Article 12, even though 

15

specific elements of discretion are contained in Article 

16

13? 

17

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

It's our position that, 

18

under Article 12, there is discretion to return a 

19

settled child and that that comes from Article 12 

20

itself.  As you pointed out, the language of Article 12 

21

says that, if more than a year has passed, the court 

22

shall order the return of the child, unless the child is 

23

settled in her new environment. 

24

 And that  I mean, I think it's clear that 

25

that could be read in two ways, and the Court has said

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, when the "similar except shall" formulation  and 

2

we cited in our brief the Department of Commerce v. U.S. 

3

House of Representatives case.  The "similar except 

4

shall" language, it's interpreted depending on the 

5

context in which it appears. 

6

 And we think it's very clear from the 

7

Convention that in the context of the Convention and 

8

specifically Article 12, that the better reading is that 

9

a settled child may be returned. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why doesn't the context 

11

include Section 13, which  which lists specific 

12

reasons why you can depart from 12?  I mean, it seems 

13

very strange to say, and in addition to that, there's a 

14

whole pot load of other reasons within  within 12 

15

itself. 

16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, Article  it's true 

17

that Articles 13 and 20 are written in expressly 

18

discretionary language, but those are sort of set out as 

19

exceptions to the rule of Article 12.  Article 12 is 

20

written up differently, but there's nothing in the 

21

Convention that ever says that a child has to stay in 

22

the country where she has been abducted to. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What's  what's the  an 

24

example of where a settled child might be returned?  A 

25

very  two very good parents, and the child is very

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adaptable, and so the child can  is well settled now, 

2

but the child will be well settled in the new 

3

environment at well.  Is that the  is that the 

4

hypothetical? 

5

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

In exercising the discretion 

6

the court should be  it's not just a free 

7

freewheeling discretion that the court is exercising 

8

under Article 12.  We think it's guided by the purposes 

9

stated in the Convention.  So, yes, first, you look at 

10

whether the child is settled, and that could be enough 

11

to defeat the presumption that an abducted child should 

12

be returned. 

13

 You can also look at whether the child could 

14

easily resettle if the child was sent back.  For 

15

example, a 10yearold child who was in school and had a 

16

lot of friends and a routine in London was abducted to 

17

the United States for a year.  That child may not  may 

18

be settled in the United States, but she may not have a 

19

difficult time resettling. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You would expect all the 

21

signatories to this treaty to come up with essentially 

22

the same exceptions, under  under what you say is 

23

is the interpretation of Article 12? 

24

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well 
I mean, it seems to me it

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just makes that article impossible to apply consistently 

2

country to country. 

3

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

No, I don't think so. 

4

And  and, the other signatories have  have almost 

5

all, I mean, I think the Hong Kong court does say that 

6

it doesn't have discretion, but it said, in that case, 

7

nevertheless, it would, even if it had discretion, it 

8

wouldn't order the children returned.  But the other 

9

courts of signatory countries that have interpreted 

10

Article 12 have all found a discretion, whether it be in 

11

Article 12 or in Article 8. 

12

 And if I 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Have they exercised it 

14

have they exercised it, that discretion which they say 

15

is there? 

16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean 
Have they exercised that 

18

discretion not to apply the  the mandatory requirement 

19

of Article 12? 

20

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Yes.  I mean, courts in the 

21

United States have done that.  I think courts in  in 

22

other countries 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm talking about foreign 

courts. 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

 have as well.  Yes.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If I understand the way you 

2

think this works, you don't  there's not even a 

3

presumption that a settled child will stay, right? 

4

You're just saying, once you've found a settled child, 

5

the obligation to return the child goes away, but at 

6

that point, it really is a kind of "all things 

7

considered" inquiry, with no presumption operating at 

8

all, just in light of the purposes of the treaty? 

9

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, I think the  the 

10

last part, Justice Kagan, is the most important part, 

11

that it has to be guided by the objectives of the 

12

treaty; that it's not a freewheeling, best interests of 

13

the child analysis or where this child should be, but 

14

you could take into account the principle in Article 12, 

15

that it's harmful to uproot a settled child, but you can 

16

also weigh against that the idea that this Convention is 

17

really geared in the first place toward preventing 

18

abduction. 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I would think it 

20

would be very unusual for a family court in that 

21

situation not to go ahead with the custody proceeding 

22

before it because it would think the child is settled. 

23

Now, do I send the child back.  So that they can do the 

24

custody proceeding in England, or just go ahead and do 

25

it here?  Don't you think most family court judges would

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

say, let's just go ahead and do it here? 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, if there's  if 

3

there's reason to send the child back, even  even a 

4

settled child, we think that the purposes of the 

5

Convention should  should prevail there. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What kind of 

7

reasons  what kind of reasons would there  would 

8

there be? 

9
10

12

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

That the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

To send the child 

back? 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

That the parent engaged in 

13

behavior like concealing the child that is  that is 

14

not condoned under the Convention, that 

15
16
17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you would visit 

on the child the behavior of the parent? 
 MS. O'CONNELL: 

We think the court  I 

18

mean, the court has discretion, we think, to order a 

19

child's returned even if she's settled.  I mean, that 

20

that discretion could be abused if a child has been in 

21

the United States, for example, for 5 years, and the 

22

court says, well, the child was being concealed, so we 

23

will send the child back. 

24
25

 But  but we think  and there will be 
some cases in which the court could probably not abuse

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

its discretion by deciding the case either way. 
 But, yes, we think on the one hand equitable 

3

tolling is not a good way to deal with this problem 

4

because Article 12 specifically wants courts to take 

5

into consideration the interest of the child 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, whatever fears 

7

my colleagues have, I've only found two  or I should 

8

say my clerks have only found two published decisions in 

9

which courts have returned the child, so it's not as if 

10

they are ignoring the settlement issue.  In fact, some 

11

might say that they are not giving abduction enough 

12

weight in  in enough cases. 

13

 But I  the Hong Kong court who said there 

14

might not be discretion to return a settled child was 

15

not the highest court of Hong Kong, either. 

16

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

That's  that's right.  I 

17

don't think any of these decisions are from the highest 

18

court. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And so, if we're going 

20

to give uniform meaning, the uniform meaning of 

21

international weight is that abduction is one factor for 

22

a court to consider in its equitable weighing on 

23

settlement because that's the whole purpose of the 

24

Convention.  That's a central reason in the preamble. 

25

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

That's right.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But isn't there 
There's always  isn't 

3

there always abduction?  As your friend has pointed out, 

4

the whole treaty only applies where the child has been 

5

abducted, so you say, oh, well, there's a special 

6

exception to the rules of the treaty where the child has 

7

been abducted, but that's what the treaty applies to. 

8
9

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

We understand that an 

abduction is going to take place in every case.  I think 

10

we are looking for something more than what happened in 

11

this case, some sort of concealment that happened, so 

12

that the parent that is left behind and looking for the 

13

child cannot find him. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I don't know what sense  I 

15

don't know what sense that makes.  Let's say a child is 

16

abducted in Mexico, and let's say that the parent who is 

17

left behind is not a rich or sophisticated person, and 

18

now, the child is brought to the United States. 

19

 And the parent in Mexico has a year to find 

20

the child in the United States, doesn't speak English, 

21

can't easily find a lawyer to handle the case.  He's got 

22

an enormous country to try to find the child in the 

23

United States.  How in the world is that going to be 

24

done? 

25

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You don't need to do very 

2

much concealment.  You can go to Peoria.  You can go to 

3

New York City, and  and it's going to be an enormous 

4

struggle to find that child within a year. 

5

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

The first thing I'll point 

6

out is that Article 12  the drafters assumed that 

7

there was going to be some difficulty in locating 

8

children, and they decided on this oneyear period, but 

9

also point out the State Department dedicates 

10

significant resources to finding children that are 

11

thought to have been abducted to the United States. 

12

 They have access to all sorts of federal law 

13

enforcement databases to try to determine if the child 

14

has come here.  They have 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How  how would that aid 

16

be invoked?  Take Justice Scalia's example.  The parent 

17

left behind in Mexico, no resources of her own or his 

18

own.  How would the State Department get into the act? 

19

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Typically, the leftbehind 

20

parent will approach the central authority in his or her 

21

own country and typically with an idea of what the 

22

abducting parent's connections are to other countries. 

23

And so, if the United States is singled out as a country 

24

to which the child might have been taken, the Mexican 

25

central authority would contact the United States

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

central authority, and immediately, somebody would be 

2

assigned to start looking for that child within the 

3

United States. 

4

 And there are a great number of resources 

5

that are channeled toward that through the State 

6

Department in working with other Federal agencies, 

7

the  the crime databases, the Federal parent locater 

8

service that's used to track down people in the United 

9

States to pay child support. 

10

 It works with State law enforcement agencies 

11

who can check school records and driver's license 

12

records and things like that, so it's not like it's  I 

13

mean, it is difficult.  We are acknowledging that it's 

14

quite difficult. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

How  how separate are 

16

the two concepts of the best interest of the child and 

17

the interest in policing parents, so they don't abduct? 

18

At what point do they intersect? 

19

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

Well, I mean, we think 

20

the Convention starts with the presumption that a 

21

settled child should be returned, and so the starting 

22

presumption is always that you should not abduct the 

23

child 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The child settled, that's 

when the abduction took place.

 MS. O'CONNELL:

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Excuse me? 
You said it started that a 

settled child should be returned? 

4

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

5

child should be returned. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

That  that an abducted 

Yes, abducted. 
When the  a determination 

8

that the child is settled can overcome that presumption, 

9

and then the other equitable factors, like concealment, 

10

come into play. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Justice Scalia? 
You know, I have one more 

13

question.  At the end of the day, now that I understand 

14

the government's position, I don't see any difference 

15

between your position and  and the position of  of 

16

the Petitioner here, except that he wants to call it 

17

equitable tolling, and you want to say we can take 

18

concealment into account under Section 12 

19

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No 
 and not apply the 

21

absolute rule, where there's been concealment.  I don't 

22

care whether you call it equitable tolling or not. 

23

 MS. O'CONNELL: 

I think the positions are 

24

quite different because, under an equitable tolling 

25

analysis, putting aside that you may be able to satisfy

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a different Convention defense, like one under Article 

2

13 or 20, under an equitable tolling analysis, the court 

3

would be prohibited from taking into account whether the 

4

child is settled in her new environment in determining 

5

whether to send her back.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAWN P. REGAN 

9

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

10

 MR. REGAN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

central difference, isn't it? 

13
14
15
16
17

Thank you, counsel. 

I would agree 

 MR. REGAN: 

That is, in fact, the 

I would agree with Ms. 

O'Connell, that there is a difference. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

A huge one, whether the 

court can 
 MR. REGAN: 

The difference is not that a 

18

court cannot take the facts and circumstances of the 

19

child's life into account.  It can.  That is  that is 

20

the Mendez case.  That's Reyes Olguin.  That's Blondin. 

21

There are innumerable cases that show that.  They can 

22

the Court can take that into account.  It's just a 

23

question of what is the question to which the Court 

24

applies those facts. 

25

 Under our circumstance, it's not this

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Article 12.2, is the child doing fine here?  Is the 

2

child living a normal life?  It's a different question. 

3

Is the  is the goal and motive and presumption for 

4

return going to be defeated here because it would 

5

present a risk of harm to the child?  We think that's 

6

the right question because that's the only question that 

7

deters concealment. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Are you  can I ask you 

how it works here?  I realize I don't know.  A year has 

10

passed.  The father never found out where the child was. 

11

Now, he suddenly finds out.  He runs to Iowa.  The judge 

12

looks at this Convention, and he says, well, the year's 

13

passed.  You've lost, let's say, and I don't have to 

14

I don't have to return him forthwith.  The child's not 

15

going to suffer intolerable injury.  I can't use that. 

16

I don't have to return him forthwith. 

17

 Now, I look, is he settled? 

Yes.  He's 

18

settled.  All right.  End of the matter.  But do we now, 

19

in the discretion of the father, have a custody hearing? 

20

The father can say, yes, all that's true, but I should 

21

have custody.  And he goes, and under Iowa law, we see 

22

who is entitled to custody.  And he has something going 

23

for him.  Namely, the mother's acted pretty badly, 

24

unless she has excusing circumstances in abducting the 

25

child.

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Does that happen or not? 

2

 MR. REGAN: 

Well, the custody proceeding 

3

would occur in a different court.  Of course, it 

4

wouldn't occur in the Federal 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, it would go to the 

6

family court, so is that  would that happen?  Could 

7

that happen?  Of course, I think. 

8

 MR. REGAN: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course.  Of course. 
Okay.  If the answer is of 

10

course, what we're talking about here is, on the one 

11

hand, we don't want to encourage abductions.  On the 

12

other hand, we don't want to treat the child as a yoyo. 

13

 MR. REGAN: 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Absolutely. 
So the question is whether 

15

the custody hearing will be in a family court in Britain 

16

or whether it'll be in a family court in the United 

17

States. 

18

 MR. REGAN: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20
21
22
23

That's right. 
That's the correct 

question; is that right? 
 MR. REGAN: 

That is the question.  And also, 

the question is how do we deter 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So our issue about whether 

24

there's discretion or  it's a little bit secondary 

25

because we can have a big, fullblown hearing about who

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should have custody, though, it will be in a different 

2

court.  It's true.  You lose.  There is more incentive 

3

to kidnap the child. 

4

 It's also true, if you win, there is a much 

5

greater likelihood that the custody hearing will be in 

6

Britain, rather than the United States, which is the 

7

yoyo problem. 

8
9
10

 MR. REGAN: 

And our concern here, Justice 

Breyer 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Now, go  now, 

11

say what you want to say.  Now, if I understand it 

12

correctly. 

13

 MR. REGAN: 

Our concern is the deterrence 

14

and prevention, which is the goal of the Convention. 

15

Justice Scalia asked about other nations in uniformity. 

16

And there could be no better reflection about the room 

17

created in Article 12 and that this  that the 

18

uniformity is not  or that this is not a problem where 

19

we need to be so concerned about uniformity. 

20

 In 2006, through the special commission 

21

process, the meeting of the  of the members of the 

22

Convention, the United States specifically apprised the 

23

other nations that it was employing equitable tolling in 

24

the 12.2 context.  As the government concedes, no one 

25

else disagreed.  No one expressed any concern about the

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

United States doing that.  That's a clear reflection 

2

that there is this room in Article 12. 

3

 Government's and Respondent's position is 

4

that concealment may be taken into account.  The problem 

5

there is the Respondent still has this enormous 

6

incentive to conceal, which is the purpose  that's the 

7

primary goal, to prevent that from happening, concealing and 

8

abduction.  That's the goal of the Convention. 

9

 But also, there's no standard. 

They haven't 

10

articulated a standard.  The government doesn't 

11

articulate one.  It  it amounts to a standard that 

12

says concealment matters, unless it doesn't.  That's an 

13

enormous  that ephemeral standard is very difficult 

14

for a respondent to overcome.  It's very difficult for a 

15

district court to apply.  And what it does is it creates 

16

this incentive to conceal because no one even knows what 

17

the question is. 

18

 Equitable tolling defines the question 

19

within the context of the Convention.  It says, by 

20

tolling, this is the question you should answer.  If 

21

there's not to be tolling and there are lots of 

22

courts  lots of cases where courts have found we 

23

shouldn't toll because the child wasn't concealed or the 

24

parent didn't exercise due diligence finding the child, 

25

then we'll ask the Article 12.2 question, whether the

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

child is settled. 

2

 The bottom line is equitable discretion will 

3

result in the abduction of more children.  Equitable 

4

tolling will disincentivize that.  I would urge the 

5

Court to look at those cases I mentioned, Mendez, 

6

Blondin. 

7

 Reyes Olguin is another one. 

2005, Westlaw 

8

67094, a 2005 case in the Eastern District of New York, 

9

Judge Gleeson where return was denied under these 

10

circumstances.  Now, that's a natural 12.1 case, I 

11

believe.  But the court looks at factors of settlement. 

12

Excuse me. 

13
