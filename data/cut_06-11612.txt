Mr. Newton.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. NEWTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Petitioner was not present at the bench

12

conference and did not have the assistance of an

13

interpreter when the magistrate judge solicited his

14

attorney's consent to conduct jury selection.

15

record does not reflect the Petitioner personally

16

consented or ever learned of his attorney's consent.

17

Whether defense counsel CAN unilaterally waive a

18

criminal defendant's right to an Article III judge at

19

jury selection, as occurred in this case, is a serious

20

constitutional question.

21

avoidance doctrine, this Court should avoid answering

22

this question by interpreting the "Additional Duties"

23

Clause of the Federal Magistrates Act to require

24

defendant's explicit personal waiver of the right to an

25

Article III judge at felony jury selection.

The

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Newton, you're not

2

claiming in this case that the defendant was any way

3

disadvantaged by the magistrate judge conducting the

4

voir dire, are you?

5

MR. NEWTON:

I'm contending that the denial

6

of his right to an Article III judge at felony jury

7

selection violated his rights.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there was no

objection to any of the proceedings by the magistrate

There were no objections to any -- well, she

She allowed the lawyer to do

allegation of discrete error during the jury selection

personal waiver of the right to an Article III judge.

18

The "Additional Duties" Clause -

19

No, we're not making any

We're contending that there should have been a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This may not be a

20

pertinent question, but where does the right to voir

21

dire come from in the first place?

22

MR. NEWTON:

The Court has discussed the

23

right to voir dire in capital cases and in non-capital

24

cases as it relates to the right to a fair trial, the

25

right to an impartial jury 4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's derivative

2

from other rights?

3

the right to a fair trial, in the Batson context helps

4

guard against an equal protection violation, but it's

5

not on its own a free-standing right.

6

In other words, it helps implement

MR. NEWTON:

Well, Your Honor, I would say

7

that the Court has said that, in a Federal case

8

particularly, you have a right to an Article III,

9

Section 2 right to a jury, as well as a Sixth Amendment

10

right, and the Court has referred to this as an

11

allocation of Federal judicial power in the people as

12

well as in judges.

13

-- has constitutional implications with respect to the

14

structure of Article III as well as any personal right a

15

defendant may have to -- to an impartial duty.

So selecting the jury obviously is a

16

The "Additional Duties" Clause is silent

17

about the type of waiver or consent required and the

18

silence is understandable.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, where a defendant is

20

waiving a jury trial or pleading guilty, that's

21

something that an ordinary person can probably readily

22

understand.

23

defendant is going to have any kind of independent

24

opinion on the question of whether it's better for the

25

voir dire to be presided over by a district judge as

But how likely is it that an ordinary

5

2

going to be in the vast, vast majority of cases that

3

your client will simply turn to you and say, which do

4

you think is better, and whatever the lawyer recommends,

5

that's what the client is going to do?

6

realistic situation?

7

MR. NEWTON:

Isn't the situation

Isn't that the

Your Honor, I don't think

8

that's necessarily true.

I've had -- I represent people

9

in trial court as well as on appeal, and I've had many

10

clients who like district judges better than magistrates

11

or magistrates better than district judges, depending on

12

how they've encountered them in prior proceedings.

13

don't think that's an assumption I would make.

14

And, more importantly, other personal

15

rights -- the right to a grand jury, a petty jury -

16

those are rights that a lot of defendants don't

17

understand.

18

a jury is because they don't have juries in foreign

19

countries.

20

So I

I've had to explain to foreign clients what

21

difference between having a judge trial and a jury of

one's peers.

23

judge and an Article III judge to do the voir dire

24

25

The difference between having a magistrate

MR. NEWTON:

I mean,

Well, Your Honor, the

10

magistrate judges have been permitted to exercise the

11

attributes of Article III power when they are adjuncts.

12

The Court in Gomez unanimously thought that the

13

magistrate's role at felony jury selection was not

14

really that of an adjunct because there was no

15

meaningful Article III review of the -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may well be, but the

that?

they -- they have independence and so on.

MR. NEWTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

There are

2

basically three characteristics that I can discern in

3

the Court's jurisprudence about other personal rights

4

that must be personally waived by a defendant on the

5

record.

6

fundamental right, and I think that the Court's

7

decisions in Hatter and Gomez and the plurality opinion

8

in Northern Pipeline, -- all those decisions I think

9

establish that the right to an Article III judge at a

First of all, it obviously must be a

10

critical stage of a criminal case is a fundamental

11

right.

12

necessary but not sufficient, because we have lots of

13

fundamental rights that can be waived during the trial

14

by the attorney.

15

But there's more than just that.

That's

The other two characteristics are I think

16

what distinguish this right and make it more like

17

waiving counsel and waiving a petit jury and a grand

18

jury and the right to go to trial at all.

19

being fundamental, the second characteristic is that

20

this right concerns the players in the game as opposed

21

to the rules of the game, the framework of the

22

proceedings in the sense of the players.

5

as a practical matter this is not nearly as important as

6

a failure to object to illegally seized evidence, a post

7

-- a post-arrest delay, open courtroom, all of which are

8

subject to waiver.

9

You're constructing your argument so that we

MR. NEWTON:

I can understand that

Well, Your Honor, if I can

10

answer your question, but also the third characteristic.

11

The third characteristic of this kind of right is

12

timing, how it's waived.

13

said these personal rights are to be waived at a

14

discrete point in time, as opposed to something during

15

the heat of battle of the adversarial process.

16

and I would respectfully disagree that the right to an

17

Article III judge, at least the right to have it without

18

a personal waiver, is a fundamental right.

19

something the Framers considered to be of utmost

20

importance, and in Hatter the Court said the

21

considerations that led the Framers to believe this was

an extremely important right -

more a tactical decision than a theoretical one.

two cases repeatedly for the proposition that this is a

right that must be personally waived.

there is a -

Patton I suppose would have

But it became enshrined in

proposition.

I thought what Adams stood

for was that the defendant can himself waive the right

do it on his own he can do it without counsel.

21

doesn't mean that if counsel does it without his

objection at the time it's invalid.

23

MR. NEWTON:

It

Well, Your Honor, it's -- the

24

language in Adams which quotes from Patton says it must

25

be the express, intelligent consent of the defendant,

Yes.

I mean it's quite a different question to

8
9

MR. NEWTON:

Well, my alternative position

is, at the very least, the record needs to reflect that

10

when counsel speaks, counsel is directly speaking with

11

the approval of the client.

12

In Peretz that was the situation.

13

the pretrial conference involved a waiver by the defense

attorney in the presence of his client and then followed

And, then, all of a sudden, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You were referring a

Alderson Reporting Company

while back to the Gomez case.

2

case correctly, it was the defense counsel who made the

3

objection to the magistrate; and there's nothing to

4

indicate whether the defense counsel had done that in

5

consultation with the defendant.

6

what the defendant's wishes were, but it was the

7

defendant -- it was the lawyer who raised the objection.

8
9

MR. NEWTON:

And if I remember that

We don't have any idea

Well, Your Honor, I think

that's distinguishable because when one is objecting to

10

the violation of a right, that's different from

11

acquiescing in a knowing and voluntary and intelligent

12

waiver of the right.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was the lawyer's

14

choice, and we have no indication that it wasn't -- it

15

was anything other than the strategic choice of the

Gomez case.

And your position is that it must come from the

Well, Your Honor, in Gomez it

20

was an objection to a alleged violation of Article III,

21

this case.

18

understand the case correctly, equated the waiver with a

your argument.

21

It seems to me that Peretz undercuts

MR. NEWTON:

Well, Your Honor, as I -- as I

22

think I've explained in the brief, Peretz is full of

23

many statements that are ambiguous.

24

Peretz has -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But everything in

Well, you say they are

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ambiguous, but isn't it -- I've reread Peretz after many

2

years getting ready for this argument, and it seems to

3

me that it's difficult to read Peretz without reading

4

the "waiver failure to object" phraseology as being

5

equivalent.

6
7
8
9

MR. NEWTON:

Well, Your Honor, Peretz has to

be read in light of two things:
One, it has to be read in light of the facts
of that case where there was a failure to object after

10

the attorney had personally -- or had stated his client

11

personally considered it.

12

before the Court in Olano distinguished between waivers

13

and forfeitures.

14

Amendment context, means at least knowing acquiescence.

15

"Waiver" clearly means an intentional and knowing

16

relinquishment of a right, and mere silence cannot be

17

interpreted as -- a mere failure to object cannot be -

18

Secondly, Peretz was decided

"Consent," even in the Fourth

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, yes, but -

19

everybody concedes that, but the question is by whom?

20

Certainly very many rights, you will acknowledge, can be

21

waived by counsel.

22

MR. NEWTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you can't simply say it

24

requires an express and knowing waiver, attributing that

25

express and knowing waiver to the defendant.
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Sure, it does, but who has to be "express,"

2

and who has to be "knowing"?

3

here.

4

MR. NEWTON:

That's the issue before us

Yes, Your Honor.

I was

5

responding to -- there is really -- the Government makes

6

two arguments based on Peretz:

7

equals to a waiver or consent, and that's what I was

8

responding to.

9

One, that mere silence

The second argument -- Peretz did not deal

10

with the issue of who is the one to consent, because in

11

Peretz there was, practically speaking, personal

12

consent.

13

Peretz to assume consent.

14

The Court reframed the questions presented in
There is -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, except for one thing,

15

and that is, if -- if it is sound to say that Peretz

16

equated "waiver" with "failure to object," "failure to

17

object" is a -- is a failure, if you will, of counsel,

18

not of the defendant.

19

objections; counsel do.

20

the implication of Peretz is that it would be a -- a

21

decision of the lawyer that would count for

22

constitutional purposes.

23

MR. NEWTON:

Defendants don't get up and make
And, therefore, it seems to me

Your Honor, I would think in

24

certain cases, if it's a personal right and a defense

25

lawyer stands up and says in the presence of his client,
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

my client consents, and the client doesn't object or

2

respond that, I disagree, then it's fair perhaps to

3

assume there's a sufficient showing of -- of personal

4

waiver by the defendant.

5
6
7

But, again, what we have in this case is
just vastly different.

We have nothing in the record -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the point was you

8

were saying that in fact Peretz cannot be read as

9

authority for the Government's position because the

10

facts in Peretz, quite as you correctly note, were that

11

the -- the client had in fact consented, or that was the

12

representation to the Court.

13

that does not seem to have been the reasoning of the

14

Court, because the reasoning of the Court in equating

15

"waiver" with "failure to object" was a reasoning that

16

in its reference to "failure to object" seemed to

17

pinpoint the actions of the lawyer alone.

18

object; lawyers do.

19

refers to, in effect, a failure by the lawyer, alone;

20

and that would be the only significant datum for

21

constitutional purposes.

22

And my point simply was

Clients don't

A failure to object, therefore,

MR. NEWTON:

What is your response to that?
I disagree.

I think that you

23

have to read Peretz in light of the very special facts

24

in that case, which involve two statements in the

25

presence of the defendant:

That the defense was not
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

objecting or was consenting; and, then, in particular,

2

the defendant, himself, was giving consent.

3

And I think you have to also look at the

4

Court's repeated focus on the fact that Peretz himself

5

gave consent in that case.

6

There was no occasion to decide which -

7

which party, the lawyer or the defendant, was the one to

8

properly waive in the Peretz case.

9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think there has to be

a showing on the record that the waiver is knowing?

11

MR. NEWTON:

Under 18 U.S.C. Section

12

3401(b), which I contend is the obvious analog for

13

waiving in the felony context, yes, absolutely.

14

think, at the very least, to avoid a constitutional

15

doubt, and that's -- also, I should say up front, all of

16

these arguments that we are -- or points we're engaging

17

in here simply show this is a serious constitutional

18

question.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

I

So you think there has to be

20

a colloquy like a Rule 11 colloquy or a waiver of

21

counsel's, this is the different, this is what a

22

district judge is, this is what a magistrate judge is,

23

do you understand the difference between the two?

24
25

MR. NEWTON:

It's going to obviously depend

on the defendant because every case involving waiver
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

depends on the particular circumstances.

But, at the

2

very least, there needs to be a showing of a knowing,

3

voluntary waiver of a right to an Article III judge.

4

This is done every day in America.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I know it's a different

6

context, but -- it does not relate to the magistrate

7

versus Article III judge, but do you think that a lawyer

8

could stipulate that the judge or a magistrate presiding

9

could do all the questioning and the lawyers would do

10

none, without the -- without the express consent of his

11

client?

12
13

MR. NEWTON:

In terms of the jury selection

process?

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that the

15

voir dire is peculiarly the -- an area in which the

16

lawyer knows what he is up to and what's at stake, and

17

the client does not.

18

MR. NEWTON:

Well, I would think the lawyer

19

could in that situation for the simple reason that you

20

have already at that point established, presumably, an

21

Article III judge is presiding or it has been validly

22

waived.

23

But picking the jury, the jury selection or,

24

more properly, the jury exclusion, because it's really

25

excluding jurors rather than picking them, that is a
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

qualitatively different thing than deciding whether

2

there is a jury in the first place or whether an Article

3

III judge should preside over the jury selection.

4

would say the lawyer could do that, because that's more

5

the heat of the battle, the adversarial process working,

6

as opposed to a discrete point in time before it.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So I

Do you think a

8

jurisdiction could adopt a rule that was especially

9

careful about selecting the jury panel and then decided

10

they would take the first 12 jurors off an arbitrary

11

list, just to pick them at random and have no voir dire

12

during the trial, just to have a preliminary screening

13

of qualifications of the -- of the entire panel?

14

MR. NEWTON:

I think certain jurisdictions

15

have done that before.

16

by prosecutors and defense counsel.

17

during the adversarial workings of the proceedings as

18

opposed to the discrete point in time before.

19

I think there's been bargaining
That again occurs

procedure would work.

This has gone on every day in

judges.

3

And in the brief I've cited a couple of

4

cases reported in Westlaw where District Judge Kazen has

5

accepted reports and recommendations where the

6

magistrate judge said, I went over the right to Article

7

III judge with the defendant personally, he executed a

8

waiver, and this was done on the record.

9

So, this is not some innovative proceeding.

10

This has been done since 1979 when they amended Section

11

3401(b).

12

clearly shows that Congress believed the right to an

13

Article III judge was a constitutional right that had to

14

be personally waived by the defendant.

15

evidence this is a serious constitutional question.

16

Court should avoid answering that serious constitutional

17

question because you can easily interpret the Federal

18

Magistrate's Act, in particular the "Additional Duties"

19

Clause, to allow for consensual delegation, which Gomez

20

talked about and Peretz talked about, only if it's

personal consent.

think that Congress would have intended this in a felony

case.

So, this is not a leap of logic to

Gomez held Congress never intended this,
this was not something Congress intended, so the Court

is going to have to fill in a gap in terms of what kind

of consent is appropriate.

there is a serious constitutional question.

On the other hand, I'm just not sure of the

practical significance of the client's participation

when it's really the attorney who is making the decision

whether or not this magistrate will allow him to strut

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Newton.
Ms. Blatt?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The decision whether to have a magistrate

10

judge conduct voir dire is a strategic call that counsel

11

is uniquely qualified to make.

12

to determine whether the magistrate judge's particular

13

style, reputation or practice in addressing prospective

14

jurors or resolving objections outweigh the independence

15

conferred by Article III.

Counsel is best equipped

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

be said of the right to plead guilty as well.

18

lawyer has a lot more experience with what kind of

19

sentence the judge is going to impose, what the odds are

20

of the jury returning a verdict of innocence.

21

the fact that the lawyer is better situated to make the

22

judgment doesn't mean it's not a fundamental right.

23

MS. BLATT:

Of course, it might

That's correct.

The

I mean,

And for the few

24

fundamental decisions where the defendant must

25

personally explicitly make, they have a monumental
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

impact on the defendant, and they protect values that

2

extend beyond mere -- mere trial strategy.

3

If a defendant is indicted for a criminal

4

offense, he readily understands he's going to have to

5

decide, do I want to plead guilty, do I want to stand

6

trial, do I want counsel, do I want a jury.

7

readily appreciate that decisions that occurred during

8

voir dire, such as whether to have an Article III judge

9

or a magistrate, whether to exercise peremptory

He does not

10

challenges, whether to challenge jurors for cause,

11

whether to object to the prosecutor's actions.

12

are all decisions that are entrusted to counsel's best

13

professional judgment and his fiduciary obligation to

14

represent the defendant.

15

These

The defendant -- I mean, the defense lawyer

16

also speaks for the client in exercising the defendant's

17

confrontation clause rights, introduce or object to

18

evidence, to object to the closing of the courtroom.

19

There's just a small handful of fundamental rights.

20

for the vast majority of criminal defendants, they don't

21

even have Article III rights, Mr. Chief Justice; they're

22

in State court.

23

So it's an important right.

24

important trial issues.

25

It implicates

But nonetheless, counsel is
And I do think, unlike the

And

1

decision whether you're going to be convicted or stand

2

trial or even testify, this is a decision where the

3

defendant is overwhelmingly likely to defer to counsel's

4

tactical and strategic judgment.

5

In this case, I just wanted to point out one

6

other thing about the magistrate.

As Justice Ginsburg

7

said, she not only let the lawyers pose their own

8

questions to the jurors, she also gave the lawyers each

9

an extra peremptory challenge.

And that just shows that

10

magistrate judges can have particular styles or

11

practice, and counsel would be uniquely situated to

12

assess the value of that.

13
14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did she rule on strikes for

cause?
MS. BLATT:

They were all by consensus, so

16

yes, she ruled on them in that jurors were excused for

17

various reasons.

18

consensus by defense counsel and the prosecutor.

19

But there was -- it was pretty much by

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that -- I mean, that

20

is, I suppose, the most significant power that the judge

21

who is conducting the voir dire or presiding at the voir

22

dire has, to allow or not allow a strike -

23

MS. BLATT:

Right, and defense counsel's

24

going to have to weigh in any given case whether the

25

magistrate judge is going to rule on any objections and
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

de novo review is possible, but it's difficult as a

2

practical matter, as the court noted in Peretz.

3

defense counsel is best situated to decide, and I want

4

to get the most favorable jury I can for my client,

5

what's the best way to do that?

6

judge better off -- am I better off with which one?

7

The

Is this magistrate

And defense counsel, if he has any concerns,

8

can object to the magistrate's role and then would be

9

entitled under the Federal Magistrate Act to have an

10

Article III judge conduct voir dire.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- I know you

12

don't like to contemplate this, but that we accept the

13

Petitioner's position that there has to be, that the

14

client has to waive.

15

adopting the rule that there has to be express waiver,

16

or would you then recommend that we ask the further

17

question whether or not there was an implied consent?

Would we be better off just

18

MS. BLATT:

An implied consent in -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, he was there, he

20

probably knew and the record shows that he knew what was

21

going on.

22

MS. BLATT:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

should go down that route.
MS. BLATT:

If a personal explicit waiver is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

required, there wasn't one here.

2

by defense counsel, so it would not meet that test of

3

having -- I don't know what the implied waiver would be.

4

There is an expressed waiver by defense counsel.

5

The express waiver was

If counsel just said nothing and there was

6

no objection, which is not what is at issue in this

7

case, then there would be a question on how do you read

8

this Court's decision in Peretz.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask how it works in

10

practice?

Does the magistrate's ruling on objections to

11

jurors, are those rulings subject to review by the

12

district judge or are they final?

13

MS. BLATT:

Under this Court's decision in

14

Peretz, there would be de novo review at the end of the

15

process.

16

in the jury but there was, nothing was ever objected to

17

by the magistrate's role.

18

And here an Article III judge actually swore

There was no -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But in practice, as I

19

understand it, very often the judge will, will review

20

the magistrate's decisions on contested objections.

21

MS. BLATT:

He can.

Right.

Yes.

And if

22

the Court said in Peretz that the Constitution would

23

require that the review be de novo and they recognize in

24

a footnote this Court that as a practical matter it

25

might be difficult to reweigh credibility
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

determinations, and you have the same kind of issues

2

when a magistrate judge conducts Social Security cases

3

or suppression hearings, the magistrate rules on or

4

weighs credibility and there is a de novo review by the

5

Article III judge.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How does that work?

You

7

have some jurors, and you have juror's excused for

8

cause, and there is an argument about that, then that

9

juror has to sit down and wait for two days and then

10

they go back and they review that before the district

11

judge.

12

work.

I just don't know mechanically how that can

13

MS. BLATT:

I don't know if it can be done

14

that day.

15

just a matter of a couple of hours.

16

I mean, in this case, the jury selection was

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Excuse me, if the Article

17

III judge says, oh, this should not have been excused

18

for cause, then you go back and bump the juror.

19

MS. BLATT:

I think this discussion just

20

shows why a defendant -- this would not be a right that

21

he would readily appreciate and understand.

22

something defense counsel would just decide.

23

-- in this particular trial, and this was a short drug

24

trial, this voir dire occurred without incident and it

25

was pretty routine.

This is
And is it

Is this something that if it were

Alderson Reporting Company

different type of case defense counsel might think, no,

2

I don't want whatever disruption it might be and we want

3

an Article III judge.

4

able to object.

And defense counsel is of course

5

I also wanted to point out -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you -- do you

7

think the right to a jury trial is something that has to

8

be personally waived by the defendant or can that be

9

waived through counsel?

10

MS. BLATT:

We read a discussion of it in

11

Florida v. Nixon and New York v. Hill including that

12

among the rights that required a personal explicit

13

waiver.

14
15

But if we're wrong about that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Were those -- was

the right to a jury trial at issue in those cases?

16

MS. BLATT:

No, it was just a descriptive:

17

There are decisions of such moment that the defendant

18

must personally make and this is usually included in the

19

list.

20

But whatever -- whatever CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When I was

21

researching it, I saw that it was usually included in

22

the list, but I thought it would track back to some case

23

that held that it was, but it never -- never does.

24
25

MS. BLATT:

Well, whatever is in the list,

it's a very small handful and it is something that the
32
Alderson Reporting Company

defendant -

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's our list, after all,

right?

4

(Laughter.)

5

MS. BLATT:

It's a very short list, and I

6

just think it's something that a defendant can readily

7

appreciate, even though it may be a strategic call,

8

whether or not he is going to plead guilty or even take

9

the stand.

I mean, the right to testify is a decision

10

that personally belongs to the defendant, but you still

11

don't need an on-the-record, explicit personal consent

12

by the defendant personally.

13

says, we have no witnesses, the client's assent is

14

assumed and that's just the way our criminal justice

15

system works.

in all but the very few exceptional cases.

constitutional question, but under our supervisory

24

power, we're going to tell the district -- the

25

magistrate judges, district judges in this circuit; it's
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a simple thing to do, put on the record that the

2

defendant himself consented.

3
4

That would be -- that would no longer be
valid, right?

5
6

MS. BLATT:

I mean, I

think a -- there is nothing to stop them -

7
8

I don't think so.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You think it would be valid

or don't think it wouldn't be valid?

9

MS. BLATT:

I don't think so.

I mean -- and

10

that's why the Court took the case to resolve that

11

circuit.

12

Court's decision in Peretz to require it.

13

there was some constitutional doubt about it but I don't

14

--

15

And I read the decision as reading this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Or at least

They specifically said,

16

we're doing this under our supervisory powers, not under

17

the Constitution.

18

still say, we think it's better for the defendant

19

himself to be told, so in our circuit that's going to be

20

the rule?

21

So my question was could a circuit

MS. BLATT:

I mean, I don't think I have a

22

fully developed answer on that, but my guess would be

23

our position is no.

24

there's at least anything to stop the particular

25

magistrate judge in any given case from saying -- from

But I don't -- I don't think

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

addressing the defendant or requiring it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -

Well, suppose the

3

question would come up.

I mean, if the circuit does

4

that the question would come up, if the magistrate

5

doesn't do it and it's not objected to, because of

6

course if it's objected to you deal with it then.

7

MS. BLATT:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10
11

Right.

Well, I And then we'd have

to decide, or the Court would have to decide whether
that's a basis for reversal.
MS. BLATT:

Right.

And on that issue our

12

position is clear:

There is a rule that would dictate

13

how it would be resolved and Rule 52(b) of the Federal

14

Rule of Criminal Procedures has no exception, and plain

15

error would apply.

16

error, the defendant would have to make the necessary

17

showings for plain error review, and on that I would

18

like to address, since we are on the subject, that if

19

the Court disagreed with us on the merits, Rule 52(b)

20

would apply and we think that all the concerns that

21

animate a contemporaneous objection rule are at their

22

peak when the defense counsel expressly agrees to the

23

course of action followed by the court, and Petitioner's

24

rule of automatic reversal would open the door to

25

gamesmanship and sandbagging because it would allow

And so if there was some sort of

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defense counsel to wait and see if the defendant is

2

convicted before objecting to the magistrate's role.

3

And before I get to -- I wanted to turn to,

4

if you apply plain error, I just wanted to point one

5

thing out about the Court's decision in Peretz.

6

was not something that was just not at issue in the

7

case.

8

in that case was ineffective because it did not meet the

9

requirements of Section 3401(b); there was no personal

10

explicit waiver; the defendant did not understand what

11

was happening, he didn't speak English well, and so on;

12

and the dissenting justices picked up on that and urged

13

the Court and dissented because there had -- one of the

reasons there was not an explicit and personal waiver by

then he can make that Sixth Amendment argument.

12

don't think it would have any merit because this is no

13

different than the myriad other types of trial rights

14

that belong to counsel.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We

Do you think the

16

magistrate judge would overstep -- assuming you win and

17

that is that rule is that the attorney can make the

18

waiver, would the magistrate judge overstep by saying I

19

know you've consented to this, but I want you to talk to

20

your client about it; I want you to explain what the

21

rules are?

22

Would that be overstepping?
MS. BLATT:

No.

I think there is some room

23

for that.

I mean I -- some room for that for the court,

24

but it's -- it's not like it's the right to testify.

25

would be hard to, you know, if there was some argument

It

1

over objection or how to question prospective jurors.

2

There's not a hybrid defense team where the -- the judge

3

is always supposed to turn to the defendant and say are

4

you sure you're comfortable with what your counsel is

5

doing?

6

If the Court does conclude that there is

7

error, the Petitioner, we don't think has made the

8

necessary showing for plain error review.

9

problem and the most fundamental is the error is not

The first

10

plain, because this Court has already upheld the role of

11

the magistrate judge in jury selection in Peretz,

12

despite the absence of a personal waiver; and at least

13

four courts have read that decision to allow a

14

magistrate judge to conduct voir dire, either when there

15

is an absence of an objection or there is express

16

consent by defense counsel.

17

And even assuming this Court doesn't reach

18

the question of whether the error had an effect on

19

substantial rights, the error did not seriously affect

20

the fairness, integrity or public confidence of criminal

21

proceedings.

22

occurred without incident or objection, as Justice

23

Ginsburg pointed out, to anything that the magistrate

24

judge did; and there is no indication -- and I don't

25

think we have heard any -- there is no indication that

The error -- the voir dire in this case

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the defendant actually disagreed with his counsel's

2

professional judgment to consent to have the magistrate

3

judge, or even had an opinion on the subject.

4

Petitioner's rule would, as I said, open the door to

5

gamesmanship because it would relieve counsel of any

6

obligation to call an error to the court's attention and

7

therefore give the court the opportunity to correct the

8

error.

9
10

If there are no questions, we would ask that
the Fifth Circuit's decision be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. NEWTON,

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. NEWTON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

17

I'd like to return to Section 3401(b), which

18

the plain language of, and the legislative history

19

behind, clearly show a congressional intent in the -

20

context for personal waivers on the record by

21

defendants.

22

same thing, at least in some similar form, in the felony

23

context.

24
25

It would be anomalous not to require the

JUSTICE SCALIA:
that has troubled me.

Could I just -- a question

Basically, what you say that is
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of such importance here is the composition of a jury.

2

mean, that's what it all boils down to, who's going to

3

rule on the composition of the jury, should it be a

4

magistrate or should it be an Article III judge.

5

if -- you know, if that is -- is so fundamental that it

6

needs a special rule that the waiver has to be personal

7

by the defendant, then you can say the same thing about

8

-- about objections to -- to the Court's failure to

9

permit a strike for cause.

10
11

I

But

That affects the composition

of the jury.
Now do you need -- do you need the

12

defendant's consent to the judge's ruling on that point,

13

or is it enough if the lawyer makes no objection?

14

MR. NEWTON:

It would be enough if the

15

lawyer made no objection, Your Honor, because that is

16

the kind of rule that I described earlier that concerns

17

the heat of the battle of the adversary process, unlike

18

a discreet point in time before.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. NEWTON:

I see.

I see.

The other point I'm trying to

21

make is that the -- it's not just the fact that it's a

22

critical stage; it's a critical stage where there is a

23

right to an Article III judge over the critical stage.

24

The Court in Gomez clearly recognized that jury

25

selection is a critical stage.

So it is the Article III

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right that implicates the right to a jury trial, but it

2

is fundamentally the right to an Article III judge that

3

is at issue.

4

The Government makes much of its claim that

5

there could be meaningful Article III de novo review of

6

magistrate judge rulings.

7

Gomez stated that the Court highly doubted it would be

8

possible to have such review, and it realistically

9

speaking is not possible because delays between the time

The court unanimously in

10

that the district judge can get back to conduct a

11

review, and in Gomez the Court found -- pointed out that

12

if you bring jurors back and question them again, you

13

run the risk of making them hostile -- they think they

14

did something wrong -- where you don't have that in an

15

erratic situation where you're delegating an evidentiary

16

hearing.

17

know that's part of the process.

18

Witnesses get recalled all the time.

They

So, realistically speaking, there is no de

22

III judge.

23

It's not the magistrate judge acting as an

The Government argues plain error doctrine

24

should apply, Rule 52(b).

Justice Scalia's concurring

25

opinion in Freytag noted that there are different kinds
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of rights that can be waived or forfeited, and most

2

rights can be forfeited short of a waiver, but there are

3

certain kinds of rights -- and we contend this is one of

4

them -- that cannot be forfeited short of a valid

5

waiver.

6

The Court in Barker and in Boykin v. Alabama

7

stated that there are certain personal rights where the

8

prosecution has the entire responsibility to spread on

9

the record the valid waiver.

And if the prosecution

10

doesn't meet that burden in the trial court, it's

11

illogical to apply the burden on the defendant on appeal

12

when it's the prosecution that would need to assure it

13

was the defendant's personal waiver that happened in the

14

trial court.

15

The Court in Wynn and Glitton and other

16

cases moreover has said, if it's a fundamental question

17

of judicial administration, then it can be raised for

18

the first time on appeal.

19

I think the Court also should consider the

20

facts of this case in deciding whether there was

21

gamesmanship.

22

Mr. Gonzalez was cut out of the equation entirely.

23

magistrate judge only invited the attorneys to the

24

bench, left him sitting there without the assistance of

25

an interpreter.

There wasn't.

Clearly there wasn't.

main point, which is -- I'm not asking the Court to

should happen and -

MR. NEWTON:

I'm asking the Court to avoid

16

that question by interpreting the "Additional Duties"

Clause, whether it's a supervisory authority matter or

18

as a statutory construction matter, to basically model
