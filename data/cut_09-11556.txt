CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

We will hear

4

argument next this morning in Case 09-11556, Tolentino

5

v. New York.

6

Ms. Schwarz.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTINA SCHWARZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SCHWARZ:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court held in Delaware v. Prouse that,

11
12

in the absence of reasonable suspicion, it is an

13

unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment for

14

police to stop a car for the purpose of checking the

15

motorist's driving credentials.
In Brown v. Texas, the Court similarly ruled

16
17

that police may not stop a person without reasonable

18

suspicion for the purpose of requiring the individual to

19

identify him or herself.

20

the principle that in this country we enjoy the right to

21

go about our business free from government interference

22

unless or until the police have just cause to detain us.

23

Petitioner's motion to suppress alleged that

These cases are grounded in

24

the police acted exactly as they did in Prouse and

25

Brown.

They stopped the car without justification,

which otherwise would not have been discovered.

of suppressing the poisonous fruit of the illegal car

4

stop, the DMV records, the New York Court of Appeals

5

chose to create a new categorical rule that prevents

6

application of the exclusionary rule whenever the police

7

act in violation of Prouse.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Instead

Was -- was -- was the

poisonous fruit the DMV records, or was the poisonous

10

fruit the fact that this person who is contained in the

11

records was the one driving the car?

13

were there anyway.

14

came from the stop was the fact that that is the person

15

who was driving the car.

16

wasn't that what should have been suppressed?

18

I mean, the records

What -- what -- what new information

MS. SCHWARZ:

Why -- why didn't -- why

Well, Justice Scalia, that is

also a fruit of the poisonous tree.

MS. SCHWARZ:

That's right, and that's

because the court below decided that -- in deciding the

case only addressed the DMV record, and -- and indicated

that the DMV records were not properly suppressible

Yes, Justice Alito, he could.
Even though the officer

18

would have no reason to know that this particular person

19

has a suspended license were it not for the chain of

20

events that followed from the initial allegedly illegal

21

stop?

22

MS. SCHWARZ:

Well, although that initial

23

stop provided the tainted information that he didn't

24

have a license, the subsequent re- offense would

25

certainly taint the -- the illegality of the first stop

MS. SCHWARZ:

Well, that -- I believe that

12

under those circumstances it would be entirely proper to

13

prosecute the case.

14

that came from an independent source.

15

With that, that would be evidence

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I mean, in light of

16

those two answers, it does seem to me that your real

17

problem here is not with the -- the DMV records.

18

with the police officer's observation after the stop

19

that Mr. Tolentino was driving the car.

20

MS. SCHWARZ:

It's

Well, Justice Alito, again,

21

all of -- there's lots of evidence that could be

22

They're all properly considered fruit, and in

2

this case the DMV records are of important evidentiary

significance.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Is there -- is there any

case in this Court where what was suppressed was

6

information that was lawfully in the government's

7

possession, as opposed to evidence that was acquired

8

originally through the search?

9

records, they're public records.

Here we have the DMV
I don't know of any

10

decision of this Court that deals with suppression of

11

evidence that is already in the government's possession,

12

and if I'm wrong about that, you tell me.
MS. SCHWARZ:

13

Yes.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I

14

don't believe there has been precedent on that issue.

15

However, in the independent source doctrine cases, there

16

-- they've always required that the possession -- or

17

that they have knowledge of the information in order for

18

it to defeat the exclusionary rule application.

19

this case, although the government had the DMV records

20

-- well, first of all, law enforcement didn't have the

21

DMV records.

22

exploitation of that illegality that they acquired the

23

records from the Department of Motor Vehicles.

24

that sense it was clearly a fruit of the poisonous tree.

25

So in

It was only until the illegality and the

So in

But even if you look at government as an

Alderson Reporting Company

integrated whole, the prior possession of the -- the

2

records was meaningless, of no value to them, until the

3

illegality when it acquired its meaning.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

Suppose the police

5

following Mr. Tolentino had noted down his license

6

plate, and then got this information, not as a result of

7

his driver's license, but from the plate on the car?
MS. SCHWARZ:

8
9

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the -­

the -- the plates of the car would not indicate the -­

10

the driver's license of the driver, and in this case Mr.

11

Tolentino -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12
13

They might show him as

the owner of the car.
MS. SCHWARZ:

14

The owner of the car.

And I

15

believe in Respondent's brief they indicated that -­

16

that some of the police computers will even show

17

descriptive features or maybe even a picture of the

19

registered owner of the vehicle, so that wouldn't have

20

provided them with cause to pull the car over.

21

But in this case Mr. Tolentino was not the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This -- this goes back to

22

a question Justice Alito asked in a probably more artful

way, but I'm not quite sure what's supposed to happen

4

goes on?
MS. SCHWARZ:

5

Is that what

No, Justice Kennedy, that's

6

not what would happen.

7

They would not allow a -- a person without a proper

license to get back in the car and -- and drive on.

statutes are based on a public safety interest, and so

15

it doesn't -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

But why doesn't the public

safety interest then permit us to use this evidence in

18

order to protect the public safety further by punishing

19

him for -- not driving?
MS. SCHWARZ:

20

I don't see the difference.
Because in order to do that,

21

it would be tantamount to sanctioning a -- a fishing

22

expedition in this case, Justice Kennedy, because it

23

would be allowing the police without reasonable

24

suspicion -­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, why wouldn't you say

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

the same thing about impounding the car?
MS. SCHWARZ:

Because the -- the -- the

3

interests are different and because it's not a forever

4

removal of the Petitioner's right to get the car,

5

whoever the -- the rightful owner is.

6

sure that the Petitioner can't get back in the car and

7

continue driving.

8

least in New York State, the -- if it was the

9

Petitioner's, they would have to show proof that they

It's just making

In order to get the vehicle back, at

10

had a valid license; and if it wasn't his vehicle, then

11

the other -- the true owner would have to get -- provide

12

proper credentials to establish that they could take the

13

-- the vehicle into their possession; and also they

14

would have to have proof that the Petitioner himself had

15

cleared up his record or get some sort of a -- a release

16

from the court or from the district attorney's office.

17

So the whole purpose of that impoundment statute is for

18

public safety.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't understand the

20

answer you gave to Justice Alito.

21

The police stop the car without cause.

22

MS. SCHWARZ:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe I mixed it up.

Uh-huh.
So illegal stop.

And you

24

say as a result of the stop they found out all these

25

things in the records, that he had no license, right?
10

MS. SCHWARZ:

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that shouldn't be

introduced into his trial for driving without a license.

4

MS. SCHWARZ:

Yes.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now the

6

question I had heard put was, suppose after they got

7

this information, they don't arrest him then, but he

8

gets into the car again and starts driving.

9

then they could arrest him?

10

MS. SCHWARZ:

11

Is that right?

stop.

16

as to what you said?

They found out he doesn't have a

I just don't understand it.

MS. SCHWARZ:

17

Did I get you right

Justice Breyer, what I -- what

18

I meant to say is the attenuation doctrine would apply.

19

Now, if the person was -- got back in his car

20

immediately at that scene and started off driving, then

21

I'm not sure that the attenuation doctrine would -­

22

would -- would kick in.
JUSTICE BREYER:

arrest him.

So therefore they couldn't

So what they do is they -- is that right?

Is

that right?

you that they -- they could -­

Because?

Because of the statutory

rights, the Court -- because they now know that he has

no license to drive, so either the car will -- if

10

And so they go to his house the next
Could

they arrest him then?
MS. SCHWARZ:

11

Justice Kagan, I think the

12

answer would be yes, and the reason why is because if

13

they see him on a subsequent occasion and they're seeing

14

him re-offend, that would attenuate the taint of the

15

16
17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the re-offense -- the

re-offense just cuts off the original taint?
MS. SCHWARZ:

I believe so, yes.

I mean, it

19

would be attenuation analysis, but to me it would be

20

pretty clear-cut that that's how it would resolve.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the only way that

22

the police can prevent an unlicensed driver from driving

All they can do is

Your answer to a number of the questions has

been that -- that have tried to address the issue of

8

what are they supposed to do, since they know they have

somebody who is violating the law, is that, well, they

10

can take away the car.

And I just want to know if

11

that's the only permissible response by the police when

12

they know that the person driving has violated the law.

MS. SCHWARZ:

If the -- if the stop was -­

there were -- I don't think that they could prosecute

that case.

They could -- they couldn't charge him with

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

And the only way to

22

prevent him from reoffending immediately is to impound

the car?

then -- or can the police arrest him right away?

Because if he gets into the car and drives,

Well, again, that would be

attenuation analysis.

But I think that the taint of the

initial illegality would make that a much more difficult

case.

4

again, if there was another person who had authority to

5

take possession of the vehicle, that person could take

the vehicle, the registered owner or someone with

I mean, that would

But the scenario that you are talking about

would be highly unlikely, and it would be almost in bad

MS. SCHWARZ:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- I think now you

have answered, he gets back into the car, drives it

away, they can do nothing because it's too close to when

16

they discovered his record of -- his suspended license.
How much of an interval must there be?

do you mean by attenuation doctrine?

19

MS. SCHWARZ:

What

Well, that would be -­

20

attenuation would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis,

Justice Ginsburg, but I would think if, even an hour

later, if the Petitioner brazenly drove by those same

23

officers, you know, thumbing his nose at them, hi, that

24

would be -- attenuation analysis would apply at that

25

point.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because you could say that

2

if he got back in the car right after the stop, if the

3

police for some reason did not impound the car and he

4

got back in the car, that's another offense, and so by

5

your theory, then they could properly arrest him and use

6

all of this knowledge in a prosecution?
MS. SCHWARZ:

7

And a court very well -- very

8

well may agree with you on that.

My only qualm with

9

that is that when the officers illegally find out that

10

he has a suspended license and then to let him get back

11

in and immediately arrest him, it's sort of in bad

12

faith.
JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Well, what -- what is that

14

word, the "bad faith"?

I take it your rule is identical

15

if when they wrongly stop the car, they look up the

16

records, the records say he has no license, and in

17

addition, he's wanted on 17 drug warrants and for 3

Well, the -- the warrants are
17

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MS. SCHWARZ:

Why?

-- because of the Ker-Frisbie

4

doctrine.

The warrants for -- for other cases are a

5

method by which the court brings the body of the

6

defendant to court.

And so there is -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

So if, in fact, a policeman

8

stops a person without cause and learns as a result of

9

that that there are many warrants outstanding against

10

him, he then can arrest the person, and -- but can he

11

introduce those warrants into court as evidence or

12

whatever if it's relevant?
MS. SCHWARZ:

13

in.

Absolutely, he can bring them

But the warrants are not evidentiary.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose the way that the

16

policeman stops the person and gets the information

17

illegally is he takes an axe and breaks into the house,

18

the policeman, and thereby -- what I'm showing -- I just

19

think this case has lots of implications, and I'm

20

looking for a rule here that's going to work in a lot of

21

different situations.

to violate the Fourth Amendment, and not only -­

be at play and would be litigated.

the defendant and the DMV records are both suppressible

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

The observations of

But that's not the argument

you seem to be making.

You want to suppress the

allow an exception to that only if there was

matters that are in a government record, however you can

suppress observations by the police on the scene that

flow directly from the illegal stop?

MS. SCHWARZ:

that both of those items are properly suppressible.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought there was some

2

rule about not being able to suppress a person's

identity?

4

you going after the DMV record; you should go after the

5

police identification of Joe Smith or whoever.

6

thought there was some rule that says the identity of

7

the person is not suppressible.

8

You've been asked a couple of times why are

MS. SCHWARZ:

I

Am I wrong about that?

That -- that is a restatement

9

of the Ker-Frisbie doctrine, that essentially says that

10

a person cannot suppress himself, his body, in order to

11

defeat the jurisdiction of the court.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so how does that fit

13

with your earlier answers that his identity here could

14

be suppressed?

15

you say that you can suppress his identity from

16

information they gained after the stop when they saw

17

him, why couldn't they say, well, we saw this man before

18

we stopped him?

19

And then I'll ask a second question.

MS. SCHWARZ:

If

There's -- there's a

20

distinction between the identity and the elicitation of

21

his name, and the elicitation of his name which led to

22

the DMV records.

That's not the identity.

I mean,

2

4

going to get a conviction.

It's -- it's not

But when you say John Smith was driving the

5
6

car, then you are eliciting testimony from the officer

7

concerning information he would not have had but for the

8

stop, that John Smith was driving the car, right?
MS. SCHWARZ:

9

Well, this Court has always

10

defined evidentiary fruit as something that -- of

11

evidentiary value which the public authorities have

12

caused an arrested person to yield to them during an

13

illegal detention, and that's from the Davis case.

14

the DMV records would fit that definition of evidentiary

15

fruit.

16

And

And in this case, because it is the classic

17

situation where there's sufficient causal connection

18

between the Fourth Amendment violation and the

19

subsequent discovery of the evidence to justify

20

suppression, there's no reason not to apply the

21

exclusionary rule here, and in fact, it meets all the

22

definition of the sort of case where there would be very

23

high level of deterrence as a result of applying the

exclusionary rule.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAITLIN J. HALLIGAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HALLIGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to start with your question,

10

Justice Breyer, about what the ruling below was and

11

what's at stake in this case.

12

held was quite narrow.

13

page 105a of the appendix:

14

15

doctrine when the only link between improper police

16

activity and the disputed evidence is that the police

learned the defendant's name."

18

What the court of appeals

It said -- and I'm reading from
"We merely hold that a

19

fact that all that was elicited here is the name of the

20

defendant, and that's appropriate.

citizens, and that's because the officer -­

your name?

2

MS. HALLIGAN:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there's -- there's

4

been no doubt here that it was a stop without suspicion.

5

That's been presumed.

6

what I just asked you -­

So how is that different from

MS. HALLIGAN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

Because -­
That they took a person

randomly, detained them without any suspicion, and said

Are you suggesting that that's okay?

MS. HALLIGAN:

No, I'm not.

The legality of

12

the stop here has not been adjudicated.

13

presuming that the police acted illegally.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

We are

I am presuming.

I know

that there's counter-arguments to that.
MS. HALLIGAN:

We are not at all challenging

17

this Court's decisions, certainly not Delaware v. Prouse

18

or any others, which hold that the police may not stop

19

someone without basis and may not certainly enforce the

20

sort of statute that was at issue in Hiibel without some

21

basis for asking for identification.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So isn't the eliciting

23

of the name as a result of an unlawful stop something

24

that could be suppressed?

25

MS. HALLIGAN:

It should not be subject to
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suppression, and that's a distinct question from whether

2

or not there was a constitutional violation that

3

occurred in the stop and the asking of the name.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The name is different

5

than the person, the body of the person, which has to do

6

with the Court's jurisdiction.

7

any different than a wallet that's in somebody's pocket

8

or a shirt or a hat, whatever is on the person?

9

a name not subject to suppression?

10

But why isn't the name

Why is

15

securing a name is never suppressible.

We're not taking issue

What we are saying is that where all that is

elicited is the name, it's not appropriate to apply the

exclusionary rule, which is a very distinct question.

MS. HALLIGAN:

In your hypothetical I'm not

2

sure whether there would be any Fifth Amendment issues

3

that would be at play, but -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

No, they find out this

5

person's alias as the result of the illegal search, and

6

that allows them to build a substantial criminal case.
MS. HALLIGAN:

7

If all that is obtained is

8

the name, then the exclusionary rule should not be

9

applied.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10
11

says:

I am John Smith.

That's Keyser Soze.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

would not be suppressible?

15

So there's a diary, and it

The diary itself, the

document would be suppressible.

that is subject to suppression, in any event.

JUSTICE ALITO:

The knowledge that that

Suppose that when -- when

21

the police stopped this particular car, they saw that

22

Mr. Tolentino was smoking marijuana or snorting cocaine

23

or drinking from a bottle of alcohol or he had somebody

24

tied up, bound and gagged on the back seat of the car.

25

Now, all of those things would clearly be the fruit -­
28
Alderson Reporting Company

all those observations would clearly be the fruit of the

2

allegedly illegal stop, right?

3

MS. HALLIGAN:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

That's correct, and -­
Even though they were in

plain view, they would all be suppressed, right?

6

MS. HALLIGAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you're saying that the

8

observation that Mr. Tolentino is at the wheel of the

9

car, that is not suppressed?
MS. HALLIGAN:

10

I would like to distinguish

11

between the observation of the person driving the car,

12

to the extent that you might have a case in which that

13

observation is made after the stop as opposed to before

14

the stop; that's a different and distinct question.

15

It's not presented in the case that's before the Court

16

right now -- from the question of whether the

17

exclusionary rule should be applied when only the name

18

is elicited.

19

The observations, it may be as -- as Justice

20

Ginsburg suggested that under Crews, because the

21

physiognomy of a person -- five justices determined

22

there the appearance is not something that's subject to

23

suppression, the police officer's observation that it

24

was in fact this individual who looks like this driving

25

the car would not be subject to suppression, either.

Alderson Reporting Company

-- your -- your friend said

19

MS. HALLIGAN:

What -- what happened to it?
What happened is this:

In

20

the suppression motion initially, the defendant sought

21

to suppress a number of things, including the

22

observations of the police.

23

not rule specifically on that aspect of the suppression

24

motion.

25

a suppression hearing on the statement that the

The trial court judge did

The trial court judge said that there would be

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defendant made, but there would not be a suppression

2

hearing with regard to the DMV records because DMV

3

records were not subject to suppression.

4

At that point the defendant pled guilty, and

5

so by operation of State law -- because first of all

6

there was not a ruling specifically on the question of

7

observations and the defendant failed to bring that to

8

the trial court judge's attention, and because the

9

guilty plea was taken, and you can only appeal when you

10

plead guilty on a suppression motion where there's a

11

final order, there's no final order on the observation.

12

That's out of the case, that would be our position.

13

You could have a subsequent case where that

14

question would be presented if, in fact, an officer does

15

not see a defendant until after he approaches the car,

16

and in that case he would have to determine whether or

17

not Crews and the five justices, which says the

18

physiognomy of the defendant is not subject to

19

suppression, controls and therefore allows the

20

observations to come in; but it's not presented here.

position that they can do anything in terms of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

I know -- I know it

raises a different question, but you know, you keep

7

saying they're just -- or you know, you're just talking

8

about the name, but names are meaningless in the

abstract.

17

MS. HALLIGAN:

You could, and I think that

18

that's why if the Court was concerned about the

19

potential breadth of that holding, it could narrow it to

20

the use of the name to link to government records.

21

the field, in particular, what an officer is going to

22

look for is records that suggest danger, so for example

23

what the officers have in New York State is they -­

can -- that may be what the officer on the scene is most

2

interested in, of course, but once you get the guy's

3

name you're interested in a lot of things.
MS. HALLIGAN:

4

That's right, and that's

5

because you are in the process of conducting some sort

6

of investigation, and to suppress the knowledge of

7

someone's identity would -- would blink reality.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8
9

Well, they're not

suppressing the knowledge of somebody's identity.

10

that -- what's being suppressed is the evidence of

11

criminal activity that you derive from that.
MS. HALLIGAN:

12

All

I think it's very different

13

than when you have drugs in a car which could clearly be

14

subject to suppression.

15

of all, that's elicited, is the name.

16

is not subject to suppression, nor did the defendant

17

seek to have it suppressed, as the court of appeals

18

observed.

19

If the antecedent piece of evidence is not subject to

20

suppression then there's no poison that can flow from

21

that to contaminate anything like the DMV record.

All that you have here, first
The name itself

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I go back and -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think that that's not

24

right, Ms. Halligan, because the search is the poisonous

25

tree.

Now, it might be that the name can't be
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suppressed, but it still might be that everything that's

2

discovered as a result of knowing the name, which would

3

never be discovered unless the search had taken place,

4

could be suppressible.
MS. HALLIGAN:

5

Two points, Justice Kagan.

6

believe, first of all, that if the name is not

7

suppressed and then something flows from the name, I

8

don't think that you can skip that step and then

9

suppress something that comes further down the road.

10

But, secondly, the fact that these records were already

11

in the government's possession is precisely what takes

12

this outside the scope of the fruits doctrine.

13

fruits -- fruits doctrine has been held to apply

14

repeatedly in cases where the evidence is in some sense

the product of the illegal government activity.

4

Yes.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the -- what is Mr.

6

Tolentino supposed to do at that point to preserve the

7

issue of the suppression of a police officer's

8

observation?
MS. HALLIGAN:

9

To preserve the issue, Mr.

10

Tolentino should have raised that fact to the judge,

11

should have pointed it out pursuant to CPLR 71070,

12

subsection (2).

13

when that happens, that is the obligation of the

14

defendant and the defendant cannot raise the issue on

15

appeal if it's not brought to the attention of the trial

16

court judge at that point.

17

guilty.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

before you finish, you -- you said a name is not

6

started out by saying the observation of the person that

7

dropped out of this case, so we're talking only about

8

records, but the extraction of a name, you say that's

9

not suppressible, even though it was unlawfully

10

extracted because there were no reasonable suspicions

11

that this person did anything wrong?

12

MR. SHAH:

Yes -- yes, Your Honor, we would

13

say that a name is different, that it's not

14

suppressible, and we would rely on the language this

15

Court used in Lopez-Mendoza, which says the respondent's

16

body or identity is never suppressible, even if it's

17

obtained as a result of an illegal search, seizure or

18

interrogation.

19

We think name is -- is part and parcel of a

20

defendant's identity, and that it has a special status

21

within -- within the criminal justice system.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Shah, how would you

23

think about this problem?

Suppose the police start

24

stopping people and rather than asking for your name,

25

they take a blood sample, they prick your finger, and
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

then they take that blood and they look in their very

2

extensive DNA databases, and they discover, oh, this is

3

a guy who, you know, did these various terrible things,

4

and start building cases.

5

MR. SHAH:

Would that be all right?

Your Honor, I think other types

6

of biometric evidence that you suggest, for example, of

7

blood evidence, might well implicate competing

8

considerations that would dictate a different result.

9

And let me suggest a couple of the competing

10

considerations, why I think the Court doesn't need to

11

reach so far and say all sorts of biometric information

12

should be treated the same.

13

For -- for one -- for one thing, things like

14

a name or even a fingerprint, this Court has said is not

15

a separate Fourth Amendment event to acquire that.

16

example, once someone is detained, it's not also a

17

search to ask for their name or to take a fingerprint.

18

However, in your example, pricking someone

For

19

with a needle to obtain their blood would be a separate

20

Fourth Amendment event, because that would be a separate

21

invasion of their -- of their bodily integrity, privacy,

22

and that might warrant different considerations, since

23

there are two violations there.

24

for greater deterrent.

25

There might be a need

I think the other sort of consideration that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

might be implicated in -- in that type of hypothetical

2

is that evidence unlike a name or fingerprint, DNA

3

evidence, for example, that you suggest, might provide

4

competing considerations in the sense that it could lead

5

to other types of information that not -- that may not

6

be relevant to the criminal justice system, medical

7

records, genetic information.

8

other competing considerations that might require a

9

different balance in the end.

It may pose a specter of

I think it would be premature for this Court

10
11

to weigh in one way or another as to whether that would

12

be appropriate.

13

would want time to -- to -- to -- we would want that to

14

play out and see -- and see what the consequences were.

15

So I don't think the Court has to go that far.

16

the Court can limit it, as in this case, to name,

17

fingerprints and other traditionally -- other

18

information traditionally used to identify a defendant.

sufficient causal relationship between the Fourth

3

Amendment violation and the later discovery of evidence,

this Court has expressed continued allegiance to this

rule.

are suppressible fruit is it fits that classic

definition.

So in this case the reason why the DMV records

Why are the observations suppressible when

the identity isn't?

That's another issue that was

10

raised.

The observations are -- again, they fit the

11

definition whereas the identity does -- does not fit

12

that.

13

from being suppressible, but the elicitation of his name

14

is something entirely separate.

15

the Crews case a majority of the Court said that a -- a

16

person could not suppress their person or their face

17

from being in court; five of the justices said that; but

18

five justices said that the in-court identification

19

could under certain circumstances be suppressible.

20

they drew a distinction between the person's body being

21

brought into court, which is not suppressible because of

22

the Ker-Frisbie rule, and then the evidentiary use of

23

the identity, the fact that the five of the justices

24

said that in certain circumstances not applicable in

25

that case, the in-court identification could be

The Ker-Frisbie rule prevents a person himself

So in other word, in

53
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suppressible shows the distinction.

And that's the

2

distinction that has been -- is confusing about this

3

case, because the elicitation of his name is what led to

4

the DMV records.

5

elicitation of the name was not sufficient or was

6

somehow related to Ker-Frisbie and could not be

7

suppressible, the DMV records directly flow from the

8

Fourth Amendment violation here, from the Prouse

9

violation.

But even if this Court found that the

And so it really doesn't really matter.

10

Especially in light of the decision in Whren

11

to remove subjective motivations from the determinations

12

of constitutional reasonableness in car stops, it's

13

essential to enforce what remains of motorists' core

14

Fourth Amendment rights; and the Whren standards just

15

must be enforced; otherwise these core Fourth Amendment

16

values will be undermined and police will be left free

17

to stop people on the roads with no objective basis and

18

check their ID and status and do fishing expeditions

19

into this sea of data that will be linked to the police

20

computers; and this would violate Prouse and Brown and

21

Hiibel.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I suppose would

23

subject the police officers to liability, though, right?

24

In civil actions?

25

MS. SCHWARZ:

Well, again, this is a classic
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case where there's a clear relationship, a causal

2

relationship, so this is the sort of case where this

3

Court has continued allegiance to application of the

4

exclusionary rule where the exclusionary rule is very

5

strong; and so why would the Court say that the second

6

sister of the exclusionary rule, in this circumstance

7

where there's sufficiently deliberate, that exclusion

8

would be meaningful and sufficiently culpable, that the

9

evidence would be -- that application of the rule would

10

be worth the cost?

In this situation there's no reason

11

to abandon the exclusionary rule.

And if you're not, in

18

what ways is it tied to the question presented about

19

identity, which is the issue you sought cert on?

20

MS. SCHWARZ:

Right.

I -- I have no qualms

21

in my adversary explaining that the question presented

22

was limited because of the procedure, of the way the

23

trial court's decision was made.

24

remanded the case, the question of whether the

25

observations were suppressible would be very much at

However if this Court

play.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why?

Because when he

3

entered a guilty plea, you reserved only the question

4

concerning the motor vehicle records; you didn't reserve

5

any other questions.

6

MS. SCHWARZ:

Well, but at the suppression

7

hearing, the -- the court would be free to consider all

8

of the suppressible fruit, including the -- the

9

statement that was made and the observations and also

10

the DMV records.

11

Thank you.
