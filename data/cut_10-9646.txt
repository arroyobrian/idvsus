CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 10-9646, Miller v. Alabama.
Mr. Stevenson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. STEVENSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In Graham v. Florida, this Court recognized

11

that children are inherently characterized by internal

12

attributes and external circumstances that preclude a

13

finding of a degree of culpability that would make a

14

sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of

15

parole constitutionally permissible under the Court's

16

Eighth Amendment excessiveness analysis.

17

While the issue in Graham involved juveniles

18

that were convicted of non-homicide offenses, these

19

deficits in maturity and judgment and decision-making are

20

not crime-specific.

21

the same barriers that this Court has found to be

22

constitutionally relevant before imposition of a

23

sentence of life imprisonment without parole or the

24

death penalty.

25

All children are encumbered with

In fact, in Roper, this Court acknowledged
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that these differences between children and adults exist

2

even in the cases involving the most aggravated murders.

3

These deficits, these differences, are even more

4

pronounced in young children.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stevenson, but in

6

Roper, the Court also made the point -- when it ruled

7

out the death penalty, it said, "To the extent the

8

juvenile death penalty might have residual deterrent

9

effect, it is worth noting that the punishment of life

10

imprisonment without the possibility of parole is itself

11

a severe sanction."

12

So, the Court in Roper seemed to be

13

anticipating this case and suggesting that -- that it

14

was all right, it was constitutional.

15

MR. STEVENSON:

There's no question, Justice

16

Ginsburg, that the -- the default sentence in Roper was

17

life imprisonment without parole, but we actually think

18

that, specifically with regard to that provision, there

19

is no greater deterrent effect, and these deficits, that

20

these problems that children experience, lend themselves

21

to an analysis that is subject when the punishment is

22

life imprisonment without parole.

MR. STEVENSON:

What the Court held in -- in

Graham --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you know, once --

4

once you depart from the principle that we've enunciated

5

that death is different, why is life without parole

6

categorically different from 60 years or 70 years or --

7

you know, you'd be back here next term with a 60-year

8

sentence?

9

MR. STEVENSON:

Justice Scalia, I think

10

you're absolutely right, that there is a point at which

11

a term-of-year sentence could constitute the same kind

12

of judgment --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. STEVENSON:

15

Okay.
-- as life imprisonment

without parole.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. STEVENSON:

Good.
But there is a distinction

18

obviously between life imprisonment without parole and

19

any other term sentence.

20

instances, if the sentence is not too extreme, do permit

21

the possibility of release.

22

Graham is not that the State forfeits the ability to

23

incarcerate for life --

ordered in the Graham context.

12

line, but I think 50 years would actually be on the

13

other side of a meaningful possibility of release.

14

would be sort of a cynical reaction, if this Court were

15

to say we ban life without parole for these kinds of

16

offenders, it would be somewhat problematic to suggest

17

that we're going to get as close to death as possible

18

and then facilitate some kind of review.

19

we're interested in --

MR. STEVENSON:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would that satisfy you if

2

the -- if it were not a mandatory term and it was left

3

to the trier, and you could put in all the mitigating

4

circumstances?

5

MR. STEVENSON:

That would not satisfy me,

6

Justice Ginsburg, for all the reasons that this Court

7

acknowledged in Graham, that -- that the problem with

8

many of these crimes is that the offense itself can

9

overwhelm all of these mitigating factors, all of these

10

aspects of juvenile decision-making that we think are

11

constitutionally permissible.

12

we still can't make good judgments about whether a

13

child -- whether these characteristics are transitory or

14

permanent.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The other problem is that

So, you're saying it would

16

be unprincipled for us to say -- or at least unsupported

17

for us to say -- that the sentence cannot be mandatory,

18

but that in some cases, it might still be imposed.

19

MR. STEVENSON:

I think it would be

20

principled to -- to kind of strike down mandatory

21

sentences, but I think constitutionally what this Court

22

has recognized in Roper and in Graham, that it would be

23

a -- a mistake to equate kids with adults.

24

have the ability to make those judgments even if we

25

create a different kind of process.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

table, then you leave us with nothing but saying that

the sentence is never permitted or that it's always

5

permitted.

6

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I -- I don't mean to

7

take it off the table; I just mean to argue, as we did

8

previously, that a categorical ban would be consistent

9

with the Court’s understanding about child status and

10

development.

11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you could write the

opinion for us, what would you hold?

13

MR. STEVENSON:

I would hold that children

14

are categorically prohibited from being subjected to

15

sentences --

16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's -- what's the

definition of a child for that purpose?

18

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, we presented data in

19

this case that would exclude a youth 14 and younger.

20

State that has set a minimum age for life without parole

21

has set it beneath the age of 15, other than one.

22

so, we -- we would make that holding.

23

would be --

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

I do think it

So, you -- you would hold

you can't -- there cannot be a sentence of life
9

Alderson Reporting Company

No

1

imprisonment without parole for anyone under 15, but for

2

anybody over 15, it would be permissible.

3

MR. STEVENSON:

No, I would also hold, Your

4

Honor, that a mandatory sentence for that cohort would

5

also be in violation of this Eighth Amendment principle.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Or you could say you

7

reserve that question for another day.

8

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I think that the

9

problem, Justice Ginsburg, is -- is that these cases

10

with the mandatory sentencing aspects to them create

11

kind of a data issue that this Court has usually relied

12

on to kind of generate an interest.

13

I think right now we know that excluding

14

considerations of age and character in a sentencing

15

determination of life imprisonment without parole is

16

problematic.

17
18
19

The Court in --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, can you tell us where the

age line needs to be drawn for constitutional purposes?
MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I would draw it at 18,

20

Justice Alito, because we've done that previously; we've

21

done that consistently.

22
23

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's where you think the

logic of your argument leads.

24

MR. STEVENSON:

That's exactly right.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you would say that a

1

17 -- a person of 17 years and 10 months, 11 months, who

2

commits the worst possible string of offenses still --

3

and demonstrates great maturity -- still cannot be

4

sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.

5

MR. STEVENSON:

That's right, for the same

6

reasons that we made that determination in Graham and

7

that the Court made that determination in Roper.

8

understand that there are some tensions when we draw

9

those kinds of lines --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I thought

write the opinion to do the bifurcated rule?

modified ban above an age, and how do you deal with

Harmelin with respect to the second part of your rule?

MR. STEVENSON:

It's a challenge, and I --

8

and I concede that.

But I -- and so, the first part of

9

my answer would be that I think the easier rule to write

10

would be that there is a categorical ban on all life

11

without parole sentences for all children up until the

12

age of 18, acknowledging --

22

talked about what that -- what the punishment should be.

23

And the reason why I say that, Justice Alito, is that in

many of these States, there's no minimum age for trying

25

a child as an adult.

They've said that some children of

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I don't really

understand this argument.

3

have enacted these laws, but they don't realize that,

4

under these laws, a -- a person under the age of 18 may

5

be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for --

6

for murder.

7

You mean the legislatures

They don't understand that?
MR. STEVENSON:

They -- they have not

8

considered that or adopted or endorsed it, would be more

9

accurate.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's difficult because

11

the statistics show there are 2300 prisoners now under

12

sentence of -- with life without parole for juvenile

13

murders and they're -- that were committed under 18;

14

2300 nationwide.

15

MR. STEVENSON:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That -- that's correct.
So, it's very difficult to

17

assess your answer to Justice Alito that, oh, the

18

legislatures don't know about this.

19

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, in -- that answer --

20

that number, Your Honor, is partly rooted in the fact

that these sentences are mandatory.

MR. STEVENSON:

And when they -- when you

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- and they are not aware of

of my argument, Justice Alito, is that the States that

4

except for one have set it at 18 --

5

That's my primary

Thirteen States have done it; all of them

JUSTICE ALITO:

And you think there's a

6

difference between the State that says expressly a

7

juvenile below a certain age may be sentenced to life

8

imprisonment without parole and a State that says that

9

if a person is convicted of capital murder, that

10

sentence may be imposed and, in another -- in another

11

provision, says that juveniles may be transferred for

12

prosecution as adults.

13

MR. STEVENSON:

I --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's a difference between

MR. STEVENSON:

There is.

15

those two?

16

And that's

17

because the -- the transfer question, which is what

18

informs whether children can be subject to these

19

sentences or not, is a very different question.

question about whether the juvenile system that may

States where there's no minimum age for trying children

15

as adults.

16

And to the extent that the State hasn't

That means in that State, a 10-year-old

child would arguably have been contemplated by the

18

legislature to be an appropriate person for life without

19

parole, or an 8-year-old child and a 6-year-old child,

20

and I think that asks too much of these statutes.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, there is no

22

question that you're dealing with a much smaller

23

universe of children sentenced to life without parole

24

who are 14 and under.

25

because so few of them commit the crimes.

There's an argument that that's

17

But putting

that aside, the universe is rather small.

2

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- the bifurcated theory

that you proffered, tell me how we get around Harmelin.

15

How would you write that decision?

16

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

Well, I think that,

17

first of all, what this Court has relied on when it has

18

looked at these numbers, what it has been trying to

19

figure out, are these objective indicia of society's

20

standards, its mores, its decency meter, if you will.

21

And we've looked at these numbers to inform us, are

22

these sentences that are -- that are consistent with

23

evolving standards of decency, or are they now beyond a

24

maturing society?

25

some measures.

And we've always found in these data

18

In the death penalty context, we've looked

2

at that in the Roper area, in the Atkins area, and we've

could do it in these death penalty cases is that, unlike

5

the cases here, the death penalty determination is

6

discretionary.

7

and evaluate a range of mitigating circumstances and

8

facts, including age, that help us assess whether the

9

determination that death is the appropriate punishment

10

The reason why we

means something in a society still trying to evolve.

11

Here that's not true.

The majority of these

sentences are mandatory.

13

about what the Constitution requires if it --

14

So, the number tells us less

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stevenson, do you have

15

statistics about how many of these sentences are imposed

16

on under 18-year-olds in non-mandatory States?

17

MR. STEVENSON:

The -- the data on the

18

larger population is not as precise, Justice Kagan, as

19

it is with our younger population, but the majority of

20

States are mandatory States, and the estimates are about

21

that 85 percent of those sentences are mandatory

22

sentences.

23

populations -- Michigan, Pennsylvania -- these

24

States have mandatory regimes.

25

Certainly, the States that have the largest

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, you think it would be

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

true, going up to age 18, that 80-plus percent are

2

imposed in States that have mandatory systems?

3

MR. STEVENSON:

That -- that's correct.

4

And, in fact, the overwhelming majority of those

5

sentences come from a handful of States where there is

6

very little discretion to impose a sentence other than

7

life imprisonment without parole.

8

And because of that feature, I don't think,

9

Justice Sotomayor, that the -- that the reliance on the

10

number is quite as powerful here as it has been in the

11

death penalty context, where that number represented a

12

very communal judgment with a lot of factors.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There wasn't a majority

14

in theory in Harmelin, and -- but at least three

15

Justices spoke about a gross disproportionality.

16

MR. STEVENSON:

Right.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it your views that

18

life -- a mandatory life without parole for someone like

19

a juvenile is grossly disproportionate?

20

MR. STEVENSON:

It is, for the very reasons

21

that the Court articulates in both Roper and Graham.

22

We're not arguing that life without parole is

23

disproportionate to the crime of aggravated murder.

24

We're arguing that the status of children, with all of

25

the deficits that childhood status creates, makes that

That's the reason why in Graham this Court

with this sentence of life imprisonment without parole

is that it actually bans and shields this population

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any reason,

11

just -- I realize it's speculation, but wouldn't you

12

think prosecutors would view that as a particularly

13

attractive offer to someone who's young in the sense

14

that they may regard the sentence as extraordinary

15

themselves, that it may be particularly attractive to

someone who's young in a way that it wouldn't be a

attractive as it is to a 15-year-old?

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, they might.

And I

20

would concede, Your Honor, that this population is kind

21

of less equipped to make determinations about whether to

take a plea or whether to not take a plea than an adult.

12

MR. STEVENSON:

And my point would be that it -- this younger population

7

is going to be disadvantaged in managing this aspect of

8

the process that I think is quite important when the

9

Court is trying to consider whether there should be a

10

categorical ban or something less than a categorical

11

ban.

12

And, Justice Kennedy, I don't mean to

13

suggest that the Court cannot, consistent with its

14

precedents, make a categorical ban under 17.

15

don't mean to suggest that if the Court can't do that,

16

that there aren't ways of reconciling the precedents,

17

with drawing a line at 15 and striking down mandatory

18

life without parole.

19

we've stated, that in these circumstances it's better to

20

have a sentence where you can make a judgment about

21

rehabilitation and public safety later in life.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. NEIMAN, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NEIMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Imposing life without parole sentences on

14

aggravated murder offenders like Evan Miller is in line

15

with the national consensus, is morally justified, and

16

is consistent with legitimate penological goals.

17

I'd like to touch on all three of those

18

points at some juncture today if I can, but I'd like to

19

start if I can with the conversation Mr. Stevenson was

20

having with a few of the Justices about the national

21

consensus issue in this case and more particularly what

22

we can infer about the judgment of legislatures and

23

ultimately the people, based on the statutes we have in

24

this case and the very different set of circumstances

25

we're looking at here than the circumstances the Court
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was looking at in Graham.

2

Exhibit A on that front is the fact that out

3

of the 39 States or jurisdictions that allow this

4

sentence, as Mr. Stevens has indicated -- or Mr.

5

Stevenson has indicated, a good chunk of them, 27 in

6

all, make the sentence the minimum sentence under the

7

statute.

8

us a little bit about the retributive goals that the

9

legislatures were trying to achieve through these

10

statutes, but it also --

11
12
13

That's an important fact both because it tells

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Life without parole is the

minimum?
MR. NEIMAN:

Life without parole is the

14

minimum sentence for anyone who commits an aggravated

15

murder or at least certain kinds of aggravated murders

16

in 27 of those jurisdictions.

17

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's also -- that's also

the maximum because there could be no death penalty.
MR. NEIMAN:

For a juvenile, yes, Justice

20

Kennedy, that's correct.

And effectively the message

21

that the legislatures are sending is that with respect

22

to aggravated murders, the worst of the worst kinds of

23

murders, there are effectively two sentences.

24

either the death penalty or there is some sort of

mitigating circumstance.

MR. NEIMAN:

Correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, you think it's

MR. NEIMAN:

According to Mr. Stevenson's

5

statistics, it's about 90 percent of the cohort that

6

comes from the mandatory jurisdiction.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's -- all right.

8

Say it's about 70 or 71, and I remember reading a statistic

9

somewhere where they managed to count up the number of

10

possibilities, i.e., serious murders committed by those

11

under 15 over 50 years or some long number of years, and

12

it was somewhere in the 70,000s, was it?

13

20,000s?

14

Or

What was it?
MR. NEIMAN:

Your Honor, the statistics I

15

have seen that Mr. Stevenson cited in his reply brief

16

had 7,500 --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. NEIMAN:

Seventy-five hundred?

-- as the number of arrests of

19

persons under the age of 15 for committing homicide or

20

non-negligent manslaughter.

about reasonable.

MR. NEIMAN:

Your Honor, as Graham

indicated, that denominator is crucial.

But the 7500

number cannot be the appropriate denominator for

7

determining whether actual sentencing practices indicate

a national consensus against this practice.

can't execute someone who hasn't killed, intended to

20

kill, or was reckless in killing.

21

more in the Jackson case, because I think it's an issue

22

there.

23

regrettable, there are different kinds of murder.

24

That's why some people are subject to the death penalty

and others are not.

But although all murder is heinous and

And I do see a world of difference

33

Alderson Reporting Company

2

vis-à-vis the individual defendants' personal liability.

3

So, assuming there are different kinds of --

4

of killings, of murder, should we be looking at the

5

Enmund/Tison line at all?

6

its application to juveniles in a different way?

7

Enmund/Tison basically, okay, felony murder if you know

8

that there's a gun involved, but should that line be the

9

same for juveniles?

Should we be talking about
Being

And, if so, then how do you go back to

11

justifying, as Justice Breyer spoke about, the mandatory

12

nature of life imprisonment without parole, given that

13

not every juvenile is equal and not every murder is

14

equal with respect to them?

15

MR. NEIMAN:

Justice Sotomayor, the clearest

16

line the Court could draw on this front would be the

17

line that the Court initially set out in Graham as

18

between homicide and non-homicide offenses.

19

there would be some question about whether an

20

Enmund-type felony murder counts as a homicide offense

21

or not, but my suggestion is that it would, at least if

22

the Court is looking for a clear line that wouldn't

23

undermine too much of what the Court set out in Graham

24

in terms of clearly distinguishing between homicide and

25

non-homicide offenders.
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Perhaps

Official

1

Nonetheless, I certainly agree that there

2

are fundamental differences between certain kinds of

3

murders, and I think that judgment is reflected in the

4

legislation we have in at least 27 of these States,

5

where aggravated murder in the very -- in the very least

6

carries with it a life without parole sentence for any

7

defendant regardless of the mitigating circumstances or

8

the like.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's not an

10

individual legislative determination.

11

just a --

12

MR. NEIMAN:

That's -- that's

It is a legislative

13

determination that aggravated murder as a class of

14

offenses is so contrary to society's values and so

15

contrary to the dignity that we assume that every victim

16

ought to be afforded, that life without parole is the

17

appropriate sentence.
So, I think there is a -- there is an

18
19

inference to be made there about the legislative

20

judgment, particularly because the sentence is a minimum

21

one.

22

Justice Sotomayor, from Harmelin makes this point --

23

point quite vividly.

The three-Justice concurrence you mentioned,

24

In Solem v. Helm, the Court had struck down

25

a sentence under the gross disproportionality analysis,
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and the Harmelin concurrence indicated that the Court

2

was a little more comfortable doing that, because the

3

sentence in that case was above the minimum and, thus,

4

did not reflect the judgment of the legislature.
But when we're talking about the minimum

5
6

sentence, it's fair to infer that that's the sentence

7

that the legislature thought as a class, in terms of a

8

class of offenses, that would be the minimum appropriate

9

sentence for that particular crime.

10

Now,

Justice Breyer -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

Counsel, when you –

12

it's a little confusing to me, but when you refer to

13

"minimum," I assume that was because of the statutes prior

14

to Graham had death as one of the other options, that that

15

is no longer an option.

16

awkward to refer to it as minimum when it's also the

17

maximum.

18
19
20

MR. NEIMAN:

So, it's -- it's a little

That's correct,

Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you have --

21

when an individual is prosecuted for an aggravated

22

murder that carries this sentence, is it typical to also

23

charge lesser included offenses?

24

MR. NEIMAN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and in

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

general, what is the distinction between exposure to

2

the -- the maximum crime and a lesser included crime?

3

In other words, what is the difference between

4

aggravated murder and manslaughter?

5

on the state of mind, doesn't it?

6
7

MR. NEIMAN:

That's correct,

Mr. Chief Justice.

8
9

It typically turns

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, is there any

reason to think that juries in a case where they have

10

the option for lesser included offenses might be

11

concerned in light of the age of the defendant about

12

whether or not the requisite intent was formed?

13

It seems to me that some of the issues that

14

we've suggested justify a different treatment of

15

juveniles have to do with mental development, and those

16

same issues would be taken into account by a jury in

17

considering which of a list of offenses the juvenile

18

should be convicted of.

19

MR. NEIMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, it's

20

certainly within the realm of reason and possibility

21

for --

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

in Miller's case?

24

that was charged?

25

Was it -- was it a factor

Was there a lesser -- lesser offense

MR. NEIMAN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there
37


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were lesser included charges of at least felony murder,

2

which has a very different intent type element to it.

3

But Miller, at least with respect to the charge on the

4

capital murder committed in the course of arson, which

5

is an intentional murder, was found guilty by the jury

6

on that charge.

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He was -- the -- there

was also a felony murder charge in the Miller case?

9

MR. NEIMAN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there

10

were two felony murder charges, one as to the robbery in

11

the case and one as to the arson in the case.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -- so, it may not be

13

realistic to speak of mandatory life without parole.

14

It's only mandatory if the youth is convicted of the

15

highest charge brought, but it remains within the power

16

of the jury, in light of the youth, to convict him of a

17

-- of a lesser offense which would not produce mandatory

life imprisonment without parole.

12

Mr. Neiman, I am wondering if we

can go back to the issue that Justice Breyer left on the

14

table, and this doesn't have much to do with how many

15

States do what, but instead just to say that in the

16

death penalty context, we've insisted on individualized

17

sentencing.

18

juveniles who were sentenced to life without parole to

19

people who -- to adults who were sentenced to death and

20

said that those two should be treated equivalently.

21

And in Graham, of course, we equated

suggest that the rules we have in the death penalty

24

to juveniles who are sentenced to life without parole?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

1

Regardless of, like, how

2

many States do what and how many times this happened,

3

but just, you know, two facts:

4

in the death penalty context, and we've equated the

5

death penalty context to juveniles without life --

6

parole in Graham.
MR. NEIMAN:

7

We've insisted on this

Justice Kagan, the answer on

8

that front, I think, is that Harmelin effectively sets a

9

bright line here such that individualized sentencing is

10

only required in a -- in a death penalty case.

11

does so --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And it

Yes, but of course Harmelin is

13

pre-Graham, and in Graham we equated these two things,

14

adults sentenced to death and juveniles sentenced to

15

life without parole.

16

MR. NEIMAN:

Well, the reason why Harmelin

17

drew that line and, I guess more to the point, the

18

reason why Woodson v. North Carolina and Lockett v. Ohio

19

held that individualized sentencing was required in the

20

death penalty context was not because the sentence

21

happened to be the highest sentence that someone could

22

receive, but because the sentence was death.

23

were certain --

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And there

In Graham, didn't the Court

reject the idea of individualized sentencing in which

40

1

youth would be taken into account on a case-by-case

2

basis?

3

MR. NEIMAN:

That's correct, Justice Alito.

4

The States were here jumping up and down asking for that

5

precise result, and we did not get it.

6

why, the result the Court thought was appropriate was

7

rather than allowing the defendant to argue for

8

mitigating circumstances and for the State to respond

9

with aggravating circumstances in one of these cases,

And the reason

10

the answer was for the juvenile to get a mitigation

11

trump card.

12

And in one of these sentencing proceedings,

13

the juvenile would be able to say:

14

that means that I don't get the highest sentence I

15

otherwise would get.

16

as a matter of law.

17

I'm a juvenile, and

I win the sentencing phase as --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the fact that we've said

18

that individualized sentencing was not enough in one

19

context does not suggest that individualized sentencing

20

ought not to be the rule in a different context where

21

there is no categorical bar.

22

MR. NEIMAN:

Justice Kagan, the response on

23

that front, I think, is that the rule from Woodson and

24

Lockett requiring individualized sentencing was one

25

that's specifically tailored to the unique aspects of
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the death penalty, aspects that remain unique,

2

notwithstanding Graham and the rule it imposed with

3

respect to juveniles.

4

But also Woodson and Lockett -- although I

5

realize that the premise of your question is that we

6

should not look at what other States are doing, the

7

premise of Woodson and Lockett was that States had

8

widely rejected mandatory death penalty sentencing, and

9

we know from the legislative record here that States

10

have done quite the contrary when it comes to mandatory

11

life without parole sentencing --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

individualized sentencing.

that it should be individualized, life without parole,

So, if you're -- if

MR. NEIMAN:

That's correct.

In Alabama, if

you're under 14, you can't be transferred out.

7

many other States, at age 13, you can be transferred

even just the number of States.

6

They ask the first

And that disturbs me enough

I'm not sure about it.

But that's why I want to hear your response,

7

because it sounds like we're arguing between whether it

8

should be 13, 12, or 14, in terms of an absolute cutoff.

9

So, how do I approach that?

I'm asking you for help on

10

that one.

I know you have a side in this.

But I say,

11

well, we're talking about 14, and we have all this

12

scientific literature and so forth.

13

MR. NEIMAN:

Justice Breyer, the reason why

14

it's fair to infer that legislatures would have

15

concluded that a 14-year-old, for example, in Alabama

16

would be subject to a mandatory life without parole

17

sentence is precisely because it's mandatory.

18

the legislatures understood that when they were

19

transferring persons who committed crimes like

20

aggravated murder that were well within the heartland of

21

the crimes for which the transfer statutes were

22

intended, those offenders would be subject to the

23

minimum sentences at least.

Surely,

24

It's quite another thing to say, well, the

25

legislature might have enacted a statute providing for
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

transfer for a 14-year-old; and for a non-homicide

2

crime, they might have assumed that the person would get

3

less than the maximum in terms of life without parole.

4

But, surely, the legislators understood that those

5

offenders would at least get the minimum.

6

And the reason why the line is more safely

7

drawn at 13 or 12, it's because if you look at, for

8

example, the tables from the Department of Justice

9

reports that both sides and the amici have cited listing

10

the transfer ages, by and large, the number seems to cut

11

off at 12 or so.

12

of the range; and if I were a defense attorney, I'd be

13

arguing much harder for a line at 13 than 12.

14

if I were a defense attorney, I'd be arguing for an even

15

higher line than that.

16

And 12 would be on the very bottom end

I imagine

But the point is that if we're going to

17

judge this in terms of objective indicia of what society

18

has decided, that seems to be the line that society has

19

drawn.

20

That line is -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Retribution, Justice Kennedy,

would be the primary goal, bringing society's

10

retributive force to bear on those who commit the worst

11

sort of crimes.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Retribution, of course, is

13

related to personal culpability.

14

and that loops back into the minor problem.

15

MR. NEIMAN:

We said that in Tison,

That's exactly right,

16

Justice Kennedy, but I think one point on which Mr.

17

Miller and the State fundamentally disagree here is what

18

we can conclude about a juvenile's culpability when the

19

juvenile has committed aggravated murder.

20

why Graham came out as it did, the reason why life

21

without parole was not permissible, was because Graham

22

himself had not committed murder.

23

that meant that Graham's culpability was twice

24

diminished, once because he was a juvenile and once

25

because he had not committed murder.
49

Alderson Reporting Company

The reason

The Court there said

Official

1

Well, here we have the hypothetical from

2

Graham where the one level of diminishment is gone.

3

Miller has -- Miller is entitled to a one-level

4

diminishment because of his juvenile status, but he's

5

not entitled to that second level of diminishment, which

6

he is what he's seeking here.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Are you aware of any

statistics that give us some quantitative sense as to

how many juveniles after years and years of prison show

significant rehabilitation?

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I imagine that

Do you have any reason to

think that juveniles are any better than anyone else as

19

far as learning from prison is concerned?

recidivism is a big problem, isn't it?

don't they?

Justice -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there any reason to

think that juveniles are any different?
MR. NEIMAN:

Justice Scalia, I haven't seen

3

any studies that would suggest that juveniles do better,

4

particularly when they're subjected to the sorts of

5

crimes that I think everyone would have -- or the sorts

6

of offenses, let me say, that I think everyone would

7

agree the Constitution would have to permit a sentence

8

of, say, 40 years minimum or the like.

9

So, I just don't think -- I think society --

10

society's primary goal here or the government's primary

11

goal here is expressing the retributive judgment about

12

the wrongfulness of murder and why it's different from,

13

not homicide, but I think governments are quite

14

legitimate and quite reasonable when they also say that

15

they don't want to roll the dice on convicted murderers.

16

Society acts with particular revulsion when a convicted

17

murderer commits a crime again.

18

And even if -- and even if that difference

19

in terms of recidivism is no different, or even if the

20

possibility for recidivism is no different, the fact

21

that the person committed a murder once and might commit

22

a murder again is reason enough for legislatures to be

23

hesitant to allow for parole in these circumstances.

25

With respect to the penological purposes,
there's also an important purpose here with respect to

murder victims and their families face.

3

I think a lot of people hear about

life-without-parole sentences, and if they oppose them

5

on political grounds or policy-based grounds, one of

6

their sort of pragmatic responses is, well, what's the

7

cost to all this?

8

parole hearings, give them that hope, and likely they

9

won't get parole anyway?

10

Why not just let these guys get their

And there's really no cost to society at

11

least in allowing that process to occur, but the cost is

12

to the victims and their families who have to endure

13

what are often very painful hearings and parole

14

hearings.

15

that sort of re-traumatization process is something that

16

governments can legitimately take into account when they

17

decide that for aggravated murder -- and not for other

18

crimes but for aggravated murder -- a

19

life-without-parole sentence is an appropriate sentence.

20

And when those come up on a frequent basis,

On the moral culpability point, there would

21

be some anomalies created by the rule that Miller is

22

seeking here.

23

hold him in the same place in terms of his moral

culpability as the defendant in Graham.

So, that would mean one of two things:

5

Either the Eighth Amendment would put a murderer on the

6

same moral level as someone who committed a non-homicide

7

crime as in Graham, or Graham himself would be back in

8

this Court or a court of another jurisdiction arguing

9

that because Graham held that Graham himself had

10

categorically less culpability than someone like Miller,

11

then Graham himself is entitled to a lesser punishment

12

than the one that Miller, in fact, received.

it certainly would be possible to have a regime under

4

likely to recidivate after an intervention than adults.

5

Generally speaking, homicide offenders are categorically

6

less likely to recidivate than many non-homicide

7

offenders.

8

are much more likely to recidivate than -- than homicide

9

offenders.

10

There is -- there are some studies that

Drug offenders and property crime offenders

And so, there's a lot to support that a

11

judgment rooted in these penological concerns would be

12

well-supported here.

13

I also want to return, Justice Breyer, to

14

your question.

15

read into these statutes a commitment to imposing life

16

without parole at a particular age, and that age is the

17

age of transfer.

18

States with the largest populations of juveniles serving

19

life without parole by a huge margin are Pennsylvania

20

and Michigan, neither of which has a minimum age.

21

Mr. Neiman has -- argued that we can

I just want to highlight that the two

That means in those States, a child of any

22

age can be subject to a mandatory sentence of life

23

without parole.

24

can read into those statutes in those jurisdictions any

25

kind of conscious commitment to thinking about age.

It's simply not true -- true that we

The other point I want to make --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think the legislators

3

in Pennsylvania and Michigan don't understand what their

4

laws provide?

5

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I think that they

6

haven't thought about it.

Yes, I do think that.

I

7

mean, for example -- this goes to the next point I was

8

about to make -- my colleague keeps talking about

9

aggravated murder.

In the State of Pennsylvania, it's

10

not just aggravated murder that subjects you to a

11

mandatory life without parole; if you're convicted of

12

second-degree murder -- no intent -- diminished -- it's

13

still mandatory life without parole.

14

We have 14-year-old children -- and, again,

15

that's the largest cohort in our group -- in the State

16

of Pennsylvania convicted of clearly unintentional

17

killings that have been subject to mandatory life

18

without parole.

19

South Dakota does the same thing.

I think,

20

where there is no minimum age and where you have that

21

kind of regime, I cannot -- I don't think we can

22

conclude that they've thought about, yes, it's

23

appropriate.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
if they do?

What if they -- what

I mean, what if, after our decision or even
58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

after the argument, States go back and say, look, the

2

decision is based on the fact that they don't think we

3

know our law, that we haven't thought about it; so,

4

let's have a hearing about it, and then we vote that,

5

yes, there should be or, no, there should not be a

6

minimum age; we think at 16 -- whatever age they do.

7

Then does the constitutional rule change?

8

MR. STEVENSON:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

I -Once we get 30

10

States saying, look, we've thought about it and this is

11

our answer, then whether the Eighth Amendment prohibits

12

it or not changes?

13

MR. STEVENSON:

No, I -- I don't think it

14

changes, because there is an age at which this Court is

15

obligated under the Eighth Amendment to say a sentence

16

of this sort, a permanent judgment that life-long

17

incarceration is -- is required --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

But one of

19

the things we take into account is societal consensus,

20

and you say we should ignore the 30 -- whatever it is --

21

States that allow this because they didn't really think

22

about it.

23

MR. STEVENSON:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well --

59

MR. STEVENSON:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

Sure.
-- let's make --

let's see if they have thought about it.

4

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

5

Well, in -- in that regard, Justice –

6

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that we do have 13

7

States that have thought about it, that have expressly

8

looked at this question of what the minimum age should

9

be.

And in 12 of those 13 States that have set the age

10

above 14, most of those States have set the age at 18.

11

So, if that's the Court's lens, then I think that would

12

support the kind of rule that we're seeking here --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if, instead of

14

striking down the laws in these States, why don't we

15

just require the State legislatures to think about it?

16

All right?

17

and -- and come up with, you know, something that agrees

18

with you or doesn't agree with you.

19
20
21
22
23

And -- and then see how many think about it,

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I think that's in

part -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wouldn't that be more

democratic somehow?
MR. STEVENSON:

It might be more democratic,

24

but I don't think it would be consistent with the

25

constitutional obligation that this Court has to protect
60

people who are vulnerable from excessive punishment.
And this is a cohort that we contend is the

most vulnerable and should be shielded from this

excessive punishment.
