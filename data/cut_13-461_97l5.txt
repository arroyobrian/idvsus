 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

next in Case 13461, American Broadcasting Companies v. 

5

Aereo. 

6

 Mr. Clement. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT 

8
9
10
11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Aereo's business model is to enable 

12

thousands of paying strangers to watch live TV online. 

13

Aereo's legal argument is that it can make all of that 

14

happen without publicly performing.  But Congress passed 

15

a statute that squarely forecloses that rather 

16

counterintuitive submission.  Because although the 

17

Internet and the thousands of mini antennas are new, the 

18

basic service that Aereo is providing is not materially 

19

different from the service provided by the cable company 

20

before this Court in 1969. 

21
22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
companies? 

23

 MR. CLEMENT: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Why aren't they cable 

They're not 
I'm looking at the 

everybody's been arguing this case as if for sure

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

they're not.  But I look at the definition of a cable 

2

company, and it seems to fit.  A facility located in any 

3

State.  They've got a  whatever they have  a 

4

warehouse or a building in Brooklyn, the  that 

5

receives signal transmissions or programs broadcast by 

6

television broadcast stations.  They're taking the 

7

signals off of the 

8
9
10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

They're taking the signals, 

right. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry, they are. 

11

Makes secondary transmissions by wires, cables, or other 

12

communication channels.  It seems to me that a little 

13

antenna with a dime fits that definition.  To 

14

subscribing members of the public who pay for such 

15

service.  I mean, I read it and I say, why aren't they a 

16

cable company? 

17

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, Justice Sotomayor, a 

18

couple of things.  First of all, I mean, I think if 

19

you're  if you're already at that point, you've 

20

probably understood that just like a cable company, 

21

they're public  they're publicly performing and maybe 

22

they qualify as a cable company and maybe they could 

23

qualify for the compulsory license that's available 

24

to cable companies under Section 111 of the statute. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But this gets it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

mixed up.  Do we have to go to all of those other 

2

questions if we find that they're a cable company?  We 

3

say they're a capable company, they get the compulsory 

4

license. 

5

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, no.  There's lots of 

6

conditions on the compulsory license.  And I think the 

7

first place  the reason that we haven't been debating 

8

about whether they're a cable company is because they 

9

don't want to be a cable company.  They have a footnote 

10

in the red brief that makes it clear.  They are not a 

11

cable company in their view.  They don't want to be a 

12

cable company.  And I think that's because coming with a 

13

cable company, it might potentially get you into the 

14

compulsory license, but it brings with it a lot of 

15

obligations to come with being a cable company 

16
17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
don't want it. 

18

 MR. CLEMENT: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MR. CLEMENT: 

21
22
23
24
25

Yes.  But that's why they 

Exactly. 
That isn't the question. 
Well, here's the other thing 

is I think 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The question is are 

they? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

I don't think they are. 

That's really ultimately a question under the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

Communications Act.  But here's why, if I could  I 

2

think  and Mr. Frederick will certainly speak to this if 

3

if you want him to.  But I think the reason they don't 

4

want to be a cable company is because I think their 

5

basic business model would not allow them to qualify 

6

with compulsory license anyways. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But I'd still like to know 

8

the answer to the question, in your opinion.  And, of 

9

course, if you want a reason, I'll give you my reason. 

10

 If we take the public performance, maybe we run 

11

into what Professor Nimmer saw as a problem.  Why isn't 

12

what used to be called a phonograph record store that 

13

sells phonograph records to 10,000 customers giving a public 

14

performance?  It seems to fall within that definition. 

15

But if it is, there's no  no first sale doctrine and 

16

it's a big problem.  So we could avoid that problem. 

17

 Now, that's why I'm very interested in the 

18
19

answer, not just what they want. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I don't think they are 

20

ultimately a cable company, and we could debate that 

21

question, but it's not the question before you.  So 

22

maybe I could give you some comfort about why you don't 

23

need to decide that question. 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, perhaps we should 

remand it, because my reason for wanting to decide it is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

what I said.  And what you've read in their briefs is 

2

they, in their supporting amici, have thrown up a series 

3

of serious problems not involving them, like the cloud, 

4

which the government tells us to ignore, and many 

5

others, which make me nervous about taking your 

6

preferred route.  So that's why I was interested in this 

7

question. 

8
9

 MR. CLEMENT: 

But, Justice Breyer, I think 

it's very important to  to understand that even if 

10

they're a cable company, it doesn't make all these 

11

problems go away.  Because they would be a cable company 

12

that by very virtue of what they want to point to, which 

13

is their user specific copies, I don't think they would 

14

qualify for the compulsory license. 

15

 I also think the better way to avoid your 

16

concerns is to maybe take them on directly.  The reason 

17

that the record company is not involved in a public 

18

performance is it's not involved in any performance at 

19

all, but that's different, of course, from an online 

20

music store, which not only provides a download of 

21

something, but actually performs it and streams it and 

22

allows it live.  And that is a basic distinction that's 

23

not only recognized by the Second Circuit in the ASCAP 

24

case, but it's also recognized in the real world by the 

25

way these  these different services are structured.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

If you provide downloads of music, you get a 

2

distribution license or a reproduction license.  If you 

3

provide streaming of music where you also have a 

4

contemporaneous live performance, then you also get a 

5

public performance license. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Is your definition  I 

7

mean, Justice Breyer has already asked you  said he's 

8

troubled about the phonograph store, and  and the 

9

Dropbox and the iCloud.  I'm also worried about how to 

10

define or  public performance or the performance of a 

11

work publicly, which I guess is the better way to do it, 

12

according to you.  How do I define that so that someone 

13

who sells coaxial cable to a resident of a building is 

14

not swept up as a participant in this?  Or someone 

15

who  the sort of passive storage advisors that  this 

16

is really hard for me. 

17

 MR. CLEMENT: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Okay.  But let me 
How do I  what do I do 

19

to avoid  what do we do, not me, but what does the 

20

Court do to avoid a definition or an acceptance of a 

21

definition that might make those people liable? 

22

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Okay.  Well, let me try to 

23

take  those are actually two different examples, and I 

24

think the answer to both of them is somewhat different. 

25

I think the provider of coaxial cable is  if it's just

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

a simple sale of the cable  is not performing at all. 

2

And so I think if you're somebody and all you do is take 

3

a piece of hardware and you sell it once and for all to 

4

a user, then the user may be performing with the 

5

equipment, but you're out of the picture.  And that's 

6

different from an ongoing service, like a cable company 

7

or like Aereo, who still owns all these facilities and 

8

they're providing, through wire transmissions, these 

9

performances on an ongoing basis. 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What if you get it 

through Dropbox? 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that's something else 

13

before you get to Justice Sotomayor's second half of the 

14

question, but something more along the lines of 

15

providing hardware.  Suppose a company just gave the 

16

antenna and a hard drive, that's what they sold to the 

17

user, and the user was able to use the antenna and the 

18

hard drive in her own house or apartment in order to get 

19

all these broadcast programs.  What would the  would 

20

that be a performance? 

21

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I think the end user would be 

22

doing a performance, but it would be a purely private 

23

performance, and I don't think the person that sold them 

24

the hardware or really anybody else, if I understand 

25

your hypo, would be involved in a performance.  And the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

answer to these hypos  I mean, this isn't something 

2

that I'm making up on the fly.  I mean, it's right there 

3

in the text of the statute. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But then it really does 

5

depend on, like, where the  where the hardware is.  In 

6

other words, if  if Aereo has the hardware in its 

7

warehouse as opposed to Aereo selling the hardware to 

8

the particular end user, that is going to make all the 

9

difference in the world as to whether we have a public 

10
11

performance or not a public performance. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well  and, again, I think 

12

that goes to what I was about to say, which is let's 

13

just not because, you know, we like one better than the 

14

other.  It's because of the text of the statute Congress 

15

wrote.  One of the ways that you can public perform.  I 

16

mean, they start with the classic public performance. 

17

Right?  A singer in a concert hall.  They've sold tickets. 

18

But then they say, wait, it's also a public performance 

19

if you take the singer's performance and you transmit 

20

it, and they're thinking over the airways and all sorts 

21

of other ways, if you transmit it to the public.  And 

22

the definition of transmission, then, is to communicate 

23

it from one place to another. 

24
25

 So there is a geographical aspect, if you 
will, built right into the statute so that if you sell

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

somebody hardware and all they're doing is transmitting 

2

it to themselves at their home, there's not going to be 

3

a transmission that's chargeable to the person who sold 

4

you the hardware.  But if you provide an ongoing service 

5

from a remote 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So you think that in my 

7

hypo, there's a performance, but it's a private 

8

performance and then you move the hardware and it 

9

becomes a public performance.  Is that it? 

10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

It  it becomes a public 

11

performance on behalf of the sender, but it still would 

12

be a private performance on behalf of the receiver.  And 

13

that's one thing that's really important to get in mind, 

14

is that in this statute as to the public performance 

15

right, there's nothing particularly anomalous about a 

16

single transmission that from the sender's perspective 

17

is a public performance, but from the recipient's 

18

perspective only allows for a private performance. 

19

 If you think about the classic cable 

20

context, which is what Congress was trying to address in 

21

1976 with the Transmit Clause, you have the cable 

22

company and they're taking a performance off of the 

23

airways and they're transmitting it to all the 

24

endusers. 

25

 Now, the cable company is clearly performing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

to the public, but that same transmission is allowing 

2

each enduser to turn on their television set and to 

3

make a performance proper, which is a private 

4

performance. 

5
6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
paying a license for no reason. 

7

 MR. CLEMENT: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10

So Roku is  Roku is 

I'm sorry? 
Roku is paying a license 

for no reason?  They sold me a piece of equipment. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

I don't know all the details 

11

of that particular piece of equipment.  I'm not sure 

12

whether they're  they're paying a license or not.  But 

13

if there was really a transfer and there's nobody else 

14

providing a transmission, I don't think that just 

15

operating the hardware in the privacy of your own home 

16

is going to result in anything but a private 

17

performance. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Go to the iDrop and the 

cloud. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Sure.  Now, there's, I think, 

21

it's a slightly different situation.  Here, I think the 

22

ultimate statutory text that allows you to differentiate 

23

a cloud locker storage from something like what Aereo 

24

does is a language to the public.  And I do think that 

25

in all sorts of places, including the real world,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

there's a fundamental difference between a service that 

2

allows  that provides new content to all sorts of 

3

endusers, essentially any paying stranger, and a 

4

service that provides a locker, a storage service.  And 

5

I think if you want a real world analogy off of the 

6

Internet, I think it's the basic decision  the 

7

difference between a car dealer and a valet parking 

8

service.  I mean, if you looked at it from 30,000 feet, 

9

you might think, hey, both of these things provide cars 

10

to the public.  But if you looked at it more closely, 

11

you'd understand, well, if I show up at the car 

12

dealership without a car, I'm going to be able to get a 

13

car.  If I show up at the valet parking service and I 

14

don't own a car, it's not going to end well for me.  And 

15

so 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

19
20

What is the difference 

I didn't mean to interrupt 

your 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

Well, I was just going to 

21

so I think there is a very real way in which you would 

22

say, you know, at the end of the day, the car dealer's 

23

providing cars to the public, the valet parking service 

24

is not.  It's providing a parking service. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

Why isn't  and I

Official

14
1

don't want to stretch you too far  why isn't it like a 

2

public garage in your own garage?  I mean, you know, if 

3

you  you can park your car in your own garage or you 

4

can park it in a public garage.  You can go to Radio 

5

Shack and buy an antenna and a DVR or you can rent those 

6

facilities somewhere else from Aereo.  They've 

7

they've got an antenna.  They'll let you use it when you 

8

need it and they can, you know, record the stuff as well 

9

and let you pick it up when you need it. 

10

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Mr. Chief Justice, that's not 

11

an implausible way to look at this.  That's exactly the 

12

way that this Court looked at it in Fortnightly 

13

decision.  But Congress in 1976 decided it was going to 

14

look at it differently, and it said that if you are 

15

providing a service, even if you are providing a service 

16

that one could reconceptualize as just renting out 

17

antennas that somebody could put on their own house, the 

18

person that provides that service on an ongoing basis 

19

and in the process exploits the copyrighted works of 

20

others is engaged in a public performance.  That is 

21

clearly what they were trying to do in the 1976 Act by 

22

adding the Transmit Clause. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, the Second Circuit 

24

analogized this to its CableVision decision.  So maybe 

25

you could explain to me what is the difference, in your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

view, between what Aereo does and a remote storage DVR 

2

system.  Is the difference  does the difference have 

3

to do with the way in which the cable company that has 

4

the remote storage DVR system versus Aereo acquires the 

5

program in the first place?  Does it have to do with the 

6

number of people who view this program that's been 

7

recorded?  What is the difference? 

8
9

 MR. CLEMENT: 

I think the potential 

difference, and it's both the CloudLocker storage and 

10

this example, I don't think this Court has to decide it 

11

today.  I think it can just be confident they are 

12

different.  Here is the 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I don't find that very 

14

satisfying because I really  I need to know how far 

15

the rationale that you want us to accept will go, and I 

16

need to understand, I think, what effect it will have on 

17

these other technologies. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I had the same question. 

19

Just assume that CableVision is our precedent.  I know 

20

that it isn't, but let's just assume that it is.  How 

21

would you distinguish the CableVision from your case and 

22

how is it applicable here?  Assume that it's binding 

23

precedent.  Just that's a hypothetical. 

24
25

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Okay.  But, Justice Kennedy, I 

would like to answer both your questions by assuming

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

that the result in CableVision is right, but I don't 

2

have to necessarily buy the reasoning, because I think 

3

the reasoning of CableVision is profoundly wrong, so let 

4

me circle back to that. 

5

 But the reason there's a fundamental 

6

difference between the RS DVR at issue in CableVision 

7

and what Aereo provides is, as Justice Alito alluded to, 

8

the fact that there's a license in the CableVision 

9

context to get the initial performance to the public. 

10

And so then I think appropriately the focus in the 

11

CableVision context becomes just the playback feature 

12

and just the timeshifting that's enabled by that.  And 

13

in that context, if you focus only on that, then the RS 

14

DVR looks a lot like a locker service where you have to 

15

come in with the content before you can get content out 

16

and you only get back the same content. 

17

 And here is what really I think Aereo is 

18

like.  Aereo is like if CableVision, having won in the 

19

Second Circuit, decides:  Whew, we won, so guess what? 

20

Going forward, we're going to dispense with all these 

21

licenses, and we are just going to try to tell people we 

22

are just an RS DVR, that's all we are, and never mind 

23

that we don't have any licensed ability to get the 

24

broadcast in the first instance, and we're going to 

25

provide it to individual users, and it's all going to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

because they push buttons and not because we push 

2

buttons.  If that were the hypothetical, I don't know 

3

how that wouldn't be the clearest violation of the 1976 

4

Act. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Alright, assume that it isn't our problem. 

6

I'm hearing everybody having the same problem, and I 

7

will be absolutely prepared, at least for argument's 

8

sake, to assume with you that if there were ever 

9

anything that should be held to fall within the public 

10

performance, this should be.  All right?  I will assume 

11

that.  I'm not saying it is. 

12

 But then the problem is in the words that do 

13

that, because we have to write words, are we somehow 

14

catching other things that really will change life and 

15

shouldn't, such as the cloud?  And you said, well, as 

16

the government says, don't worry, because that isn't a 

17

public performance.  And then I read the definition and 

18

I don't see how to get out of it. 

19

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Here is the way to get out of 

20

it, Justice Breyer.  Ultimately the words you're going 

21

to have to interpret are "to the public." Now I think 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

To the public?  You see, 

23

separate, at the same time, or at different times? 

24

Separate or together?  So a thousand people store in the 

25

cloud the same thing, as can easily happen, and call it

Alderson Reporting Company

2

back at varying times of the day. 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

And if all they can do is, just 

3

like the valet car parking service, is get back what 

4

they put up there, I think you could easily say that 

5

that is not to the public.  And that is not just me 

6

coming up with a clever distinction.  That's the 

7

distinction that's really been drawn in the real world, 

8

because not all cloud computing is created equal, and 

9

there are some cloud computing services that use cloud 

10

computing technology to get new content to people that 

11

don't have it, and they get licenses.  And there is 

12

other cloud computing that just has locker services and 

13

they don't think they need a license, and so I'm not 

14

saying that you have to bless what the market has done, 

15

but I think it's a profound indication 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But what if, Mr. Clement, 

17

it's not so simple as a company that just allows you 

18

yourself to put something up there?  What if  how 

19

about there are lots of companies where many, many 

20

thousands or millions of people put things up there, and 

21

then they share them, and the company in some ways 

22

aggregates and sorts all that content.  Does that count? 

23

 MR. CLEMENT: 

That, Justice Kagan, is 

24

precisely why I'm asking you not to decide the cloud 

25

computing question once and for all today, because not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

all cloud computing is created equal.  The details of it 

2

might matter.  If I can just take my valet parking service 

3

one more time.  If the valet parking service starts 

4

renting them out and sort of has a little Zipcar service 

5

on the side and says, hey, while we have your car, if 

6

somebody else needs a car, we're going to rent it out to 

7

them, I think that's different from the pure valet 

8

parking service.

10

 If I could reserve the rest of my time for 
rebuttal.  Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

14

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS 

15
16
17
18

Thank you, counsel. 

 AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONERS 
 MR. STEWART: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 I would like to begin by reinforcing two of 

19

the points that Mr. Clement made.  The first is that 

20

what Aereo is doing is really the functional equivalent 

21

of what Congress in the 1976 Act wanted to define as a 

22

public performance.  As the Chief Justice said, one 

23

potential way of looking at this is that Aereo and 

24

companies like it are not providing services, they are 

25

simply providing equipment that does, in a more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

sophisticated way, what the viewer himself can do.  It's 

2

a plausible way of looking at the world.  That's what 

3

the Court in Fortnightly and Teleprompter said, but 

4

Congress acted to override that and to make clear that 

5

cable services, services that used one big antenna to 

6

pull broadcast signals out of the sky and reroute it to 

7

their subscribers, those people were engaged in public 

8

performances and they ought to be paying royalties. 

9

 The second thing that I would like to 

10

reinforce in Mr. Clement's presentation is that there is 

11

no reason that a decision in this case should imperil 

12

cloud locker services generally, but, as Mr. Clement was 

13

pointing out, that the term "cloud computing" 

14
15
16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How about Simple.TV or 

NimbleTV, which is not quite a hybrid? 
 MR. STEWART: 

I guess I'm not familiar 

17

enough with the precise details of the operation, but 

18

just let me say in general terms there are obviously 

19

services that provide television programming over the 

20

Internet.  Some of them are licensed because they 

21

recognize that they are publicly performing.  If a 

22

particular company, for instance, recorded television 

23

programs and offered to stream them to anyone who paid 

24

the fee or offered to stream them for free and made its 

25

money off advertising, that would be a public

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

performance because those companies would be providing 

2

content to people who didn't have it. 

3

 I think the basic distinction, the one that 

4

at least defines the extremes, is the distinction 

5

between the company, whether it be Internetbased or a 

6

cable transmitter, that provides content in the first 

7

instance and the company that provides consumers with 

8

access to content that they already have.  If you have a 

9

cloud locker service, somebody has bought a digital copy 

10

of a song or a movie from some other source, stores it 

11

in a locker and asks that it be streamed back, the cloud 

12

locker and storage service is not providing the content. 

13

It's providing a mechanism for watching it. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask my same question 

15

to you that I asked to Mr. Clement?  How about if 

16

there's a company that allows sharing and that 

17

aggregates all the content that different individual 

18

users put up and that in some sense sort of sorts and 

19

classifies the content in different ways?  How about 

20

that? 

21

 MR. STEWART: 

I think you would have to 

22

you would have to know both the details of the service 

23

and you would have to be making a harder call there 

24

about how to draw the line, because I don't pretend that 

25

there is a bright line between providing a service and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

providing access to equipment.  If you look, for 

2

instance, at the extremes of a person putting a rooftop 

3

antenna at his own home, everybody agrees that the 

4

rooftop antenna manufacturer is not performing at all 

5

and the individual is engaged in a solely private 

6

performance. 

7

 The other extreme is the cable company, one 

8

big antenna, makes transmissions to a lot of people; 

9

Congress clearly intended to define that as a private 

10

performance.  Somewhere in the  you could come up with 

11

lots of hypotheticals that look more or less like one of 

12

the other extremes, they are somewhere in the middle. 

13

It's an authentically hard call as to where to draw the 

14

line.  So I don't have a good answer for you. 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How do we get out of 

16

the Nimmer example?  I mean, how do we get out  what words do 

17

I write to get out of this, throwing into this clause a 

18

music store that distributes via Federal Express, a 

19

device, or the U.S. Postal Service or even someone over 

20

the counter, distributes to 10,000 people a copy of a 

21

record which they then will take and play it?  They 

22

have, to the same degree, transmitted something that 

23

will electronically make a performance of the music.  So 

24

are they when they sell the record violating the display 

25

clause?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

 MR. STEWART: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

 MR. STEWART: 

No, they're not 
Because?  Because? 
Because the definition of "to 

4

transmit" goes on:  "To transmit a performance or 

5

display is to communicate it by any device or process 

6

whereby images or sounds are received beyond the place 

7

from which they are sent." 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

Of course they are.  The 

sounds are received beyond the place.  It requires the 

10

person to take the record, put it on a machine, and then 

11

play it. 

12
13
14

 MR. STEWART: 

Well, there is a separate 

exclusive right in the Copyright Act. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course there is.  And 

15

that separate exclusive right has such things as first 

16

sale doctrine attached.  But if they also flow here, 

17

if they  if this covers them, which is why Nimmer wrote 

18

the paragraph that was quoted, if this covers it, there 

19

is no first sale doctrine, and that has a lot of 

20

consequences.  I think so.  Anyway, if you don't know 

21

and you haven't got something right there and you 

22

haven't thought about it, you're not going to think 

23

about it in two minutes, nor will I. 

24
25

 MR. STEWART: 

No.  No.  I have thought about 

it.  And I think the answer is that the word "transmit"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

is being used in a particular sense.  You are correct 

2

that there are some contexts in which we would say that 

3

a person who sends CDs or vital albums over the mails is 

4

transmitting those.  That's not the sense in which the 

5

term "transmit" is used here.  It's talking about 

6

transmitting in a way that causes the sights and sounds 

7

to be received, transmission through radio waves, 

8

through cable, et cetera.  And if there were any doubt 

9

about the word "transmit," remember that it's part of 

10

the definition of the word "perform."  And ambiguities 

11

in the definition should be construed in light of the 

12

defined term.  And nobody would say, in ordinary 

13

parlance, that a person who transferred a copy of a 

14

record was performing it. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Stewart, before you 

16

finish, Mr. Clement in his brief made the point that we 

17

would  if we took the position that Petitioner urges, 

18

there would be an incompatibility with our international 

19

obligations; that is, Aereo's view of the public 

20

performance right is incompatible with our obligations 

21

under the Berne Convention and under  what is it, 

22

WYCO?  On pages 44 to 45 of his brief, he says that 

23

"Aereo's view of what the public performance right is 

24

runs straight up against our international obligations," 

25

and he cites a case from the European Court of Justice

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1
2

and I think another case. 
 MR. STEWART: 

We haven't made that argument. 

3

We  we believe that existing U.S. copyright law 

4

properly construed is fully sufficient to comply with 

5

our international obligations.  But that  that doesn't 

6

mean that we think that whenever a court misconstrues 

7

the statute, we will automatically be thrown into 

8

breach.  It's certainly possible.  But if this case were 

9

decided in Aereo's favor that some of our international 

10

trading partners might object, but  but I'm not going 

11

to take the position that we would concede those 

12

objections had merit, so we're not making that argument. 

13

 The other thing I would make  say to  to 

14

reinforce the point that Mr. Clement was making about 

15

the phrase "to the public," using his example of the 

16

valet parking, using a comparable example of a coat 

17

checkroom, there are situations all the time in which 

18

people place property momentarily at the disposal 

19

disposal of another and then retrieve it later.  And 

20

it's distributed to them at that later date, not in 

21

their capacities as members of the public, but as the 

22

true owners of the property.  And I think some kind of 

23

distinction along those lines is essential in much more 

24

mundane applications of the Copyright Act.  For example, 

25

if I invite 10 friends over to watch the Super Bowl,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

that's a private performance.  It's not a public 

2

performance.  That's  that's not because my friends 

3

are not members of the public.  They are.  And in some 

4

other capacities, it would be important to regard them 

5

as such. 

6

 If the theater down the street had a 

7

screening of Casablanca and it happened that those 10 

8

people were the only 10 people who attended, it would be 

9

a public performance, because they would be in there in 

10

their capacities as members of the public.  So I think 

11

for  in a wide range of situations dealing with public 

12

performance, distribution to the public, it's essential 

13

to ask not only are these individuals members of the 

14

public in some sense, but are they acting in their 

15

capacities as such.  And if you have the pure cloud 

16

locker service, the service that doesn't provide 

17

content, it simply stores content and then plays it back 

18

at the user's request, that  that service would be 

19

providing content to its true owner. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

How do you want us to deal 

21

with CableVision  the CableVision case in the Second 

22

Circuit?  Again assume it's a binding precedent.  Just 

23

assume that. 

24
25

 MR. STEWART: 

My answer would be the same as 

Mr. Clement's, that the reasoning of CableVision, if you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

really adhere to the idea that the only trans  the 

2

only performance that counts is the individual 

3

transmission, and ask does that go to more than one 

4

person, then it's hard to see how you could rule in 

5

favor of our position here.  But as far as the bottom 

6

line outcome of CableVision is concerned, you could 

7

accept the government's position and still say 

8

CableVision was decided the correct way because 

9

precisely because CableVision had a license to perform 

10

in real time, to broadcast the program to its 

11

subscribers.  The only thing that was at issue was the 

12

supplemental RSDVR service.  And the court in 

13

CableVision appropriately, we think, held that the 

14

recording of those programs by the subscribers who were 

15

already entitled to view them in real time was fair use 

16

under Sony and the playback can reasonably be 

17

characterized as a private performance of their own 

18

content.  Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT BY MR. DAVID C. FREDERICK 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

 I want to address the cable question, but 

2

before I do that, can I just say the three points I 

3

wanted to make are the text is very clear for Aereo, the 

4

interpretations of the text that they offer absolutely 

5

threaten cloud computing, and third, this case is really 

6

a reproduction right case masquerading as a public 

7

performance case. 

8
9

 Now, we are not a cable service. 

The reason 

we're not a cable service is because cable takes all 

10

signals and pushes them down.  There's a head in.  It's 

11

defined by statute.  There's a very particularized 

12

regulatory structure that deals with taking a lot of 

13

content and pushing it down to consumers.  Aereo is an 

14

equipment provider.  Nothing happens on Aereo's 

15

equipment until a user initiates the system.  The user 

16

initiates the system by logging on and pressing this is 

17

the program that I want to watch.  That then tunes the 

18

antenna, activates the recording that will be made, and 

19

then the user is then able to play back that recording. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I always thought, and 

21

I'm  try to be careful about it, but not often enough, 

22

probably breach it like every other member of the 

23

public, that if I take a phonograph of a record and 

24

duplicate it a million times the way you're doing it, 

25

and I then go out and sell each of those copies to the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

public, then I am violating the Act.  So why is it that 

2

you are not? 

3

 MR. FREDERICK: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

Well 
It's not logical to 

me 

6

 MR. FREDERICK: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sure. 
 that you can make 

8

these millions of copies and give  sell  essentially 

9

sell them to the public, because you're telling the 

10

public when they want to buy it, they can call it up and 

11

hear it.  So why aren't you trans 

12

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, your hypothetical, 

13

Justice Sotomayor, implicates the reproduction right. 

14

That is the exclusive right of the copyright holder to 

15

restrict the number of copies that is made.  That is not 

16

a public performance right question. 

17

 They abandoned their challenge in the 

18

preliminary injunction proceeding to the reproduction 

19

right issue because it runs right into the Sony 

20

decision.  In Sony, this Court held that consumers have 

21

a fair use right to take local overtheair broadcasts 

22

and make a copy of it.  All Aereo is doing is providing 

23

antennas and DVRs that enable consumers to do exactly 

24

what this Court in Sony recognized they can do when 

25

they're in home and they're moving the equipment, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

antennas and the DVRs 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3

 MR. FREDERICK: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Frederick 
 to the Internet. 
 was Judge Chin right 

5

when he said that there was no technically sound reason to 

6

use these multiple antennas?  That the only reason for 

7

that was to avoid the reach of the Copyright Act.  Was 

8

there a technical reason, instead of having a one big 

9

antenna, to have all of these what, dimesize antennas? 

10

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Let me  this is a very 

11

complex question, Justice Ginsburg, and let me answer it 

12

at multiple levels.  There are technical reasons why the 

13

individual antennas provide the same utility at lower 

14

costs and functionality than one big antenna.  But there 

15

are very practical concerns, too. 

16

 As a startup business, Aereo is attempting 

17

to entice consumers to replicate on the cloud what they 

18

can do at home at lower cap costs and more efficiency. 

19

As a practical matter, and Judge Chin had no basis in 

20

which to make this statement at all in his dissent 

21

because these are facts not on the record and efficiency 

22

is not a consideration under the Copyright Act, you 

23

can't do multiple channels over the Internet anyway. 

24

You can only do a single video stream at a time.  So 

25

whether you have one big antenna or whether you have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

lots of little antennas, you still have to compress the 

2

signal and only one can go over the Internet at a time. 

3

 However, Justice Ginsburg, as a startup 

4

business, there is a very real consideration for why 

5

multiple antennas make sense.  If you're in New York 

6

City, you want to put an antenna on top of the building, 

7

you've got to get a building permit.  If you want to 

8

construct it, you've got to get a construction permit. 

9

If you want to put it up there with a crane, you have to 

10

get a subway permit before you can do all of the things 

11

to put a big antenna on a building in New York City to 

12

get broadcast signals. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But is there any 

14

reason you need 10,000 of them?  Can't you put just 

15

if your model is correct, can't you just put your 

16

antenna up and then do it?  I mean, there's no 

17

technological reason for you to have 10,000 dimesized 

18

antenna, other than to get around the copyright laws. 

19

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, the point of the 

20

copyright laws, though, Your Honor, shouldn't turn on 

21

the number of antennas.  It turns on whether the person 

22

who is receiving the signal that comes through the 

23

Internet is privately performing by initiating the 

24

action of that antenna getting a data stream, having 

25

that signal compressed so that it can be streamed over

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

the Internet through a userspecific, userinitiated 

2

copy. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That may well be, but it 

4

doesn't contradict the Chief Justice's question.  I 

5

mean, you're just saying that by doing it this way you 

6

don't violate the copyright laws.  But his question is, 

7

is there any reason you did it other than not to violate 

8

the copyright laws? 

9

 MR. FREDERICK: 

We understood  yes, there 

10

is a reason, Justice Scalia.  We wanted to tell 

11

consumers, you can replicate the experience at very 

12

small cost.  You know you have a right to put an antenna 

13

on your roof and put a DVR in your living room.  We can 

14

provide exactly the same antenna and DVR for a fraction 

15

of cost by putting it over the cloud. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yeah, but it's 

17

not  it's not.  You give them space that's available 

18

when they call in.  They don't have  this is my little 

19

dime thing, and this is my copy that's going to be here. 

20

They're there, and when they want something, you provide 

21

the service of giving them that.  They don't have a 

22

dedicated antenna in Brooklyn. 

23

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, some of the consumers 

24

do.  The record is clear that some are statically 

25

assigned to particular users.  But Mr. Chief Justice,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

that doesn't answer the question, the statutory 

2

interpretation question, which is, as in CableVision, as 

3

Justice Kennedy noted, there is a userspecific, 

4

userinitiated copy that when viewed by the user is a 

5

private performance. 

6

 That operation of the system works exactly 

7

the same way.  And the fact that CableVision is able to 

8

compress its signals to make them Internetaccessible 

9

through a single antenna and Aereo chooses to do it 

10

through multiple antennas to avoid all the hassles that 

11

go with having a big antenna should not matter for the 

12

copyright laws. 

13

 We're still talking about renting equipment, 

14

that consumers have a right to get overtheair signals 

15

that are free to the public, using public spectrum that 

16

the  that the government has allocated so that 

17

broadcasters 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose  suppose Aereo 

19

offered a service so that the viewer at home could press 

20

three different buttons, but it takes only 45 seconds, 

21

and he could get the broadcast without advertising?  And 

22

Aereo would have some way to screen out the advertising 

23

so you could watch the entire baseball game or football 

24

game without the ad  without the ads. 

25

 MR. FREDERICK: 

That would probably violate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

the reproduction right, Justice Kennedy.  It would not 

2

violate the public performance rights. 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would Aereo be a performer 

then? 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Aereo would not be a 

6

performer.  The question would be  and this does go 

7

into the technical details.  And here, the position 

8

between the parties is quite stark.  They say the facts 

9

don't matter.  We have a welldeveloped factual record. 

10

There, Justice Kennedy, the fact that would matter in 

11

your hypothetical would be whether or not the initiation 

12

of the advertiserfree had been somehow done by the 

13

consumer or whether it had been done by the cloud 

14

provider. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, the consumer makes the 

16

choice.  You can have it with the ads or without the 

17

ads.  Push button one or button two. 

18

 MR. FREDERICK: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20
21

Right.  I understand 
I don't understand why he 

is the performer in one case and not in the other case. 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Because the  the action of 

22

who is a performer turns under the statute on who is 

23

making  who is acting to make the sequence of sounds 

24

and images perceivable.  Where you're talking about 

25

taking out advertising, what you're doing is you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

altering the copy, and you are abridging, infringing, 

2

the reproduction right.  That is not something that you 

3

can do in the Aereo technology.  I have no brief to 

4

defend that.  That would be a very difficult 

5

reproduction right question.  But it doesn't matter in 

6

terms of who is exercising a private performance, 

7

because that is being done in the home with a 

8

userinitiated, userspecific copy. 

9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Frederick, your  your 

client is  is just using this for local signals 

11

 MR. FREDERICK: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
 right now.  But if we 

13

approve that, is there any reason it couldn't be used 

14

for distant signals as well? 

15

 MR. FREDERICK: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18
19
20

Possibly. 
Possibly what?  There is 

possibly a reason, or it could possibly be used? 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

It can't be used for 

distance, but it implicates 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What would the difference 

21

be.  I mean, you could take HBO, right?  You could 

22

you could carry that without  without performing. 

23
24
25

 MR. FREDERICK: 

No, because HBO is not done 

over the airwaves.  It's done through a private service. 
 But Justice Scalia, let me answer your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

distant signal hypothetical this way.  That would 

2

implicate again the reproduction right.  It does not 

3

implicate the private performance and public performance 

4

distinction, because, even if you were to take distant 

5

signals and make them available in the home, it's still 

6

through a userinitiated, userspecific copy of distant 

7

programming. 

8
9

 The question then becomes, is there a fair 
use right to be able to do that.  What Sony said, 

10

because Sony was dealing with local overtheair 

11

broadcasts and making a copy of local overtheair 

12

broadcasts, it said that consumers have a fair use right 

13

to make a copy of that. 

14

 Sony did not address the distant signal, and 

15

the question then would become in balancing the various fair use 

16

factors whether it was appropriate for a consumer to be 

17

able to get access to that programming without being 

18

able to otherwise implicate the free public spectrum. 

19

 Now, the way Congress has addressed that, 

20

Congress has addressed that by saying that when there 

21

are distance signals that then get pushed through a 

22

cable system, there is a copyright royalty that gets 

23

paid. 

24
25

 But I want to make absolutely clear. 
Satellite, cable, do not pay copyright royalties for

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

local overtheair broadcasts.  Why?  Because the local 

2

overtheair broadcast channels wanted it that way. 

3

They didn't want to be in a situation of having to 

4

figure out how to divvy up all the copyright royalties 

5

to the various holders.  So when they talk about how 

6

Congress supposedly overruled Fortnightly, what they 

7

ignore is that in Section 11(d) and in Section 122(c) of 

8

the Copyright Act, Congress said the retransmission of 

9

local overtheair broadcasts through satellite and 

10
11

cable shall be exempt from the copyright regime. 
 And so when they talk about the 

12

retransmission issue, they're really trying to conflate 

13

a totally different regulatory system 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Frederick, would you 

15

clarify?  If every other transmitter does pay a royalty 

16

 maybe it's under compulsory license  and you are 

17

the only player so far that doesn't pay any royalties at 

18

any stage 

19

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

20

person who sells an antenna to me at the local Radio 

21

Shack doesn't pay copyright royalties either.  And a 

22

and a company that provides a rental service for me to 

23

put an antenna in my home and install it, they don't pay 

24

copyright royalties either. 

25

 And the question that it really boils down

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

in this case is how significant should it be how long 

2

the cord is between the antenna and the DVR being 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The answer is very 

4

significant.  And the reason it's very significant is 

5

because what the local antenna person doesn't do but you 

6

apparently could do, even if you don't, is with the same 

7

kind of device pick up every television signal in the 

8

world and send it, almost, and send it into a person's 

9

computer.  And that sounds so much like what a CATV 

10

system does or what a satellite system does that it 

11

looks as if somehow you are escaping a constraint that's 

12

imposed upon them.  That's what disturbs everyone. 

13

 And then what disturbs me on the other side 

14

is I don't understand what the decision for you or 

15

against you when I write it is going to do to all kinds 

16

of other technologies.  I've read the briefs fairly 

17

carefully, and I'm still uncertain that I understand it 

18

well enough.  That isn't your problem, but it might turn 

19

out to be. 

20

 (Laughter.) 

21

 MR. FREDERICK: 

22

think I  let me try to make it their problem. 

23

 (Laughter.) 

24

 MR. FREDERICK: 

25

Well, let me address  I 

I think I've addressed the 

distant signal, and I think you can reserve that case to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

say that might raise a different issue, but on the facts 

2

here would not entitle the company to an injunction 

3

enjoining Aereo from providing the service. 

4

 Now, with respect to the second aspect of 

5

this, the reason why their interpretation of the 

6

Transmit Clause causes so much problem, so many problems 

7

for the cloud computing industry, is that  is twofold. 

8

Number one, they are conflating performance with work in 

9

the Transmit Clause.  What they are saying is that, so 

10

long as the work is always perceived in some fashion 

11

through a performance that is privately done through the 

12

playback of a recording, that that  because the 

13

initial work was disseminated to the public, that 

14

implicates the public performance right. 

15

 What that does is it means that every time 

16

somebody stores something in the cloud, whether it's a 

17

song, a video image or  or the like, if it happens to 

18

be something that somebody else has stored in the cloud, 

19

the act of one person initiating it and perceiving it is 

20

going to implicate the public performance right.  And 

21

that's why the cloud computing industry is freaked out 

22

about this case because they've invested tens of 

23

billions of dollars on the notion that an userspecific, 

24

userinitiated copy when perceived by that person is a 

25

private performance and not a public performance.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

 The second thing that they do that's wrong 

2

with the statute is they aggregate performances. 

3

Instead of where the statute says "transmit a 

4

performance," they say "transmit performances."  Because 

5

they acknowledge that the way the technology works for 

6

Aereo is that it is an individual, userspecific, 

7

userinitiated copy.  But they say no matter if you add 

8

enough of them together, you can aggregate that to 

9

become a public performance. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Just to make sure 

11

I've got  there's no reason it's a userspecific copy, 

12

is it?  They're making 10,000 copies.  It'd be much 

13

easier for you if you'd just have to make one copy and 

14

everybody could get a copy. 

15

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, that's where the issue 

16

about replicating what happens in the home matters, 

17

Mr. Chief Justice, because if I'm in my home and I start 

18

the program two minutes in, using Aereo's technology, I 

19

missed the first two minutes, I never get to watch it. 

20

It happens to be when I push the button to initiate the 

21

copy, just like if I'm at home watching on a DVR, the 

22

same principle.  And so that copy will always be 

23

different because I have control over it versus 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Surely, you can make 

a program where you have just one copy and starting it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

at different times.  You don't need every viewer to have 

2

his own copy. 

3

 MR. FREDERICK: 

But that is  that is the 

4

key distinction between video on demand and the service 

5

that Aereo provides, the kinds of equipment and 

6

technology that Aereo provides.  We don't have a brief 

7

to defend the master copy because in the master copy 

8

situation, that is indisputably public because there is 

9

no right to exclude anyone else.  With Aereo's 

10

technology, if I'm making a copy using Aereo's system, 

11

no one else can look at it.  Even if you happen to have 

12

watched the same program, you can't watch my copy, I 

13

can't download it 

14
15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

your copy is different from my copy. 

16

 MR. FREDERICK: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

That's just saying 

Correct. 
But that's the 

reason we call them copies, because they're the same. 

19

 (Laughter.) 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

All I'm trying to 

21

get at, and I'm not saying it's outcome determinative or 

22

necessarily bad, I'm just saying your technological 

23

model is based solely on circumventing legal 

24

prohibitions that you don't want to comply with, which 

25

is fine.  I mean, that's  you know, lawyers do that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

But I'm just wondering why 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 whether you can 

4

give me any technological reason, apart from compliance 

5

with a particular legal regime, for your technological 

6

mind. 

7

 MR. FREDERICK: 

It is much simpler if you're 

8

a startup to add components, to add modules when you're 

9

starting up, ramping up.  And what we're talking about 

10

in any cloud computing industry is you're starting with 

11

one group of servers and then you add them, almost like 

12

Lego pieces, as you are adding the number of people that 

13

you're using.  That is a technological reason why the 

14

cloud works the way it does, Mr. Chief Justice. 

15

 So with Aereo's antennas and its DVRs, we 

16

can, with about the length of the size of this counsel 

17

table here, service tens of thousands of people in the 

18

New York area.  We can provide the antennas and we can 

19

provide the DVRs and it's a very compact, small space. 

20

And then if we expand and we're able to continue to be 

21

in business and we get more subscribers in Brooklyn, we 

22

might add another row that would be the size of  of 

23

the counsel tables behind me. 

24
25

 That aspect of the technology goes to the 
modules that are used for cloud computing where you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

basically can add additional servers, add additional 

2

hard disk space and then when new consumers activate 

3

and let me just be clear about this, when they sign up, 

4

their system is completely empty.  There's no content 

5

being provided.  There's equipment that's being 

6

provided.  So when they activate the system and they 

7

say, I want to watch the news at 6 o'clock, they then 

8

start the process that then fills their individually 

9

assigned storage with the 6 o'clock news.  But until 

10

that happens, there's no content being provided.  So the 

11

notion that they have in their reply brief over and over 

12

that we're somehow a content provider would mean that 

13

everybody who provides an antenna or a DVR is somehow a 

14

content provider.  And if that's true, then the 

15

implications for the equipment industry are obviously 

16

quite massive and you can understand why that would 

17

frighten the cloud computing industry because that turns 

18

them into public performers whenever they are handling 

19

content.  Now, the government says 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

They give the subscriber 

21

a menu, and it says you can get any of these things. 

22

It's not as though the  the subscriber initiates it. 

23

You have these choices and they're providing you these 

24

choices and those choices are content. 

25

 MR. FREDERICK: 

It's no different,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

Justice Ginsburg, than if I'm at home and I have an 

2

antenna or rabbit ears on my TV and I know what channels 

3

I can get. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Frederick, it's 

5

also  it's also no different from  from a user's 

6

perspective, it's exactly the same as if I'm watching 

7

cable.  Right?  You just have a different content 

8

selection, but it looks the same to you.  Somebody else 

9

is providing you with a menu, and then you pick off that 

10
11

menu. 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Right.  But the menu, 

12

Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg, is simply what is 

13

technologically available.  There are broadcast signals 

14

that are available in a local area, and they are limited 

15

because that's what the broadcasters make available. 

16

And simply providing a user guide that says you can tune 

17

to this channel or you can tune to that channel, if you 

18

want to pick up one program or another, can't be the 

19

difference between a content provider and merely 

20

merely facilitating the use of your equipment. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Would you  would you 

22

explain in a sentence or two, which will sound as if I'm 

23

favoring with you, but I want them to have a chance to 

24

reply, the thing that frightened me somewhat in your 

25

brief was, I think, of the cloud storing everybody's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

music.  Vast amounts of music.  And now they then send 

2

it down, perhaps to a million people at a time, who 

3

want to all hear the same song. 

4

 Now, what you said was, if I understood it, 

5

but explain it if it is, that there is a provision of 

6

the copyright law that says when that happens, it's 

7

subject to a compulsory license.  And if it's subject to 

8

a compulsory license, then, of course, people can get it 

9

and it's paid for by somebody.  But if we decide with 

10

them, there'd be a different provision that would come 

11

into play, namely, the performance, and it wouldn't be 

12

subject to the compulsory license.  There's no point 

13

telling me I'm right if I'm wrong.  What I want to know 

14

is am I  have I got your argument correctly?  And if 

15

not, what is it? 

16
17
18
19
20

 MR. FREDERICK: 

I think that your argument, 

Justice Breyer 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's not my argument.  It's 

a parody perhaps, or an incorrect version of your argument. 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Let me  okay.  Let me try 

21

to correct this.  There is no compulsory license with 

22

respect to music or video.  There are different 

23

compulsory licenses with respect to satellite and cable 

24

that capture all signals and push them down to everyone. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So that would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1
2

be the same then, it isn't going to be a problem. 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

No.  Where it's going to be 

3

a problem with the cloud is if you say  if I'm 

4

watching a particular program and you're watching a 

5

particular program and Justice Sotomayor is watching the 

6

same program, we are engaging  and the company that 

7

has allowed us to make a copy of that is engaging in 

8

public performance.  Where you have to deal with 

9

infringement is the concept of  of volition and the 

10

idea of who is doing the act.  If I'm simply making 

11

equipment available, then 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But it should work out in a 

13

parallel way.  That is, when I look at the program, I am 

14

making a copy of the program and, therefore, I'm 

15

violating the nonexclusive right  the exclusive right 

16

to copy.  Now, if that's fair use and therefore, I can 

17

do it, it should also be fair use if exactly the same 

18

thing happens but it comes from a cloud. 

19

 MR. FREDERICK: 

But let me  let me  let 

20

me further answer your question about music, because I 

21

omitted a key distinction, which is that for local radio 

22

broadcasts, there is a music distribution license.  It's 

23

under Section 115 of the Copyright Act. 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

 MR. FREDERICK: 

115(c)(3). 
Right.  But that's the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

whole  that is exactly the same way satellite and 

2

cable work, as well.  So that if you're broadcasting in 

3

the local area, it is for free.  It is like a 

4

copyrightfree zone.  And the reason for that in the 

5

music world is because they want local radio 

6

broadcasters to play songs because that drives sales of 

7

the records.  That's a totally different business model, 

8

of course, than in the television world. 

9

 But the reason why this matters for your 

10

perspective is that what the court  the Second Circuit 

11

in CableVision did was it said userspecific, 

12

userinitiated copies are private performances.  They 

13

are not public performances.  And the only way 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But now you're saying 

15

that AT&T system, Netflix, Hulu, all of those systems 

16

get their content and they don't push it down to you. 

17

They do exactly what you do.  They let you choose what 

18

you want to see. 

19

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Yeah.  The difference is 

20

that they do not exclude anyone.  And the difference 

21

the publicprivate distinction from property law 

22

is whether or not there's a right to exclude.  If I have 

23

private property, I exclude others.  If I have public 

24

property, I'm not excluding others.  Netflix, Hulu, 

25

those other services, they're not excluding anyone.  As

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

a user of those services, I have no right to exclude 

2

anyone else.  And so they are making their product, 

3

their content available to all without exclusion other 

4

than the subscription that you pay.  What we're doing is 

5

providing the equipment that enables people to access 

6

it. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you are seeking 

8

subscribers, legions of subscribers.  So I don't 

9

understand that.  You say they have to  are you 

10

selective, in that some people who want to use your 

11

service are going to be turned down?  You're not.  You 

12

will take anybody who can pay, right. 

13

 MR. FREDERICK: 

Sure.  And if we went around 

14

to a 1,000 or 10,000 homes in Brooklyn and we put up 

15

antennas, installed their DVRs for them, and we sent 

16

them a monthly bill every month to pay us because we had 

17

performed that service and provided that equipment, it 

18

would be the exact same position, Justice Ginsburg.  And 

19

that can't be a copyright violation. 

20

 Now, the only distinction the government has 

21

offered for why CableVision decision in the Second 

22

Circuit, and this goes to your question, 

23

Justice Kennedy, somehow should be different here, is in 

24

the supposed lawfulness of the first instance in which 

25

that content is received.  That distinction can't work

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

and would imperil the cloud.  Here is why.  When a 

2

person is accessing local overtheair broadcast 

3

television, it is doing so because that is free public 

4

spectrum.  And Sony says we have a fair use right in 

5

order to make a copy of that free use.  The government 

6

in the Fortnightly case argued that there is an 

7

impliedinlaw license when a person accesses local 

8

overtheair telecasts in that way.  So it can't be the 

9

distinction between our situation and CableVision that 

10

there is somehow some difference.  Because if I'm 

11

watching local overtheair broadcast TV in my home, I 

12

don't have to pay a royalty for it.  And that's exactly 

13

the analogy that would be appropriate there. 

14

 Now, how would that affect the cloud? 

Well, 

15

if you turn every type of performance that an individual 

16

makes from some content that gets downloaded or 

17

transferred from the cloud, the cloud provider can't 

18

tell what is legal or what is not legal.  Some stuff 

19

could be up there pirated.  Some stuff could be up there 

20

perfectly licensed.  And what the position of the other 

21

side in this case is, those people are liable for direct 

22

infringement of the public performance right.  And 

23

that's why the cloud industry is very concerned that if 

24

you have too expansive an interpretation of what is the 

25

public performance right, you are consigning them to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1
2

potentially ruinous liability. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Frederick, why isn't it 

3

sufficient to create a line such as the one Mr. Clement 

4

said, which said, you know, do you on the one hand 

5

supply or provide the content, that puts you in one box; 

6

on the other hand, if you are not supplying or providing 

7

the content, if the user is supplying and providing the 

8

content, and you are just providing the space, a kind of 

9

platform for them to do that and for them potentially to 

10
11

share the content, that puts you in another box? 
 MR. FREDERICK: 

Well, Justice Kagan, I note 

12

that my friend did not reference the words of the 

13

Transmit Clause at all when he offered that distinction. 

14

And that's actually quite important, because in order to 

15

get there, you have to make up words to put them in the 

16

Transmit Clause.  But even if you were to think that 

17

that was good for a policy reason, you would still have 

18

to explain why the hundreds of thousands of people that 

19

are subscribers to Aereo's service don't have exactly 

20

the same fair use right to get overtheair broadcast 

21

content that all of those people who are not Aereo 

22

subscribers but they happen to have a home antenna and a 

23

DVR.  Those people have every bit as right to get that 

24

access.  And the fact that they are doing it doesn't 

25

make their antenna or their antenna provider a content

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

provider.  As I said 


2


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Alright so why do people pay for the 

3

Aereo service if they can do the same thing all by 


4


themselves? 


5


 MR. FREDERICK: 

Because if you don't have to 

6

buy a TV, a DVR and an antenna and a sling box, which 

7

might cost you thousands of dollars, you might pay $100 

8

to rent it, or if you want to just look at programming 

9

selectively, you pay $8 a month, it's a rental service, 

10

Justice Ginsburg.  That can't change the copyright 

11

analysis.  And just because you rent equipment does not 

12

transform the person that is providing that equipment 

13

into a public performer, particularly when you are the 

14

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY PAUL D. CLEMENT 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 

23

 MR. CLEMENT: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

24

 Just a few points in rebuttal: 

25

 First, I just have to correct a fundamental

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

difference.  Mr. Frederick says, as he did in his red 

2

brief, that if you only  if you are a cable company 

3

and you only retransmit locally, you don't have to pay a 

4

royalty.  That is just wrong, as we point out in the 

5

reply brief.  There is a minimum royalty that every 

6

cable company pays whether or not they transmit distance 

7

signals.  So that is just wrong. 

8

 Second, this is not a case, as Mr. Frederick 

9

would like to say, where the user pushes a button, and 

10

then after that point, Aereo is just a hapless 

11

bystander.  And if you want insight into what actually 

12

happens behind the scenes, to use the phrase the 

13

District Court used, look at pages 64A to 67A of the 

14

petition appendix.  Because Judge Nathan explains all of 

15

the things that Aereo does after the consumer presses 

16

the button and before it comes back to them on their 

17

home screen.  They are not just a passive bystander. 

18

 Also, this whole notion of what is 

19

volitional.  Maybe in the reproduction concept, in 

20

context, just pushing a button and there is only one 

21

person who reproduces, but the concept of what is the 

22

requisite volitional conduct is answered by the Transmit 

23

Clause.  Congress specifically looked at this and said 

24

there are going to be lots of situations where the 

25

sender, usually the cable company or Aereo, sends a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

transmission to the user, and the sender of that 

2

transmission, if it allows a contemporaneous 

3

performance, unlike the record company, they are a 

4

transmitter.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

consequences of our decision today. 

7

 MR. CLEMENT: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

Mr. Waxman, tell me the 

Your consequences 
Do you put them out of 

business, or do they have to go and negotiate a license 

10

with every copyright holder?  The  you are, in fact, 

11

telling me they are not a cable company, they are not a 

12

satellite company, so they can't go into those systems 

13

of payment.  What happens then? 

14

 MR. CLEMENT: 

The consequences really gets 

15

back to the Chief Justice's question, which is, if they 

16

actually provide something that is a net benefit 

17

technologically, there's no reason people won't license 

18

them content.  But on the other hand, if all they have 

19

is a gimmick, then they probably will go out of business 

20

and nobody should cry a tear over that. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Once you take them out of 

22

the compulsory licensing system, they're going to have 

23

to find copyright owners, who owns James Agee's 

24

pictures?  Who owns something that was written by 

25

like a French silent film in 1915?  I mean, the problem

54
1

is that they might want to have perfectly good things 

2

that people want to watch and they can't find out how to 

3

get permission.  That is a problem that worries me and 

4

it worries me again once you kick them out of the other 

5

systems. 

6

 MR. CLEMENT: 

It's not a problem that should 

7

worry you because, first of all, if they need a 

8

compulsory license, maybe Congress can revisit it as it 

9

has in technologically specific ways for cable and 

10

satellite, but there is other ways to get content.  They 

11

can approach HBO

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But the Second 

Circuit 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you have some other 

rebuttal points? 
 MR. CLEMENT: 

I did, Your Honor, and one of 

17

them really gets to this HBO point, which is they want 

18

to say that this whole case is about reproduction and 

19

there's no public performance going on at all.  And to 

20

understand how crazy that is, with all due respect, if 

21

they approach HBO and say, we would like to carry your 

22

content and provide it as a premium service, they would 

23

be telling HBO, by the way, we don't need a public 

24

performance license.  All we need is a reproduction 

25

license because we don't involve ourselves in any public

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

performance at all, and that's why at the end of the day 

2

their argument simply blinks reality.  They provide 

3

thousands of paying strangers with public performances 

4

over the TV, but they don't publicly perform at all. 

5

It's like magic.

 Thank you, Your Honors.
