CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-800, Karen Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds.

Mr. Friedberg.


6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN C. FRIEDBERG


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


8

10

MR. FRIEDBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

There is at least a little irony in the fact


11

that Dean Witter is the litigant here before you, about 27


12

years past the time when it started with Dean Witter and


13

Byrd the -- the move toward closing the courthouse doors


14

to public investors and forcing them into industry-run


15

arbitration.

16

place a hurdle in the way of the public investor who


17

ironically at this point seeks to enforce an arbitration


18

agreement. 


19

Dean Witter is now back here attempting to


The issue today before the Court is the extent


20

to which the industry and Dean Witter may now invoke court


21

involvement to interfere with a customer's claims before


22

arbitration and -- and to decide whether the customer's


23

claims are timely under a section of an arbitration code


24

providing for a time limitation on eligibility.

25

is who decides. 


The issue


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It is clear that -- that over the years a


2

presumption has developed in favor of arbitrability where


3

there is an arbitration clause in a contract.

4

cases say that that presumption can only be overcome by


5

clear and convincing evidence that the parties agreed to


6

have a court decide arbitrability issues within a --


7

within the scope of an arbitration agreement.

8

case, there is no such evidence. 


And the


In this


The arbitration clause in the 1992 agreement

10

between the parties is as broad a clause as one can


11

imagine.

12

her and Dean Witter concerning or arising from any account


13

or any transaction involving Dean Witter and the client,


14

whether or not it occurred in the account, or the


15

construction, performance, or breach of this or any other


16

agreement between us.

17

arbitration clause, meant to be as broad as possible.

18

intent clearly is to move cases against brokers by


19

customers out of the courts and into arbitration.


20

The client agrees that all controversies between


It's an industry-designed

The


That -- that 1992 agreement was, of course,


21

followed by a 1997 submission agreement signed by


22

Ms. Howsam which merely states that as an undersigned


23

party, she and her trust submit the present matter in


24

controversy, as set forth in the attached statement of


25

claim, to arbitration in accordance with the Constitution,


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

by-laws, rules, regulations, and/or code of arbitration


2

procedure of the sponsoring organization.

3

it's the NASD, but the -- the other self-regulatory


4

organizations and exchanges have similar rules to the 6-


5

year rule.

QUESTION:

6

In this case,


It seems to me that some of the


7

language in First Options, which the respondent relies on


8

cuts against your case.

How -- how do you deal with that?


MR. FRIEDBERG:

9

Well, first of all, First


10

Options is a case in which there was a question about


11

whether an arbitration agreement existed, which is not the


12

case here.

13

wrote that -- that in that situation, the presumption


14

shifts. 


15

And Justice Breyer, writing for the Court,


The AT&T case -- clearly the -- when the


16

question is just the scope of an arbitration agreement,


17

but there is no question about the existence of the


18

agreement, there needs to be clear and unmistakable


19

evidence of an intent to have the courts decide rather


20

than the arbitrators decide.


21

QUESTION:

The respondents here, of course,


22

argue that because of the not to be submitted clause, the


23

6 years, that limits the scope of the -- of the


24

arbitration agreement.


25

MR. FRIEDBERG:

The -- the respondent, of


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

course, is -- is referring to rule 10304, which says that


2

-- that disputes which arose out of transactions or events


3

more than 6 years prior are not eligible for submission to


4

arbitration. 

First of all, that -- that rule is found in a


5
6

section of the arbitration code.

7

agreement itself.

8

of Arbitration Procedure. 


And it's found in a section of the Code


QUESTION:

9

It's not found in the


Well, so is 10324 which you're


10

relying on.

That is, the arbitrator shall be empowered to


11

interrupt and determine the applicability of.

12

that's --

MR. FRIEDBERG:

13

I mean,


Exactly, Justice Scalia.

And


14

the point I was -- was trying to make is that -- that the


15

code has to be read as -- as one code in that -- in that


16

respect. 


17

The -- it's also, I think, illuminating that the


18

-- the section, the 300 series of the code in which that


19

is found, is -- is not the eligibility section in the


20

sense that the 100 series is.

21

basically a procedural, instructive portion of the code


22

for the arbitrators to apply. 


23

The 300 series is -- is


There is some -- we -- we've made the argument


24

and -- and I think it's a valid argument -- that eligible


25

for submission can mean a number of things.

And -- and


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that it refers, in this case to -- it could refer in this


2

case to when the arbitrators take the case under


3

submission, just as this Court takes the case under


4

submission after the petition, after the briefing, after


5

the arguments are made. 

There -- there is, of course, the need to get


6
7

the case in front of a tribunal in order to -- to decide


8

whether or not the case is timely.

9

prevent the case from going all the way to the end zone,


So while the rule may


10

it -- it certainly doesn't prevent the -- the litigant


11

from or the -- the person arbitrating from -- from getting


12

out of the starting gate. 


13

Moreover --


14

QUESTION:

Is -- is that your criterion, that --


15

that -- the -- on -- on the question of what -Â­


16

arbitrability turns on the question, do you get in front


17

of the particular person or tribunal at all as opposed to


18

how long do you stay when you get there?

19

if -- if it's a question of whether you get there at all,


20

it's -- the question is arbitrability and the presumption


21

goes one way.

22

if you get in front of that person, that's not an


23

arbitrability question and the presumption goes the other


24

way.

25

In other words,


If the question is how long you stay there


Is that -- that's your point. 

MR. FRIEDBERG:

That -- that is one point,


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Souter. 

The -- the other point that -- that needs to be


2
3

made is that whether or not this is part of the code, part


4

of an agreement, it falls within the John Wiley and Moses


5

Cone case law as opposed to the First Options holding. 


6

And in -- in John Wiley, if the Court will recall, there


7

were prerequisites, timeliness prerequisites, to filing


8

for arbitration, which the Court said, because there was


9

an arbitration agreement and there was no dispute about


10

that, were for the arbitrators to decide. 

In Moses H. Cone Hospital, there were -- there


11
12

were prerequisites of timeliness.

13

arbitration had to be filed within 30 days after an


14

opinion by an architect as to the disputed contracting


15

claims.

16

clearly said in Moses Cone that the Federal Arbitration


17

Act establishes as a matter of Federal law that any doubts


18

concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be


19

resolved in favor of arbitration, whether the contract


20

involves construction of the contract language itself or


21

an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to


22

arbitrability. 


23

The -- as I recall, the


And so -- and -- and the Court -- the Court


QUESTION:

-- definition of the domain of


24

arbitrability?

You're saying shall be eligible for


25

submission just means that the arbitration forum doesn't


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

get to the merits if more than 6 years have elapsed.

2

-- so you say that's not a question of arbitrability but


3

how the arbitrator will proceed. 


4

What is your definition of arbitrability? 


5

MR. FRIEDBERG:

But


Justice Ginsburg, our -- our


6

definition of arbitrability I think has to be broader than


7

that.

8

There is the --


9

But there is -- there is the merits arbitrability. 


QUESTION:

Well, the question that doesn't go to


10

the arbitrator -- you're saying this one does.

11

he has to take it up first -- or she.

12

with, if it's a question of arbitrability, the courts


13

decide it.

14

the -- the range of other questions, then it's for the


15

arbitrator. 


16

It's just


But we're dealing


If it's not a question of arbitrability, but


So my question is, what -- the domain for the


17

court -- the question is it arbitrable is a question for


18

the court.

19

What is the content of that label, arbitrable?


MR. FRIEDBERG:

It's a hard question for me to


20

get my hands around, Justice Ginsburg, but there -- there


21

is no question that in the first instance the court has to


22

decide whether a claim is -- is arbitrable.

23

the court finds that -- that there is an arbitration


24

clause that covers the merits of the dispute, then the


25

court should defer to arbitrators on any question


And -- and if


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regarding scope. 


2

QUESTION:

Well, now --


3

MR. FRIEDBERG:

4

QUESTION:

I don't think --


-- this -- this is a contract matter.


5

Right?

I mean, if -- if the parties clearly didn't want


6

the arbitrator to do this and wanted the court to do it,


7

you -- you don't dispute that the court would do it. 


8

Right? 

MR. FRIEDBERG:

9

Right. 


10

QUESTION:

11

Now, you concede the point that arbitrability is


12

for the courts.

So it's just a question of contract.


Right? 


13

MR. FRIEDBERG:

14

QUESTION:

Right. 


So presumably if 10304 had read no


15

dispute, claim, or controversy shall be arbitrable, okay,


16

under -- under this code where 6 years have elapsed, that


17

would -- would that exclude this from -- from the


18

arbitrator?


19

MR. FRIEDBERG:

20

QUESTION:

I believe not, Justice Scalia.


My goodness, it's using the exact


21

term that you concede sends it over to the -- to the


22

court. 


23

MR. FRIEDBERG:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well --


It -- what do you have to do beyond


using the -- the very word that you say bounces it to the


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court?

They say it.

It shall not be arbitrable.

2

even that will not -- will not get it to the courts.

3

-- what does one have to do to get it to the courts?


4

MR. FRIEDBERG:

5

QUESTION:

And

What


Well --


And my next question is going to be,


6

is there a whole lot of difference between saying it shall


7

not be arbitrable and saying, it shall not be eligible for


8

submission to arbitration? 


9

MR. FRIEDBERG:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FRIEDBERG:

12

I'm not --


And I don't think there is. 

I don't think there is either,


Justice Scalia. 


13

QUESTION:

14

me so hard on this.

Okay.

Which is why you're fighting


Right? 


15

(Laughter.) 


16

MR. FRIEDBERG:

17

I think what we have to do is look to the case


Precisely. 


18

law, including the ATT case and -- and its progeny, and


19

First Options says the same thing really, that the court


20

has to decide in the first instance is there an


21

arbitration agreement.

22

it's undisputed -- that there is an arbitration agreement,


23

then the question is, does it go to the substance of the


24

case or is it a matter of the scope?

25

starting with the Gulf and Warrior --


Having decided -- and in this case


And the cases say,


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION:

What happened to the intent of the


parties?


3

MR. FRIEDBERG:

4

QUESTION:

That -- that's what --


I mean, you're talking as -- as


5

though this is some law being sent down from on high.

6

thought we established that step one is what did the


7

parties intend. 


8

MR. FRIEDBERG:

9

QUESTION:

I


Right. 


And you say that even if the parties


10

say it's not arbitrable, well, that doesn't matter.

11

still go through this -- this game that seems to come down


12

from on high. 


13

MR. FRIEDBERG:

We


But the question is who will


14

decide a certain issue of arbitrability, and AT&T and --


15

and Moses H. Cone and First Options even says that once


16

you find that there's an agreement to arbitrate the


17

substance of the -- the dispute, then the question is did


18

the parties, by unmistakable evidence, agree that the


19

courts, rather than the arbitrators, would decide that


20

scope issue.


21
22

QUESTION:

So then you're saying arbitrability


under our cases is not for the court necessarily.


23

MR. FRIEDBERG:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I'm saying --


I mean, you can't have it both ways.

There -- there's a --


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

If you say arbitrability is for the


2

courts, then if the -- if the agreement between the


3

parties says this is not arbitrable, that question of --


4

of whether those facts exist or not ought to be for the


5

courts. 


6

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I think that's true for that


7

threshold issue, but if we get to a point where all issues


8

that -- that may preclude ultimately submitting the case


9

to the arbitrators for determination have to be decided by


10
11

the court, then we're running afoul of John Wiley.

QUESTION:

I -- I didn't understand it that way. 


12

I thought the question was not what the parties intend. 


13

It's how we find out what they intend.

14

we're trying to decide between a tough burden of proof


15

standard on that that favors courts and where you apply no


16

burden of proof standard or, if anything, favor the


17

arbitration.

18

what the party intended.

19

court unless there is clear and convincing evidence they


20

wanted this arbitrable.

21

In both instances, we're trying to find out


Breyer, although --


23

QUESTION:

25

But we assume that they intended


Am I right? 


MR. FRIEDBERG:

22

24

And I thought


I think you're wrong, Justice


Because?

Then I may not have stated


it correctly.

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I think what -- what the --


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

again, what the initial issue for the Court is, did the


2

parties agree to arbitrate the substance of the dispute.


3

QUESTION:

Yes, of course, and I thought what 


4

my opinion said was that when we're trying to decide


5

whether they agreed to arbitrate or not, we apply a fairly


6

tough standard.

7

they did. 


8
9

They have to show rather clearly that


What were the -- what was the word you quoted at

the beginning from the opinion?

Didn't you quote a phrase


10

that said on that -- in deciding whether an issue is


11

arbitrable, we apply the standard of?


12
13

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I believe I quoted from the


Moses H. Cone --


14

QUESTION:

Yes.

15

MR. FRIEDBERG:

I'm sorry.

You go ahead.


-- decision which -- which says


16

-- which says that the presumption is in favor of the


17

arbitrator's deciding. 


18
19
20

QUESTION:
not communicating.
QUESTION:

I'll get the phrase and then -- I'm

I'm sorry. 

I -- Justice Ginsburg asked a


21

question that I'm also interested in.

Quite apart from


22

the reference of -- in the agreement to the fact that the


23

arbitrator shall decide this, your second argument, on


24

your first argument, what do you want me to say if I write


25

the opinion or another member of the Court writes the


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

opinion in your favor?

If the essence of the dispute


2

involves the particular issue, then that is arbitrable and


3

that's for the arbitrators to decide?


4

MR. FRIEDBERG:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

us to write.

No.

I --


I -- I just don't know what you want


It's the same question Justice Ginsburg had.


MR. FRIEDBERG:

Justice Kennedy, it's basically


8

what was announced in the AT&T case when it was sent back


9

to the court to decide who decides certain questions.

10

Court should decide in this case that where there's a


11

valid, written agreement to arbitrate the subject matter


12

or the merits of the dispute, particularly where the


13

arbitration clause encompasses all controversies and the


14

parties have not clearly and unmistakably reserved certain


15

issues of arbitrability for a court decision and -- and I


16

mean, within the scope as opposed to the basic dispute --


17

the presumption in favor of arbitrability should apply,


18

and issues relating to the scope of the arbitration


19

agreement are for the arbitrators. 


The


20

And in this case -- AT&T, when the Court sent


21

the case back to the lower court said, these issues are


22

for the arbitrators to decide unless you find unmistakable


23

evidence that the parties agreed -- and this is the intent


24

of the parties -- that the court would decide. 


25

I -- I would like to reserve --

QUESTION:

Mr. Friedberg, do you disagree with


2

the Government?

The Government did say there are two


3

considerations.

The first one you agree with obviously,


4

whether the parties entered into a binding arbitration


5

agreement.

6

question, that is, whether the subject matter of the


7

dispute falls within the scope of that agreement.

8

are the two things.

9

the one, did they agree to arbitrate.


10

And then the Government says there's a second


Those


You seem to be saying there's only


MR. FRIEDBERG:

No.

I'm not -- obviously I'm


11

not doing a very good job of expressing our position. 


12

Where the subject matter of the dispute, the merits-


13

related issue -- as in First Options, it was the question


14

of whether the Kaplans owed money or not -- is within an


15

arbitration agreement, then any ancillary type dispute as


16

to timeliness should go to the arbitrators to --


17

QUESTION:

What -- what if I have an arbitration


18

agreement that says all -- all disputes arising from an --


19

an accident on the employer's premises shall be


20

arbitrable, and the issue is whether this accident


21

occurred on the employer's premises or not?

22

parties -- or the -- the employer contends that this


23

injury occurred elsewhere entirely.

24

it occurred on the premises or elsewhere? 


25

MR. FRIEDBERG:

One of the


Who decides whether


I think in the first instance


16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the court would decide that because the parties did not


2

agree to arbitrate any claims. 


3
4

QUESTION:

Why is that different from here?

The


parties --


5

MR. FRIEDBERG:

6

QUESTION:

Because --


-- did not agree to arbitrate any


7

claims that -- with -- with regard to an accident that did


8

not occur on different premises, but that incurred --


9

occurred more than 6 years before.


10

MR. FRIEDBERG:

11

QUESTION:

Because --


They didn't agree to arbitrate it. 


12

They said it shall be -- shall not be eligible for


13

submission to arbitration. 


14

MR. FRIEDBERG:

Because of the principle,


15

Justice Scalia, set out in the John Wiley case and the


16

Moses H. Cone --


17

QUESTION:

But I don't see how that principle


18

applies -- doesn't apply here, but applies in the other


19

premises situation.

20

between the two. 


21

I -- I just don't see any distinction


MR. FRIEDBERG:

I -- I think because the Court


22

has previously said that a timeliness issue is -- is a


23

procedural issue.

24

substantive issues, of course, but --


25

It's intertwined with -- with


QUESTION:

Well, can't you make it a -- I mean,


17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's up to the parties, who are masters of their


2

agreement.

3

condition of the arbitration, surely they can do it, can't


4

they? 


5
6
7

If they want to make timeliness part of the


MR. FRIEDBERG:

They could but they didn't in


this case.

QUESTION:

What you're saying, I guess, is that


8

if the -- if the allegation of harm falls within the


9

subject of the arbitration clause, everything goes to the


10

arbitrator unless they have unmistakably said that some


11

subsidiary issue does not.

12
13

MR. FRIEDBERG:

Is that --


That -- that is what our


position is. 


14

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Friedberg.


15

Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you. 


16

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS


17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


18

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS


19
20

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


21

For two reasons the question whether


22

petitioners' claims were submitted within the 6-year time


23

limit is for the arbitrators to decide. 


24
25

First, as this Court held nearly 40 years ago in

John Wiley, when the parties have agreed to submit the


18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

subject matter of the underlying dispute to arbitration,


2

the question whether the dispute was presented within a


3

contractual time limit is presumptively for the


4

arbitrators even if the time limit is a prerequisite that


5

conditions the duty to arbitrate. 


6

Second, the time limit in this case is imposed


7

by the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure, which the


8

parties incorporated into their agreement in full.


9

QUESTION:

What is -- what is the general


10

principle that Justice Ginsburg was asking for that


11

controls your first conclusion? 


12

MR. ROBERTS:

Okay.

Arbitrability is, as used


13

in the Court's cases, a term of art that includes two


14

questions.

15

are bound by a valid arbitration agreement and the other


16

question is whether the subject matter of their underlying


17

dispute is within the scope of that agreement.

18

subject matter of their underlying dispute, what I mean is


19

whether they agreed to arbitrate disputes about the


20

primary conduct that -- that is given rise to the -- to


21

the underlying claim. 


22

One of those questions is whether the parties


And by the


And what the Court held in -- in John Wiley is


23

once the parties -- once the court has determined that the


24

parties have agreed to arbitrate disputes arising out of


25

the -- the underlying conduct that's at issue, then

questions about their litigation conduct and how those --


2

how that dispute was processed after it arose -- those are


3

presumptively for the arbitrators to decide.

QUESTION:

4

What was the text in John Wiley &


5

Sons?

6

did the agreement say that no controversy shall be


7

eligible for submission to arbitration? 


8
9

What was the language of the agreement?

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Did it --


The -- the


agreement didn't use that -- that language.

It said the


10

failure of either party to file a grievance within this


11

Why?

But the point --

Let me put it to -- to

reading of this clause, shall be -- shall not be eligible

MR. ROBERTS:

6

MR. ROBERTS:

The --


This is not phrased as a statute.

There may be differences, Your


7

Honor, but -- but the -- the time limit language, the

eligible for submission language, what that indicates is

that the timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to

arbitration of the merits of the claim.

MR. ROBERTS:

You presume -- you presume that


2

because if the parties didn't -- didn't contemplate that


3

they would arbitrate about disputes arising from the --


4

from the underlying conduct, which that goes to, then they


5

presumably didn't think the arbitrators were going to have

anything to do with any questions connected with such a

dispute.

But when they did -- no.

They didn't think they were going to


arbitrate about any matter that occurred more than 6 years

previously.


11

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

When --


And therefore, they didn't think the


13

arbitrator would be the one to decide whether it occurred


14

6 years previously or not.

MR. ROBERTS:

They agreed and there's -- there's

There are all sorts of

characteristics of a claim:

distinguishing one of those characteristics from another


You -- you've given us no -- no basis for


10

as far as whether the court or -- or the arbitrator


11

decides. 


12

MR. ROBERTS:

13

QUESTION:

I --


I suggest that a very clear basis is


14

what the parties themselves have said.

When they have


15

referred to a particular characteristic as being non-


16

arbitrable, it means that the question of whether that


17

issue -- whether that -- that fact rendering it non-


18

arbitrable exists is a question for the courts.

19

that would solve a lot of cases.

20

else you -- you -- you distinguish where from when from


21

between which people. 


22

MR. ROBERTS:

That --


And I don't know how


My -- my distinction is between


23

and it's the distinction the Court drew in the John Wiley


24

case and that the courts of appeals have followed for 40


25

years except in -- in the limited context of the question

presented here.

It's the -- the distinction that's --


2

that's been embodied in the Uniform Arbitration Act, which


3

is cited on page 14 of the reply brief.

4

distinction between the primary conduct and whether


5

there's a limit on what primary conduct is subject to


6

arbitrability and other questions about -- about


7

litigating conduct. 


It's the


And the -- the rule that would focus on the


8
9

language of -- of the parties and parse that language to


10

see whether it's phrased as a limit of arbitrability, to


11

then decide whether the presumption in favor of courts


12

deciding the question of arbitrability imposes an extra


13

layer of complexity that doesn't -- it's not likely to


14

reflect the -- the real intent of the parties. 

The -- what we're trying to figure out is not


15
16

whether the parties thought this was a question of


17

arbitrability, but who they intended to decide the -- who


18

they intended to decide the question.

19

the underlying claim is within the scope of their


20

agreement, it's likely that they intended that ancillary


21

questions would be decided by the party that they


22

committed the underlying dispute to.

But even setting that aside, here we've got

25

And the -- and when

Their language reflects their

5

It's more likely to be reflected by

some arbitrary rule that if it relates to place, yes; if


7

it relates to time, no.

MR. ROBERTS:

8
9

It reflects their intent that --


that timely submission of a claim is a prerequisite to


10

arbitration of the merits of that claim.

But it doesn't


11

reflect their intent of who is to decide whether the


12

prerequisite is -- is met.

13

anything about that. 


There's -- it doesn't say


Rule 10324, which is also a part of the parties'


14
15

agreement, does say something about that.

It says that


16

the arbitrator shall be empowered to interpret and


17

determine the applicability of all code provisions.

18

the time limit is a code provision.

that, regardless of the issue that we're discussing, is

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Roberts, are you saying

essentially the parties have an agreement to arbitrate,


4

and that looks like very broad, any and all questions, and


5

then there's this code of procedure?

6

code is directed to is how, if the arbitrator has


7

authority, the arbitrator is to proceed.

8

essentially what you're saying? 


9

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

So what the NASD


Is that


It's -- it's concerned --


10

the -- the code is concerned with the rules of the


11

arbitrable forum, and it makes sense that the arbitrators


12

are the ones to interpret and apply those rules.

13

that's confirmed by Rule 10324. 


And


But -- but yes, the -- the question whether a


14
15

claim is timely submitted goes not to the character of the


16

underlying claim at the time it arose and whether claims


17

of that character are subject to arbitration.

position?

20

litigation chaos? 


And haven't we got to take that


Because otherwise we're just going to have


MR. ROBERTS:

21

Yes.

completely undermine the purpose of arbitration, Your

resolution, and moving all these questions into antecedent

10

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

12

Yes. 


Because it says nothing about if the


case were in court what the limitation would be. 

MR. ROBERTS:

13

Yes.

It's a forum-specific limit,

MR. STARR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:

Let me begin with what we believe to be the


8

fundamental point in the case.

the opening arguments, and that is, this is in fact


10
11

determined by contract.

It has been mentioned in


What did the parties intend?


In response to the specific question posed by


12

Justice Ginsburg, the language of AT&T we think is quite


13

pertinent.

14

parties' agreement creates a duty for the parties to


15

arbitrate the particular grievance, not whether there's an


16

arbitration clause at that level of generality.


17

It says arbitrability simply means whether the

21

that, in the absence of unmistakable language, then we're


22

going to have a trial before every arbitration if there is


23

any procedural or other defense that could be raised.

The grievance has got to refer to the

that.

But let me go to your point with respect to

litigation chaos. 

QUESTION:

Wait.

Before you do that, do you

disagree with -- what he said the -- I thought that your


6

-- your -- you would accept what he says, but that -- that

your point is that the primary conduct causing the injury

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

12
13

It is --

-- and not conduct that occurred


before 6 years. 

MR. STARR:

It is going to the issue of what did

AT&T mean by the specific word grievance.

15

10304 is is a clear statement by the parties, leaving the

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

It's eligible --

Okay.

-- eligible for submission. 

But submission -- I just don't see


5

how submission can decide this case because you can say


6

the -- the ultimate issue is submitted when the -- when


7

the whole case goes to the arbitrator, or you can say it


8

is submitted when the arbitrator gets beyond procedural

issues and gets down to the issue of the primary conduct

that caused the injury.


11

MR. STARR:

12

QUESTION:

13

Justice Souter --

So I don't see how submission is --


is going to be the -- the deciding factor. 

MR. STARR:

14

Justice Souter, we would guide the


15

Court first to the word eligible for submission.

16

-- and the NASD has described -- and we set this forth at


17

page 25 of the brief -- specifically what it means in this


18

context.

19

found in rule 6 of the Court, and what it means is if


20

you're not eligible, you don't get to this podium.

21

don't go to the forum. 


22

But eligible is a very familiar term.

Eligible


It is


You


And the parties are -- I think what is


23

essentially dividing the parties here today is that there


24

is some sense that because of John Wiley & Sons, the


25

parties cannot agree to a temporal restriction.

That


30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

makes no sense whatever, and indeed it's inconsistent with


2

the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress' policy. 

QUESTION:

3

But you can agree to a temporal


4

restriction and still not commit yourself as to who


5

decides whether that restriction is true.

MR. STARR:

6

And that guides us -- you're exactly


7

right, and so you then go to what is that temporal


8

restriction, and let's analyze that temporal restriction. 


9

We believe the words --

QUESTION:

10

But if the temporal restriction then

were phrased in terms of no relief shall be granted on a

MR. STARR:

8

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the


9

submission agreement in 1997 -- and this is commonplace. 


10

In that submission agreement, the petitioner did, indeed,


11

agree to submit the issue for arbitration to the NASD


12

under the rules. 

QUESTION:

13

No, no.

To one of three -- I think


14

they agreed to submit to one of -- one of three or four


15

different arbitrators, and they happened to pick this one.


16

And if the other arbitrator had different rules, it would


17

have had a different result. 


18

MR. STARR:

But they -- they don't, and that's

the assurance I want to give and why it's odd that the SEC

has been silent on this.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

PaineWebber v. Hofmann -- we quote that language at page

20.

Webster's, it can only have one reasonable meaning, and


4

that is qualified for it.

12 years ago he said, looking at the dictionary, at

5

And there needs to be a gatekeeper.

6

under this Court's presumption -- this Court's law and


7

it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act as well

-- it makes sense for the courts to be the gatekeeper.


9

And it is,


And I want to come, if I may, to Justice


10

Souter's concern about litigation chaos.

11

The rule that is being suggested here ushers in all manner


12

of difficulties and we would describe or refer the Court,


13

in particular -- this is in our brief -- to the Edward


14

Jones v. Sorrells case.

15

the following kind of question.

16

No one went to court, but an eligibility defense offered


17

to the arbitrators.

18
19
20
21
22

To the contrary. 


The Seventh Circuit had before it

Eligibility claim made. 


The arbitrators simply noted it.


Some of these arbitrations go on for years. 

Literally 2 years is not unknown in the industry. 

In that particular case, the arbitrators never

decided the eligibility issue. 

And the NASD has said this -- we refer you to


23

page 7 of our brief, as well as page 25.

There was a need


24

for the eligibility rule -- for that rule to be clear and


25

for there to be a gatekeeper.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that -- that what it


2

says, this rule says -- one interpretation of it,


3

plausible interpretation, is arbitrators decide the


4

eligibility question first. 

Do you agree, Mr. Starr, that this 6-year rule


5
6

is a rule for the arbitration forum?

That is, suppose


7

this dispute now goes to court and the court says, we


8

think that the 6-year limit has not been met.

9

customer says, fine, court, but under New York law, the


Then the


10

limit, if we're in court, is 10 years and I'm well within


11

that.

12

limit, is for the arbitration forum only, not for the


13

dispute.


14

This is a limit, as I understand it, this 6-year


MR. STARR:

That is correct.

But the issue is


15

who then decides whether this forum -- who is the


16

gatekeeper?

17

That's what's before you. 


QUESTION:

That's now -- now, that's my puzzle


18

because isn't it odd that a limitation period that applies


19

only in the arbitration forum is then decided by a court


20

where the court would have a different limitation? 


21

MR. STARR:

Not -- not at all because if there


22

is a different limitation -- and, indeed, 10304 draws the


23

very distinction between the eligibility requirement to


24

get in the door of arbitration as opposed to a statute of


25

limitation which might vary.

Now, the 6-year limitation -- the eligibility

And that's the NASD in the Federal -- what's it


MR. STARR:

Yes.

The self-regulatory


16

organization, which is what the NASD and the exchanges


17

are, submit their proposed rules to the SEC which could


18

change this at the stroke of a pen.

19

for lo these years while these issues have been


20

languishing in -- in the courts.


21
22

QUESTION:

I -- I would like to get back to the


question --


23

MR. STARR:

24

QUESTION:

25

It has not done so


Yes.

Well, why is these interpretations


that are not part of the agreement that the respondent or


35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the petitioner here signed -- why are they binding on the


2

petitioner? 

MR. STARR:

3

Because she agreed in the submission


4

agreement to be bound by arbitration under the code of


5

procedure.

6

signed, which goes back to paragraph 19 --


It's an express agreement by her which she


QUESTION:

7

Well, so we're just talking here,


8

when you say the NASD has said, this is incorporated in


9

the code of procedure which she agreed to be bound by?


10

MR. STARR:

11

QUESTION:

12

No. 

Okay.

I thought -- I thought you


said something else. 

MR. STARR:

13

What I tried to say is that the NASD


14

has described the reasons for the rule to which she


15

agrees.


16

QUESTION:

17

MR. STARR:

Well, why should that bind her?

It binds her only in the sense of it


18

helps the Court understand what the background of the rule


19

is.

20

does the rule mean and what's the purpose of the rule.

21

think, Mr. Chief --


22

QUESTION:

She is bound the rule.

We are now moving to what

We


Well, supposing I enter into a


23

contract with Sears and, say, I'll pay $300 for something,


24

and then Sears has a publication which says, you know,


25

here's the warranty and, okay, you get the warranty.

And


36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

then Sears puts out a magazine and says, what we really


2

mean in this warranty is A, B, C.

3

doesn't affect the terms -- how you interpret the terms of


4

the warranty. 

MR. STARR:

5
6

There may very well be, under those


circumstances, an issue of whether there was a contract. 

The other side doesn't dispute that there is a


7
8

Now, certainly that


contract and that the NASD rule is a part of the contract.

QUESTION:

9

But it's the NASD's interpretation of


10

the rule.

11

a view as to what the contract means, I just don't think


12

it binds the other side. 


13

I mean, if you have a private entity expressing


MR. STARR:

I'm not suggesting binding


14

authority.

15

by the NASD's explanation, which also goes to the purpose. 


16

Why is this?

17

is a rule that is borne of experience of the entire


18

industry --


19

I'm suggesting that illumination is provided


Is this simply an arbitrary rule?

QUESTION:

No.

It


But, Dr. Starr, can I ask you a


20

question about the meaning of the rule?

It may not really


21

be germane to this ques -- but I've been puzzled. 


22

Supposing you had a case in which the conduct occurred 7


23

years ago and it was fraudulently concealed until 1 year


24

before the arbitration is requested.

25

arbitrable or not?


Would that be


37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. STARR:

Well, there would be an issue that


2

the Court would then analyze what is the occurrence or


3

event.

QUESTION:

4
5

Well, I'm talking about the


occurrence is 7 years ago. 

MR. STARR:

6

And -- and in terms of purchase or


7

sale of security, it might very well that that would not


8

be arbitrable in this industry because of the occurrence


9

or event.

There are also, as the Court knows, statutes of


10

repose in the statute of limitation -- in -- in the


11

Federal securities context as well. 


12

But the point is the --


13

QUESTION:

14
15

So this is an absolute rule without


any tolling provision.

MR. STARR:

That's correct.

It -- it is a


16

absolute eligibility rule that simply tells the person --


17

and again, there's no choice here in the sense of if she


18

had gone to the New York Stock Exchange or the American


19

Stock Exchange because the rule is exactly the same.


20

QUESTION:

But I'd -- I'd like you to go back to


21

what I thought was the key question, Justice Ginsburg's


22

initial question.

23

What is this term arbitrability?


That the context -- I've gotten not to an


24

answer, but I've gotten to a beginning with First Options. 


25

First Options says that the question of whether you agreed


38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to arbitration is basically a matter of intent and apply


2

State law.

That's the basic rule. 


3

Then there's a subsidiary rule.

4

is, but if what you're interested in is whether the


5

parties agreed to arbitrate the question of arbitrability


6

-- see Justice Ginsburg says what is that -- at subsidiary


7

rule, what you do is assume that silence means no because


8

only if it's clear and unmistakable. 


9

The subsidiary


Then First Options goes on to say we'll give you


10

a couple of examples.

11

particular merits-related dispute is arbitrable because it


12

was within the scope of a valid arbitration agreement,


13

that is not a question of arbitrability.

14

Because the parties, after all, have a contract for


15

arbitrability.

They thought about the question of


16

arbitrability.

It won't -- it -- it's all very likely


17

that they wanted this whole thing to be arbitrable.

18

then they give you an example of where it is, where there


19

is no contract, where there is nothing, where the parties


20

never thought about arbitration, in all likelihood. 


21

An example whether or not a


Why not? 


And


Now, with those examples, it seems to me that


22

we're honing in on but we don't have yet an answer to the


23

question Justice Ginsburg asked.

24

contract and it's a thing they likely thought about and


25

it's sort of a minor subsidiary thing and, after all, it's


Well, if there's a


39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

something that the arbitrator knows about and courts


2

don't, that would all say it's not about arbitrability in


3

the sense of requiring a special presumption.

4

there's nothing at all in writing, if it's something


5

courts know about, there is. 


6

All right.

That's where I am.

But if


That doesn't


7

help you because I think in this case, yours would fall in


8

the first category.

9

response because I -- I need my thinking developed on


10
11

But, nonetheless, I'd appreciate a


this.

MR. STARR:

Justice Breyer, I believe that the


12

question of arbitrability, the duty, and who decides that


13

question is guided by the -- is determined by the intent


14

of the parties. 


15

QUESTION:

16

MR. STARR:

And we agree with that. 

We now look to the contract. 


17

There's some discussion as what does the contract include. 


18

The parties have been in agreement that the contract


19

includes the rules, including 10304.

20

specific and targeted provision, that we then go to that


21

rule, and we say, what is the parties' intent with respect


22

to whether this issue is eligible -- this matter, dispute,


23

claim, or controversy shall be eligible for submission. 


24

It does not say specifically the courts are going to


25

decide that.

Right?

That is the most


But the First Options presumption,


40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

since the language is not clear that the court shall


2

decide it, is that that is the baseline.

3

fact, the default position unless, indeed, the parties


4

have clearly and unmistakably provided that that is an


5

issue for the arbitrator.


6

QUESTION:

7

MR. STARR:

That is, in


Which brings you to 10324.

And 10324 is, in fact, a broadly


8

worded provision that says on its face that the


9

arbitrators are empowered to decide, to interpret, and the


10

like, the provisions of the code.

Several points.

11

The first is this is a very


12

general, as opposed to a quite specific, provision, and


13

when we then analyze it, and we analyze it in the context


14

of the remainder of the code -- and I would guide the


15

Court especially to rule -- or section 10104 that says


16

arbitrators shall be appointed --


17

QUESTION:

Where do we find that in your brief?


18

MR. STARR:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STARR:

21

And that's 10304.

10104 is at page 35 --

Thank you. 

-- of the brief, Mr. Chief Justice.

And then at the bottom


22

paragraph, 10104 says that arbitrators shall be appointed


23

by whom?

24

shall be eligible for submission under the code.

25

words, when we take the code and we look at various


The director of arbitration only for cases that

The powers of the


But are not -- but that those --


11

those provisions are not ones that the court decides


12

either.


13

And I'd like you, Mr. Starr, to tell me why I'm


14

wrong, because I take it from your argument you would say


15

I'm wrong, in saying we have an agreement to arbitrate


16

signed by the broker and the customer.

as broad as you can get.

auspices, these are the procedural rules, including

and not after you've decided the merits.

22

1

What is wrong with that division?


2

MR. STARR:

Because it is building in a


3

procedural versus subject matter distinction, a sort of


4

way of looking at the code as opposed to determining --


5

and you used the term, Justice Ginsburg, statute of


6

limitations.

7

would guide the Court again -- refer the Court to the


8

second sentence of 10304 which draws the distinction --


9

this also goes back to Justice Kennedy's question -- that


This is not a statute of limitations.

with respect to this -- the first sentence tells us, 6
