We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 10-507, Pacific Operators

Offshore v. Valladolid.

Mr. Clement.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The straightforward question in this case is

12

whether the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides a

13

remedy for a worker injured in a forklift mishap on dry

14

land.

15

from operations on dry land has a remedy in the State

16

workers' compensation law, but not from OCSLA's

17

extension of the Longshore Act to the outer continental

18

shelf.

19

Ninth Circuit here held that the accident occurred too

20

far inland for direct coverage under the Longshore Act.

21

The answer is no.

A worker injured on dry land

Indeed, both the Benefits Review Board and the

land, do you -- where do you put the 3-mile State

Mr. Chief Justice.

If there were platforms on there

2

that were themselves treated as land, that might be.

3

think most of the 3 miles from shore is going to be the

4

navigable waters, and that might be covered, for

5

example, directly under the Longshore Act.

6

say, one of the anomalies here is there was a direct

7

Longshore Act claim in this case, and the determination

8

was that the facility here was too far inland for direct

9

coverage under the Longshore Act.

I

But as I

So, therefore, the counterintuitive

10
11

proposition on the other side of the table today is that

12

in extending the Longshore Act to the outer continental

13

shelf, Congress effectively created a boomerang effect

14

that caused the Longshore Act to apply further inland

15

than it otherwise would.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, just to follow

17

up on the Chief Justice's question, if there's a

18

helicopter crash in the water, let's say it occurs 2.5

19

miles from the shore, is that covered?

20

would it be covered if it occurred 3.5 miles from the

21

shore?

22

MR. CLEMENT:

And, similarly,

Well, Justice Kagan, I think

23

the best answer is both of those crashes would be

24

covered directly by the Longshore Act because the

25

Longshore Act by its own terms, not extended by OCSLA,
4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

covers the navigable waters, and both of those would be

2

accidents occurring in the navigable waters.

3

part of this Court's opinion in the Pacific Operators

4

case addressing the DOHSA claim, this Court said that a

5

helicopter effectively, when it's performing this kind

6

of ferrying function, is a vessel.

7

that the right answer there is not that OCSLA extends

8

the Longshore Act, but the Longshore Act applies

9

directly under those circumstances.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10

And in the

So, I would think

The curious thing about this

11

case is that the statutory language seems to me to speak

12

quite clearly to some theory of causation.

13

14

outer continental shelf.

Maybe it's but-for, maybe it's proximate, but it's some

22

talk first about the causation and then about the

23

smuggling, if I can.

24

is both causation in this 1333(b) and a situs

25

requirement that both sides acknowledge.

As to the causation, I think there

5

Alderson Reporting Company

At a bare

Official

minimum, there have to be injuries resulting from


2

operations conducted on the shelf.

3

alone, that causation principle alone, if faithfully


4

applied, is enough to decide this case in our favor.


5
6

And I think that


But let me address the smuggling, because I
do think --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Give me an example of a --

8

of an injury that occurs on the shelf that is not a

9

consequence of operations conducted.

10

What -- just

beachcombers out there, or what?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think the best example

12

would be, Your Honor -- is somebody who's on the shelf

13

but they're not employed in the relevant production

14

purposes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

And so, you might have an -What are they doing out

there?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

MR. CLEMENT:

25

this statute at a time when they didn't know the full

2

shelf.

3

trying to -- at the one point, they're trying to limit

4

5

there that are designed for the production of the

6

mineral wealth of the shelf.

7

what some of the language is directed at.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

And so, what they're trying to do is they're

And so, I think that's

But if that -- if that's

what Congress meant, then the emphasis should be on is

10

this person one who regularly works on the outer

11

continental shelf.

12

was on the outer continental shelf 98 percent of the

13

time.

14

And the -- this worker, we're told,

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

And if he was at the --

15

on the outer continental shelf at the time of this

16

accident, he probably wouldn't have been injured.

17

But the one thing I think the statute

18

clearly speaks to is not status, but it speaks to, as

19

Justice Alito suggested, at a minimum a relationship

20

between the operations that caused the injury and the

21

fact that those operations have to be conducted on the

22

shelf.

11

land-based, and is injured in repairing that machine.

12

Under your view, no coverage?

13
14

MR. CLEMENT:

No coverage, Your Honor, and I

think that -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

I think that's quite

16

difficult to square with the "as a result" language

17

because this is a result of the operation.

say the machine got broken because of the -- of the

19

operations, and there -- and he's fixing it and he's

injured.

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Let's just

No, I disagree, Your Honor,

22

respectfully, and I think your way of looking at that

23

hypothetical doesn't give sufficient import to the

24

phrase "conducted on the shelf."

25

Respondents want to do is they want you to look at the

It's -- what

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute as saying as long as there is an injury that

2

results from operations that have the purpose of

3

developing the outer continental shelf, that that's

4

enough.

5

your hypothetical would be that's covered.

6

And if that were enough, I think the answer to

But the statute very specifically says that

7

they have to be injuries as a result of operations

8

conducted on the shelf for the purpose of extracting the

9

mineral wealth of the shelf.

10

And so, that first "on the shelf" I think

11

clearly modifies the operations.

12

conducted on the shelf are --

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Only operations

Well, the

Government and --

MR. CLEMENT:

-- covered by the statute.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The Government and the

Ninth Circuit take care of that by saying that the

person has to have -- the injured employee has to have

19

spent substantial amount of time on the -- on the

20

offshore operations.

21

So, you could add that.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, you can't add that, Your

22

Honor, because if there's one thing that is absolutely

23

clear about this statute it's that it doesn't include a

causation and you don't have a situs and a status

requirement, then in that scenario, there's no way to

16

get just a status test.

17

implore you to think about in that is not only is it not

in the statute, but there is a statute that has a

status-based remedy that travels with the worker

wherever they go.

12

That just doesn't work.

This was not

Now, there is a test where we say that the

13

best reading of the statute is status plus situs.

14

if I could try to get this argument out -- it's a little

15

bit complicated, because I think the defect of this

16

argument, if it has one, is it doesn't leap out directly

17

from 1333(b), and you have to read 1333(b) in

18

conjunction with both the rest of 1333 and in

19

conjunction with 903(a) of the Longshore Workers' Act.

20

If you do that, I think you will see there is a situs

21

requirement and a status requirement.

22

And

Let me start with the rest of the 1333.

If

23

you think about this statute, the primary engine for

24

applying Federal law to the shelf is not 1333(b); it's

25

1333(a).

It applies all of Federal law to the shelf.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But some statutes, it doesn't work, and the

2

Longshore Act is one of them.

3

Longshore Act to the shelf without any modifications, it

4

won't cover the shelf because it by its terms has a

5

situs requirement that is limited to the navigable


6

waters and at that point the drydocks.


7

If you apply the

So, Congress has to tailor the longshore


8

remedy to the reality of the shelf, and it does it in


9

two ways.

One, it has this language that everyone's

10
11

focused on that is something of a status requirement in

12

that it limits the recovery to employees who are engaged

13

in certain activities.

14

1333(b) is important.

15

and (3), and they effectively define terms in the

16

Longshore Act to make them work for purposes of

17

extending it to the shelf.

18

But the rest of the language in
It's these definitions (1), (2),

And the key definition is (3).

Three

defines the term "United States" when used in a

20

geographical sense, and it defines it to include the

21

shelf, the artificial islands, and the fixed attachments

22

thereto.

23

isolation, because it's defining the term "United

24

States" for geographical purposes, and 1333(b) does not

25

use the term "United States" for geographical purposes.

Now, that's a puzzle if you look at 1333(b) in

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But another statute does; it's 903.

2

remedy that's extended.

3

It's the longshore

And 903(a) uses the term "United States."

4

And 903(a), if you want to look at, is at page 96 of the

5

petition appendix.

6

The situs requirement of 903(a) unmodified limits

7

recovery to the navigable waters and drydocks.

8

you take that definition from (b)(3) and essentially

9

superimpose it on 903(a), you then get a remedy that has

10

a situs requirement; there's a recovery, but only if the

11

injury occurs on the navigable waters, drydocks, the

12

shelf, artificial islands, and the attachments thereto.

13

But that's the situs requirement.

So, if

So it's -- as I say, it's a complicated

14

argument, and it doesn't stare you in the face if you

15

look at 1333(b) --

9

MR. CLEMENT:

That's a different issue than

And if I could take that --

10

there's a couple of pieces to that, Justice Sotomayor.

11

First of all, I would say that I think that the

12

hypothetical, let's say, of, you know, a nut or

13

something coming off the shelf and hitting somebody

14

somewhere else is -- illustrates the difference between

15

our primary argument and our backup argument.

16

On our primary argument, somebody who -- if

17

the nut hits somebody in the navigable waters, they

18

wouldn't recover from OCSLA; they would recover under

19

the Longshore Act directly because they were on the

20

navigable waters.

21

On our backup theory, that it's a tight

22

proximate cause test, then I would say, yes, that person

23

can recover under OCSLA, but that's really a fortuitous

24

set of circumstances precisely because I wouldn't apply

25

a substantial nexus test, which seems to me just an

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Well, you're not -- you

Certainly not.
All right.

You don't

want a proximate cause test.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I could live with a

8

proximate cause test as long as it's a proximate cause

9

test that's tailored to the statute.

And what I mean by

10

that is I think if you look at the statute, you can't

11

have a proximate cause test that doesn't take geography

12

into account.

13

And I think -- in particular, I think in a

14

case like this, you have to ask yourself not just

15

proximate cause in the abstract, but were there

16

operations somewhere other than the shelf that were a

17

more direct proximate cause of the injury?

18

that's the case, then the remedy lies in the law that

19

applies to those other operations.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

funny because, you know, this Court has on more than one

2

occasion sort of remarked that "proximate cause" itself

3

is a weird formulation because "proximate" sounds like

4

it has a location aspect to it.

5

for purposes of this statute, that should be right.

6

It's proximate cause as tailored to this statute and the

7

policies of this statute, and I think that would want to

8

really take the geography into account.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we actually think,

Mr. Clement, I don't really

understand proximate cause as applied to a -- a statute

11

14

and we have a whole body of law that gives guidance for

that.

say two things.

One is I do think there's an anomaly

22

here, but I do think it's -- you know, you're not being

23

asked to apply proximate cause for purposes of assessing

24

liability because, as you say, strict liability -- it's

25

kind of automatic liability.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

1

But what I would say is you are being asked,

2

at least under the backup theory, to apply proximate

3

cause as a way of determining the geographical scope of

4

the statute.

5

it's so anomalous that you wouldn't do it if you thought

6

that was the better way to read the statute.

7

And that's anomalous, but I don't think

That said, I do think that the best way to

8

read the statute is consistent with all the other

9

statutes as part of a jurisdictional puzzle.

I mean,

all of the areas off of the shelf are governed, with the

11

exception of seamen under the Jones Act, primarily as a

12

matter of geography.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, if your

14

position is right, then we have a worker who most of the

15

time is doing work on a platform, and he will be covered

confronted the objection that, well, if -- under OCSLA

3

workers would move in and out of coverage, and it

4

rejected it in the Herb's Welding case.

5

I think it's common ground -- well, maybe not, but it

6

should be common ground that if you had a worker who was

7

injured on a State platform, that that would not be

8

covered by -- a State waters platform, that that would

9

not be covered by OCSLA.

And I don't --

about where the injury occurs, and that's not what --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Clement, may I go

back to -- you referred to Herb's Welding, but that was

10

a case -- it was a claim under the Longshore Act, not an

11

OCSLA claim, and the Court said it was expressing no

12

opinion on whether 1332(b) covered the injury.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right.

Herb's Welding

14

is not a holding, but at the end of that opinion, the

15

Court confronts this argument that isn't it odd that

16

somebody would be moving in and out of coverage?

17

the Court says that that is a product of OCSLA.

18

doesn't say it's a product of OCSLA generally; it says

19

particularly that it's a product of OCSLA's extension of

20

the Longshore Act.

21

about people moving in and out was answered by the Court

22

in Herb's Welding.

23

And
And it

And I do think that this objection

I would also say, Justice Ginsburg, the

24

second point I wanted to make in response to your

25

earlier question is I understand that it might make

2

individual no matter where they work.

3

is -- I mean, that's not only a different model; that's

4

the model that Congress rejected.

5

hard about having an admiralty remedy, and presumably

6

then the Jones Act would apply, and if you were attached

7

to a vessel or a platform, then you would have coverage

8

no matter where you went.

9

But the problem

They thought long and

But that's not what they did.

They

10

incorporated instead as their model the Longshore Act,

11

and the Longshore Act always had a situs requirement.

12

So, when Congress makes a conscious effort to deal with

13

this unusual geographical problem with -- and solves the

14

problem with the Longshore Act, which is sitting there

15

with a situs requirement, and doesn't adopt the Jones

16

Act, which has a status-only requirement, it seems very,

17

very peculiar to adopt instead a model that would have a

18

status-only test.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Congress also did not

20

adopt the proposal, the specific proposal to confine

21

OCSLA to situations in which State workers' compensation

22

was unavailable.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

And I think that's -- they

24

rejected that with good reason, Your Honor, because you

25

have to remember that, at this point, they're living

with the experience that this Court ultimately resolved.

2

But they're living in real time with the experience of

3

people under the Longshore Act, which at that point, did

carve out and limit the remedy, the Federal remedy, only

when a State remedy was unavailable.

it's interesting.

The only way they can say that those

MR. CLEMENT:

One can't really

Justice Kagan, I would beg to

differ.

And I think what you have to understand is, go

18

back in 1953 and when they're -- I mean, you can say

19

confidently that there aren't accountants on the shelf

20

because you have the benefit of 60 -- 60 years of

21

experience with -- post-1953 with what goes on, on the

22

shelf.

23

for a brave new world, and they don't -- they're trying

24

to provide for all of the occasions that may come to

25

pass out on the shelf.

Congress at this point is sort of legislating

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

There is a great law review article that

2

actually provides this background, and it's written by,

3

of all people, Warren Christopher, the Warren

4

Christopher, and it's in the Stanford Law Review, and it

5

was written December of 1953, and it's worth a look

6

because it captures this idea that they're kind of, you

7

know, legislating for this brave new world out there,

8

and they don't know who's going to be out there.

9

don't know if it's going to be all drill workers or if

They

10

there's going to be accountants and clerical workers out

11

there.

12

And so, I think with that context, it's not

13

at all odd that they would use those six words to say,

14

kind of the way that Congress did later in 1972 in

15

imposing the marine employment test for longshoremen --

16

it's like, look, we want to provide a longshore remedy,

17

but not to just anybody, any employee who might happen

18

to be on the shelf; we want to provide it to those

19

people who are essentially in the core operations that

20

are going on, on the shelf.

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT
MR. PALMORE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I'd like to start off with the exchange that

5

Justice Kagan had with Mr. Clement about the language

6

that was used here in 1333(b), and I think the contrast

7

between the language that Congress used in 1333(b) and

8

the language it used in other provisions, neighboring

9

provisions, of 1333 is instructive.

10

And I'd like the point the Court to section

11

1333(c), which is on page 3a of the appendix to the

12

Government's brief.

13

National Labor Relations Act.

14

how Congress went about drafting when it wanted to

15

specify legal consequences that would flow from an

16

actual event that took place in a particular place.

17

Congress extends the National Labor Relations Act to

18

"any unfair labor practice, as defined in such Act,

19

occurring upon any artificial island...." And then it

20

lists with particularity the particular situses where

21

the National Labor Relations Act would apply.

22

This is the provision involving the
And I think this shows

So,

If Congress had followed that model in

23

section 1333(b), it would be a very different statute.

24

It would have said, as Your Honor pointed out, with

25

respect to disability or death of an employee resulting
27

from any injury on the outer continental shelf.

operations on the outer continental shelf.

event would happen.

Suppose the facts of this

14

instead of spending 98 percent of his time on an oil rig

15

doing things that he did there, actually spent only 20

percent of his time there, and he spent 80 percent of

17

his time on land doing what he was supposed to be doing

the same in the two situations.

causal relationship.

It was based on this Court's

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT


2
3

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you,


Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:


4

I'd like to shift some focus to what would


5

have happened if Mr. Valladolid had worked on a floating

6

platform instead of a fixed, because the law is clear

7

that if the platform was floating, he would be a Jones

8

Act seaman, and under this Court's cases, if he were

9

injured on land, he would have a Jones Act remedy.

So,

10

the only anomaly here is that he happened to be working

11

on a fixed platform 98 percent of the time.

12

question is whether the permissive workers' compensation

13

benefits provided under OCSLA carry with him when he

14

happens to be injured on land as a result of the shelf

15

operations.

That's correct.

vessels.

15

MR. FREDERICK: 
 But the point is that they

16

get a Jones Act remedy if they happen to be injured on

17

land.

18

if the Jones Act seaman is driving to Reno and there's

19

an accident, he's covered under the Jones Act and gets

20

to have a Jones Act remedy, notwithstanding that the

21

injury has nothing to do with his service on the vessel

22

itself.

23
24
25

So, Mr. Chief Justice, under your hypothetical,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're -- you are not

proposing to eliminate that anomaly?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, what I'm saying is that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're saying wherever you

3

are injured, so long as you're on a platform,

4

you're covered.

5

I don't think so.

MR. FREDERICK:

If the work is substantially

6

related and the causal connection goes to the employment

7

relationship, to the operations, the worker is covered

8

under OCSLA.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, you still have an

anomaly.

11

MR. FREDERICK:

There is --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

covered; sometimes it won't be covered.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Sometimes it will be

It is, to be sure, a more

15

comfortable fit to the actual language of the statute

16

than imposing and superimposing a situs-of-injury

17

requirement, which is nowhere to be found in section

18

1333(b).

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any injury on

20

land in the course of employment that would not be

21

covered by OCSLA where we have a worker of this kind

22

that -- who spends 98 percent of his time on the outer

23

continental shelf -- the injury, however, is on land?

24

Is there any case where such a worker who predominantly

25

works on the outer continental shelf would not be
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

covered by OCSLA in your view?
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, if the work is arising

3

out of the course and scope of employment, which is the

4

natural way that these workers' compensation regimes

5

work, and it is related to the shelf operations, our

6

submission is, yes, he is covered under OCSLA.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, then what you're

8

really saying is -- it's not your test, but really the

9

Government's saying we look to see, is this person

10

dominantly working on the outer continental shelf?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

That -- that's correct,

12

Justice Ginsburg.

It's the easiest to administer test,

13

too, because the way workers' compensation insurance

14

works, the employer will -- based on the payroll of the

15

workers who are out on the shelf and its overall

16

payroll, will pay workers' compensation premiums, and

17

under the Department of Labor regulations, it will add

18

an endorsement for those workers whose status it

19

controls, would be covered under OCSLA and thereby get

20

the higher Federal benefit.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, if you work only 20

22

percent of your time for this -- this drilling company

23

on -- on the -- on the platform, but it so happens that

24

you are injured on the platform, you know, a bolt comes

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

we'd like to have a test that we apply to your

14

situation, and it's nice to know -- maybe 30 percent, I

15

guess, is as good as any.

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I know, but

The point that Congress was

17

trying to get at -- and these are platforms that were

18

covered by State workers' compensation in 1953 -- was to

19

extend the more generous Federal benefits to encourage

20

an industry that was a nascent industry to develop the

21

resources of the outer continental shelf, to provide

22

uniformity, to provide benefits to the workers who were

23

exposed to the perils that were out on the platform.

24

And so, it makes sense, we submit, that when those

25

workers who are -- who are subjected to those
49

circumstances have the same Federal benefits.

are substantial benefits.

12

that we find that we can't find your status test in the

language of the statute and that what this statute seems

14

to give us is, instead, a causal test and that the cause

is whether operations on the outer continental shelf

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. CLEMENT:
A few points in rebuttal.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
First of all,

10

Justice Kennedy, you asked about deference, and I think

11

before you give any deference to the Government's

12

position, you should look at the other Government's

13

position, which is to say the position that the

14

Government took in its brief to this Court in Pickett v.

15

Petroleum Helicopters in 2002.

16

They have a completely different position

17

now, and they've never explained the difference other

18

than to say what they thought was plausible then they

19

now find persuasive now.

20

deference.

21

similar to ours.

22

albeit a slightly different situs, but otherwise it's on

23

all fours with our position.

24
25

That's not enough for

And in that brief, they took a position very
There has to be status plus situs,

Second of all, the Government comes up here
and says that the longshore remedy is an outlier among
57

Alderson Reporting Company

1

workers' compensation remedies because it's the only one

2

with a situs.

3

workers' compensation provisions that Congress could

4

have extended to the outer continental shelf, it picked

5

the Longshore Act with that situs requirement.

Well, the problem with that is of all the

6

And the Government also says, well, you

7

know, the reason that the Longshore Act had a situs

8

requirement was because of Jensen, and this Court's

9

decision in Jensen created a problem about whether State

10

workers' comp law could go to the navigable waters.

11

Well, that's the exact same backdrop against

12

which Congress is passing OCSLA.

13

State workers' compensation law can go to the outer

14

continental shelf.

15

tells Congress that it can't extend -- States can't

16

extend their laws to the navigable waters.

makes --

18

It doesn't know that

Jensen is still good law.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Jensen

What

But why -- why doesn't

19

Congress know?

20

would include outer continental shelf workers in their

21

compensation scheme.

22

Because I think States overwhelmingly

MR. CLEMENT:

Oh, no, Justice Ginsburg.

23

What States overwhelming did is say a worker could be

24

covered in a different State.

25

outer continental shelf was not something that was well

But covering them on the

58

established.

2

And, indeed, Congress specifically heard

3

testimony that questioned the ability of either States

4

to get their workers' comp law there directly and also

5

heard that there might be constitutional problems,

6

because of the Knickerbocker Ice case, of Congress

7

extending the State law there.

8

settled on this remedy of taking this Longshore Act that

9

solved the Jensen problem on the navigable waters and

10

So, that's why they

solved the same problem for the outer continental shelf.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It would make sense to

12

use the Longshore Act because they wanted to have the

13

same level of compensation.

14
15

MR. CLEMENT:

As other alternatives like the

Jones Act?

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No.

No, no. They wanted

17

the OCSLA worker to have the same benefits as the

18

longshore worker.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure, when they were on the

20

shelf.

21

jurisdictional problem they solved with the Longshore

22

Act with the shelf -- with the statute.

23

But they were solving the exact same kind of

Justice Sotomayor, I don't think you can

24

read too much into (b)(2).

All (b)(2) is doing is

25

modifying the same definition for the longshores.

4

(b)(3) does the same thing, and it modifies the situs

5

and creates a situs that makes sense for the shelf:

navigable waters, drydocks, the shelf, artificial

7

islands, and everything attached thereto.

It's

imprecision without any text.

So, you would be completely

The last point I would make is this:

The

answer to the causation test is really -- the kind of

even when you recognize that and you look at what's left

approach that essentially incorporates the Longshore Act
