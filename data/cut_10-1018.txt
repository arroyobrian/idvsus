CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Ms. Millett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When a private attorney is temporarily

11

retained by the government to work in coordination with

12

or under the direct supervision of government employees

13

in fulfilling the government's business, in getting the

14

government's work done, that attorney is entitled to the

15

same immunity that a government employee performing that

16

same function for that same government would receive.

17

In this case, that is qualified immunity.

18

comports with the history and policy concerns that have

19

animated this Court's section 1983 and immunity

20

jurisprudence.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That rule

That's across the board,

22

Ms. Millett, the rule you just stated?

23

situation in which a private attorney engaged to assist

24

a government office in the performance of a public

25

function would lack qualified immunity?
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Is there any

Or is it simply

Official

1

wherever a government agency employs a private attorney

2

to assist it in doing its work, that attorney will have

3

qualified immunity?

4

MS. MILLETT:

I think it -- it may well be

5

the latter rule, the more broader one, but for these

6

purposes, the Court only needs to decide the situation

7

when they are working in coordination with or under

8

direct supervision of government employees.

9

to clarify that answer because how one defines doing a

And I want

10

public service -- for example, if a State government

11

appoints somebody to represent one of their police

12

officers who's sued in a 1983 action, if there's five

13

defendants, the attorney general can't represent them

14

all; they will all commonly appoint people and will pay

15

them -- some States will pay them from the -- from the

16

State fisc.

17

And so, they'll be paid by the government to

18

perform a governmental function in that sense, but their

19

allegiance there is to the individual employee, not to

20

the government.

21

The same with public defenders.

So, there are certain situations where

22

someone can be retained by the government in that sense,

23

paid by the government in that sense.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why does it matter whether

the privately retained attorney works in close
4

Alderson Reporting Company

cooperation with government employees?

2

case Mr. Filarsky had simply been hired to go off and

3

perform this investigation and, at the end of the

4

investigation, report the results to the town?

5

the case come out differently then?

6

MS. MILLETT:

Suppose in this

Would

I don't think that would, but

7

in this -- but I think it depends on what one means by

8

coordination with or supervision.

9

attorneys, attorneys can never be an independent

And with respect to

10

contractor in relationship to their client in the way

11

the prison was in Richardson.

12

They are always, in the sense of the rule that I'm using

13

it, working for their client agency, their client

14

government, and under its control and authority.

15

the decisions they make are the decisions of that

16

client.

17

Attorneys just can't be.

And

And that's why the whole -- the whole reason

18

we should have this rule is understanding what immunity

19

protects.

20

governmental conduct, and its ability to maneuver with

21

an area -- in an area of reasoned decisionmaking.

22

It protects government decisionmaking,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I -- I suppose you can

23

argue that there is a built-in limitation because the

24

question doesn't even come up unless there's state

25

action.

So, there has to be close enough cooperation so
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's state action.

I had never thought that when a

2

private attorney gives an opinion letter to a government

3

agency or government entity at its request that there's

4

any state action there at all.

5

there the question just wouldn't even come up; am I

6

correct?

So, that question -- so,

I assume --

7

MS. MILLETT:

Right, because, certainly, the

8

state action limitation both limits the operation of

9

this rule.

There's many times attorneys or others who

10

work with the government will not implicate the state

11

action rule.

12

case, and I think it would not be uncommon in attorney

13

cases.

14

tort, is because the government was involved, because

15

governmental actors took his advice, conducted a

16

search -- he didn't -- issued an order -- he didn't.

17

And yet we have -- we're left in this is odd world where

18

the only way this tort, constitutional tort lawsuit, can

19

go forward is without the government.

20

And that's sort of the irony of -- of this

The only reason this was a tort, or an alleged

Now, 1983 is about deterring governmental

21

conduct, but this Court's immunity jurisprudence says we

22

don't over-deter and we want to allow the government to

23

operate within a realm of reasoned decisionmaking.

24

they need to operate within that realm, get reasoned

25

advice and make reasoned decisions, regardless of
6

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

whether the source of the advice is a temporarily or

2

permanently retained attorney.

3

The need is for reasoned decisionmaking.

4

And if you over-deter, which is what an action against

5

the private attorney who is now charged with litigating

6

and defending the government's allegedly

7

unconstitutional conduct, standing all alone while all

8

the government actors have walked away -- that turns

9

section 1983 on its head.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your test -- and

11

this is -- I think goes broader than the articulation of

12

the test -- doesn't give this private attorney much

13

assurance by itself.

14

coordinating, is he under the supervision, is he really

15

doing public service?

16

him sufficient breathing room so he doesn't stop, and

17

when, as in this case, he's threatened that we're going

18

to sue you if you do this, he has to think, well, now,

19

am I being supervised by the government?

20

coordinating with the government?

21

them what -- it -- the test itself undermines the

22

asserted purpose.

23

It's sort of a multifactor, is he

I mean, if the idea is to give

MS. MILLETT:

Am I

Or I -- am I telling

Well, two responses to that.

24

First of all, the State law requirement -- the state

25

action requirement that Justice Kennedy referred to will

up front require allegations by the plaintiffs that will

2

discuss the coordinated -- presumably the coordinated

3

action.

4

coordination.

There's going to have to be some level of

5

But the second reason is, as I said, with

6

respect to attorneys, I don't think this is going to be

7

a hard question because they are forever agents and

8

fiduciaries.

contractor that you had in Richardson.

They can never be the independent
They are always

10

answerable to and working for their governmental client.

11

test here is -- is an on-hands, day-to-day looking over

13

your shoulders.

The government has to be able to get

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

Suppose -- suppose the

16

government hires an attorney to do an independent

17

investigation; it hires an outside attorney precisely

18

because it does not want to be faced with allegations

19

that it has manipulated the outcome of the investigation

because its own conduct is at issue.

going to interfere at all.

between that and the prison situation?

17

that entity pursuant to a contract.

18

exactly what the difference is.

19

MS. MILLETT:

What is the difference
The private

I don't understand

The difference is -- there's a

20

practical difference and then a legal doctrinal

21

difference.

MS. MILLETT:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It seems to me that

3

there's enough evidence that the lawyer was the one who

2

That's a -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This argument seems to

3

fall under what Justice Scalia termed a functional test,

4

that he's serving just like any other government lawyer.

5

If you were going to fit this case under the Richardson

6

majority test, how would you do it?

7

MS. MILLETT:

And I'd do that -- first of

8

all, I keep -- I'm putting it right in -- in

9

Richardson's language, which said it was reserving this

10

very question, and that is, when an attorney or any

11

individual is working in close coordination or under the

12

supervision of government officials in the performance

13

of an essential function.

14

And so, that makes clear that Richardson was

15

deciding not that situation, the handed-off turnkey

16

situation.

Mr. Filarsky being brought on to the team.

18

This -- there's no turnkey here.

So -- so, independent

19

know, a counsel appointed because -- to show that the

you get independent counsel, the Attorney General says:

The President says:

1

MS. MILLETT:

No.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's -Why?

He's not working in

3

close coordination.

4

The whole purpose of an independent counsel is to

5

eliminate supervision.

6

He's not subject to supervision.

MS. MILLETT:

Yes, but independent counsel

7

is still sued in the name of the United States.

Their

8

client was the United States Government.

9

whom -- that is the interest in which they worked.

That is
They

10

were -- they had a client that they were answerable to.

11

They were not freewheeling independent contractors; they

12

were attorneys with a client.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Weren't the

14

prison guards who were -- who were suable in

15

Richardson -- weren't they suable under 1983 as acting

16

under color of law?

17
18

MS. MILLETT:

This Court assumed that

question; it did not answer it in that -- in that case.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the whole issue would

20

have been a nonissue if they -- if they couldn't be

21

sued.

22

MS. MILLETT:

This Court assumed it.

I

23

think it's fair to assume when you're operating a

24

prison, although I think to -- there's a reason this

25

Court reserved it, because the question there is -13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

certainly, the corporation --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MS. MILLETT:

Yes.

-- was under color of law,

4

whether the individuals who worked for the corporation

5

would also be under color of law.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't you think the -- the

7

two should go pari passu, as we say, that if you can be

8

sued for acting under color of law, you ought to have

9

the defenses that people who are acting with legal

10

authority have?

11

MS. MILLETT:

Well, this Court's already

12

crossed that bridge in cases like Wyatt, where, for

13

example -- and it does because the State law requirement

14

can sweep broadly in some situations.
So, I don't think in a situation like

15
16

Wyatt v. Cole, where you have private plaintiffs

17

pursuing their private agenda and they simply invoke a

18

State law, that that makes them integrated with the

19

government in the way that an attorney is, and certainly

20

the way Petitioner was here, that they're not part of

21

the governmental team, and they're not making -- they

22

weren't making decisions in the interest of the

23

government.

24

protect there, and that's what -- the rationale this

25

Court gave for denying qualified immunity in Wyatt.

There was no governmental decisionmaking to

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The key here is that this is -- you cannot

2

protect governmental decisionmaking in this context

3

without protecting the source of advice for that

4

decisionmaking.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Lawyers are not

6

supposed to be cowed by the exigencies of the situation.

7

We're worried in qualified immunity with protecting

8

governmental actors, to make sure they will feel

9

comfortable doing the right thing rather than being

10

intimidated in the situation we had here.

11

Lawyers have that professional obligation in

12

the first place.

13

defense of qualified immunity?

14

So, why does a lawyer need the -- the

MS. MILLETT:

There are a couple of reasons.

15

First of all, that rationale would mean no government

16

lawyers get the protection either, because they have

17

that exact same obligation of fealty, and we don't apply

18

that rule.

19

reason we don't is we understand that this is a more --

20

it's a more layered inquiry into timidity.

21

That hasn't even been questioned.

And the

First of all, we don't even want the

22

subconscious pressures that would come with full-freight

23

liability for governmental conduct to any angry third

24

party even subconsciously interfering with the decisions

25

of government lawyers temporarily or permanently
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

retained.
Secondly, we want the government to be able

3

to get the advice, to be encouraged to get the advice.

4

Section 1983 must support governments getting legal

5

advice to counsel them in complying with the law that

6

section 1983 enforces, but government will be deterred

7

from obtaining legal advice if the cost of getting an

8

attorney -- especially if you're a small town,

9

municipality, county, you don't -- can't afford a

10

full-time staff, and the cost of getting an attorney is

11

all those things that qualified immunity wanted to

12

protect against.

13

Our decision -- reasonable decisionmaking

14

that we thought was protected by qualified immunity is

15

now on trial.

16

a jury is going to assess liability for a reasonable

17

governmental decision.

18

And we have to be there as witnesses, and

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Millett, our cases have

19

said that we're supposed to look not only to policy but

20

also to history.

21

that a person in your client's position historically

22

would have had at most an actual malice -- a malice

23

defense or a reasonable cause defense?

24

have anything more than that?

25

Would you disagree with the premise

MS. MILLETT:

Would a person

They would have had the same
16


Alderson Reporting Company

1

sort of good-faith defense that this Court in Harlow

2

turned into qualified immunity, both as lawyers

3

working --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, in Wyatt, we said that

5

that was a very different kind of immunity than the

6

Harlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no

7

basis for giving Harlow immunity.

8
9

MS. MILLETT:

It -- it -- the Harlow

immunity came from the same roots.

Well, the -- what

10

happened in Wyatt was we said we will turn that into

11

protection for the government when we need to protect

12

the special functioning of government.

13

need -- the Court had no need to do that in Wyatt

14

because there was no governmental decisionmaking at

15

stake there.

17
18

You had no

But the -- the same type of defense -- this
Court recognized in Richardson -JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, I take it that your

19

answer is, yes, it would only have been a malice

20

defense, but that doesn't matter, notwithstanding Wyatt.

21

Is that your answer?

22

MS. MILLETT:

The -- the answer is that it

23

is the same type of defense that this Court recognized

24

in prior cases as supporting qualified immunity when

25

needed to protect the decisions of the government.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

Richardson itself recognized this --

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Doesn't that suggest really

3

that we don't have a historical test anymore, that

4

really all we're looking to is policy considerations?

5

MS. MILLETT:

Not this case at all, because

6

you've got layers.

You have layers of -- of history.

7

You have the history recognized in Richardson for -- for

8

lawyers who are working at the behest of the government,

9

that specific history.

You have the general history

10

where -- where attorneys were provided a reasonable and

11

good-faith, malice, and probable cause type of defense,

12

which again is the type of -- the type of defense that

13

gets turned into qualified immunity when needed to

14

protect government's reasoned decisionmaking.

1

our position that when people are doing the business of

2

government, private people, can be sued under section

3

1983 or Bivens, there should be a presumption in favor

4

of qualified immunity.

5

And Richardson is not to the contrary

6

because that is a fairly unique case in which the

7

private prison was so removed from the day-to-day

8

workings of government officials that it would not have

9

furthered the purposes of qualified immunity to give

10

qualified immunity to the folks in those situations.

11

So, what we're talking about, like --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's just hard to imagine

13

anything more imbued with state action than imprisoning

14

someone.

15

thinking about the case.

16

That's -- that's the problem I have in

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

I mean, several

17

members of the Court said that in Richardson.

18

the -- the Court's opinion really talked about the

19

uniqueness of the situation there, that Tennessee was

20

doing something really out on the forefront in terms of

21

giving the day-to-day decisionmaking to the folks in

22

that situation in the private prison, and only checking

23

up.

24

really not much ongoing monitoring at all.

25

There was monitoring, you know, annually.

And

It was

And the -- the Richardson Court, you know,

found that to be a unique situation, but it

2

distinguished the situation that you have here, where

3

you have people --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Wasn't Richardson really all

5

about how market forces would make immunity unnecessary?

6

And how is it that market forces play any different role

7

in this case than they do in Richardson?

8
9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, we understand the

Court's discussion of market forces to be really

10

important in the context there, where you don't have

11

individuals who are working closely with government.

12

The Court needed -- and the purposes of

13

qualified immunity wouldn't be served in terms of

14

deterrence and in ensuring good government

15

decisionmaking.

16

the Court reassuring itself in those circumstances that

17

there would still be private prison companies that would

18

be willing to take on the business of government and

19

would be able to do it, you know, consistent with the

20

Constitution.

21

But the market forces discussion was

So, we don't understand the Court to have

22

been setting out market forces as a test for qualified

23

immunity, because, as your question seems to suggest,

24

taken to its logical conclusion, any time a private

25

person is being hired by the government, you could say,
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well, there's a market for the person, couldn't someone

2

else fill those shoes, et cetera, et cetera.

3

think the Court's market forces decision was -- was

4

fairly confined to what the Court itself described as a

5

unique situation in Richardson.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, we

And the Court --

Do you think market forces

7

do operate differently here, or is it basically the same

8

thing?

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

We do think that there's a

10

difference in that the attorney in this situation has

11

private clients that that attorney can work for, whereas

12

the private prison company really could only work for

13

the government.

14

But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that in this

15

case the -- the firm that the lawyer was associated with

16

said its dominant business was giving advice to local

17

government, local municipal government units.

18

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

So --

I mean, that was an

19

important part of the firm's business, but Mr. Filarsky

21

broad training and expertise in employment-related

22

matters.

24

decision in Richardson was really focusing on the

25

purposes of qualified immunity and whether they would be

So, there's certainly other work that could be

MS. SAHARSKY:

6

acknowledge or to concede that market forces do not

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, why does market

11

force eliminate this defense for somebody who's an

12

employee of a private company but not for somebody who's

13

an employee of the government?

14

MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.

I

15

didn't mean to suggest that we thought that the market

16

forces inquiry was particularly relevant to the -- to

17

answering the qualified immunity question.

18

explaining that the way we read the Court's opinion in

19

Richardson, which obviously the members of this Court

20

are the experts on, is that the Court was looking to

21

market forces to reassure itself after it determined

22

that the purposes of qualified immunity just wouldn't be

23

served by giving an organization that was so far removed

24

from the day-to-day workings of government the

25

protection of qualified immunity.

I'm just

The Court just -- the

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

market forces really was just something unique to that

2

case.

3

And what we think is the most relevant is

4

what the Court started with both in the decision in

5

Wyatt and in Richardson, which is, is it necessary to

6

give qualified immunity here to make sure there's

7

principled and fearless government decisionmaking?

8

the business of government that's important.

9

this case, although Petitioner is an attorney who has

It's

And in

10

his own fiduciary obligations, it is certainly the case

11

that when he was threatened during the conduct of this

12

personnel investigation, that that is something that

13

potentially could chill his behavior.

14

And to the extent that he cabins the advice

15

that he gave to the fire department officials, that

16

affects the ability of government to do their job.

17

I might give the Court --

18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Well, that would be a

breach of his duty as an attorney.

20

MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm saying --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And he would be subject

22

to malpractice in that case.

You -- seriously, I find

23

this whole argument about market forces with respect to

24

attorneys representing people odd because there's a

25

whole slew of unemployed lawyers who will be happy to
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

take on any government service they can.

2

So, going back to the -- that's -- what I

3

consider the central argument you're making, which is:

4

Will it chill advice?

5

given the independent fiduciary duty that an attorney

6

has to zealously guard his or her client's interest.

7

And I'm not sure how it can,

MS. SAHARSKY:

I'm saying that an attorney

8

is in a difficult position there, and it's the same

9

position that a government attorney would be in, and the

10

Court has extended qualified immunity to government

11

attorneys who are in this position, either giving legal

12

advice, like in the Burns case, or serving as

13

prosecutors.

14

operating in this case that would make him

15

distinguishable from a government attorney.

16

And there's just no difference when he's

To answer another suggestion, I think, in

17

your question, the Court talked about, in terms of

18

deterrence and chilling, making sure that there were

19

talented candidates who wanted to take on the position

20

of government.

21

we're concerned about wiping out the market entirely.

22

It said, you know, if there is a segment of the market

23

that will not take on this business anymore, that's a

24

fairly serious problem when we need to make sure that

25

the government of -- of business is done.

So, the Court has never said, you know,

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And if I can just make -- give the Court

2

another example to, perhaps outside the context of this

3

case, see how a private person being denied qualified

4

immunity would affect government employees, consider a

5

fire department that has some full-time fire department

6

personnel and also some volunteer firefighters.

7

they're working together in fighting a fire, you don't

8

want the volunteer firefighter thinking:

9

down this door?

10

When

Should I break

I might face personal liability.

You want him to make fearless decisions

11

because whether he breaks down the door or not is going

12

to directly affect the ability of the other folks who

13

are trying to go into those homes, trying to stop the

14

fire, to do their jobs.

15

That would also be true in the context of

16

court security.

18

direct supervision and control over them, but --

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Petitioner has not demonstrated a historical

shown that the immunity's purposes also serve Mr.

2

issue that has been most -- discussed the most, which is

3

the Petitioner's test.

4

The test that the Petitioner proposes that

5

this Court adopt is one that is very difficult to use.

6

The test is simply whether the individual is temporarily

7

retained in the -- in the functional equivalent of a

8

government employee, considering three factors.

9

three factors are:

The

one, the nature of the role

10

performed; the close supervision and/or coordination

with a government official --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what about your test?

14

MR. MCGILL:

MR. MCGILL:

I think that that's a much

closer call -JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it because it's Abraham

Lincoln or -JUSTICE SCALIA:
didn't exist.

You should say section 1983

That's your answer --

7

MR. MCGILL:

What?

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. MCGILL:

-- to that one, right?

But I think it's a much closer

10

call because he was engaged in a prosecutorial function,

11

which this Court over the years --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But investigatory

13

functions -- they don't get immunity.

So, if Lincoln

14

had looked into it and said, you know, I've looked into

15

this; I don't think we should prosecute.

16

said was use your judgment.

And what they

No.

MR. MCGILL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So, there are
This is one of

Right.
Imagine in this case the

23

lawyer sat down with the other firemen, the supervisor

24

and so forth, and they said -- not necessarily this

25

event; they said we want to do X.

And the lawyer said:

38

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I have to tell you, it's unclear whether X is

2

constitutional or not.

3

also have to tell you that if you do it, you will not be

4

held personally liable.

5

Now, because it's unclear, I

Now, can a lawyer give that advice?

Yes.

6

When he does, of course, he's subjecting himself to

7

personal liability.

8

worrying me, among other things.

Now, it's that conflict that is

9

So, what do we do about that?

10

being asked to give advice to the client.

11

canons of ethics, he ought to have their interest at

12

heart, and in doing that, he's subjecting himself to

13

what could be hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars

14

worth of damages or whatever in suits for malpractice.

15

Is there a way that we side with you out of that

16

dilemma?

17

MR. MCGILL:

The lawyer is
Under the

I don't think that that's

18

necessarily an immunity question; it's more of a

19

liability question because it very well may be that --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

What I'm

21

assuming in the question is, since it's a close

22

question, he has to worry about a court saying:

23

were wrong in saying it was legal.

24

The matter was unclear, but it was not legal.

25

You

It was not legal.

At that point, he becomes subject to much
39

Alderson Reporting Company

damages.

But, of course, the others do not, and he had

2

to tell them go ahead with it.

3

MR. MCGILL:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. MCGILL:

You understand my point.

I do.
So, what is the answer?

But -- but I think what -- what

6

it is -- the difference there is that there you have an

7

attorney just providing advice, which is different than

8

what happened here, where you actually had the attorney

9

engaged --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that may be, but what

11

I'm trying to work out is what is your set of rules?

12

we don't say -- if we don't say you have immunity, and

13

you agree that this is a bad dilemma at least in my

14

hypothetical case, I'm trying to work out what set of

15

rules you advocate in order to either say, well, that's

16

too bad, the dilemma is there, we can't get around it,

17

or something else.

18

If

That's why I want your answer.

MR. MCGILL:

If the attorney under those

19

circumstances could be held liable for a constitutional

20

violation for simply giving advice and he happens to be

21

a private attorney working for profit, then he wouldn't

22

have immunity.

23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I change it slightly, and

he puts them up to it.
MR. MCGILL:

Well -40


Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because I don't know why he

2

couldn't.

I mean, you know, he says go do it.

3

other words, my hypothetical -- okay, go ahead.

4

MR. MCGILL:

Or, in

I think the answer's the same.

5

If somehow under those circumstances the attorney could

6

be held liable for giving that advice, and he's -- he's

7

a private attorney, and he doesn't pass the Richardson

8

test, then he would not be entitled to immunity.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
MR. MCGILL:

10

So, there's no -- there's no --

I'm sorry.

12
13

Your case --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, you can finish

your answer.

14

MR. MCGILL:

There's certainly no -- there

is no historical basis of immunity just for giving legal

advice.

The Petitioner hasn't pointed this Court to any

You might want to think -- take a minute to think about

it.

3

I mean, it seems exactly the kind of

4

situation for which qualified immunity was -- was

5

developed.

6

he thinks is the right thing in this situation.

might be sued.

9

if you do that, I'm going to sue you.

We want Filarsky to give what he -- do what
We

So, Filarsky

10

naturally, or some lawyer in that situation, is going to

11

think, wow, do I really want to run that risk?

12
13

Isn't that exactly why we have qualified
immunity?

14

MR. MCGILL:

No.

And the reason for that is

15

that because Mr. Filarsky is a private individual, he

16

doesn't need qualified immunity.

17

is decided in 1997, but in 2003, the Ninth Circuit

18

issued its decision in Gonzalez v. Spencer.

attorneys like Mr. Filarsky don't need immunity; they

don't get immunity.

And in

So, the law in the land since

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's easy

24

for a judge to say because they're absolutely immune,

25

but for the lawyer who is sitting there and saying -42

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- saying I'm going

3

to sue you, if you were -- well, you are a lawyer.

you're sitting in that situation.

5

enter into your mind?

6

I don't care; this is the right answer.

7

Isn't that going to

You say, well, sue all you want;

MR. MCGILL:

But, for nearly a decade, the

8

law within the Ninth Circuit has been that private

9

attorneys don't receive immunity.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. MCGILL:

Right.

And that -- the fact that is,

12

is that Mr. Filarsky knew going into that -- that

13

investigation that he wouldn't have immunity for

14

anything he -- he did.

15

didn't make him --

16
17
18

And

And it didn't deter him; it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how do you

know?
MR. MCGILL:

Well, because he -- in the

19

light of the threats that he received, he still went

20

forward with the -- what was deemed to be an

21

unconstitutional search.

22

you know, wanting to prevent unwarranted timidity and

23

deterring talented candidates from working for the

24

25

So, the policy purposes of,

had the chief issue the order, right?

MR. MCGILL:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And then the chief

4

later on says, well, he told me to issue the order.

5

mean, I'm not quite sure that things went exactly as

6

they would if you had qualified immunity.

7

MR. MCGILL:

I

Well, Mr. Filarsky said -- and

8

this is what he said on the record; it's in the

9

transcripts in the Joint Appendix -- is that he's

10

issuing the order on behalf of the department.

11

what he said.

13

and Mr. Filarsky, and that's what led to the

14

formalization of -- of the order.

15

That's

And then there was some -- some

JUSTICE SCALIA:

there is a lot of bad, cowardly legal advice being given

in the Ninth Circuit.

I don't really know that,

but you don't know the opposite, either, do you?

MR. MCGILL:

I don't.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why didn't you

23

cross-appeal on the clearly established law?

24

qualified immunity, but the advice that he gave was

So, why did the Petitioner --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why didn't you bring up

that -- that issue?

6

MR. MCGILL:

I think it was -- that's sort

7

of the law of the case, is that the Ninth Circuit found

8

that there was a constitutional violation.

9

obviously didn't want to appeal that.

No, but -- but whether it

11

was clearly established.

12

here was a recognition:

13

can't go into a house, private house, without a warrant.

14

So -- in fact, Filarsky said something about I know a

15

way -- a way to get around that; we just tell them to

16

bring out the items.

17

MR. MCGILL:

In other words, what we had

22

Why the decision was

Are you saying it's clearly

reason it's an issue is because he says, look, I've got

violates the Fourth Amendment for the city to say, okay,

defense?

That's how his -- his defense

I haven't used it; I've got the insulation there.

17

Yes, I do because it -- it --

certainly, Mr. Filarsky didn't have any reasonable

19

suspicion to believe that Mr. Delia was lying or was

20

being dishonest.

21

cause.

22

I -- I -- he said it as -- at the -- during the

23

interview that I -- I don't necessarily know that you're

24

lying; I just -- I want to see if you are.

25

He certainly didn't have probable

He had a hunch.

4

And that's when they ended up issuing that order.

5

I think that would be a different situation

6

if perhaps you could argue that they had a reasonable

7

suspicion or had some cause to search his house, but

8

here they didn't.

So, I think it is under those facts

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Mr. McGill, back to

11

immunity, what -- one thing I don't understand about our

12

law here, you say there was no historic basis.

13

have to concede that that's right.

14

there's -- there was only a malice defense.

15

that always true when it comes to a -- a private person?

16

In other words, of course there's no historic basis for

17

qualified immunity.

18

in 1970.

19

basis for this sort of immunity.

And I

Seems to me that
But isn't

This kind of immunity was developed

It's sort of by definition there's no historic

So, to say that the historic basis matters

20
21

is really to say that private people never get Harlow

22

immunity.

23

MR. MCGILL:

Well, I think that that's

24

right.

There was not qualified immunity at common law,

25

but there was absolute immunity.

And in -- there -- I

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mean, I can't go back and think about all the different

2

immunities that may or may not have existed, but I -- I

3

do know that the Petitioner has the burden to bring

4

forth a firmly rooted tradition.

5

over and over that it's not going to create new

6

immunities.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

This Court has said

But the Court's cases are a

8

mix of history and -- and policy.

The Court has

9

recognized both absolute immunity -- has recognized

10

absolute immunity in instances where there wasn't

11

absolute immunity at common law; isn't that true?

12

MR. MCGILL:

Right.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and the rule about

14

malice being -- being the criterion of liability, that

15

applied not just to -- not just to private lawyers but

16

to government lawyers as well, didn't it?

17
18
19

MR. MCGILL:

It did.

That that -- that that

good-faith defense applied -JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, if we're going to be

20

historically faithful, we should deny any qualified

21

immunity to government lawyers or expand the government

22

immunity to -- for government lawyers so they can do

23

anything so long as it's not malicious?

24

MR. MCGILL:

25

Court would have to do.

Well, that -- that's what this

48

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. MCGILL:

3

It would have to basically

expand what was at common law --

MR. MCGILL:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

Right.

-- a defense.
So, the devil with history,

right?

8
9

Right.

MR. MCGILL:

Well, it would result in this

Court having to expand that immunity that it expanded in

10

Harlow to private individuals.

11

because a private individual like Mr. Filarsky is a

12

market participant, the purposes of immunity aren't

13

served.

14

mentioning earlier about --

15

And our position is that

They just simply aren't needed.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I was

What about -- what about

16

the argument that Filarsky makes, that if there were to

17

be a proceeding against him, inevitably the witnesses

18

would be the government employees?

19

battalion chiefs, the fire chief.

20

reasons for the qualified immunity is you don't want to

21

disturb government employees in the routine performance

22

of their work.

23

disruption, distraction of these government employees.

24
25

They would be the
So, one of the

Certainly, in this case, there would be

MR. MCGILL:
some distraction.

Well, there probably would be

That would be inevitable, but it
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be no different than the distraction that the

2

government would face when a private attorney is sued

3

for any number of claims, malpractice or, you know, some

4

State law violation.

5

And to say that the -- the distraction that

6

the government is going to face based on just what is

7

probably a small sliver of the big pie, which is, you

8

know, 1983 litigation, is pretty speculative.

9

course, it doesn't answer the question that the -- the

And, of

10

government employer itself can still be liable under

11

Monell.

12

So, even though the immunity may kick in and

13

the individuals may get off or may not have to stand

14

suit, it -- there are still occasions when the

15

government is still going to be there.

16

distraction is still going to exist.

have participated in the --

4

something illegal is going on.

6

doesn't -- he just sits there quietly?

MR. MCGILL:

Really?

He has an

That's his job.

And he

I don't know that -- that

he would be liable under section 1983.

But if he were,

9

and he were a private lawyer, he would not have

10

qualified immunity.

11

Richardson test where there's no historical basis for

12

it, and because he's the private individual working

13

under -- you know, working for profit and subject to

14

market pressures, he wouldn't --

15

He would still be under the same

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if he -- this

16

for profits -- I -- the significance of that eludes me.

17

Sometimes people act out of, you know, public service,

18

and particularly in these sorts of situations, the town

19

needs a lawyer, and he's helping out.

20

were purely a volunteer, it would be a different answer?

21

MR. MCGILL:

What -- if he

If he were purely a volunteer,

22

it very well might be a different answer because some of

23

those policy concerns that -- that Richardson talked

24

about and discussed may not be present.

6

MR. MCGILL:

He's working for

So, it's

I don't know that 50 percent

7

makes a difference.

And earlier, we were discussing

8

that -- the 1-year or the 2-year and so forth, the

9

length of the contract.

I don't think that those things

10

necessarily make a difference.

11

Filarsky was undertaking that representation or that

12

role in a manner that made him subject to other regular

13

market pressures.

14

The point is whether Mr.

If he was performing a function and

15

competing against other lawyers or other investigators

16

performing that same function, then the point is there,

17

you know, he isn't going to be as timid because he's

18

going to want to do a good job.

19

concerns that are present for that government lawyer

20

aren't there for him as a private individual.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the same policy

Well, suppose a municipality

22

were to -- or a State were to abolish all the civil

23

service rules and all the special rules and go back to

24

employment at will for government employees.

25

-- would that take with it the whole qualified immunity
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Would that

Official

1

regime?

2

MR. MCGILL:

I don't think that it would.

3

In other words, is the question whether or not, if we

4

abolished the merit system or civil service system,

5

would qualified immunity still be needed?

6

I think if that were the question, that --

7

well, that's a tough question to answer.

But it very

8

well may not be because, you know, part of the decision

9

in Richardson here was -- it was -- they are operating

10

within a different system.

11

if you start to make the public system look more like a

12

private system, then it very well may be that immunity

13

won't be needed at all.

14

Private versus public.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

It seems strange because the

15

immunities, at least some of the immunities, long

16

pre-date the -- the institution of the civil service

17

system.

18

person who works is influenced by market forces to some

19

degree; isn't that correct?

20

Everybody is subject to market forces.

MR. MCGILL:

Every

I think that that's correct,

21

but when you have a civil service system, a merit

22

system, it's -- it is not as easy to correct behavior as

23

it would be for, say, a private person.

24

Filarsky, if he was not performing at -- at the level

25

that the City of Rialto had hoped, he can be replaced

immunity or it's not needed.

is, under Harlow, that they would receive it.

them don't -- don't have any protection?

18

MR. MCGILL:

Well, I -Do you think the rest of

I think that the answer would

19

be the same in that they very well may not need

20

qualified immunity because those pressures and those

21

concerns underlying immunity aren't there.

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wow.

That's going to be

disappointing news for all those attorneys at Justice --

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. MCGILL:

I just want to go back and talk
55


Alderson Reporting Company

1

about the Petitioner's test a little bit, too, because

2

the Court had some concerns about it.

3

same concerns, and that's that the test requires a

4

factual analysis, you know, being temporarily retained

5

in close coordination and supervision.

6

factual questions that aren't going to bode well for

7

early resolution of a case.

8
9

And I share those

Those are highly

And a -- the lawyer is going to be able to
plead around that test very easily and take the case

10

into -- into full-blown litigation and discovery and so

11

forth.

12

So, that -- that test is problematic.
In addition, as I understand it, the test is

13

going to be extended well beyond attorneys.

The test

14

results in anybody working for the government under, you

15

know, close coordination or supervision, whatever that

16

means, is going to get immunity.

17

beyond attorneys, to anybody.

18

with the government and meets that factual test is now

19

going to have immunity.

So, that is well

Anybody who contracts

20

And that's something -- that's a huge step

21

that this Court, you know, should not take, especially

22

when there is no historical basis for it and the policy

23

concerns are not present.

24
25

But even if you apply that test to
Mr. Filarsky, under these facts, Mr. Filarsky would not
56

Alderson Reporting Company

1

have immunity.

He wasn't temporarily retained.

2

worked for the City of Rialto for 14 years as -- as a

3

business, for profit.

temporarily retained.

He had many clients, and the City

Mr. Filarsky was not performing a --

Are all of these --

are all of these objections applicable as well to the

10

determination of whether there is state action from the

11

attorney's conduct?

12
13

MR. MCGILL:

The concerns about there being

a factual --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. MCGILL:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. MCGILL:

Yes.

-- inquiry?
Yes.

I don't think so.

I mean, as

18

an attorney, I would have to certify in a pleading that

19

-- the relationship between the person I'm suing and the

20

government.

21

information put forth in the pleading that would

22

establish that, and I don't know that one could simply

23

make up state action for purposes of pursuing a 1983

24

action.

25

So, I think that there would have to be

So, it -- it may be that there's a factual
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inquiry, but I don't think it's as great or nearly as

2

great as -- as the temporarily retained or close

3

coordination components to the -- or the Petitioner's

4

test.

5

Mr. Filarsky was not performing a function

6

that is uniquely governmental.

7

misconduct is not a governmental function, or it's not a

8

prototypical governmental function.

9

Investigating workplace

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your -- your

10

objection is not that he was investigating workplace

11

conduct; your objection is that he was ordering people

12

to tell your client to bring out stuff that was in his

13

house.

14

MR. MCGILL:

Correct.

But it was under the

15

-- the auspices of a -- a workplace investigation, if

16

you will.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but telling

18

people basically either executing a search or in effect

19

executing a search, that is a uniquely governmental

20

function.

21

MR. MCGILL:

Executing a -- a formal search

22

by the government is something -- that's a role that the

23

government performs, but I wouldn't say that -- I

24

wouldn't equate, you know, executing a search with what

25

occurred here.
58

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Well, let me -- let me restate that, I
guess.

What I mean to say is that --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. MCGILL:

You don't want to say that.

Mr. Filarsky -- the function,

6

the role that he was performing was that of an internal

7

affairs investigator.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but if -- if he did

9

the same thing for a private company -- he could do the

10

same thing for a private company, say, you know, you're

11

going to get fired unless you substantiate your story by

12

bringing the stuff out of your house.

13

a search -- an unlawful search; right?

14

happened in a private company.

15

MR. MCGILL:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. MCGILL:

That wouldn't be
It could have

It could, and -Yes.

Yes, it very well could have.

18

And that's my point, is that what Mr. Filarsky did in

19

his role was not uniquely governmental.

20

performing that governmental function.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He wasn't

Well, there's very little

22

that is uniquely governmental.

I mean, my goodness, if

23

we denied immunity to -- to all those acts that are not

24

uniquely governmental, there would be very little

25

immunity, I'm afraid.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MS. MILLETT:

Thank you.

7

Justice Breyer, your dilemma is -- sits at

8

the crux of why qualified immunity is appropriate here

9

because not only do you have the lawyer saying, well,

10

you'll be all okay, but I'm going to be going down in

11

this lawsuit; the lawyer's going to have a duty to

12

inform his client that, in fact, this will lead to

13

litigation.

14

capacity, but guess what, litigation is going to ensue.

You will be protected in your personal

That can influence and deter both lawyers'

15
16

willingness to work for the government at these cut

17

rates or pro bono rates, their -- subconsciously, the

18

advice they give, and it can make the government not

19

want to act on the advice, which is precisely what we

20

want to protect.

21

Nothing like that was happening in

22

Richardson.

The government was nowhere on the scene

23

when the constitutional decisions being challenged --

24

they weren't even percipient witnesses in that

25

situation.
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The second point I want to make is fiduciary

2

duty doesn't change it other than it confirms that he's

3

working in the interest of the government, but every

4

agent has a fiduciary duty to their principal.

5

you can't deny qualified immunity on that ground or

6

you'll have a sweeping decision on your hands.

And so,

7

The market concerns, Justice Sotomayor --

8

the test is not whether a warm body could be found to

9

fulfill this operation if he won't do it.

This is a

10

completely different market from Richardson, where

11

there's only one client for prisons, and that's the

12

government.

13

Here, the government is competing for the

14

services.

15

wants people of the caliber that the government service

16

needs and deserves, it is competing.

17

the Chief Justice recognized, a lot of times, including

18

for Mr. Filarsky, that's done at discount rates.

19

When it needs a skilled attorney, when it

And right now, as

These folks -- this is already a marginal

20

decision.

And if you want to talk about market

21

decisions, then you're going to push that weight.

22

if the answer is, if you decide to take on this pro bono

23

representation or cut your rates out of public duty and

24

-- and a willingness to serve your government, guess

25

what comes with it:

And

You alone will be left holding the
61

Alderson Reporting Company

1

bag at the end of this for the governmental misconduct.

2

Section 1983 is supposed to deter

3

governmental conduct.

It is not supposed to deter the

4

reasonable advice given by lawyers to governmental

5

clients.

If the Court has no further questions.

Thank you.
