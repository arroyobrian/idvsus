 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

first this morning in Case 131175, the City of Los 

5

Angeles v. Patel. 

6

10

 Mr. Rosenkranz. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

11

 This case is about whether to deprive scores 

12

of cities of one of the most effective tools that they 

13

have developed to deter human trafficking, prostitution, 

14

and drug crimes that have seized the  the ground in 

15

America's hotels and motels. 

16

 The ordinance in question is the least 

17

intrusive of  inspection scheme that this Court has 

18

ever encountered.  It is limited to showing the police a 

19

single book containing only information that the hotels 

20

transcribe specifically for the city and that they've 

21

been turning over to the police by operation of law for 

22

150 years. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you  first, two 

24

questions:  Is the information that they've been keeping 

25

for 150 years the same?  Because looking at the

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requirements, the early information was basically 

2

somebody's name and  I'm not even sure  their 

3

address.  But today's information has  or today's 

4

registry and requirements have information that Federal 

5

law doesn't permit to be disclosed, like driver's 

6

license, credit card information.  I mean, Federal law 

7

says you can't disclose that information. 

8
9
10

 So isn't there a difference? 

It's not the 

same tradition over 150 years. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

You are right, Your Honor, 

11

that the amount of information has increased.  The 

12

privacy interests, however, have been pretty much the 

13

same.  It was name and address and the rate that they 

14

were charged and so forth, and that is the  the  the 

15

information that the  that the hotels have argued is 

16

the most private. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right.  All of the 

18

things that you say, the most effective tool for 

19

trafficking, prostitution, child molestation, none of 

20

that sounds like it's  the purpose of the search is 

21

administrative. 

22

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, it is administrative, 

23

Your Honor, and to understand why it's administrative, 

24

you have to focus first on the target.  The target here 

25

is not people who are accused of crimes.  The target is 

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the motels and the hotels who are required to keep 

2

records, to record information.  And why are they 

3

required to record the information?  For the deterrent 

4

purpose, and the deterrent purpose more specifically is 

5

that criminals do not like to register.  They do not 

6

like to record their information. 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Rosenkranz, are you 

8

saying then that the police can do this  can request 

9

these records on demand, and they don't have to have any 

10

reason at all  no reasonable suspicion, no probable 

11

cause, nothing  because the purpose is to deter people 

12

from staying in hotels who might do bad things.  So 

13

no  nothing like a reasonable suspicion requirement. 

14

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

15

It's the same rationale that this Court adopted in 

16

Burger, that frequent, unannounced spot inspections are 

17

necessary in order to achieve that deterrent purpose; 

18

that if the hotels do not record all the names, and more 

19

specifically, they record most names but not the names 

20

of the  of the guests that they know are criminals, 

21

there's no way to know, unless you have this frequent, 

22

unannounced inspection, that someone is missing.  So 

23

there's a real necessity here as there was in Burger and 

24

in Biswell. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can you tell me how many

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecutions there have been  and I use the word both 

2

criminally or civil  for the failure to register 

3

people? 

4

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, there have been 

5

numerous prosecutions.  I can't tell you how many.  The 

6

complaints in this case, which are in the beginning of 

7

the joint appendix, refer to the plaintiffs having been 

8

prosecuted multiple times, or fined, for failure  for 

9

failing to keep the records. 

10

 And I guess I do want to underscore this 

11

point about necessity.  The problem is not that the 

12

registers are empty.  The problem is that the hotels 

13

decline to record the names of those who they know are 

14

criminals, or the motels do 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that has nothing to 

16

do with the free right to search.  Those people who are 

17

refusing to do it are going to refuse to do it.  A 

18

recordkeeping requirement has no  has no 

19

constitutional challenge.  What does is the unfettered 

20

access to that record. 

21

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

22

let me just break it down. 

23
24
25

Agreed, Your Honor, and so 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Those people who don't 

want to do it are not going to do it anyway. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Exactly.  Those people who

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

don't want to do it go somewhere else or don't commit 

2

their crimes, but if they  if they are forced to do 

3

it, which is to say the motel won't let them stay there 

4

unless they register, then they will not commit those 

5

crimes in the motels.  And the only way to make sure 

6

that the motels are enforcing that obligation is to 

7

descend on them without notice as  as Justice Ginsburg 

8

was saying, and frequently, so that they never know when 

9

the police are going to come.  Why?  To make sure that 

10
11

they are indeed recording the information. 
 And why is the real time observation key? 

12

It's because they've been busy, the police show up and 

13

they have a register, and they notice that room 

14

number  room No. 2 is unoccupied according to the 

15

register, but they see someone in room No. 2.  They know 

16

only from real time observation that there is a violation 

17

here.  If they get the register a month later, they have 

18

nothing to compare it to. 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You  you mean they can 

20

walk up and down the halls and see that nobody's in the 

21

certain room?  I don't know quite how you do that. 

22
23
24
25

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, Your Honor, the way 

it works in particular 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You have room No. 2 as if 

it's right there, but room No. 1204 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

So motels, for example, are 

out in the open.  You can sit there and see 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What about my question 

4

about room 1204?  You seem to say the police can wander 

5

all over the hotel. 

6

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, if  the police may 

7

be allowed to wander around the hotel.  They probably 

8

will not see much if what they're doing is wandering 

9

back and forth looking at particular rooms. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I suppose in motels they 

11

can see what rooms have cars in front of them.  And I 

12

suppose as to room 1204 they can see, usually behind the 

13

desk what  what keys are missing, what  what rooms 

14

appear not to be occupied. 

15

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

That's correct, Your Honor, 

16

and that's why the real time observation is so key, 

17

because you can't do that a month later.  And that's why 

18

we have the same necessity 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sure.  Why?  I mean, 

20

what you're saying is it's easier to prosecute, but it 

21

doesn't mean that you can't devote some resources and 

22

find this out.  You do a surveillance which is what 

23

police do for a lot of crimes.  And you watch people 

24

going in for two hours and leaving, and you keep a 

25

record of it.  You can even stop those people who are

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

leaving to ask them. 
 So there's a whole lot of law enforcement 

3

techniques that could be used to combat the situations 

4

you're talking about. 

5

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

6
7

But not nearly as 

effectively, Your Honor, because 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, since when has the 

8

Fourth Amendment completely been abandoned to how 

9

effective the proof that the police can get at a moment 

10
11

should be? 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, Your Honor, that's 

12

not the test.  But Dewey refers to the fact that it's 

13

not as effective, and it simply doesn't work, Your 

14

Honor.  Let me give you an example. 

15

 If all the police are doing is looking for 

16

who's in what room and what keys are missing, they don't 

17

actually know what to look for until long after the 

18

fact.  They may be looking for the wrong thing.  And 

19

there are many motels where they can't  where they 

20

can't do it, for example, look at the keys because 

21

they're not available and easy to see.  And so it's 

22

having the information right in front of them, and then 

23

comparing it to things that they might be able to 

24

observe. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Rosenkranz, why

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

isn't this just like Barlow's really?  That it's not 

2

necessary on the following rationale:  Number one, most 

3

people will consent so that you go  the police go into 

4

a hotel and say we'd like to see your registry, most 

5

people are going to consent.  If somebody says no, and 

6

there's a real basis for believing that the evidence is 

7

going to be altered or destroyed, you can seize it 

8

pending judicial review, or you can get an 

9

administrative warrant ex parte and conduct a surprise 

10

examination if you want to. 

11

 So we talked about all of those things in 

12

Barlow's, about how  why that suggested that these 

13

warrantless searches were not necessary.  What makes 

14

this different? 

15

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Your Honor, what makes this 

16

different is the distinction between Barlow's on the one 

17

hand and Burger, Dewey, Biswell, Colonnade, on the other 

18

hand, and that is the movability of information.  That 

19

is the transience and  of the information that you use 

20

to verify. 

21

 In Barlow's, if there is an unsafe 

22

condition, there is an unsafe condition, and it's hard 

23

to see.  The  this Court said it also in See and 

24

distinguished  and Biswell distinguished See on that 

25

ground.  If you  if you  if it's the sort of

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

condition that doesn't change over time, you can get a 

2

warrant, and it doesn't affect your 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

What's 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Go ahead. 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

What's going to  what's 

6

going to change here?  The registry is the registry, and 

7

as I said, if in an unusual case you have the feeling 

8

that the hotel is complicit, you can make sure to freeze 

9

the registry.  But that's going to be an unusual case, 

10

and mostly, the registry is going to be there. 

11

 And, you know, as I said mostly people are 

12

going to consent.  To the extent not you can go get a 

13

warrant. 

14

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, Your Honor, what 

15

will  what would change is, is the information on the 

16

basis of which you draw that comparison.  If you only 

17

compare the register  if you get the register a month 

18

later, you can't compare it to facts on the ground to 

19

to the cause 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

A month later doesn't  you 

know, it  it's an hour later. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, you mean get a 

23

warrant within hour?  Warrants within an hour are  are 

24

not that easy to get, particularly 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What's the probable cause

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for the warrant? 

2

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, there is  that's 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If you haven't seen the 

4
5
6
7

register, what's the probable cause? 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Right, there is no probable 

cause. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What, do you have to have a 

8

policeman sit outside the hotel for  for days to  I 

9

mean, you don't have probable cause unless you know that 

10

there  there are people who are, you know, in  in 

11

the room for a short time who haven't registered. 

12

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Right.  That  that's 

13

exactly right.  But  and warrants are for probable 

14

cause.  That's why Burger and Biswell said no, you don't 

15

need to get a warrant when you're doing an 

16

administrative inspection. 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If you prevail in this 

18

case and a member of the Court sits down to write the 

19

opinion, does he or she have to use the phrase 

20

"reasonable expectation of privacy" and say there is no 

21

reasonable expectation of privacy in our society, in our 

22

culture, in our day, or do we just forget that phrase? 

23

In  in a way, as we all know it's circular, that if we 

24

say there is a reasonable expectation, then there is. 

25

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, Your Honor, the 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

answer depends upon which Fourth Amendment rubric one

2

uses.  Under the Burger line of cases, the Court looks 

3

at the statute, asks is this a closely regulated 

4

business?  Was it necessary?  Is it a legitimate nonlaw 

5

enforcement purpose, and so forth. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is closely regulated 

7

another way to talk about reasonable expectation of 

8

privacy? 

9
10
11

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Yes, indeed it is. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

We talk about that in the 

Katz case, the telephone booth case 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I don't know that 
But I'm not sure that 

14

is that still a phrase that's  that's necessary and 

15

required for us to address in an opinion like this? 

16

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

If the Court adopts the 

17

Burger rubric, what the Court was doing in Burger was 

18

saying because this is so heavily regulated in the 

19

context of this case, because everyone knows that these 

20

registers have been reviewed by the police for 15 years, 

21

no one goes into the hole  into the hotel business 

22

unaware that their registers will be inspected. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Whose expectation of 

privacy are we talking about? 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

We are talking only about 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

the hotel.
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Not the hotel guests; 

right? 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

No, Your Honor.  The motel 

5

 the plaintiffs have taken the position that this is 

6

not about the expectation of privacy of the guests. 

7
8

Yes.  That's what I 


 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
thought.  It's 

9

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

But only 


10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 of the hotel. 


11

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Yes. 


12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You can't see my register. 


13
14

It's  it's dear to me. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Even though I have entered 


15

a business that for 115 years has revealed these 

16

registers and for 100 of those years, actually revealed 

17

the registers to the guests. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But 
Who 
Suppose that there's a 

21

Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose that there's a statute that says 

22

that the taxing authority, the IRS or the equivalent on 

23

the State level, that the taxing authority can go into 

24

businesses at any time and check payroll records; and 

25

the reason is that they need to conduct these surprise, 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

warrantless searches because there's a serious problem

2

with businesses ginning up false payroll records.  Is 

3

that constitutional? 

4

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

I would think not, Your 

5

Honor, at least not without more information.  And the 

6

difference is, there  there isn't this long history of 

7

the government reviewing payroll records.  And 

8

secondly  or at least it's a closer question.  And 

9

secondly, payroll records are not the sorts of things 

10

for which you need spot inspections.  If someone 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

How about the hiring 
No.  If the government says 

13

that they do  the government says that if you wait 

14

till they submit everything at the end of the year, 

15

they'll falsify a lot of records, and we really need to 

16

see what's happening right now on the ground in 

17

real time. 

18

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, Your Honor, either a 

19

payroll record is false or it's not.  You don't need 

20

real time verification to figure out if it's false or 

21

not. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, you do, because you 

23

don't want to give them the time to falsify things till 

24

the end of the year.  I mean, we  we could have a 

25

thousand examples like this. 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

And  and my answer is

2

still the same.  It doesn't have the same real time need 

3

to verify against facts that are 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't know why not. 

5

Checking to see if people are actually registered, you 

6

don't know that until you see a person working.  So 

7

you've got a construction site.  You count the number of 

8

people; and you say, let me see your recordkeeping for 

9

your employees today. 

10

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

11

Well, Your Honor, that 

was 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

That's a real time need. 
It's a  it's  but 

14

either the record  either the ultimate record that is 

15

submitted is false or it's not.  You  you don't have 

16

the real time ability to verify whether those records 

17

are 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 MR. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You just 

ROSENKRANZ:   correct. 
You just keep a 

21

register  you falsify the register the way that you're 

22

saying these people would. 

23

 I  my problem with the closely held 

24

closely regulated is I don't see one regulation that's 

25

not applicable to virtually every public accommodation 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

entity, whether it's a telephone company or a day school

2

or a hospital. 

3

 I mean, virtually all of these requirements 

4

that you list are part of the normal State regulation of 

5

entities that serve people. 

6
7

 Is it your position now that once we say 
this is closely regulated, that everything is 

8

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10
11
12
13

No, your Honor. 
 that serves the 

public in some way? 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

No.  And I see I'm eating 

into my rebuttal time, so if I may answer quickly. 
 No. 

There  first of all, the closely 

14

regulated exception is not  is  is way more than 

15

just closely regulated.  There are three other elements 

16

to it, and you need to demonstrate the necessity, you 

17

need to demonstrate that it's not a criminal justice 

18

purpose, and you need to demonstrate that there's an 

19

adequate substitute for a warrant. 

20
21

 So if there are no further questions, I'd 
like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

 SUPPORTING PETITIONER
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 This Court can resolve this case on a much 

5

narrower basis than it has used in looking at other 

6

administrative inspection schemes, such as the one in 

7

Barlow's. 

8
9

 The Ninth Circuit itself recognized that 
this case did not involve an entry into the nonpublic 

10

working places of a business.  It did not involve an 

11

entry into a residential property.  It involved an entry 

12

only into the public lobby area of a motel and a brief 

13

inspection of the registry of the motel. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that doesn't 

15

seem very significant.  I mean, it  it could well 

16

involve entry into a drawer.  We wouldn't normally say, 

17

well, because you can  our rule is not simply because 

18

you can get into a house, for example, that you're free 

19

to rummage through desks. 

20

 MR. DREEBEN: 

That's certainly right, but 

21

what the  this statute requires is that the registry 

22

be produced for inspection.  And the way in which the 

23

officer gets to the registry is to walk into the lobby. 

24

 And so the Ninth Circuit 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  You're 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying that if a police officer stands outside a house

2

and says, bring me whatever it is I want from inside, 

3

and he brings it out, that's not a violation of the 

4

Fourth Amendment because he, under compulsion, tells the 

5

person you have to bring me what's inside, because I 

6

can't enter under the Fourth Amendment. 

7

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, Justice Sotomayor, it 

8

would be a search.  The reasonableness of it would 

9

depend on the facts, but what  what my 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So that's the point. 
 my point here is that this 

12

is  we're dealing here with businesses which have 

13

reduced expectations of privacy, and we are not dealing 

14

with entry into the nonpublic areas of the businesses, 

15

which is what Marshall's was concerned with, Colonnade, 

16

Biswell, Burger, all of those cases. 

17

 So the Ninth Circuit itself did not apply 

18

the rules that govern those kinds of situations where 

19

the Court has sometimes said an administrative warrant 

20

is required and other times said it is not. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This is a facial challenge. 

22

Now, are there any or a substantial number of instances 

23

in which the application of this statute would be 

24

constitutional? 

25

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I  I think there 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would, Justice Alito, in  if there were exigent

2

circumstances that justified the access to the registry. 

3

 And most importantly 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

5
6
7

need the statute. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9

 MR. DREEBEN: 

11
12
13

Well, the statute helps 

because it informs the 

8

10

But  but then you don't 

No. 
 hotels. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There are exigent 

circumstances.  You can get  get a warrant. 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yeah.  Well, you don't have to 

get a warrant. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So that doesn't work. 
No, I think it works, Justice 

16

Kennedy, in the sense that the  the statute provides 

17

encouragement for a potentially recalcitrant hotel owner 

18

to produce it, because it's an offense for him not to. 

19

 But more importantly, I think for the 

20

Court's evaluation of the facial challenge issue is that 

21

there's no record in this case about what kind of 

22

privacy expectations actually exist with respect to 

23

hotel registries.  It's largely a matter of conjecture, 

24

speculation, and everybody's intuition of 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't think  I don't 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

see why we've ever required more.  All we've required is

2

a person to say, this is my business record. 

3

 And why do they have to prove more? 

4

 MR. DREEBEN: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Because 
What  what are they 

6

suppose to prove, that they don't use  that they don't 

7

show it to anyone else?  We've never required that. 

8
9
10
11

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I think that they should 

show that there's a certain degree of confidentiality 
associated with it that they in fact 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, there is today 

12

when the Federal law requires that you not disclose 

13

credit card information and driver's license information 

14

and these registries contain that information.  So you 

15

can't have it both ways. 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well 
The registries 
 some 
 by law are required 

20

to have the driver's license information taken for 

21

people who are paying cash 

22

 MR. DREEBEN: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's right. 
 and requires the 

24

credit card information of people who are otherwise 

25

registering. 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, the registry doesn't

2

have to have the credit card information unless they 

3

check in at a kiosk.  And this, I think, brings up a 

4

very important point.  What the Ninth Circuit did was 

5

facially invalidate the statute that said that 

6

regardless of any facts, it can't be enforced against 

7

anyone. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah.  I  I assume that, 

you know, if the problem is license plates and credit 

10

card information and all of that, it's not up to the 

11

hotel to complain about that invasion of privacy.  It's 

12

up to the guests, right? 

13
14
15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

I would agree with that, 

Justice Scalia. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And this case does not 

16

involve the guests.  It's just the hotel who's 

17

objecting. 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

It's just the hotel, and there 

19

is a range of situations in which different information 

20

is maintained in different ways. 

21

 So I think that treating it as a facial 

22

challenge is problematic; but if you reach the merits, 

23

what the Ninth Circuit itself did is conclude that this 

24

case doesn't trigger the very strong safeguards that are 

25

triggered when there is an invasion of a nonpublic space 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a business.  They treat it as if it's an

2

administrative subpoena case, which does have Fourth 

3

Amendment requirements associated with it; but those 

4

requirements are that the subpoena be relevant, that it 

5

be reasonable in scope, and that it be specific. 

6

 And the Ninth Circuit conceded that all 

7

three of those requirements are satisfied, Section 

8

41.49, by itself establishes the relevance of the 

9

information for the administrative purpose that the 

10

statute serves.  It is specific and it is narrow in 

11

scope.  And anybody who goes into the hotel industry 

12

knows that that is a  an inspection that they are 

13

subjected to. 

14

 The Ninth Circuit 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

How  how do you 

distinguish  is it Marshall and Barlow? 

17

 Do I  do I have the right name? 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

19

 And the distinction which the Ninth Circuit, 

You do, Justice Kennedy. 

20

itself drew is that involved entry into the nonpublic 

21

areas of a business which exposes a much wider range of 

22

information to the inspection of the authorities. 

23

 Marshall covered every industry in 

24

interstate commerce, and it allowed OSHA inspections 

25

without any limitation.  And in that circumstance 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I don't understand

2

that, Mr. Dreeben.  You're saying that it makes a 

3

difference constitutionally whether you keep the 

4

registry at the front desk or in the back office? 

5

 MR. DREEBEN: 

What I'm saying, Justice 

6

Kagan, is that the Ninth Circuit analyzed it precisely 

7

that way, that you can walk into the lobby of a hotel. 

8

This Court so said in the Lone Steer case, you're not 

9

invading any expectation of privacy.  All you do is you 

10

ask the hotel keeper, the front desk clerk, to show you 

11

the register, which can be done as  simply by just 

12

moving the computer screen so that the officer can see 

13

it.  And that is the most minimal intrusion on privacy 

14

interests, if they exist. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, if I were running a 

16

hotel, I think I might have  prefer to have two 

17

uniformed detectives in the backroom so the guests don't 

18

see it.  I think it's quite intrusive. 

19

 MR. DREEBEN: 

The Ninth Circuit treated it 

20

as a lesser degree of intrusion than an inspection of 

21

all of the private areas of the business; and that's why 

22

it applied the subpoena line of cases.  But once you 

23

apply the subpoena line of cases, you realize that the 

24

statute itself serves the purposes that that line of 

25

cases is designed to serve. 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And the only remaining claim that's

2

really  well, the judicial review will be very 

3

difficult to accomplish in this case, because the whole 

4

purpose of this administrative scheme is, we're not 

5

you know, we regulate prostitutes, we regulate narcotics 

6

activity through the criminal law.  The place where they 

7

are frequently conducting it are lowbudget motels that 

8

have a strong incentive to take cash and not fill out a 

9

registry and allow this kind of criminal activity to 

10

flourish. 

11

 So the regulatory purpose of 41.49 is to 

12

target not the criminals, but the place where they 

13

conduct their activity.  And doing it in a classic 

14

administrative way.  This is lawful activity; you can 

15

rent a room.  You just have to not rent it to people for 

16

cash, for short terms, for no reservations, when they 

17

don't have an identification to show who they are, and 

18

you need to keep a record of what you're doing. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dreeben, I'm trying to 

20

figure out what do you think is relevant here; so let me 

21

give you a hypo, which is say that it's not a hotel, but 

22

it's a hunting lodge.  And there are recordkeeping 

23

requirements about how much people shoot and when they 

24

shoot them and what they shoot, and so forth and so on. 

25

And the fish and wildlife service or some state 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

equivalent of that says, we do not  we do not want to

2

rely on people reporting this to us at periodic points, 

3

we just want to make spot inspections, surprise 

4

inspections, all the time.  Would that be all right? 

5
6
7
8

10

 MR. DREEBEN: 

difficult case to me, Justice Kagan, in part because 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's a private hunting 

lodge, this was a private hotel. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

difference, isn't it? 

14

Is this a public hunting 

lodge? 

11

13

It seems like a much more 

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, that's a big 

I will have to defer to 

members of the Court on hunting lodges. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

But I think that interest that 

17

is being served there is far weaker than the interest 

18

that is being served here, which is a genuine problem 

19

reflected in the fact that there are a hundred statutes 

20

like this across the country in different sounds 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Wait, that's how you're 

22

going to distinguish it, Just because it's more 

23

important?  Because the fish and wildlife people think 

24

that it's really, awfully very important to make sure 

25

that all these rules are  are complied with. 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

I agree with that, Justice

2

Kagan, but I do think that this Court in it's classic 

3

Fourth Amendment analysis balances the government 

4

interest to be served against the nature of the 

5

intrusion. 

6

 I don't know enough about the hunting lodges 

7

that you have in mind to really gage the nature of the 

8

intrusion.  I will say this, that a mere requirement 

9

that you expose books and records that you're required 

10

to keep as a regulatory matter, and that no one disputes 

11

you're required to keep, to a law enforcement officer in 

12

a public area of your facility, that's this case. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There  there  there is 

14

no dispute here that you can require the hotel to keep 

15

the records. 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

19
20

That is correct. 
Is that right? 
The hotels are not challenging 

that. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think there would be a 

21

big dispute with regard to private hunting lodges, 

22

whether you could require them to keep the records. 

23

 MR. DREEBEN: 

And there may be Second 

24

Amendment concerns that the Court would weigh in the 

25

balance. 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 I think that the Court can resolve this
case, in an extremely narrow fashion. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I think it's even 

4

more dangerous.  Look at almost how many businesses, 

5

retail businesses transact their recordkeeping in public 

6

areas.  Talk about any shop in the country.  They don't 

7

go to the back, virtually any of them, and transact 

8

their business, keep their credit card information. 

9

They put it right on the computer in front of them.  So, 

10

I mean 

11

 MR. DREEBEN: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  I think 
So it can't be that 

13

merely ask  intruding on someone's private 

14

information, in a public place eliminates the Fourth 

15

Amendment. 

16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

May I answer? 
Yes. 

I think you ask  asked three 

19

questions, Justice Sotomayor; first, the substantiality 

20

of the government interests; second, the nature of the 

21

intrusion on privacy; and third, necessity.  And there 

22

is a strong need in the case of these hotels, where 

23

prostitution and narcotics activity flourish because 

24

criminals do not want to identify themselves when they 

25

check in, to have regular, unannounced inspections to 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

give the hotels the incentive to comply with the

registration law.

 ORAL ARGUMENT BY THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 
 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, may it 

please the Court: 
 We ask the Court to hold that the city does 

11

not need to go to the judge in advance and get a 

12

warrant, but instead, that it merely needs to issue us a 

13

onepage subpoena.  Now, we can object to that subpoena, 

14

but it's going to be enforced unless the city isn't 

15

actually implementing a legitimate administrative scheme 

16

because it's searching us to harass us or to investigate 

17

crimes. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is it  is it your 

19

position that there is no instance in which this statute 

20

and the  the implementation of it would be 

21

constitutional? 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It is because the hypothesis 

23

that you would use it for, exigent circumstances or when 

24

would you have waived the right to privacy by putting it 

25

out on the desk, don't actually involve the enforcement 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2


of the statute.

 What's necessary here, the value that's in 


3


the Fourth Amendment, is the requirement that there be a 

4

regularized scheme.  Now, it's going to be a regularized 

5

scheme that either appears in the administrative rule 

6

itself.  That doesn't exist here.  There's no limit on 

7

when they can search, how often they can search, or the 

8

reason they can search.  And if there isn't that, then 

9

we put a court into the process.  We make 

10

preenforcement judicial reviewable available, and the 

11

reason is the Fourth Amendment protects our sense of 

12

tranquility.  The hotel owners, individuals in other 

13

contexts, businesses in other contexts, need to know 

14

that beat officers aren't going to, at their whim, 

15

conduct these searches. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Suppose that a city or a 

17

State wanted to establish an administrative inspection 

18

regime along the lines of Barlow's?  What would it 

19

what would it have to include in your judgment?  Could 

20

they  could the warrant be issued by an administrative 

21

law judge 

22

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
 as opposed to a superior

Would it have  would it

No. 
Could they  could it be 

done without prior notice? 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could you have different 

8
9
10

standards for different types of hotels? 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

If there is 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Periodic inspections for all 

11

hotels, but much more frequent inspections for hotels 

12

that rent by the hour, hotels that have a large number 

13

of guests who pay in cash, and so forth? 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All those things could be 

16

done. 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Sure. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Now if that's okay, it's 

19

really not clear to me what that would add to the 

20

ordinance that we have before us. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Great.  And that was, 

22

Justice Kennedy asked how we  how Barlow's plays out 

23

in this context.  So Mr. Dreeben is half right in his 

24

answer.  He is absolutely right that the Court has said, 

25

look, if you're not physically inspecting the premises, 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

then you don't have to, ahead of time, get a warrant.
 And, Justice Scalia, it's not a probable 

3

cause criminal warrant.  All the Court has required in 

4

this line of cases is that the government show that it's 

5

part of an ordinarily administrative scheme. 

6

 But the second part is what's missing, and 

7

the key case that's mentioned in passing by Mr. Dreeben, 

8

it hasn't gotten enough attention in the case, it's 

9

called Donovan v. Lone Steer.  And it was decided by 

10

an opinion by then Justice Rehnquist, it's an unanimous 

11

opinion, and it considers a circumstance very similar to 

12

this, and that is, under the Fair Labors Standards Act, 

13

the government can do just what it does here, and that 

14

is it just demands employment records. 

15

 And the reason this Court said that that 

16

comports with the Fourth Amendment is there is a 

17

balance, and that is that the government has to issue a 

18

subpoena to which the employer can object.  And that 

19

accomplishes two things.  The first is, without 

20

burdening the government, it interjects the possibility 

21

of judicial review and that way you know that the 

22

enforcement officer 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what would be the 

24

nature of the objection?  I'm going back to 

25

Mr. Rosenkranz's answer to my question.  He said, the 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there is no notion of probable cause, reasonable cause.

2

The hotel owner is required to keep these records and 

3

the  that's not disputed.  They're each required to 

4

keep them.  And so  and the police don't have to have 

5

any reason. 

6
7
8
9

 What would be  what would be shown by some 
kind of a hearing? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Sure, Your Honor.  This 

line  this Court's consistent line of precedents, 

10

there are six cases that have dealt with this subpoena 

11

rule, have said the following:  And that is, the 

12

concern, when you have a scheme like this one that 

13

doesn't tell the officer how often or when to search, 

14

and  is that the officer will do two things that are 

15

forbidden by the Fourth Amendment.  One is they'll do it 

16

in a harassing way, and the second is they'll use it for 

17

crime control. 

18

 And the latter is a real concern here. 

The 

19

city is avowedly saying it wants to look at the record 

20

to, for example, find prostitutes or the Johns who are 

21

involved in renting the rooms.  And so that's why what 

22

you do is you let the police issue the subpoena.  They 

23

don't go to the judge ahead of time.  But the prospect 

24

that there can be an objection and that you can go to a 

25

judge is what protects the  the sense of tranquility 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

of the business owner.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, what's the 

3

purpose  you agree that it's constitutional to require 

4

the registry? 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Absolutely. 
Okay.  Why is the State 

7

interested in requiring the register if it can't go look 

8

at it with little notice? 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Ah 
What's the point? 
Well, Justice Kennedy, the 

12

fact that its only interest is in law enforcement I 

13

think is a point in our favor.  But just recognize that 

14

what Mr. Rosenkranz is describing as the scenario that 

15

gave rise to your question about room 1202 we think is 

16

entirely inaccurate.  So if I could just play out the 

17

hypothetical. 

18

 His point is as follows: 

An officer shows 

19

up at a motel, and sees someone in a room  sees a 

20

light on in room 2.  We'll give him his best case.  And 

21

what he wants to do then is to go and look and, right 

22

then, determine, look, there is a registration card for 

23

room 2.  Now, I don't know what that proves, because he 

24

doesn't know that anything inappropriate is going on in 

25

room 2, but it doesn't matter.  What the officer does is 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

he makes a record:  There was someone in room 2 on

2

June 1st 12:00 a.m.  And then he comes back two days 

3

later and serves the subpoena. 

4

 There is no reason in the world  that 

5

doesn't give any advance notice to the motel owner.  If 

6

he has a particular concern, then he can sequester the 

7

records so that they can have them held separately, if 

8

there is going to be an objection, which is extremely 

9

rare.  There is no reason  his concern is about 

10

contemporaneous observation.  That's not the issue in 

11

the case.  He can sit outside and look outside the room. 

12

The issue in the case is do you have to go in and have 

13

no opportunity for a judge to be involved before you 

14

search the records. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Seeing the light on doesn't 

16

prove anything unless you know that the hotel has not 

17

registered the person who is in the room. 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Scalia 
And 
 remember, our objection 

21

is not to them being able to either require the register 

22

or inspect the register.  Neither one of those is at 

23

issue.  The question is, can they do that without giving 

24

us any opportunity to say to a judge what's actually 

25

going on in here is law enforcement or harassment; 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they've come in five times during the day.  And that

2

system, which is they issued the subpoena, right?  They 

3

don't go to the judge ahead of time, they come up, they 

4

show  they give me a subpoena, right, and they say, we 

5

want the records, and if there is an objection, the 

6

officer has made the observation about room 2. 

7

 And they can go ahead  telephonic warrants 

8

are easy, but there's no reason that the subpoena 

9

objection can't be heard by a judge later on.  He's 

10

already observed and made a note about what's going on 

11

in the hotel. 

12

 Now, I will say 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They  they  they could 

14

fill in.  While he's running off getting his subpoena, 

15

they fill in who was in that room. 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The subpoena is  Justice 

17

Scalia, the subpoena  he's not running off anywhere. 

18

The subpoena is simply handed at the desk.  This is an 

19

administrative onepage piece of paper.  But let me just 

20

say 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, no  sorry. 
I don't understand. 

Okay.  Sorry. 
He has it in his pocket? 
Yes.  That's how 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All you're asking for, all

2

this litigation, is just that the one who wants to 

3

inspect it just pulls out a piece of paper and hands it 

4

to him and that makes it all okay. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No.  There's two parts to 

6

this, Justice Scalia.  That's how a subpoena works.  The 

7

reason this Court has asserted  has required that is 

8

the bare minimum, except in the very limited Burger 

9

context, is that when you hand the subpoena, the person 

10

who receives the subpoena says, this is an unusual case, 

11

I'm going to go to the trouble of objecting.  I think I 

12

can tell a judge and prove to a judge that this is law 

13

enforcement in  in disguise. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

without the subpoena. 

16

He could say the same thing 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes, but that's  our 

17

critical point is that this guarantees him the right to 

18

say that to a judge. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And I thought 
It allows him the 

21

opportunity, while the policeman is getting a subpoena, 

22

to fill in the name of the person in what is otherwise a 

23

blank space. 

24
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, he's not 

going to get a subpoena.  Subpoenas don't work that way. 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

Subpoenas are issued 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Oh, I thought you 

3

said that if he serves a subpoena, the other person can 

4

demand judicial  preenforcement judicial review. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, that's correct. 
So the police 

7

officer has to go somewhere to get the judicial review 

8

with whoever the hotel owner sends. 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, it might not work that 

10

way, and that is, the hotel office  the hotel owner 

11

may have to file a motion to quash.  It's not 

12

particularly important to your hypothetical. 

13
14
15

 Mr. Chief Justice, here's the problem with 
that argument. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, it is important to 

16

the hypothetical because we're trying to figure out how 

17

this works. 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20

Yes. 
The policeman goes with a 

subpoena and the hotel owner says, I object. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 
Now what happens? 
He files 
And how long does it take? 
It doesn't take any amount 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of time, which is why the Court has consistently 

2

required it.  And that is, he says, I'm not going to

3

give you the records.  I'm going to file a motion to 

4

quash.  If the police want to enforce it right away, 

5

they can go to an administrative judge and ask that it 

6

be 

7
8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  They go 

somewhere. 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

10

Yes. 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  During that 

11

time, doesn't the hotel clerk take his pen and say, I 

12

didn't register this guy in room 2, I'm going to get in 

13

trouble, and he fills in whatever is left to be filled 

14

in. 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No.  For the reason given by 

16

Justice Kagan, and that is, you can sequester the 

17

records.  And that is, the question is searching the 

18

records.  That is, we're talking about a set of cards. 

19

And if this is a real concern  now, I will say it is a 

20

concern made up by the city's lawyers in this Court when 

21

at trial they did not introduce any evidence of this and 

22

it would be equally applicable in every kind of required 

23

record.  The same is true in a construction site or Fair 

24

Labor Standards Act. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So in a standard 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

construction subpoena, if you object and say, well, I'm 

2

going to take these records and keep them in the police 

3

car trunk until we resolve this? 

4
5
6
7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 
are two ways 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

11

There's authority for 

that? 

8

10

Yes, you can do that.  There 

I'm sorry? 
There's authority from 

this Court? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Oh, sure.  It's very similar 

12

to what this Court has said in the Fourth Amendment 

13

context.  Remember, when the police show up at someone's 

14

house and they're concerned about the destruction of 

15

evidence inside, what they do is simply sequester 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me that's much 

more intrusive than the scheme you're objecting to. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Kennedy, I don't 

19

think the government can have it both ways.  These are 

20

our private records, okay?  And they want to do 

21

something incredibly unusual that the Fourth Amendment 

22

forbids, and that is, they want to have a scheme that 

23

doesn't say when they'll search, how often they'll 

24

search, or the purpose of the search. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

They're not entirely 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

private records 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.
 they're records required 

4

by law to be kept and you are not objecting to that at 

5

all. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Justice Scalia, that's 

7

absolutely right.  The other side makes a good point, 

8

and that is, these are business records that will 

9

receive reduced Fourth Amendment protection.  We 

10

understand that.  So did the unanimous court in Lone 

11

Steer.  What it said is, that's the reason we don't have 

12

a probable cause requirement here.  That's why we 

13

require the minimum amount of judicial process, which is 

14

the prospect that if the owner has a good objection, 

15

they can go to a judge.  That's why we don't have the 

16

Fourth Amendment's full protections.  But remember 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Goldstein, I thought 
But you said they could 

19

be  they can be  they can be sequestered by the 

20

police officer, they even answered before, that 

21

suggested you have to have some outside approval.  But 

22

now you're saying if the hotel owner says, you can't 

23

have these records, the police can say, give me the 

24

books and take them away. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  They cannot inspect 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

them, just hold them aside.  If this is a real problem, 

2

which there's no evidence of, but if  if they want to

3

just hold them aside, then that  they can be just 

4

sequestered.  Nobody looks at them until a judge 

5

decides. 

6
7

11
12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's a seizure.  That is a 

seizure. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right.  Absolutely. 

Justice 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So why is that justified and 

looking at the information not? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

This Court has held that in 

13

the identical circumstance, this arises in the Fourth 

14

Amendment context.  When the government is concerned 

15

about the destruction of evidence, before it can acquire 

16

a warrant, it can sequester the property, that is, it 

17

can seize control of the property without searching it. 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yeah, that's if it has 

probable cause. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Your Honor, it has the 

21

relevant level of cause that's required in the 

22

particular context.  We can't 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I'm confused by your answer. 

24

I thought you said in response to my earlier questions 

25

that the city could have a regime under which an 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

administrative law judge issues a warrant, not a 

2

subpoena 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 for a periodic 

5

inspection. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Sure. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So the  the officer would 

8

have the warrant, would go to the hotel, here's the 

9

warrant, this is your periodic inspection.  There would 

10

be no prejudicial review. 

11

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is  that's not right. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

There could be a challenge 

13
14

to it later. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No, Your Honor.  When 

15

what this Court has said in cases like Camara and See, 

16

and it's the distinction drawn in Lone Steer and 

17

Barlow's, is that when you get the preenforcement 

18

judicial review, that is the judicial evolvement that's 

19

required. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Right. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right?  So we'd be perfectly 

22

happy with that.  The difference between your 

23

hypothetical and this one is that a judge is involved 

24

and ensures that this isn't for law enforcement.  It's 

25

the orderly operation of administrative scheme; whereas, 


43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what the city wants is for a beat cop to be able to go 

2

in at anytime, as often as he wants, for any purpose.

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The complexity of the 

4

answers and, frankly, the surprise I have at some of 

5

your answers may indicate that this is not a basis for a 

6

facial  this is not a case for facial attack. 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9
10
11

Okay.  Let me 
Seems to me we have to go 

back and  and decide these issues on a casebycase 
basis. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Justice Kennedy, I'll 

12

give you my responses to that obviously, and that is, the 

13

Court in all of the Colonnade line of cases and Camara 

14

cases has dealt with things on a categorical basis.  It 

15

has never done it on a casebycase basis, because it is 

16

look at the structure of the scheme, that is, this is a 

17

scheme where they're not going to have any reason 

18

they don't need any justification to come in.  We know 

19

what they can seize.  It's still limited, right?  It's a 

20

particular record, but they can do it anytime.  And in 

21

that kind of scheme, what the Court has consistently 

22

insisted on, and I hope that the Court will take a look 

23

at Lone Steer, is that there be this minimum of a 

24

subpoena process.  I'm just describing, Your Honor 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I thought 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the stronger answer would be we've always looked at a 

2

lack of procedural protection under a facial

3

challenge 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8
9
10

Certainly.  That's Sibron 
We did. 
Sibron says exactly 
Exactly.  So anytime 

that the challenge as to the lack of process 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 we've looked at it, 

11

facially or as applied or whatever, but it doesn't need 

12

to be as applied. 

13

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  And let me just add 

14

one other point that's sort of underappreciated in the 

15

case, and that is, not only does our complaint assert an 

16

asapplied challenge, there was a trial on the 

17

asapplied challenge.  And the record on the asapplied 

18

challenge is the record in this case.  We pursued our 

19

facial challenge only after before the second trial they 

20

stipulated that they had only facial defenses of the 

21

statute.  That's the  that's the reason we have this 

22

oddity that we're here on a facial challenge.  The 

23

evidence has already been collected.  There's nothing to 

24

be gained by having a second trial. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Would you  would you 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you've constantly said that one of the objections that 

2

the hotel owner can make is that you want these records

3

for enforcement of the criminal law, right?  You say 

4

that's bad. 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
But the whole purpose of 

7

this thing is to enable the criminal law to be enforced, 

8

isn't it? 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Ah, Justice Scalia, there 

10

are two different points that are being made here.  One 

11

is, you're quite right.  They have an administrative 

12

scheme.  The point of the administrative scheme is to 

13

deter criminal violations.  But my point is different, 

14

and that is, imagine on Tuesday a police officer comes 

15

in and says, look, I think there's a prostitute in the 

16

room 3, okay?  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to 

17

invoke this 41.49 and see if that person's name matches 

18

up as a prostitute, okay?  That's criminal law 

19

enforcement.  It requires probable cause. 

20

 The fact that they have an underlying 

21

administrative scheme doesn't mean that they can 

22

investigate crimes through using this evidence.  This 

23

Court has said time and time again in its administrative 

24

decisions that it's really important that we involve the 

25

courts because there is this concern, and this case 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

presents it more starkly than any other, that you will 

2

misuse the administrative process.

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I think there may be 

4

an exception to that principle where the whole purpose 

5

of the scheme is to enable the detection of criminal 

6

activity. 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

But 
And then the objection 

would be the whole scheme is bad.  You cannot require 

10

them to keep books because its whole purpose is to 

11

detect criminal activity. 

12

 But that's not what you're arguing. 

You're 

13

saying, they can keep the books in order to detect 

14

criminal activity, but if they request the book in order 

15

to detect criminal activity, it's bad. 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

20

argument.  And that is 

22
23

That doesn't make any sense 

at all. 

19

21

No, its 

Because it's not the 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, what is  what is 

the argument? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The argument is  their 

24

defense of the statute is not that the  the records 

25

are used to detect crime; it's they're used to deter 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crime.  They don't look at the records to find 

2

criminals.  All they do is look at the records to make

3

sure we're keeping records. 

4

 My point is that one day a police officer 

5

under this  and it can happen regularly, is that an 

6

officer, a beat officer will come in and say, I'm not 

7

concerned about whether you filled out the form; I 

8

think there might be a prostitute in room 3, and use 

9

it for criminal law 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And, Mr. Goldstein, I had 

11

thought that an equally important purpose behind these 

12

laws is to  as you said earlier, prevent harassment. 

13

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Prevent, I don't like this 

15

hotel owner, I want to drive this hotel out of business, 

16

I'm going to be showing up in his lobby every day. 

17

 But that's part of what's going on here, 

18
19

isn't that right? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That's  in fact, the 

20

principal thing that this Court's precedents have 

21

pointed to  and just look at what's missing in this 

22

in this ordinance.  Every time the other side will say 

23

to you, look, we identified specifically the records. 

24

But the question isn't what the records are, it's the 

25

loss of the sense of tranquility provided by the Fourth 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Amendment, that we don't know how frequently and for 

2

what harassing purpose and how  and for what reasons

at all that a police officer is just going to come in

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

10
11

Have we used that 

Which one, Your Honor? 
Tranquility. 

I don't think that that word 

is 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We talk about 

12

privacy and all that, but I'm not sure that the Fourth 

13

Amendment should be expanded to protect the sense of 

14

tranquility. 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm trying to 
I have a problem imagining 

17

tranquil hotel owners.  It's not what I associate with 

18

owning a hotel. 

19

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It is the sense of certainty 

20

that the Fourth Amendment provides that what you do know 

21

is that there are going to be limits on when the police 

22

come in and say, show us your papers.  Okay?  And that's 

23

what we're talking about. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do  I think 

there's some rule  at least they do it, I mean, in 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

1

hotels, they have these notices posted all over about 

2

where the first emergency exit is and all that.

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

Yes. 

and check to make sure the hotel has those posted 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN:

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could police come in 

Yes. 
 without any type 

of a warrant?

spaces.  That is to say 

11

Because they're in public 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I don't know 

12

 is the back of a hotel room door  I mean, is that a 

13

private place? 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

So you're saying, say, for 

15

example, in the back of the restaurant, in the back of 

16

the kitchen, for example? 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

about every hotel room

 has one of those 



22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Oh, inside the room. 
Can they go and say, 

24

look, you know, this is a very important thing to make 

25

sure people don't die in a big fire, we're going to make 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sure you've got them.  Check  let me go look in room 

2

12 where nobody is.

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It's a great example for us. 

4

That's actually Camara and See; that's a fire inspection 

5

regime.  And what has to happen is that there has to be 

6

a subpoena ahead of time. 

7

 At the very least, this Court  the lowest 

8

level  the lowest standard the Court has ever applied 

9

is in a case called Dewey.  And what Dewey said is, at 

10

the very least, if you're not going to involve a court, 

11

you have to have a set of rules about when these 

12

searches are going to apply, or are going to be 

13

conducted, and how often. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This is  I didn't quite 

15

understand your answer about harassment.  Maybe it's 

16

because  maybe this is in the record or maybe it's 

17

because this wasn't as applied.  But the police  even 

18

if this ordinance were invalidated, the police could 

19

show up whenever they wanted, couldn't they, and ask for 

20

the  the owner or the person at the desk voluntarily 

21

to disclose the register so there could be  they could 

22

be in the lobby as much as they want. 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right. 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So exactly what does  how 

25

does this aid in harassment of hotels? 

51

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Because of the fact that 

2

they're requiring us to produce private records.  The

3

Court  it was always the case, in cases like Barlow's, 

4

Camara, See, where the police couldn't show up and 

5

inspect the premises, they could still show up and 

6

harass.  But what the Court said is if you're going to 

7

invade privacy  we agree this is  everyone agrees 

8

now this is a Fourth Amendment search. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, but it's a private 

10

it's a public space.  I don't know whether it's 

11

dispositive, but it's of some relevance. 

12

 So they walk in  there are two scenarios; 

13

one, with the ordinance, one, without.  Without the 

14

ordinance, they walk in and they said, would you, in the 

15

kindness of your heart, let us look at the register. 

16

And the owner says, no, I don't want to.  And then they 

17

come back the next day and they do the same thing. 

18

Okay?  That's the first scenario. 

19

 The second one is, they come in and they 

20

say, let us see the register.  You show them the 

21

register, and what?  It's a harassment because they sit 

22

there for a while and the guests coming in see the 

23

police in the lobby?  I just don't understand factually. 

24
25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It's the fact  it's the 

fact that day after day after day we have to give them 

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

our private information.  And it  it really will 

2

involve the problem that it can harass and be intended

3

to put us out of business.  If our customers are in the 

4

 let's imagine the following scenario  and I, you 

5

know, we are put in this position because they've come 

6

up with this hypothetical  these hypotheticals about 

7

when it could be valid. 

8
9

 The officers see someone come into the 
motel, and each time they see someone come into the 

10

motel, they come in and say, hey, we're the police, let 

11

us see the records.  The  it really can interfere if 

12

you just imagine 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I think that's  if you 

14

had such a casespecific example, that might be one 

15

thing.  But maybe it would help if you can tell me what 

16

goes on in this precompliance judicial review. 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes. 
So the hotel owner says, 

19

sorry, you can't look at the registry, I want 

20

precompliance judicial review. 

21

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

23
24
25

Yes. 
What is the nature of 

that review? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The  this Court has 

considered that question in the Fair Labor Standards 

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Act, the context of the tax, the context  and the 

2

banking context, so California Bankers, Donovan, and Lone

3

Steer.  And what it has said is that the administrative 

4

agent with the  you know, the police officer, whoever 

5

enforces the law  don't have to go to a judge  gives 

6

a onepage subpoena.  Then there is an objection by the 

7

business owner in any of these contexts, and remember, 

8

in banking, these are records that the government 

9

requires you to produce. 

10

 And then what happens is that the  the 

11

what generally will be the rule, it's up to the city, is 

12

that the city will put the onus on us to go to a judge. 

13

And the fact that the onus is on us to go to a judge and 

14

the fact that our objections are very limited, which is 

15

to say, we only get to object that this is harassing or 

16

for law enforcement, means that we almost always give 

17

over the records because it's going to be a completely 

18

futile objection.  But it is the prospect that we can go 

19

to a judge that tells the beat cop that he needs to 

20

behave and 

21
22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 
objections that would be 

23

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

And those are the only 

Yes. 
 successful, harassment 

and using this for law enforcement? 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes.  That's detailed in 

2

this Court's precedents including Barlow's, it is what

3

 that's the rule of Camara and See. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How many of these Courts' 

5

precedents involves a business that has been treated 

6

like a public utility?  I mean, there are requirements 

7

for hotels, how big the room has to be, how many people 

8

you can put in the room, even in  in many locations, 

9

how much you can charge for the room. 

10

 The hotel owner is not like the  like a 

11

private business.  He is a regulated provider of  of 

12

public services that has traditionally been regulated 

13

closely over the years. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

The short answer  the 

15

first question you asked is, how many times have you 

16

been asked that question.  The answer is none.  The 

17

second answer to your question is that, but in the 

18

relevant sense, which is to say how much of this 

19

property is protected and private, is that 

20

overwhelmingly hotels have constitutional protections. 

21

 Remember, 95 percent of this hotel is going 

22

to be the guests' rooms, and unlike in cases like Berger 

23

 remember they go out and search the open junkyard, 

24

unlike cases like Colonnade and Biswell where you 

25

inspect the open stores or even go behind the scenes. 

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Here the police can't do it.  The Fourth Amendment, 

2

everybody agrees, protects privacy at the hotel.  And so

3

there is a much greater expectation of privacy on our 

4

part. 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I think the question 

6

that Justice Scalia is asking is, is there a reason to 

7

think that hotels are a more heavily regulated industry 

8

than all the other industries that we can think of? 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No.  I mean, just think 

10

about it.  California Bankers and Miller are cases 

11

involving banking.  Banking is incredibly heavily 

12

regulated, you have to have a charter, the government 

13

requires you to keep all kinds of records.  And in both 

14

of those cases  and remember, Justice Scalia, those 

15

are the bank customers' records, they're about the bank 

16

customers' transactions. 

17

 And what this Court said in both of those 

18

cases is that with rare exceptions, like the $10,000 

19

requirement, Title I of the Bank Secrecy Act is 

20

constitutional because it requires a subpoena.  That is, 

21

there is the prospect of getting a judge involved if the 

22

Bank Secrecy requirement that the investigation is too 

23

onerous. 

24

 I'll give you one other data point 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But innkeepers have been 

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

regulated, not for decades, but they've been regulated 

2

for centuries and they have  they have duties to the

3

public that are enforceable. 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So 
And I'm just puzzled by 

6

this case.  You concede that the records have to be 

7

kept.  There are very few reasons for keeping those 

8

records other than law enforcement. 

9

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Ah, that we disagree with, 

10

Justice Kennedy.  Remember we've kept these records and 

11

innkeepers have kept these records for time immemorial. 

12

We use these records for very different purposes.  They 

13

are every record of our business transactions.  We use 

14

this information to keep in touch with our customers. 

15

Every business does.  It's quite proprietary 

16

information.  And while it's the case that we 

17
18

I've never  I've never received anything from them.

 (Laughter.) 

24

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

25

Motel 6 does this?  Jeez, 

My goodness. 
You may not be in their 

But, nobody doubts 

remember, this is an ordinance that applies to the Four 

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Seasons and the RitzCarlton and everything else. 

2

They've just carved out a very specific subset.

3

 And, Justice Kennedy, while we are attentive 

4

to the point that you can't  we are not asserting and 

5

the guests are not asserting Fourth Amendment rights 

6

here, let's not lose sight of the fact that these 

7

records can show very, very personal information.  Not 

8

just the driver's license information, but whether you 

9

stayed at a hotel during a religious or a political 

10
11

convention 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Once again, you're not 

12

complaining about the privacy interests of the guests. 

13

That's not your complaint here. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Justice Scalia, here's the 

15

point. We  they agree this is a Fourth Amendment 

16

search, point one.  Then what you are doing is if you 

17

have to make an honest assessment of whether this 

18

information really does further the Fourth Amendment 

19

value of privacy.  And it does because this has private 

20

stuff in it.  There's just no real dispute about that. 

21

 And I am sympathetic, Justice Kennedy, to 

22

the fact that innkeepers have been regulated for a long 

23

time.  I will simply say that in 99.4 percent of the 

24

jurisdictions in this country, this is not the rule. 

25

There are 100, but there are 18,000 other jurisdictions 

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in which this is not the rule and apparently has never 

2

been the rule.

3

 And the nature of that regulation isn't one 

4

that, in the Burger sense, impinges on our sense of 

5

privacy.  We have to take guests, but what does that 

6

tell us about whether our records are private?  And 

7

certainly, we can identify a huge array of other 

8

businesses that are regulated. 

9

 The one data point that I wanted to make is 

10

that in 2002, the Department of Justice did a study, and 

11

it found that 335 different provisions of Federal law 

12

use the system that I just described for you; and that 

13

is, the subpoena first in order to get the records.  And 

14

there's a bare handful of them, none of them involving 

15

just bare records with the possible exception of the OCC 

16

that use this exception that says, you never have to get 

17

a judge involved.  It is the subpoenas 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

99.4 percent 

19

jurisdictions, does that include  are you comparing 

20

the little hamlet in Indiana with Los Angeles or 

21

New York?  Does New York City have something like this? 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I don't know the answer to 

23

the question of that particular city, but, Your Honor, 

24

they're including big and small and so am I.  So there 

25

are a lot of big cities that don't have this rule. 

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 My point is this, Justice Kennedy 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  you're  you're

3

saying, oh, the hotel has a private interest because it 

4

wants to know who its customers.  But they can do that 

5

by keeping their own record consensually.  You have 

6

conceded that they can require the information as a 

7

matter of law. 

8
9
10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

precedents say they can, Your Honor.  And my point is 
this, because your precedents say 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

14
15

Well, that's because your 

Well, that means it's true. 

Well  and hence, my answer 

yes. 
 But my point is this: 

Because they can do 

16

it here, Justice Kennedy, they can do it everywhere. 

17

The government can require any business to keep track of 

18

all of its transactions and all of its customers.  And 

19

if the government can then just say, all right, now, 

20

give us all that information, then they've reduced the 

21

Fourth Amendment to a nullity. 

22

 The final point I'll make is that don't be 

23

confused with the idea that there's something special 

24

about hotels.  The amount of government regulation here 

25

is massive.  The reason that the deputy solicitor 

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

general is here on behalf of the United States is that 

2

there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of

3

regulatory schemes the Federal government administers 

4

where it is now required to use a subpoena.  But what 

5

selfrespecting regulator wouldn't love 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

A subpoena  a subpoena is 

7

worthless when what is sought is something that can be 

8

easily destroyed, hidden or falsified.  It's  it's 

9

very useful if you're trying to get complicated records 

10

that can't be easily altered between the time when the 

11

subpoena is issued and the time when the subpoena is 

12

enforced.  But nobody  nobody issues a subpoena for 

13

the murder weapon that one is  you know, that you 

14

suspect is in somebody's house. 

15

 So these records are more like the murder 

16

weapon where there's something that can be easily 

17

falsified.  You  you seem to concede when you say that 

18

the police can seize them, then  then the subpoena is 

19

worthless. 

20

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Lone Steer says the opposite 

21

with all respect, and that is, the records there are how 

22

many hours did someone work at what amount of pay.  And 

23

if you can't falsify that just as quickly as you can 

24

falsify who's in room 2, then I just don't understand 

25

the nature of recordkeeping. 

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The Court has insisted on this as a bare 

2

constitutional minimum, both to keep the enforcement

3

officer in line and to let us know the enforcement 

4

officer is kept in line.  It has not  it has been 

5

attentive to the fact that we don't want to put undue 

6

burdens on the government and that is, it's just a 

7

subpoena and that we have less than Fourth Amendment 

8

rights. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You think  you think 

10

payroll records in general are no more complicated than 

11

the ledger at a motel that runs by the hour? 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

In the relevant respect, 

13

Justice Alito, if the question is, did the person work 

14

50 hours or 35 and the record says 50  the actual 

15

record would be 30  50 and I just want to fill in 35, 

16

yes.  The  the court didn't even think that that was a 

17

remotely plausible argument in that  the line of cases 

18

that I'm describing.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

23

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

24

 Let me start with the facial point and then 

25

Thank you, Your Honor. 

circle back to the  to the merits.  So as I hear 

62

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Mr. Goldstein describing the rule, the only objections 

2

that are going to be raised are harassment and whether

3

this is for a legitimate purpose, but if that's the 

4

concern, that's a classic asapplied challenge. 

5

 If a hotel has a cop coming up to them five 

6

times a day, they come in and say, this is really 

7

harassment.  These searches are inappropriate.  And if 

8

the  if it's the purpose of the officer, he's doing 

9

criminal investigation rather than actually caring about 

10

whether my records are complete, that is an asapplied 

11

challenge. 

12

 Now, the plaintiffs have not even tried to 

13

demonstrate that this ordinance is unconstitutional in 

14

every circumstance.  On pages 19 to 20 of our brief, we 

15

develop numerous scenarios, and Mr. Goldstein mentioned 

16

only one of them. 

17

 So, for example, where the hotel is required 

18

to upload the records to the police department every 

19

day, it may not even be a search, but it's certainly 

20

less intrusive. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that's  that's not 

22

the statute.  I didn't understand those examples because 

23

some of those examples, the police could act without 

24

this  without this. 

25

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well 

63

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

2

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Without this 
So not that one, Your

3

Honor.  Justice Kennedy, not that one.  So some of 

4

them  in some of them, the ordinance has the purpose 

5

of requiring someone to do something that they would not 

6

otherwise have to submit to.  But the one that I just 

7

gave as an example, the scenario of uploading the 

8

documents rather than the police conducting a search on 

9

the spot, is less intrusive. 

10

 And  and the problem here is that the 

11

plaintiffs have tried to invalidate every possible 

12

application of this ordinance but they haven't done 

13

the  the intrusiveness, privacy, government interest 

14

balance that one needs to do for each of them. 

15

 But let me then circle to the merits 

16
17

because 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm still very confused 

18

about this.  There is always a potential exception to a 

19

warrant, even a Fourth Amendment warrant of going into 

20

the home, exigent circumstances, there's someone sick on 

21

the other side, if there's a fleeing felon into the 

22

place, but that doesn't eliminate the need for a 

23

warrant.  It's not a telluslater issue.  Police can't 

24

just keep going in and then fish around for an excuse. 

25

That's a process issue. 

64

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Understood, Your Honor. 
You're entitled to a

3

warrant, you're entitled to a subpoena, you're 

4

entitled  that's what they're challenging, which is 

5

they're not challenging all of the other reasons why the 

6

police could go in legitimately 

7

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

Well, Your Honor 
 with an exception to 

the Fourth Amendment.  They're asking whether this kind 

10

of search, generally, without all of those other exigent 

11

circumstances or other Fourth Amendment exceptions is 

12

constitutional. 

13

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

Right, Your Honor. 
Is the process here 

right? 

16

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

17

 And so let's not talk about the exceptions. 

Understood. 

18

Let's talk about another example where the motel 

19

continues to keep the register in the open, like they 

20

did for 100 years, and then snatches it away when the 

21

police come.  That 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You know something, but 

that's a different issue.  It's in the public. 
 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, right.  And they 

would 

65

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

think that's going to happen?

3

And how often do you 

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

And for that reason, they 

4

would have no expectation of privacy and the Fourth 

5

Amendment calculus would be totally different.  But let 

6

me  let me 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but then it's not a 

8

search at all.  And, once again, it's not this statute 

9

that's doing the work. 

10

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, no, your Honor.  If 

11

they snatch it away, it certainly is this ordinance that 

12

is doing the work. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You're saying that they have 

14

no expectation of privacy.  We wouldn't  we wouldn't 

15

say it's a search at all, and the police can take it 

16

away.  It doesn't depend on this statute. 

17

 MR. ROSENKRANZ: 

Well, no, exactly.  We 

18

would  we would win the Fourth Amendment case, but 

19

they would  but that has been invalidated by  by 

20

 So let me just emphasize that this is a very

1

narrow rule that we're talking about.  We're talking 

2

about a rule that is unlikely to be repeated in so many

3

of the other circumstances that have been discussed 

4

today. 

5

 It's about an inspection of only a single 

6

book of information that the government requires hotels 

7

to maintain and that the  that Mr. Goldstein has 

8

admitted the government should  can require hotels to 

9

maintain. 

10

 It's in a context that is especially prone 

11

to criminality.  People are using these hotels precisely 

12

to commit crimes where the gaps are quite detectable in 

13

real time but not detectable otherwise. 

14

 In an industry where there has been hundreds 

15

of years of regulation including a history of 

16

warrantless searches that are even broader at the time 

17

of the founding, hotels were being searched with 

18

without warrants at the time of the founding and a 

19

history of a hundred years of police inspections in Los 

20

Angeles itself and even a hundred years of these things 

21

being open to the public.

 If the Court has no further questions, we 
respectfully request that the Court reverse.
