ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
North Carolina breached the Southeast

12

Compact in this case.

Whether you examine it from

13

the perspective of the sanctions that were imposed by

14

the Commission, or whether you evaluate it from the

15

perspective of the repeated statements by the

16

executives of the Commission that there had been a

17

material breach and a repudiation, or whether you

18

examine it from the perspective of the undisputed

19

record that was collected by the Special Master, the

20

conclusion, it seems to me, is inescapable that what

21

North Carolina did here by taking no action between

22

December 1997 and July of 1996 simply does not

23

fulfill the responsibilities that they had -- that

24

North Carolina had assumed, and therefore the only

25

issue should be:

What is the appropriate remedy for
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this extraordinary breach?

2

To go to the specific record, just to be

3

clear about this, the Special Master says at page 10

4

of his report:

5

North Carolina did not take additional steps to

6

pursue a license for a waste facility during that

7

period."

8

North Carolina took no further steps to license

9

between 1997 and 1999.

10

"The parties do not dispute that

Our undisputed statement of facts is that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips, the point

11

that North Carolina makes is it would be throwing

12

away the taxpayers' money to no purpose.

13

what is the point of continuing to pursue a license

14

when North Carolina does not have the funding to

15

continue the process and to open the disposal

16

facility?

17

That is,

So North Carolina's point of view is:

What

18

does it mean to continue to seek the license when

19

they are not going to have the money to get to the

20

end of the line?
MR. PHILLIPS:

21

Right.

Well, North Carolina

22

assumed the responsibility more than a decade prior

23

to that time to take all appropriate steps in order

24

to provide for licensing and for construction of a

25

facility.

"Appropriate steps" in that context has to
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mean something more than simply doing nothing,

2

declaring categorically that you are going to

3

repudiate the agreement, and attempting to extort

4

from the compact and its Commission additional monies

5

that it is absolutely clear that the Commission has

6

no responsibility to North Carolina to pay.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

did the Commission give before this?

10

But the -But how much -- how much
It just did

that out of the goodness of its heart?

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, it did it with -- with

12

the approval of the other States in the compact, for

13

the purpose of promoting the ultimate objective of

14

the -- of the contract --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and I think that

16

one of the best indications of what -- what a

17

contract means is the manner in which the parties act

18

under the contract, and that suggests to me that it

19

was never contemplated that North Carolina alone

20

would foot the bill for -- for obtaining this

21

license.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

The language of the -- of

23

the compact itself, Justice Scalia, is quite plain.

24

It's clear that the Commission has no responsibility

25

to create -- to pay for the creation of this -- of
5

this facility.

2

That was clear from day one.

North Carolina, not only in its legislation

3

authorizing its authority, but also its governor

5

responsibility to create this facility, that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

At what cost?

At whatever cost -What the Special Master

said was, I believe, that there was never an

10

obligation to do it at all costs.

11

to bankrupt their treasury to do this; is that

12

correct?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

They didn't have

Well -Do you accept that as a

working proposition?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

I would say that the -- that

17

the State of North Carolina would have -- have a

18

defense of impossibility if they could argue that

19

going down this path would have bankrupted North

20

Carolina.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I think there was

22

certainly a significant amount of evidence that the

23

cost of completing this project was way above any

24

reasonable expectation of the parties at the time of

25

contracting, correct?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, but the -- but the

2

payment of $80 million by the Commission was way

3

above what any of the parties expected at the

4

beginning of the process as well.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What -- what do you

6

believe the evidence shows with respect to the

7

reasonable cost of completing this project?

MR. PHILLIPS:

assume that the construction of the facility itself
would have cost an additional $75 million.

complete the license.

I doubt that that would have

included the full construction.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm only going

7

through these to try to get a sense from you of at

8

what point did North Carolina have a right to claim

9

impossibility?

10

You are saying that --

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

I mean, I think North

11

Carolina -- first of all, North Carolina never did

12

assert a right of impossibility.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it did by saying,

we can't complete this project.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it said it wouldn't

16

17

unilaterally imposed upon the other States to the

18

compact the obligation to fund, an obligation none of

19

them had -- had assumed under the contract.

20

It imposed upon us and

To be sure, they had provided moneys to

21

North Carolina with the expectation that North

22

Carolina would use those moneys ultimately to build a

23

project.

24

North Carolina unilaterally declared that they were

25

not going to complete the project and that they were

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So your argument is then

3

that they acted 2 years too late.

4

notice that they were not able to go forward, but

5

they were going to keep this thing going, so if the

6

funds should somehow become available, they would

7

have the -- they would have things still in place.

8

They wouldn't have terminated the effort.

1

That's -- it's -- you paint a picture of

2

repudiating the contract, when North Carolina gave

3

notice in '97 that it would have to fold if it didn't

4

get the money.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, and -- and the

6

question then, obviously, that -- the legal issue

7

that that presents is whether or not a party to a

8

contract who is not entitled to expect the other

9

participants to the agreement to pay any more money

10

or in fact any money whatsoever has the authority

11

essentially to attempt to extort that money while

12

continuing to gain the benefits of the contract for

13

an additional year and a half; at that point, then

14

they -- then they withdraw.

15

We can debate about whether the withdrawal

16

was in good faith or not.

17

there is no substantial difference between the

18

repudiation and the complete disregard of the

19

contractual obligations.

20

But the bottom line is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What were the benefits

21

that North Carolina was getting by paying whatever it

22

was -- 400-odd thousand dollars -- to keep it going

23

for another 2 years?

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the benefits of being

a part of the compact is all of the powers that the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Commission had to deal with other compacts in terms

2

of how to license -- not how to license, but how to

3

dispose of waste.

4

being a part of a compact during the entirety of that

5

period.

6

to repudiate this agreement or to withdraw from it

7

until they got to the point where they were -- where

8

they recognized that they were about to be sanctioned

9

for their failure to comply with their

responsibilities.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Were there any benefits to

the contract at all until -- unless and until there

13

was a waste facility constructed?

MR. PHILLIPS:

benefits, Justice Scalia.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there were huge

What?
The Barnwell facility in

18

South Carolina was disposing of waste and was only

19

going to take wastes from the compact States in the

20

Southeast Compact.

21

ample access to that South Carolina facility that, if

22

it had never joined the compact, it never would have

23

had available to it.

24
25

So North Carolina had -- had

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

In 1995, Justice Ginsburg.
And so they -- by 1997,

they didn't have any access to Barnwell anymore.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but they still had

5

the benefit of the compact's -- the Commission's

6

authority to negotiate on behalf of the member States

7

deals with other compacts for the disposal in those

8

facilities which you otherwise don't have the benefit

9

of.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It sounds to me pretty

11

hypothetical.

12

that there is an obligation to commit money and a

13

liability for failure to do so in a compact which

14

says that the State can withdraw at any time.

talk about good faith withdrawal.

16

faith withdrawal?

17

no longer worth our trouble.

faith withdrawal.

accepts $80 million, goes down a path, is not

23

fact -- and maybe it was -- they had in good faith

be entitled to get the 80 million back?

10

I'm not sure what happened to the $80

11

be a tougher case if they had taken the 80 million

simply cannot be built consistent with health and

safety.

17

I think that would be an argument that we

But what I think you are not entitled to

18

do, as North Carolina, is to decide unilaterally that

19

more money should be paid, which is not provided for

20

under the agreement, and insist on that as a

21

condition of fulfilling any of its responsibilities

22

under the agreement.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is your position --

what do you say that the States contemplated

25

regarding the financing of these -- of these

2

to be selected as the second State would have to pay

3

the full cost, even if it was $200 million, and then

4

would -- how long would it take for that State to get

5

that money back?

know, 80, 100 years later to get the benefit of some

7

other State having to finance a project?

That the State that was unfortunate enough

Would it have to wait until, you

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

I mean, well, the

working assumption is that the facilities would be in

10

operation for 20 years.

11

Alito, is that once you have one of these facilities

12

built, given that there are not very many of them and

13

they are and would be a monopoly within the compact

14

region, you have virtually limited -- unlimited

15

authority to dictate whatever price you want to

16

require for taking on the disposal.

17

at the sites that exist -- it was true in Barnwell;

18

it's certainly true in Utah and in Washington -- I

19

mean, those are licenses to print money, essentially,

20

at this point.

And the reality, Justice

25

correctly, Mr. Phillips, that none of these -- none
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of these compacts that were negotiated around the

2

same time, none of them yielded a disposal -- an

3

operative disposal facility?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

None so far.

Texas I think

5

is as -- is as far along in its process as -- as

6

anyone, and it's -- and it's part of a compact.

7

you know, obviously there is a "not in my backyard"

8

mentality here.

9

the fundamental question remains, you know, what --

10
11

But

But the -- at the end of the day,

who bears the responsibility?
North Carolina -- it wasn't as though North

12

Carolina was the unfortunate recipient of this

13

particular decision and then said, you know, we don't

14

want to do this, we can't pay for this, there's no

15

way we can accomplish this.

16

having been designated as the host State,

17

affirmatively passed legislation accepting that

18

responsibility and committing the State to actually

19

providing for a facility.

20

North Carolina, after

Now, Justice Stevens, I agree, if it had

21

turned out that as a matter of public health and

22

safety -- that's the big bugaboo here -- if that had

23

been an obstacle, or maybe, Justice Sotomayor, if the

24

expense had been so far out of the range of what's

25

12

stopped them from withdrawing?

13

provision I see in the contract about withdrawing is

14

the one that says once the facility is completed --

19

there is nothing express in the contract, in the

compact, that would prevent them from doing that.

I

do think there is an implied duty of good faith.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -- all right.

Well,

go ahead, explain.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, because there's

7

massive repudiation long before the -- the question

8

still is, what do you do with 1997 to 1999?

9

they withdraw, they have repudiated the agreement.

Before

10

They have breached it totally.

11

the agreement was lost once North Carolina refused to

12

take any steps, much less appropriate steps.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

The very essence of

Is there in this implicit

14

that the State of North Carolina, prior to their

15

withdrawal, while they are still acting, will

16

appropriate reasonable amounts of money for this?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

And take -- well, what they

18

are supposed to do is take appropriate steps to

19

license, which means --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do appropriate steps

include -MR. PHILLIPS:

-- continue to do what's

necessary to get a license.
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- do they -- does this --

if we have a lend-lease agreement entered into a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

treaty and absolutely ratified, I suppose that if

2

Congress decides not to lend and won't appropriate

3

the money to do it, we are in breach of the treaty.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And I assume if there is a

6

similar agreement here and North Carolina's

7

legislature doesn't appropriate any money for

8

whatever internal reasons, North Carolina is in

9

breach of the treaty.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Do I understand this

correctly?

13
14

Right.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, that's absolutely

right, Justice Breyer.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any authority for

16

the proposition that when a legislature does not

17

appropriate the money that the executive of a State

18

has committed to another State, that State is in

19

breach, irrespective of whose fault it is within the

20

State?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know that there is

22

specific authority for that proposition.

23

Justice Breyer, it seems to me what you describe

24

there is exquisitely close to what this -- what this

25

Court resolved in Mobil Oil Exploration, where
21
Alderson Reporting Company

But,

Official

1

Congress passed a statute saying that the

2

administrative side would not be permitted to go

3

forward, and this Court said that action constituted

4

a repudiation of the underlying obligation, even

5

though it was far from clear that there would ever be

6

any exploration or production of oil on this -- on

7

the outer continental shelf sites that were in there.

8

This Court said that when -- that if an

9

obligor will commit a breach that would of itself

10

give the obligee a claim for damages for total

11

breach, so that it so substantially impairs the value

12

of the contract, and the government said it would

13

break or did break an important contractual promise,

14

impairing the value of the contract, then the

15

government must give the companies back the money.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So this case then

17

boils down to, am I correct, in the years prior to

18

their withdrawal, did they take the steps,

19

appropriate steps, that this contract obliges them to

20

make?
MR. PHILLIPS:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

But that's -- but if you

-- we should win.

In my

4

judgment, that's -- the conduct of North Carolina

5

between 1997 and 1999 is exactly the same conduct

6

that the United States entered into in Mobil

7

Exploration.

point, and it's called -- what is it called?

But the specific finding is that North

5

Carolina had a duty to go forward and -- and stopped

It repudiated.

In addition to that, when North Carolina

8

announced that it was shutting down the project and

9

that it was not going forward, that it was just going

10

to run out and wait and hope, frankly, that

11

additional funding would come forward, the -- the

12

compact -- the director of the compact specifically

13

wrote to the governor twice, saying:

14

in repudiation and in violation of the agreement; it

15

is your responsibility.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

These are acts

But they also -- you

-- with that answer, is

18

that you earlier said that they could -- forgetting

19

if they didn't take any money -- under the terms of

this repeatedly -- have withdrawn at any time because

22

they didn't want to sink any more money into this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let's put aside

that duty of good faith --

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- because with that

6

duty of good faith, you're suggesting that merely

7

because they took a million -- that's what the Chief

8

Justice is asking you -- or 80 million, that that

somehow converted or changed the express terms of the

contract and bound them in some way to find funding

argument I'm hearing you make.

than that, Justice Sotomayor.

conclude that that is the case.

minimum we are very much like the private oil

companies in the Maryland v. Louisiana case, in any

14

event, where, you know, the claims were out there; it

15

was far from clear exactly how those claims were

going to play out in one way or another.

18

19

the Court said was:

20

close and there's no basis on which to assume that

21

they are doing more -- that they are asking for more,

22

and therefore there's no Eleventh Amendment problem.

And this

We have to sort that
What

These all look to be pretty

23

And, of course, remember the Special Master

has held open the possibility that if for some reason

the claims of the Commission were to deviate from the

1

claims of -- of any of the compact States, which as

2

far as I can tell to this point they have -- they

motion at that point.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't there an

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

21

IN SUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY

22

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The United States has participated in this
case both, at the Court's invitation, at the motion
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for leave to file stage and then before the Special

2

Master, primarily on the issues that were addressed

3

in the Special Master's preliminary report, which go

4

to questions of the assertion of Eleventh Amendment

5

immunity in original actions as well as the structure

6

of the compact and the compact's power to assess

7

monetary sanctions itself.

8

Today we make two principal arguments:

9

one, that the Court should deny North Carolina's

10

motion to dismiss the Commission as a party,

11

rejecting at this time or for the time being the

12

assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity; and second,

13

that the Court should deny the claim that the

14

Commission has the power itself to impose monetary

15

sanctions under article 7(F).

16

That's not to say that the States party may

17

not seek monetary relief, appropriate monetary

18

relief, themselves in an original action in this

19

Court.

20

is not a forum established by the compact itself,

21

which is not only a compact between the States, but

22

an Act of Congress, to do that.

23

the Commission in this original action, of us

2

proceeding to answer substantive questions about the

3

interpretation of the compact, et cetera, without

4

addressing initially the right of the Commission to

5

bring this action as an original action at all?

6

It seems to be putting the cart before the

7

horse, or -- because I'm not sure why we should be

8

reaching the merits, deciding the merits, before

9

identifying which are the parties and what claims

10

they have before us.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- I, think, as Mr.

12

Phillips suggested, this Court's decision in -- in

13

the United States v. Georgia establishes the Court is

14

not required to, and in some circumstances it -- it

15

may be possible to dispose of the case on -- on the

16

merits because the plaintiff States in this case I

17

think undoubtedly have a cause --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

But this one won't.

Well, the plaintiff States

20

undoubtedly have a cause of action for breach of the

21

compact.

22

parties to the compact, they can bring an action

23

whether or not the Commission is properly before --

24

before the Court.

25

North Carolina violated the compact therefore can be

They are parties to the compact, and as

2

3

question of -- of whether the Commission could

4

5

If this Court were to agree with the

6

Special Master that there was no violation of the

7

compact, then the question of whether the Commission

8

could be -- could also bring that claim and what --

9

what remedy there might be for that, either to the

10

States or to the Commission, would never have to be

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, two things about that.

2

In Maryland v. Louisiana, which was a suit brought by

3

a number of States to challenge a -- a Louisiana tax

4

on Commerce Clause grounds, that case went forward on

5

the suit of the -- of those States, but the natural

6

gas companies who paid the tax were permitted to

7

intervene, and the Court did that, notwithstanding

8

the Eleventh Amendment.

9

States parens patriae was not identical to the claims

Surely, the claim of the

10

of the individual natural gas companies to get a

11

refund on their own behalf, but the Court nonetheless

12

allowed them to intervene, and the Court's judgment

13

in this case awarded -- required the State of

14

Louisiana to make refunds to -- to all taxpayers.

15

So I -- I don't think -- especially in an

16

original action where the State has a certain parens

17

patriae responsibility, I don't think that the claims

18

have to be identical in the precise way that they

19

were in -- in Arizona v. California.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

There -- there are several

3

points that I think are important to bear in mind

4

with this.

5

that monetary liability on the part of a State is

6

distinct from prospective relief, and I think the

7

Court should not lightly assume that States have

8

agreed to have a nonjudicial forum, like a --

9

I think this Court has always recognized

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, are we supposed to --

10

are we supposed to treat compacts among States as if

11

we are dealing with those who want to impose

12

obligations on the States?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but -Here, aren't we trying to

15

say what obligations did the States themselves want

16

to impose on themselves?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and as we point out in

18

pages 26 and 27 of our -- of our brief, there were

19

three -- it's actually four compacts that were

20

adopted or approved in the very same Act of Congress

21

which specifically provide for monetary sanctions --

22

or monetary -- monetary remedies, which shows that

23

the compacting parties knew how to do it when they

24

wanted to.

25

But beyond that, I think it's important to
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

look at the overall structure of article 7, where the

2

sanctions power appears.

3

which is on page 19a of the blue brief, refers to any

4

party State which fails to comply, et cetera, "may be

5

subject to sanctions, including suspension of rights

6

under the compact and revocation."

7

First of all, article 7(F),

Those are all forward-looking sanctions.

8

But -- but I think what really reinforces that is if

9

you look at the title of article 7, which is on page

10

17a, it says -- it deals with eligible parties,

11

withdrawal, revocation, entry into force, and

12

termination.

13

the -- in the Commission.

14

by contrast, are set out in article 4 of the -- of

15

the compact.

16

for example, article 4(E)(11), on page 11a -- the

17

only enumerated power with respect to sanctions

18

there, at the bottom of 11a, is to revoke the

19

membership of a party State in accordance with

20

article 7(F).

Article 7 is all about membership in
The Commission's powers,

There are enumerated powers there and,

21

One would think, if there -- if there was

22

an extraordinary power to grant monetary sanctions,

23

that it would have appeared in the enumerated powers,

24

and in fact, in the one compact adopted at the same

25

time that provides for imposition of fines, it
42

actually appears in the enumerated powers portion of

2

the relevant compact, not in the membership.

3

And, Justice Breyer, you asked about

4

5

the Commission to be the judge of -- of certain

6

matters.

7

driving at is the Commission being the judge of the

8

qualifications of the -- of the States and the

9

11

It's like the power of any legislative

15

article 7(C) is directed at that, not at some power

16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I think I should begin with a simple

question that my grandson asked me, which is why did

all the States are required to remain in the compact,

2

withdrawal is a nullity, the Commission can enforce

3

financial sanctions, and the compact members waive

4

sovereign immunity and can be sued in Federal court.

5

This compact is based on a consensual

6

model, where it -- each -- each State can withdraw,

7

and therefore the compact has to be in the rough

8

financial interest of each of the States at any point

9

in time, which is what --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You took -- you

11

took $80 million, and they got nothing for it.

12

would be a question your grandson might ask.

(Laughter.)

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

That

What did you do

with the $80 million?

16

MR. DELLINGER:

The $80 million came from 

17

- not the State -- the statement that the States gave

18

North Carolina $80 million and North Carolina has

19

kept it and didn't give it back is a shorthand that

20

is misleading in every single respect.
The funds, of course, didn't come from the

21
22

States.

They contributed $25,000 apiece.

23

from charges on generators from all over the country.

24

The funds went to the authority established under

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How did that help the

and North Carolina walking away?

8

Well, Justice Sotomayor, no

one was helped by this process or the process of the

10

other compacts, none of which resulted in a -- in a

facility.

13

and, as I will show in a moment, fully in accord with

14

the understanding of the Commission and North

15

Carolina, that they would be -- it would be jointly

16

financed, even though the Commission had no legal

17

obligation.

18

But what North Carolina did was to carry

But the key reason --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm hard-pressed to

19

understand where that comes from.

Under the terms of

20

the contract -- the compact, the compact expressly

21

says that none of the contracting States have any

22

liabilities with respect to this --

23

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct, and it

24

says that the Commission does not have any legal

25

obligation -46
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. DELLINGER:

Exactly.

-- under the compact to

3

fund it, either.

4

consensual compact and because of the right to

5

withdrawal, as the master noted, it would have been

6

surprising if a facility were constructed without

7

significant assistance from the States that were not

8

the host State because of the right to withdraw, and

9

that indeed was recognized from the very beginning.

10

But it was because this is a

For example, in 1996, when the -- the

11

chairman of the Commission was hoping to speed up the

12

completion, the chairman noted that the opening of a

13

new regional facility in North Carolina would ensure

14

a source of revenues for site development in the

15

third host State.

16

Indeed, it's not surprising that, from the

17

beginning of the compact, the Commission provided a

18

substantial amount of the funding because North

19

Carolina could have withdrawn at any point.

20

Commission repeatedly recognized that it was, quote,

21

"necessary and appropriate and reasonable and

22

equitable" for the Commission to contribute to this.

23

And the

Mr. Phillips cites the North Carolina

24

legislation -- the North Carolina legislation, which

25

notes that, among the Commission's -- the authority's
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

corporate powers, when it sets up the authority or

2

the financing -- but the North Carolina legislation,

3

as the Commission expressly recognized and cited in

4

providing the money, provides that North Carolina may

5

accept funds from its general assembly.

6

Carolina authority may accept funds from the North

7

Carolina general assembly, from the Commission

8

9

Government, or from generators.

10

The North

And they begin to

say it's necessary and appropriate.

11

At every step, they -- the Commission says

12

that in -- in February of '88, October of '89,

13

September of '92, November of '92, "reasonable and

14

equitable to provide this funding," and of course it

15

makes sense, given the consensual nature of the

16

compact.

17

So, what happened?

Why did North Carolina

18

quit?

19

withdraw, South Carolina withdrew in 1995.

20

South Carolina withdrew, this of course deprived the

21

Commission of a ready source of funding from the fees

22

that were being paid to the facility in Barnwell,

23

South Carolina.

What happened was, because of the right to
When

24

But much -- or of equal significance is the

25

fact that South Carolina, having withdrawn, no longer
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

had to comply with the compact requirement, that

2

South Carolina ceased operating a facility on

3

December 31, 1992.

4

Why was that important?

Because the

5

compact creates, as Mr. Phillips noted, something

6

like a monopoly within the region, and when you are

7

financing the facility you know, if you are the

8

financing authority, that you will have a captive

9

market --

JUSTICE BREYER:

is:

16

they know that the cholera plant will be hated by

everybody in their State, but it's necessary.

What we have are a group of States, each of whom

We'll undertake it, okay?

So

But the

Now, that's their basic deal.

20

I don't know that they ever would have

21

entered into this as part of the basic deal that

22

State A depends for 4 years on State B doing it, but

23

when it's State A's turn, they run away.

24

that's the deal.

25

addition, take $80 million?

They can run away.
Okay.

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Well,

But in
That's where we

Official

1

are back with the Chief's question.

2

Now, I don't know whether it is an

3

appropriate step or not an appropriate step to keep

4

the 80 million as well as running away.

5

to me that we have an arbitrator that was supposed to

6

decide whether it was or whether it wasn't, and they

7

said it was an appropriate step.

8

would take the 80 million, never give it back, at

9

least.

10

But it seems

They foresaw you

But the Commission thinks it isn't.

And

11

the arbitrator paid no attention whatsoever to the

12

Commission.

13

language that I quoted is that the Commission is the

14

judge of the members' compliance with the

15

requirements of this contract.

16

I think:

17

to the fact that the Commission thought that what was

18

keeping the 80 million was not an appropriate step.

And what the Commission says in the

Surely, he should have paid some attention

Now, there we are.

19

So when I read that,

That's my question.

20

And the only answer I've heard so far is, if I read

21

the rest of the sentence, it talks about laws of

22

States relating to the enactment of this contract --

23

compact.

24

so narrowly to refer to laws that talked about how

25

you adopt it.

And I don't know that you read "enactment"

There might be a whole lot of laws.
50
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

guess you pay attention to all of them.

2

see what the last phrase has to do with it.

3

anyway, that's my basic question in the case.

4

MR. DELLINGER:

All right.

So I don't
But

I'll -- I'll

5

answer them in reverse order:

The keeping the 80

6

million and the Commission's judgment about that.

7

Their argument is either that, you know, the

8

Commission is somehow the sole judge of these issues

9

or that there's some -- that you should treat a State

10

as something like a regulated industry under an

11

agency model.

12

at least the part of 7(C) that they leave in their

13

quote, as establishing that.

14

Kneedler was attempting to say when his time ran out

15

is that, if you just read 7(C), it's about

16

membership.

17

And they -- and they point to 7(C), or

20

members; (D) provides that the first three States

21

which enact and pay their fees will bring the compact

22

into existence.

23

compacts are not eligible for membership.

24
25

(A) lists the initial State

And (E) states that members of other

Then (C), in the middle, says that each

the fees and enactment, and the Commission is the

2

judge of the qualifications of the party States and

3

of its members and their compliance with the

4

conditions and requirements of the compact -- and if

5

I may go "dot, dot, dot" -- relating to the enactment

6

of this compact.

7

Now, that phrase "relating to the

8

enactment" might refer just to the preceding phrase

9

about laws of the party States.

But Mr. Kneedler and

I both read it more naturally in the context of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dellinger, what of

- what of Mr. Phillips's argument that that $80

16

million gave North Carolina a leg up, should there

17

ever be any revival of the development of a disposal

18

facility; North Carolina is much better situated than

19

anyone else to do this, because they have already

20

sunk $80,000 into pursuing a license?

21

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, it has been 10 or 12

22

years since this occurred, Justice Ginsburg, and

One possibility is to modify the compact to

So why is Georgia going to stay in the
compact, when it has what may be a -- a less costly

10

and less distant alternative in going to Barnwell,

11

South Carolina?

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why -- why would

13

anyone stay in the contract?

It's necessary for the country to store

20

understanding, incomplete, no one wants it, and so,

21

now, the States have formed a series of compacts.

22

And we are told, in an amicus brief, that,

23

if this compact is interpreted to allow one State to

24

take advantage of another State's having done so for

25

years and then run away and keep $80 million to boot,
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it will be impossible for many other States to resist

2

that same route.

3

And that will be the end of compacts

4

through the United States, and what we will have is

5

low-level waste without storage.

6

roughly, that's made in an amicus brief in this case,

7

and I would like to know your opinion.

8
9

MR. DELLINGER:

That's argument,

My response to that is that

the amicus' suggestion that a decision for North

10

Carolina would impair the very useful mechanism of

11

interstate compacts has it exactly backwards.

12

States establishing compacts remain

13

entirely free to include or add provisions limiting

14

the right to withdraw; permitting the imposition of

15

sanctions, including financial sanctions; imposing

16

those on States that are no longer members; defining

17

whether the limits will be a million dollars or a

18

hundred million for what they will impose -- or no

19

limits at all; and, as the Central Compact did,

20

requiring a waiver of sovereign immunity so that

21

these judgments can be enforced in Federal court.

22

All that's possible.

23

But a decision in -- whether or not you

24

decide for North Carolina, if that's what you want in

25

a compact, you can have that compact, and nothing in

a decision for North Carolina would change that.
A decision in favor of North Carolina

3

would, in fact, benefit the compacting process

4

because it would provide assurances to State

5

legislators that you can pick up a copy of the

6

proposed compact and read it and know that that is

7

the extent of the liabilities to which you are

8

imposing your -- exposing your State, and that is the

9

limit of the obligations you are taking on to --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this case -- in this

11

case, how did it come about that the right to

12

withdraw any time until the second plant was

13

operable, was that -- that was North Carolina's

14

proposal after it was designated to be the site?

15

MR. DELLINGER:

Justice Ginsburg, the

16

original compact had no limits whatsoever on

17

withdrawal, and when North Carolina was chosen as the

18

site, it proposed, as a necessary condition to its

19

not -- not withdrawing, that the compact be admitted

20

to add a provision, 7(H), which would say that after

21

-- 30 days after the second facility becomes

22

operational, no State may withdraw without the

23

consent of all the other States.

24

So North -- North Carolina added a

limitation on the -- at their behest, a limitation on
61
Alderson Reporting Company

the right to withdraw.

out, it was clear that that limitation on the right

to withdrawal wasn't good enough because it meant

So, with North Carolina willing to continue

20

Mr.

But, most importantly, there is Alden.

21

Alden makes this a civil case because Alden says that

22

private suits against non-consenting States present

23

the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive

24

processes of judicial tribunals.

25

If you allow another party in that's not a

State, you are subjecting a State to all of the

2

discovery, all of the different theories, all of the

3

depositions, all of the document requests.

4

State may, in its attorney general's office, think

5

twice about doing that. A private litigant will not.

6

A sister

So I think this case is that -- I believe

7

if you didn't want to overrule Arizona, you could say

8

it's a case where the United States brought a case in

9

its role as trustee for the Indian tribes and the

10

tribes themselves were allowed to intervene, and they

11

were, therefore, virtually one and the same party.

12

And you wouldn't need to overrule it.

13

if it stands for any broader principle, it can

14

survive Alden v. Maine.

15

I don't think,

Now, if the Commission is out, then we

16

think there is -- and if you agree that there was no

17

breach of contract, then I think the Court should

18

direct the dismissal of the quasi-contract claims

19

because only the States will be left as a party.

20

And those claims -- quasi-contract claims

21

of restitution, it's -- they are claims that are

22

governed by the subject matter of the compact between

23

the States, and as to parties to the compact, there

24

can't be any such claims, and I think that should be

25

the end of it.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFFS

7
8

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

9

I would like to respond to a number of the

10

points that have been made.

11

fundamental one that Mr. Dellinger relies upon is the

12

notion that this $80 million was not the money of the

13

compact States, and he -- he keeps saying that

14

repeatedly -- you know, based solely on the fact that

15

the money doesn't come through the treasury of the

16

States.

17

It seems to me the most

But he ignores, on 12A, article 4(H)(2)(b),

18

which says, with respect to the levying of the

19

special fees or surcharges, which was the basis upon

20

which the entirety of the $80 million comes, that

21

this must represent the financial commitments of all

22

party States to the Commission.

23

It was the understanding that, in

24

exercising the authority to levy these amounts of

25

money in order to generate this, that that was the
77
Alderson Reporting Company

1

States' money, all of the States' money, and

2

ultimately, if this Court would have determined that

3

the money --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That provision just

5

says the States don't have to give anything more than

6

that, that that's what satisfies whatever obligations

7

they may or may have.

8

money belongs to them?

9

But where does it say that

MR. PHILLIPS:

It says each State hosting 

10

- you know, "shall annually levy surcharges."

11

total of those surcharges represent the financial

12

commitments of all of the party States to the

13

Commission.

15

provided for in that context.

I think all this means is

that that is the only financial commitment that the

10

States are obliged to -- to make.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think there's no question

12

that it -- that it can be read as -- as saying that,

13

which, of course, then tells you, if it's not the

14

Commission's responsibility and it's not the States'

15

responsibility, then it was clearly, from the outset

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That just doesn't make any

sense.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there would be a way

4

to allocate it.

It seems to me that maybe -- that

5

either the Commission, based on the vote of the

6

parties -- the party States, could either allocate it

7

back on a pro rata basis, or they can do it on the

8

basis of the percentage of the -- of the waste that

9

was used in any particular fund.

10

There's no specific provision on that, but

11

it seems to me that doesn't detract, Justice Scalia,

12

from the fundamental point that what the compact

13

members agreed upon was that this money would be the

14

money of all of the States.

15

keep it as a Commission.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And, therefore, we can't

But the money that's --

17

but the money that is talked about in that section,

18

as I read it, that's money that would be generated

19

after the facility was completed.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, South Carolina, in

21

this particular context.

The -- immediately, it

22

would be South Carolina, and ultimately, then --

23

assuming North Carolina or another State were to site

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you're saying the

money generated by the South Carolina facility was

the money of the compact members?

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
And that was the money

6

that was given to North Carolina?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, because the compact

question with respect to findings of breach.

I -- I think that the Court

9

appropriate rule of restitution, because we are too

not there.

12

We're not -- we're

But I think, if the Court finds that North

13

Carolina breached the compact, it ought to try to

14

find a reasonable way to remedy that particular

15

problem, even if the technical standards didn't

apply.

appropriate standard of restitution in a problem as

14

So I think we would still have an argument

Mr. Dellinger spent a lot of time on what

15

strikes me as sort of a complete fantasy with respect

16

to the funding situation that North Carolina faced.

17

You know, once South Carolina left, to be sure, we

lost the ability to take money and help North
