ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Justice Scalia, and

may it please the Court:
The Federal Circuit's clear and convincing

11

13

patents, even though this Court recognized in KSR that

14

invalid patents stifle rather than promote the progress

15

of liberal arts.

16

17

should govern in all cases because section 282 does not

18

specify a heightened standard of proof.

Under this Court's decisions Grogan

MR. HUNGAR:

MR. HUNGAR:

To the extent that -- that

2

Justice Cardozo was discussing a heightened standard in

3

the limited context of priority inventions, we think

4

that that's not consistent with section 282, which, of

5

course, came later.

6

concerns that undergirded the Court's heightened

7

standard in priority of invention cases, where -- those

8

concerns were addressed to the -- the problem of

9

primarily oral testimony being offered to substantiate

10

Moreover, I would note that the

priority of invention claims.
The Federal Circuit has separately addressed

11
12

that issue by means of its corroboration requirement,

13

which operates separate and independent of the clear and

14

convincing evidence standard, so the concerns that

15

undergirded RCA are -- are completely taken care of by

16

that as well.

example which had explained this rationale for a

13

heightened concern in that specific context.

14

don't have cases applying -- Supreme Court cases

15

applying the heightened standard in other contexts.

16

don't mention any heightened standard in viewing

invalidity questions.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

although I would note that Judge Rich, in American Hoist

20

decision, says that the cases prior to 1952 were all

21

over the map.
But -- but the relevant question is what

would Congress have thought the state of the law was in

If you think that there's any merit at all to the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that Congress could not have thought in 1952 that the

2

law was an across-the-board heightened standard, because

3

case after case after case rejected the proposition that

4

there is a heightened standard or that the presumption

5

was unaffected when the evidence was not considered by

6

the Patent Office.

7

The -- we've cited numerous cases in our

8

brief at pages 34 through 36.

10

cases, some from before 1952 and some from after 1952,

weakened or eliminated when the prior art evidence was

not considered by the Patent Office.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The -- and we also in the

So, you just -

Well, Mr. Hungar, it seems

15

to me that RCA would matter, even under your view of the

16

world, because if you think that Congress did not codify

17

the existing state of the law as to the standard of

18

proof and you think that Congress -- that -- that

19

section 282 was essentially silent as to the standard of

20

proof, then the question is, what do we do?

21

answer to that question is we go with our prior

22

precedent, which is RCA.

23

MR. HUNGAR:

And one

Well, first of all, again,

24

because RCA in context was a case where there was a

25

priority of invention dispute that had been adjudicated
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the Patent Office on the same evidence previously

2

resolved by the Court, a priority of defense dispute,

3

where the heightened standard cases had some

4

application, it clearly wouldn't affect the standards in

5

this case.

6

Congress thought in 1952, and when you don't have a

7

clear rule to be codified, the default rules of

8

statutory construction apply.

9

statutory construction in a -- on this question, in

But, more fundamentally, that's not what

The default rule of

10

Grogan and Huddleston, the preponderance standard

11

applies.
And, moreover, while the statute does not

12
13

specify a heightened standard, it does actually speak to

14

and -- and preclude the argument that i4i makes, because

15

the first sentence refers to patents being presumed

16

valid under this Court's precedent, a presumption shifts

17

the burden of going forward, and the second sentence of

18

the original statute refers to the burden of proof.

19

Under their interpretation, presumption does all the

20

work.

21

going forward, also shifts the burden of proof, and does

22

so under a heightened standard, which has never been how

23

presumption is interpreted generally in the law, and it

24

renders the second sentence entirely superfluous.

25

There's no need for it.

The first sentence not only shifts the burden of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's -- it -- it is true

2

that the Federal Circuit has been consistent now since

3

almost the beginning, since that court came on the

4

scene, and it does have a monopoly on appeal in patent

5

cases since 1984.

6

has consistently taken this position, one would have

7

expected that there would have been bills proposed to

8

change it.

Because the -- the Federal Circuit

Were there any?
MR. HUNGAR:

9

No, Your Honor, not that I'm

10

aware of.

But I would note that this is, I think, i4i's

11

congressional acquiescence argument, if you will, and

12

that argument fails for numerous reasons.
First of all, if there could be any

13
14

acquiescence, and we don't think that the -- this

15

Court's extremely high requirements for such a claim

16

have been satisfied here, but if there could be any

17

acquiescence at all, the first 30 years after enactment

18

of the statute would be the most relevant consideration

19

in determining what Congress had acquiesced in, and it's

20

perfectly clear that the regional circuits all rejected

21

the across-the-board heightened standard that i4i is

22

arguing for.

23
24
25

So if Congress acquiesced in anything, it
was not an across-the-board heightened standard.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I -- I -

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

having read some of those cases that you've cited that

2

you claim weakened or eliminated the burden of proof

3

standard, most of them didn't quite eliminate it.

4

Virtually all of them added an instruction to the jury

5

of some sort that said that the application of the

6

standard should take into account the fact that the PTO

7

did not consider evidence -- did not consider the prior

8

art relied upon in the invalidity challenge.

9

You didn't ask for such an instruction in

10

this case; is that correct?

11

isn't that adequate to convey the point that you're

12

trying to convey, that a jury should, in fact, consider

13

that the PTO never got to see that prior art?

14

MR. HUNGAR:

And if you didn't, why

Your Honor, if I understand

15

the -- the question correctly, first of all, I would

16

disagree with the characterization of the cases, but

17

with respect to the preservation issue, we objected to

18

the clear and convincing evidence instruction, and we

19

also said that if -- if any instruction on the

20

heightened standard is going to be given, it needs to

21

reflect that -- the fact that, at least with respect to

22

prior art combinations that were not considered by the

23

Patent Office, the standard should be a preponderance.

24

And, indeed, that's true of all of the prior art

25

combinations that were at issue in the case.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But other judges give a

2

slightly different standard.

3

convincing standard, and they add a separate instruction

4

that tells the jury, in applying that standard, you

5

should consider the fact that the PTO did not see this

6

evidence.

You didn't ask for that?

7

MR. HUNGAR:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

They give a clear and

We didn't ask -
You just asked for the

preponderance of the evidence charge?
MR. HUNGAR:

10

But, Your Honor, we did object

11

to the clear and convincing evidence instruction, and so

12

if -- we don't think that's the right answer, the more

13

easily satisfied instruction, if that's what Your Honor

14

is referring to.

15

conclusion, that that is in fact what the law requires,

16

then our objection to the clear and -- the unmodified

17

clear and convincing evidence instruction would justify

18

a new trial here.

MR. HUNGAR:

All you have to charge is preponderance of

into account -
MR. HUNGAR:

2

Your Honor, that construction

3

would not solve the fundamental problem, which is that

4

when the Patent Office didn't even consider the

5

evidence, it makes absolutely no sense, as the KRSR

6

court indicated, to have this heightened deference.

7

statute requires a degree of deference by shifting the

8

burden of proof and the burden of going forward, but for

9

i4i to say that we need to go beyond what the

The

10

presumption is, the normal default standard of

11

preponderance, you need some heightened reason for that.

12

There's absolutely none, particularly when the Patent

13

Office didn't consider the evidence, didn't make a

14

decision, there was no decision and no evidence

15

considered going to the relevant question.

16

not -
JUSTICE BREYER:

17

That's

I have one question here I

18

would like to get your view on.

I'll assume that the

19

language is open enough in the history so that we could

20

make what would be a change, I think it would be a

21

change.

22

that are because there are two types of errors:

23

bad thing not to give protection to an invention that

24

deserves it; and it is just as bad a thing to give

25

protection to an invention that doesn't deserve it.

The reasons as I get from the brief for doing

13
Alderson Reporting Company

It's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Both can seriously harm the economy.
And you are also saying that the Patent

2
3

Office is out of control, not through its own fault, but

4

there are too few people and too many inventions.

5

therefore type two error is a real risk.
So I'm turning you to and say:

6

And

Well, what

7

should we do about it?

8

have also seen in these briefs the following proposal:

9

One, somebody who thinks there is a type two error, go

10

back to the Patent Office and ask for reconsideration.

11

That's pretty good.

12

again.

13

I know your proposal.

But we

We get the experts to look at it

And then that's coupled with:

Tell the

14

district judges to stick very closely to their job,

15

allow the clear and convincing standard to apply to

16

facts, and by that we mean brute facts, and let them

17

decide the brute facts, but let the judge decide whether

18

that amounts to obviousness, novelty, or any of the

19

other prerequisites.

20

Now, I've gotten that out of the amicus

21

briefs, some of which say they support you but they

22

really don't.

23

views on those two suggestions as being sufficient to

24

cure the problem that you point to.

I don't

Your Honor, I don't think it

addresses the problem because the fundamental problem is

21

imposing this heightened standard on the jury that has

22

no moorings in the statute and no moorings in common

sense, particularly in a case like this one where the

As one of Your Honor's earlier questions

2

pointed out, the fundamental problem here is that the

3

interests on the i4i side of the equation, the policy

4

interests, are outweighed if anything by this Court's

5

repeated recognition that invalid patents stifle

6

innovation and competition and are very harmful.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

Mr. Hungar, could we go

back to the statute that was enacted in 1952.

Before

patent or the effect of the patent, that was on the

challenger.

12

the defendant would have the burden of proof and the

14

normal standard is preponderance.

presumption of validity, must Congress have intended to

16

do something more than simply repeat that the defendant

has the burden of proof?

So when Congress added a presumption of

No, Your Honor.

The law

19

actually before 1952 was quite unsettled on that

20

question, as we noted in our brief and as Judge Rich, I

believe, noted in the American Hoist case, there were

actually cases prior to 1952 saying that the burden was

don't think -- I don't recall that they speak to that

7

level of specificity.

I think certainly

But I

But certainly there are cases saying the

8
9

I believe -- you know, the

burden is on the patent holder.

Congress overturned

10

those cases by imposing -- by stating in the second

11

sentence that the burden of proof would be on the

12

defendant.

13

earlier, for Congress to have added that sentence if it

14

didn't view the presumption sentence as shifting the

15

burden of proof to the defendant, let alone shifting it

16

under a heightened standard, so -

But it only makes sense, as I indicated

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

If the challenger has the

18

burden of persuasion, wouldn't it almost go without

19

saying that the challenger would also have the burden of

20

production on the issue of invalidity?

21

added then by -- what role is played then by that

22

sentence, a patent shall be presumed valid?
MR. HUNGAR:

23

So what would be

I think that's unclear, Your

24

Honor.

Certainly there are circumstances in which the

25

party with the ultimate burden of proof does not bear -

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

does not have the burden of persuasion at every stage.

2

And Congress -- there were also cases prior to 1952

3

suggesting that the presumption had gone away, that

4

there was no longer a presumption of validity or that

5

the presumption went the other way.

6

And so again, Congress wanted to be clear;

7

it was saying there is a presumption which shifts the

8

burden of going forward under this Court's precedence,

9

and there is a burden of proof on the defendant, and

10

that's all it did.

11

more, much more than the pre-1952 cases authorized -

12

there are literally dozens of pre-1952 cases cited in

13

that list of 200 cases referenced at footnote 3 of our

14

brief, from prior to 1952, rejecting the notion that

15

there's an across-the-board heightened presumption of

16

validity; saying, no, if the evidence was not considered

17

by the Patent Office or in some -- the Western Auto

18

case, for example, from the Sixth Circuit says well,

19

there's this -- the exception for oral testimony of

20

prior invention, that's the RCA case; but everything

21

else is preponderance.

22

heightened presumption of validity in any other

23

circumstances.

24
25

To infer that it did something much

So there's no -- there's no

So I think the law was clear, and the
treatises we cite at page 9 of our reply brief also make
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

clear the treatise writers understood, there was no

2

across-the-board heightened presumption that it was

3

weakened or eliminated when the evidence was not before

4

the Patent Office.

5

actually RCA itself cites with approval two court of

6

appeals cases that we note in our reply brief, the

7

Studie case and the Wilson case, which rejected the

8

notion of a heightened standard across the board.

9

said well, that's true when the issue was adjudicated

And some of the cases said -

They

10

before the Patent Office, but here where the Patent

11

Office did not adjudicate the issue that doesn't apply.

12

So again you just can't get out of the pre-1952 case law

13

-- the rule that i4i is urging.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, and may it

please the Court.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Waxman.

The long-settled, clear and

22

convincing evidence standard is correct, one, as a

23

matter of statutory interpretation, two, as a matter of

24

stare decisis in a field in which stability is

25

particularly important, and, three, as a matter of first
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

principles.
As to one, in 1952 Congress codified a long,

2
3

uniform line of decisions from this Court holding that

4

the presumption of validity imposes a heightened burden

5

of proof, a burden of proof that this Court in RCA

6

unanimously described as, quote, "clear and cogent

7

evidence."

8

actively acquiesced in the Federal Circuit's consistent

9

holding expressly drawn from RCA that the standard is

10

"clear and convincing."
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I would like that

notion of active acquiescence.
MR. WAXMAN:

15
16

How actively do we

acquiesce?

14

And for the past 28 years Congress has

I thought that might get a rise

out of you.

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. WAXMAN:

I hope I'll get a chance to go

19

to first principles, but having made that provocative

20

statement, the point is -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

21
22
23
24
25

It's like passive activity,

right?
MR. WAXMAN:

I may want to submit a

supplemental brief on that point.
(Laughter.)
22
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WAXMAN:

What I mean to say is that this

2

is not a statute that Congress enacted and then forgot

3

about.

4

even before the Federal Circuit was created, Congress

5

started amending the law to address the problem of

6

low-quality patents, with the first re-examination

7

procedure in 1980, any number of amendments, including

8

to section 282, the creation of interparties

9

re-examination in 1999, and the current consideration of

10
11

This is a statute in which beginning in 1980,

a post-grant review process.
So Congress has been very, very active in

12

this field, and what I mean by active acquiescence is it

13

has been very active in this field, it is well aware of

14

the clear and convincing evidence standard, and it has

15

done nothing whatsoever to change it, even make any

16

effort to consider making such a sweeping change in

17

long-standing doctrine.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman -

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

If I could take you back to

20

first principles, which is where you started, I have

21

three problems in seeing your interpretation in the

22

language of section 282.

23

First, the statute says the burden of

24

establishing invalidity of a patent, et cetera, et

25

cetera, shall rest on the parties asserting such
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

invalidity.

If Congress wanted to impose a clear and

2

convincing burden, why in the world would they not have

3

said that expressly in that sentence?

4

Number two, if the first sentence, "a patent

5

shall be presumed valid," means that -- is talking about

6

the burden, then it's superfluous, because that's dealt

7

with in the second sentence.

8

And, third, the phrase "shall be presumed

9

valid" doesn't seem to me at all to suggest clear and

10

convincing evidence.

A presumption normally doesn't

11

have anything to do with clear and convincing evidence.

12

Most presumptions can be disproved by much less than

13

clear and convincing evidence.

14

in -- your -- your position into the language of the

15

statute?
MR. WAXMAN:

16

So how do you read that

Well, as to presumptions

17

generally, I found particularly persuasive your opinion

18

for the Third Circuit in GI Holding.
JUSTICE ALITO:

19
20

But more -

I've gotten a lot smarter

since then.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. WAXMAN:

More directly to the point, and

23

with all due deference to the sensibilities of the

24

presiding Justice for this argument, when Congress

25

enacted section 282 in 1952, the revisers note the House
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Committee report, the Senate committee report said that

2

they were, quote, "codifying the existing presumption of

3

patent validity," and this Court had unanimously said -

4

and this is language from RCA that Microsoft does not

5

address -- on page 2 of its opinion says, quote, "even

6

for the purpose of a controversy of -- with strangers

7

there is a presumption of validity, a presumption not to

8

be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.

9

Now, to be sure, that was dicta in the sense

10

that the case in itself involves a priority issue.

11

it was the holding of the Court 3 years later in Smith

12

v. Hall; it was repeated on the very same day in Mumm,

13

and it was -- the Court spent an entire page, I think

14

page 7, the better part of page 7 and 8 of its opinion,

15

explaining that -- enunciating a general principle of

16

the law, and it would be a cruel joke on Congress to

17

have said, we are, when it said we are codifying the

18

existing presumption, that that presumption was not

19

exactly what the Supreme -- the Supreme Court

20

unanimously had said, which is a presumption not to be

21

overthrown by clear and convincing evidence.

22

But

Now, that's -- it's not that the first

23

sentence uses the word presumption.

24

essentially presumption of patent validity, which is a

25

feature, a uniform feature of the Supreme Court's
25
Alderson Reporting Company

It uses the word

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisprudence since the Court first started addressing

2

this issue in 1873, and indeed when Justice Story first

3

decided the Washburn v. Gould case, there is -- their

4

argument is the standard is a preponderance.

5

There is not one opinion, there is not one

6

sentence, there is not one phrase in any of this Court's

7

line of decisions that supports that proposition -- and

8

when Judge Rich said in 19 -- shortly after 1952 that

9

there was some disarray in the courts' opinions, he

10

was -- and you can look at his opinion in context.

11

was talking about lower court decisions that had either

12

ignored or misinterpreted this Court's very clear

13

holdings -- holdings which, by the way, refute not only

14

their argument for a universal standard, preponderance

15

standard, but directly refute their argument that there

16

somehow is some other standard of proof that applies

17

with respect to evidence that assertedly was not before

18

the Patent Office.

21

He

That was true of most of this Court's cases
decided before RCA, and for that matter after RCA.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you agree, looking

22

to Judge Rich's opinions, that it would have been in

23

order for the judge to instruct, if the judge had been

24

asked to do so, that the evidence would carry more

25

weight if it hadn't been presented, defendant's evidence
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would carry more weight if it hadn't been presented to

2

the Patent Office?

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, and the Federal Circuit

4

has said that over and over and over again.

I mean, I'm

5

going to quibble with the word "would" because I think

6

the actual language of the instruction can't invade the

7

province of the jury.

8

say that the defendant contends that the patent is

9

invalid because the law presumes that a patent issued by

But you could -- certainly could

10

the PTO is valid, the defendant bears the burden of

11

proving invalidity by clear and convincing evidence, and

12

in deciding whether the defendant has met that burden,

13

you may find it more easily met with evidence that you

14

conclude the Patent Office did not consider in

15

evaluating patentability.

16

That is the long-standing established rule

17

of the Federal Circuit.

It was stated, as was

18

recognized in American Hoist, in 1984, and the

19

explanation for it, Judge Rich's explanation is exactly

20

the same in cite that this Court's statement's in KSR

21

is, which is that there -- there are -- there are

22

reasons independent of deference to a particular PTO

23

decision that warrant a clear and convincing evidence

24

standard, and -- and this is key -- there is no case

25

from this Court, to my knowledge, in Anglo-American
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisprudence, that creates or sanctions a regime in

2

which there are different standards of proof with

3

respect to a particular issue that a jury has to decide.

4

The question -- when there is -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

there are cases in which the presumption disappears?
MR. WAXMAN:

7
8

Well, there are case -

Well, there -- are you

referring to cases of this Court?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Yes.

Well, I mean,

10

there -- there -- there are instances in which a

11

presumption disappears and then the -- the parties begin

12

again with burden of persuasion, et cetera.
MR. WAXMAN:

13

Well, okay.

I'm -- I'm talking

14

here about -- the argument here is about the standard of

15

proof, that is, a jury has to be instructed is it beyond

16

a reasonable doubt, is it preponderance, is it clear and

17

convincing?

18

Anglo-American jurisprudence, and certainly Microsoft

19

and its amici have not cited one in which the jury is

20

told that depending on the weight you ascribe to the

21

evidence you heard, you should apply a different

22

standard of proof.

I'm not aware of any instance in

The issue goes to the weight of the

23
24

evidence.

I mean, imagine a case in -- a regime in

25

which you said, well, you've heard eyewitness testimony.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

If you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, find that the

2

eyewitness really had an unimpeded view, the standard is

3

preponderance, but if you think that the view was

4

impeded or obscured, the standard is clear and

5

convincing evidence.
The -- the assertion that there was evidence

6
7

that the jury -- that the PTO didn't hear, and as the

8

briefs point out it is far from black and white what the

9

PTO does or doesn't consider.

And in addition the -

10

it's far from clear whether the unconsidered evidence

11

is, quote, more pertinent than evidence that was

12

considered.

13

reasons of first principles, that I will articulate in a

14

moment if left to my own devices, that the burden of

15

proof is clear and convincing evidence, but you may find

16

that burden more easily met if you find that there was,

17

in fact, evidence relating to validity that was not, in

18

fact, considered by the PTO when it issued this property

19

right.

Even assuming that, the jury is told, for

Now, the first -

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't there a lower

22

court that has ruled that that standard, in the manner

23

that you've articulated, could confuse a jury as to what

24

clear and convincing evidence means?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

The -
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In fact, it's not clear

2

and convincing evidence if you phrase it that way, that

3

it's something less than that.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I mean, a lot -

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so, the amici here

6

have suggested alternatives to that language that you're

7

endorsing -

8

MR. WAXMAN:

There -- there are -- there are

9

any number of formulations that trial courts have given.

10

I think the one that would be clearest would be one that

11

says in deciding whether the defendant has met his

12

burden, you may give added weight to evidence that you

13

find the PTO didn't consider in deciding validity.

14

The case I think you're referring to was

15

Microsoft's earlier case involving z4, where unlike this

16

case, Microsoft did ask for an instruction but it was

17

rejected by the court -- it was -- it was rejected by

18

the court and found not to be an abuse of discretion.

19

The key point with respect to that instruction goes to

20

the articulation that was suggested earlier, because in

21

that case the instruction said you -- you make -- I

22

instruct -- I don't have it in front of me, but it was

23

essentially a mandatory instruction to give greater

24

weight or that the burden would be more easily met.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course the instruction

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you've proposed to the jury, like your adversary's

2

proposition, would require determining what it was that

3

the Patent Office considered.

Well -
You have to do it for your

There is a -- there is a great

10

difference, Justice Scalia, between telling individual

11

jurors what amount of weight they may or may not give to

12

certain evidence in creating a dual standard of proof

13

which would, for reasons that -- that Microsoft's own

14

amici point out, requires -- would require the jury

15

first to determine whether this evidence was or wasn't

considered and was or wasn't more pertinent -

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, as -- as I

23

24

reflect the -- the research, I believe, on footnote 12

25

of our brief, the -- this point is argued in many, many,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

many cases.

That is -- and it was true in this case.

2

Evidence is put on that the jury -- that the PTO didn't

3

consider this particular prior art, although, you know,

4

in this case the file wrapper shows that there were five

5

prior art rejections based on other art before the

6

patent was allowed, and counsel argue it to and fro to

7

the jury, as the Allison and Lemley article points out,

8

the statistics bear out the common sense, which is that

9

juries are, in fact, very influenced by the fact that

10

there was art going to or questioning validity that was

11

not considered by the PTO.
In other words, the instruction, whether the

12
13

instruction is necessary or not, juries get it, and

14

juries apply it.

15

apply two different standards of proof following all

16

sorts of predicate determinations that they would have

to make.

What they're not required to do is

18

May I simply list the first -- the first -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but why -- why -

20

why not, Mr. Waxman?

If the whole reason for this extra

21

deference, for this clear and convincing standard is a

22

Patent Office is expert and so we defer juries similarly

23

to defer to their judgment, but if they haven't judged

24

anything, what is the justification for continuing to

25

have the clear and convincing standard?
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WAXMAN:

There -- here are four

2

independent principles that justify the clear and

3

convincing evidence standard across the board regardless

4

of what the jury considered.
Number one, an infringer's validity

5
6

challenge is a collateral attack on a government

7

decision that has already been made, quite unlike Grogan

8

and Huddleston, that bestows property rights by written

9

instrument.

10

Number two, the harm from an erroneous

11

determination is hugely asymmetrical.

12

of invalidity by a single lay jury vitiates for all time

13

the patent and all of the reliance interest by the

14

inventor and the investors and the licensees who have

15

relied upon that ex ante.

16

A single holding

Third, this grant of property rights not

17

only induces reliance, which lack, like the land patent

18

cases induce reliance, this is a grant of a property

19

right that under the Constitution is specifically

20

designed to induce reliance in exchange for the

21

inventor's honoring her half of the patent bargain, that

22

is public disclosure of her intellectual property for

23

the public benefit, and the commitment of capital by

24

investors and licensees that's necessary to bring into

25

fruition for the public benefit.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Isn't there a limited amount

of reliance that any patent holder can have, given the

3

re-exam system?
MR. WAXMAN:

4

Yes, and the fact -- yes, the

5

re-examine system -- I think your point actually, I wish

6

I had thought to make this point myself.

7

often invoked by the patent holder.

8

re-exam is done by the expert agency and allows the

Re-examine is

That is, because

10

of yes, the patent's fine or no, it's invalid for all

11

time, but can narrow the scope of the patent in re-exam,

12

many re-exams are requested by the patent holder.
And more -- and also, when you request

13
14

re-examination or when the PTO makes a re-exam decision,

15

that decision is good for all time, whichever way it

goes, unlike the stark asymmetry in trial court

requirement of heightened proof was part and parcel of

the presumption itself in the same way that I think most

of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is part and parcel of

the presumption of innocence in criminal cases.

The other thing I would say in response to

9
10

Justice Alito's question, which also goes to the natural

11

meaning of the statute, Justice Alito asked, I think,

12

basically, if these precedents were not on the book and

13

we were just looking fresh at the language, what would

14

we assume the standard to be?

15

let's look at what the defendant is asking the judge or

16

jury to do.

17

to set aside a decision that has been made by then the

18

Patent Office, now the PTO, and we would ask what sort

19

of standard of proof ordinarily applies when a litigant

20

asks a court to set aside an administrative decision.

21

And I think we would say,

The defendant is asking the judge or jury

In a sense, this court had a variant of that

22

problem a few years ago in Dickinson v. Zurko, which

23

dealt with direct court of appeals review of a denial by

24

the PTO of a patent applicant's application, and the

25

statute clearly authorized judicial review in the
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal Circuit, but said nothing about what standard

2

would apply.

3

conflicting standard imposed by the statute, we will

4

look to background principles and administrative law,

5

and the standard will be substantial evidence.

6

that's basically what this Court said back in 1894 in

Morgan v. Daniels.

9

validity of an issued patent is that that litigant is

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

But that ground doesn't

13

carry very much weight when the matter was never

14

considered by the PTO.
MR. STEWART:

15

I think you are correct that

16

if Congress had focused specifically on the category of

17

cases in which the only evidence brought forward to show

18

invalidity had not been considered by the PTO, it might

19

have addressed that separately.

20

three independent reasons that it makes sense to apply a

21

heightened standard even in that category of cases.

22

first two have to do with the interests of the patent

23

applicant, the third has to do with the interests of the

24

PTO.

25

In our view there are

The first one is that the patent -- the
40
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

grant of a patent has historically been understood to

2

reflect a quid pro quo between the applicant and the

3

government, and the applicant's part of the bargain was

4

disclose that which might otherwise be maintained as a

5

trade secret, and the government's part of the bargain

6

was give a period of exclusivity.

7

And I think there is a thread in this

8

Court's cases, especially in the barbed wire patent

9

cases, to the effect that once the patent applicant has

10

honored his part of the bargain a court should be

11

hesitant to essentially deprive him of the benefit for

12

which he contracted unless the evidence is clear.

13

court in the barbed wire patent cases said that whatever

14

doubts there may be as to whether the patentee was

15

actually the first inventor should be resolved in the

16

patentee's favor because without question he was the one

17

who first disclosed the information to the public, made

18

it available to the public through the patent

19

application process itself.

20

The

The second is related to the patentee's

21

reliance interests, but is more instrumental.

22

independent of our concerns for fairness to the patent

23

applicant, Congress could reasonably determine that

24

there are enough uncertainties along the way to getting

25

a patent, to having it overturned on various other

That is,

grounds that in an invalidity suit the patent -- the

2

patentee should have reasonable confidence that it won't

And I would like to respond briefly to Your

5

Honor's question, Justice Kagan, about why isn't that

12

acknowledge the force of your observation that to some

13

extent, the patent holder's confidence would be greater

14

if there were no re-examination process at all.

15

guess I would say this is just one aspect of the patent

16

law's balancing of competing interests in a way that

17

doesn't serve either to the exclusion of the other; and

18

to use an obvious analogy, the current term of patent

19

protection is 20 years from the -- the date of the

application.

So this would -- it reflects Congress's

19
20

understanding that there is a problem with patents that

21

should not have been issued, but its desire to create

22

additional mechanisms for the PTO to address that

23

problem, rather than to have it be done through

24

litigation.

25

about the 20 and the 10 years is somebody could ask,

But that -- the point I was going to make

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

well if 20 years is better than 10, why wouldn't 30 be

2

better than 20?

3

would give the patentee even more -- or the potential

4

patentee even more incentive to invent, but at a certain

5

point Congress decides that countervailing

6

considerations require an end.

7

And the only answer is 30 presumably

And it has essentially done something of the

8

same thing with re-examination.

It said we're not going

9

to go so far in the direction of protecting patent

10

holders' reliance interests as to preclude the PTO from

11

reassessing what it's done, but that doesn't mean that

12

reliance interests aren't important.

13

And the third thing I would say is even when

14

a defendant in an infringement suit comes forward with

15

prior art that was not itself considered by the PTO,

16

there's always the possibility that that prior art will

17

be substantively equivalent to prior art that the PTO

18

did consider; and so in cases like this, in form the

19

defendant would be asking the jury to make a

20

determination that the PTO had never made, but in

21

substance, what the defendant would be asking the jury

22

to do is conclude that what the PTO thought was a

23

patentable advance really was not so.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3
4

MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Justice Scalia.

A

few points that I would like to make.
First of all, with respect to the suggestion

5
6

that the jury should be instructed on the weight to be

7

given various forms of evidence, I note that in the z4

8

case that's been discussed, the Federal Circuit rejected

9

the very, quote, "more easily carried," closed quote,

10

instruction that i4i suggests as the solution, and it

11

did so because it would confuse the jury about what the

12

standard is.

13

Having effectively three standards of proof

14

in patent cases rather than two is hardly a solution to

15

the problem; but more fundamentally, whatever

16

instructions might or might not be appropriate regarding

17

the particular evidence before the jury, there has to be

18

a justification for departing from this default

19

preponderance standard, and no sufficient justification

20

has been offered.

21

The statute doesn't provide for it, the

22

legislative history doesn't reference it, the pre-1952

23

case law can't reasonably be read in that way.

24

-- i4i and its amici do not point to a single case in

25

the -- in the years leading up to 1952, the 15 or so
45

That's

Your Honor, as you know,

20

re-exam is not available for many of the types of

21

invalidity issues that arise.

22

if -- if the Court had such a rule, the problem is,

23

re-exam takes a long time, patents plaintiffs generally

24

oppose stays of litigation for re-examination, because

25

they want to get to the jury because they know that

But in any event, if -

2

either judges or the Patent Office on re-exam.

3

want to get the case litigated as quickly as possible so

4

you get through the court system before the re-exam has

5

been completed.

6

So they

So to the -- in fact if it were true, as

7

some of the amici argue, that a patent applicant -

8

patent holders are afraid of juries and want the experts

9

at PTO to resolve the questions, which we don't think as

10

a -- as a factual matter is accurate, but if that were

11

true, the patent applicant, the patent holder has the

12

absolute right to initiate re-exam themselves, and they

13

could certainly go to the court and say please stay

14

proceedings pending re-examination.

15

courts refuse to stay proceedings, because they don't

16

want to prejudice the plaintiff, who is opposing a stay,

17

but if the plaintiff is asking for a stay, there's not

18

going to be any problem.

So the system already permits patent holders

8

With respect to the legislative history that

9

they rely on, if you're going to look at the legislative

10

history, what it actually says is that Congress is

11

referring to the presumption as stated by the courts,

12

plural -- not the Supreme Court, courts plural -- so if

13

you're going to look at legislative history it actually

14

makes clear that Congress was not looking only at the

15

RCA case which is not even referenced in the legislative

16

history, but was looking at rule as it was understood to

17

exist in 1952, which is not the rule that i4i urges.

18

With respect to the -- the presumption

19

point, the presumption clearly does serve a purpose, the

20

presumption language in the statute, by overturning the

21

courts -- the prior to 1952 decisions that had rejected

22

the presumption, and by making clear that the burden of

going forward is on the defendant, so the plaintiff

doesn't have the burden that it would otherwise have of
