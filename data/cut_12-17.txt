ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GUPTA:

8
9

Thank you, and may it please the

Court:
All 50 States have public records laws.

10

47

11

of those States make access available to residents and

12

nonresidents on equal terms.

13

enforces a discriminatory access policy, and, because

14

commercial requesters make up the vast majority of

15

records requesters, out-of-State businesses bear the

16

brunt of Virginia's policy.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Virginia, by contrast,

When -- when was the first

18

of those laws enacted?

19

think it's in my adult lifetime that Florida was the

20

first to enact a sunshine law.

21

about that?
MR. GUPTA:

22
23
24

Do you know?

I think it's -- I

Is that -- am I correct

That's right.

All of these

laws -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

In the '60s.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GUPTA:

1

3

In the '60s and the early '70s.

Virginia law was enacted in 1968.

And we don't deny

that -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

And you say that's a

5

fundamental -- that's a fundamental right covered by

6

Privileges and Immunities Clause, which nobody had until

7

the 1960s?
MR. GUPTA:

8
9

Well, to be clear, the modern

transparency laws are new, but they sit on top of

10

well-established common-law right -- rights to access

11

that are based, not on modern notions of transparency,

12

but on the right to secure property and other basic

13

interests -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

still exist in this State, don't they?

16

records of deeds and whatever the common law would have

17

covered?

18

MR. GUPTA:

But those -- those rights
Cannot you get

Well, it's true that -- that

19

Virginia's law exempts deeds from its Freedom of

20

Information law, but, if I understand their position

21

correctly, they would be entitled, as a constitutional

22

matter, under their theory, to preclude people from

23

other States from accessing even deeds.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Well, I'll ask them -- I

didn't understand that to be their position, but -- but

4

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

2

I guess we can ask them.

MR. GUPTA:

Well, my

client, Mr. Hurlbert,

3

is in the business of gathering property records for his

4

clients.

5

the deed, but what he can't get and what he principally

6

gathers for his clients are real estate tax assessment

7

records, and those are a much richer storehouse of

8

property-related information than simply the deed.

9

Now, it's true that, in Virginia, he could get

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you -- can you

10

explain that business a little more fully than you did

11

in the briefs?

12

records from all the States about tax assessments.

He's in the business of collecting

13

MR. GUPTA:

That's right.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And he -- and he does

15

that for a client who could very well ask himself.

16

what is the service that's being performed?

17

MR. GUPTA:

So

Well, he -- you know, he doesn't

18

just do the routine request.

19

companies are the ones who hire him.

20

they're routine requests, they can do them themselves;

21

although if they're not based in Virginia, they would

22

still have to hire a Virginian to do it.

23

The -- the large data
And they -- if

But they bring him in when there's some flaw

24

in the -- the routine process where the -- the State is

25

being recalcitrant or the local official is being

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

recalcitrant.

And he's an expert in being able to

gather

these -- these records and knowing the process is

3

knowing what he's allowed to do and what he's not

4

allowed to do.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

All -- all he has to

6

do is get somebody from -- from Virginia to ask for him,

7

right?

8
9
10
11

MR. GUPTA:

Well, he could hire someone from

Virginia to do that, but that's -- you know, that's sort
of precisely what the -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you don't

12

have to pay the person too much, he just has to write a

13

letter saying, give me these documents, right?

14

MR. GUPTA:

He would still have to hire

15

someone, and that would be an increased cost.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- for

Well, an increased

17

cost of -- I don't know how much -- 100 bucks, right?

18

Go -- write a letter, say you want these documents, and,

19

when they come to your house, give them to me.

20

MR. GUPTA:

Yeah.

For the large data

21

companies -- you know, they will hire someone other than

22

him to perform this service.

23

talking about routine requests.

24

even for them, if you're talking about a -- a request

25

that isn't routine, if he has to do something further to

They will -- if you're
But even -- you know,

6

Alderson Reporting Company

2

enforce the rights, he's going to have to do that in his
name, or the data company will have to hire someone

3

other than him, someone based in Virginia, to do that

4

for them.

5

And then he will lose that business.
So the lower you go down in the food chain

6

of the data industry, the bigger the effect of

7

Virginia's policy.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How much -- how much of

an impact, in fact, does it have on his business?

10

mean, there are 47 States who will provide this

11

information.

12

MR. GUPTA:

I

Well, for -- for him, in the

13

Virginia market, it completely forecloses him from doing

14

access -- business in the Virginia market.

15

And, if other States were to have policies

16

like this, he wouldn't be able to do business in those

17

States as well.

18

business in Virginia, it completely cuts him off.

19

So if -- if the focus is on him and his

If the focus is on -- on what the effect is

20

in the aggregate, on the market as a whole, because most

21

public records requests are commercial requests, it's

22

going to have an effect on most commercial requesters

23

who are out-of-State.

24
25

And -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Gupta, I -- I

understand that the -- the reasoning of Virginia in not

7

Alderson Reporting Company

own

Official

1
2

allowing out-of-State people to -- to get these FOIA
is the following:

requests

That the purpose of these -

3

these laws -- and I remember it when the first ones were

4

enacted -- government in the sunshine.

5

it was not to enable people to get information, per se;

6

it was to enable people to see how their government is

7

working, so that they could attend to any malfeasance

8

that is occurring in the process of government.

9

The purpose of

It seems to me entirely in accord with that

10

purpose of these laws to say it's only Virginia citizens

11

who -- who are concerned about the functioning of

12

Virginia government and ought to be able to get whatever

13

records Virginia agencies have.

14

What's -- what's wrong with that reasoning?

15

MR. GUPTA:

16

First, transparency was one purpose, but, as

A few responses, Justice Scalia.

17

I said, these laws also carried forward the much more

18

longstanding rights to access based on personal

19

interests and property interests.

20

time that these laws were enacted -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Also, even at the

But -- but you don't need

22

any personal or property interest under these laws.

23

can just -- just out of curiosity, if you -- if you were a

24

Virginian, at least, in Virginia, even though you have

25

no interest in the matter at all, you can ask the agency

8

Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official

1
2

for records about this or that.

It -- it can't be

based on -- on the

3

traditional property interest.

4

ability of the citizens of the State to find out what

5

the -- what the government of the State is up to.

6

MR. GUPTA:

It's based on the

Even -- even at the time that

7

these laws were enacted in the -- in the '60s, it was

8

well-understood that they were going to have a big

9

commercial impact.

10
11

The property records industry was in

full swing by the end of the late 19th Century.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the point is that

12

FOIA is tied to, as Justice Scalia said, the citizens

13

should know what their government is doing.

14

don't have to give any reason at all, if you were a part

15

of that political community.

16

allow people from out-of-State to vote.

17

part of Virginia's political community.

18

And you

Now, Virginia doesn't
They're not

So why isn't this -- if you're not part of

19

the political community, then you don't fall under FOIA,

20

which is a peculiar statute, in that everybody who is

21

covered by it can get whatever they want, and they don't

22

have to give any reason for it.

23

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

Well, elections just

24

simply don't work if you -- if you allow noncitizens to

25

participate in elections or if you can't wall off the

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

State in that respect.

But what the State can't say is,

simply because one purpose of this law is that we want

3

to constitute ourselves as a political community, that

4

we can exclude activities that have a big commercial

5

effect.
And -- you know, when we're looking under

6
7

the Dormant Commerce Clause or under the Privileges and

8

Immunities Clause, this Court's cases have said

9

repeatedly you don't look to uncover the original

10

legislative purpose, you look to whether there is

11

discrimination, which there is here, on its face, and

12

you look to whether there is a discriminatory effect.
One example of how this policy is actually

13
14
15

being -
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And is the only thing that's

16

necessary -- excuse me -- is the only thing that's

17

necessary that the law affect a few people commercially?

18

I mean, how much -- how many of the requesters have to

19

be engaged in some kind of commercial activity in order

20

for your arguments to work?

21

MR. GUPTA:

Well, what this Court has said

22

is that there is no de minimis exception, if there's

23

discrimination against commerce, but, here, what's going

24

on is anything, but de minimis.

25

that the -- the vast majority of the requesters are

Virginia does not deny

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

commercial requesters -- the vast majority of

out-of-State

requesters are commercial requesters.
Their -- the amicus brief supporting their

3
4

side, the Local Government Attorneys of Virginia amicus

5

brief, at page 30, explains the way this policy -

6

policy is being implemented, is that noncommercial

7

requests are typically honored, but out-of-State

8

requests by data miners are being categorically denied

9

under the policy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

But this -- this is

11

not -- this is not a regulation of commerce.

12

State practice that may have an incidental effect on

13

commerce, and the incidental effect may be

14

disproportionate, depending upon whether you're State or

15

local, but it's not a regulation of commerce.
MR. GUPTA:

16

It's a

But that's -- that was the

17

Fourth Circuit's theory, and I think incidental can mean

18

a few different things, and I think in -- in their

19

opinion, it -- it does mean at least three different

20

things.

21

that.

22

So maybe it would be helpful if I try to unpack

If it means incidental in terms of the

23

effect on my client's business, I think, as I've

24

explained, it's anything, but incidental; it completely

25

forecloses him from the market.

If it means incidental

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in terms of the -- the aggregate effect of this statute,
again, it's not incidental because the vast majority

3

of -- of affected parties under this policy are

4

out-of-State commercial requesters, particularly data

5

companies.
And -- you know, if it means incidental

6
7

compared to the purpose of the statute, as I've said,

8

transparency was one purpose of the modern FOIA laws,

9

but they also subsumed and sit on top of all of the

10

longstanding rights of public access that have been

11

around since the -- the first settlements in the United

12

States -- or before the United States, when, in order to

13

have a functioning property system, we recognized that

14

you've got to have records of who owns what and -- and

15

those records have to be made available to anyone in

16

order to exercise property rights.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the State of

18

Virginia says, as a policy, we want to help Virginia

19

businesses, and so we're going to open a business

20

training, best practices institute, where you're going

21

to learn how to be a better business person, but the

22

only people who can come in are -- are Virginia

23

businesses.

24

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under your theory,

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

because that will have an effect -- an incidental effect
commerce in a way that's discriminatory, is -- is

3

that unconstitutional?

4

MR. GUPTA:

5

I don't think so.

And there are

a couple of distinctions.
First, that's not something that the State

6
7

exclusively is able to provide.

8

courthouse or the public archives across the street or

9

the road that runs between them that only the -- the

10

It's not like the

State is able to provide.
Anyone can provide a business training

11
12

institute, so the State is just one player among many.

13

Also -- running a
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

But that -- that just goes

15

to the extent of the impact, not -- not on the

16

principle.

17

there's no such thing as a de minimis exception.

And you say extent doesn't matter.

18

MR. GUPTA:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

You say

No -
So that -- that explanation

doesn't -- doesn't seem, to me, to hold water.
MR. GUPTA:

21

Well, maybe I didn't explain it

22

very well.

To be clear, I think it's more than just a

23

difference in degree; it's a difference in kind.

24

are fundamentally different when -- when you're talking

25

about running the courthouse or running the public

13

Alderson Reporting Company

These

on

Official

1
2

archives, nobody else can do that.

Nobody else

can collect -- you know, make

3

tax assessments, collect those records, and keep the

4

official public archive of those things.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

So what?

That -

So what?

Except

6

to the extent that that bears upon how much of a -- an

7

imposition this is upon interstate commerce.

8

to me, that's the only relevance of that point.
MR. GUPTA:

9

Well -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

And -- and you dismiss that

11

relevance.

12

impact is on -- on interstate commerce.

13

It seems,

You say it doesn't matter how extensive the

MR. GUPTA:

Well, to the extent that you -

14

you think it does matter, I mean, that -- that

15

distinction doesn't matter in this case because the

16

impact is -- is great.

17

impact on out-of-State commerce.

The principal impact is an

18

But let me -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

Is that -- when

you're talking about impact, is that a Pike analysis?
MR. GUPTA:

No.

I think this -- if you were

22

in -- in the dormant Commerce Clause, this would be the

23

per se rule of invalidity.

24

discrimination.

25

You have facial

The -- the -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I thought, if

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

it was facial discrimination, you're not concerned about
impact.

3

MR. GUPTA:

That's right.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's right.

I thought a question

5

of talking about the effects on interstate commerce,

6

that's the -- you know, the Pike analysis.

7

MR. GUPTA:

No.

What this Court has said is

8

that -- that the first -- sort of first-tier scrutiny,

9

the per se rule is -- is for cases where there's

10

discrimination on its face or discrimination in effect.

11

And then you've got this other category for the -- the

12

Pike analysis, where the State regulates evenhandedly.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's your closest case

14

in support of the proposition that this is impermissible

15

as a discrimination against interstate commerce?

16

your best case?

17
18
19

MR. GUPTA:

What's

When you say, "this," you mean

the -- that public records access is commerce?
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if you -- you are

20

arguing, as one of your arguments here, that this is

21

discriminatory as to -- as to interstate commerce, as I

22

understand your argument, what is the best case you have

23

to support your position?

24
25

MR. GUPTA:

What's the closest case?

Well, I think if you're -- if

you're -- if the question is about whether or not

15

Alderson Reporting Company

2

records access is commerce, there's Reno v. Condon this
Court's unanimous decision -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3
4

Well, my question is

what's the best case you have for your argument?
MR. GUPTA:

5

Well, I think -- you know, this

6

Court's unanimous decision in Reno v. Condon held that,

7

because people buy public records and sell them in

8

interstate commerce, that's, indisputably, interstate

9

commerce.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11

So we -

discrimination.

That wasn't a -

12

MR. GUPTA:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

But that wasn't a

That's right.
That's just -- that goes

to the question whether or not this is commerce.

15

MR. GUPTA:

That -- that's right.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what is your best

17

case to show that this is discriminatory in violation of

18

our precedence?
MR. GUPTA:

19

Well, Virginia doesn't deny that

20

there's discrimination on its face, so I take your

21

question to be asking -- you know, what about the

22

commerce aspect?

And in Reno v. Condon -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

Now -- if I have

24

to write the opinion, what case do I put down?

25

waiting.

16

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm

Official

MR. GUPTA:

1
2

Yeah, I mean, you -- okay.

So

you

can also look to Camps Newfound, which, I think -

3

you know, was much -- much more attenuated to commerce.

4

There, you had a generally applicable law, a property

5

tax law -
JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

If I only have time to read

one case -

8

MR. GUPTA:

Yeah.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

would you like me to read?

11

the question.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. GUPTA:

-- or possibly two, which
I think that's, basically,

Yeah.

I mean -- you know, look.

14

There's no case that's -- that's entirely on all fours,

15

but -

16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

But I assume you

don't want me -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. GUPTA:

That's why you're here.

So right.

So -- so -- okay.

So

21

the Camps Newfound case is -- is a case where you had a

22

generally applicable law.

23

It exempted -- you know, charities that served primarily

24

in-State residents.

25

It was a property tax law.

It was -- there is no evidence that the

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

State of Maine intended that to be a -- you know, a

2

discrimination against commerce and, obviously, swept

3

more broadly and affected both commerce and

4

non-commerce.

5

had facial discrimination against commerce because there

6

were people operating these summer camps, and they were

7

treated differently -
JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9

But this Court said that -- you know, you

I'll look at those.

But I

think the Commerce Clause, basically, has, as its

10

objective, insofar as it's dormant, to prevent a

11

legislature or decisionmaker within its State

12

discriminating in favor of their own State producers.

13

MR. GUPTA:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

Right.
Now, it's pretty hard for

me to put this case into that mold.
MR. GUPTA:

16

Well, I mean, one -- you know,

17

one piece of evidence, Justice Breyer, is the media

18

exception to the Virginia statute.

19

makes it clear that Virginia was aware that people who

20

were requesting information for commercial purposes were

21

going to use this statute and they exempted the press -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

though, isn't it?

25

It's just Virginia media,

Isn't it only media that -

MR. GUPTA:

24

It -- this -- this

6

with their purpose, that this statute is meant to assure

7

good, honest government in Virginia.

Well, if this is a statute, it's

a pretty unusual statute that discriminates among
newspapers, so it says -
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

If it does what the -- I

12

had exactly the same question for both parts of your

13

argument, that what it's their -- am I right in thinking

14

that anyone can get any information -- anyone in any

15

State can get any information that pertains to him or

16

her?

Is that right or not?

17

MR. GUPTA:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. GUPTA:

20

There is a separate Virginia -

Yes.

Is that right or not?
There is a

separate Virginia statute that allows this.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

to know, whether it's separate or not.

23

MR. GUPTA:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Okay.

That's what I wanted

That's right.
Anyone from Alaska to

Hawaii can get any information that pertains to him or

19

Alderson Reporting Company

into

Official

her.

Second, that this has nothing to do with

2

judicial records, there is a different statute that

3

makes judicial records public.

4

MR. GUPTA:

That's correct.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So we're, now,

6

talking about the class of information, other than the

7

two classes I've mentioned.

8
9

And I then ended up -- and I'd like you to
add something to this, if you can, that, really, this is

10

about -- since getting information involves usually a

11

benefit to the recipient, but, sometimes, harm to the

12

person the information is about, that willing to run

13

that harm and risk of harm is the interest in State good

14

government, okay?

15

MR. GUPTA:

Uh-huh.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, if that's the

17

interest, that's an interest that probably a State has

18

the right, just as it has the right to say other people

19

can't vote in State elections, if that's the interest,

20

then I guess it could take reasonable measures related

21

to that interest.

22
23
24

All right.

Now, that is the -- the argument

or the position that I would appreciate your addressing.
MR. GUPTA:

Sure.

You know, that -- we

25

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

don't deny that that's an interest that the State has,
then you have to see whether the -- the interest is

3

reasonably furthered by the statute.

And, here, you

4

have a resource that is not finite, and the statute

5

allows the State to recoup its expenses.
So nothing is lost to Virginians.

6

There

7

isn't any loss in transparency to Virginians by

8

extending access to out-of-State data companies.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

But if it costs for

10

Virginia -- Virginia has to take care of its own, and,

11

if it has to service FOIA requests from all over, it's

12

going to cost the State.

13

people to do this.

14

hours going through these records, so the State

15

doesn't -- it wants to conserve its resources for its

16

own people.

17

It's going to have to hire

They're going to have to spend many

MR. GUPTA:

But -- but there's no loss in

18

resources, Justice Ginsburg, because the statute allows

19

Virginia to fully recoup any administrative expenses.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they -- but they just

22

don't want out -- they -- they don't want outlanders

23

mucking around in -- in Virginia government.

24

perfectly okay for good old Virginians to do that, but

25

they don't want outlanders to do it.

21

Alderson Reporting Company

It's

Why -- why is that

but

Official

1
2

unreasonable?

MR. GUPTA:

Yeah.

That -- that is

certainly

3

their interest.

But you've got to see whether the

4

policy serves -- serves -- you know, the interest,

5

and -- and this is a statute that is supposed to promote

6

transparency.

It actually makes it less transparent.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Counsel, I'm -- I -

8

there is underlying your argument a sort of fundamental

9

belief that you are entitled to relief -- pardon the

10

alliteration -- simply because the statute discriminates

11

between citizens and noncitizens.

12

position?

13

MR. GUPTA:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is that your

No, not at all, I mean -
So if it's not, what are

15

the two rights that you -- or what rights are it that

16

you're claiming have been violated?

17

and immunities.

18

You say privileges

What's the privilege or immunity?

MR. GUPTA:

It's the privilege or immunity

19

of pursuing a common calling across State borders.

20

there's no dispute here that Mr. Hurlbert's common

21

calling is -- is gathering data.

principal users of public records laws.

GUPTA:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So this is an as-applied

challenge?
MR. GUPTA:

5

Yes.

So -- so it's an

6

as-applied challenge with respect to Mr. Hurlbert's

7

common calling.

8

that is his common calling and that this law has the

9

effect of completely cutting him off from pursuing his

There's no -- there's no dispute that

10

common calling in the Virginia market and that 47 other

11

States -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

Then you would be doing

13

something very strange with this statute because you

14

would be saying Hurlbert has a right to this because

15

it's his business.

16

this statute is it doesn't matter what you want the

17

information for.

But the statute, the character of

But you're saying the out-of -- the

18
19

in-Stater, it doesn't matter.

20

argument that, if this out-of-Stater has a good reason

21

for getting this and it's related to the out-of-State's

22

business, so you -- you're changing the character of a

23

FOIA statute, which is it doesn't matter what you want

24

it for.

25

MR.

That's right.

3
4

All right.

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

Out-of-Stater, is it your

I mean, you would -- you

23

know, we would -- we would ask that you rule that the

2

is unconstitutional, as applied to him, and then

3

Virginia would have the choice, if it has a -

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

statute

I -- I'm having a

5

problem, and then I think it's Justice Ginsburg's

6

problem, which is, absent the statute, he can't demand

7

that Virginia provide him with this information because

8

that's how he wants to work, correct?

9

So what's the added value that gives him a

10

right to demand it merely because a statute exists?

11

doesn't have a right to the information.

12

MR. GUPTA:

Well, he's -- all he's asking

13

for is information that's available in the public

14

archives on equal terms with Virginians.

15

way that -- that someone who -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the same

He -- he has a very

reasonable request in my view, but the question isn't

21

part is this:

22

tailored to the statute.

The question's -
And the -- the way -

It seems that the work is sort of

It's in this way.

I -- I have a job, and my

job is to study election processes.

They're truly amazing.

And I say

-- you know, it would help me a

3

lot if I was actually a voter in each of these States.

4

That would help my job.

5

I could learn things that I probably couldn't learn

6

otherwise.

7

It would lend authenticity, and

Now, does that add anything to the argument?

8

I mean, I don't think so, but it sounds a little bit

9

like you're making that kind of argument -

10

MR. GUPTA:

No.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and -- and they either

12

do have the right or they don't.

13

it helps that I -- that I say, well, I really want it

14

for my work.

15

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

And I don't know that

But this is -- this is a

16

profession that has existed since the founding era.

17

By the late 19th Century, you had an

So this isn't -- Mr. Hurlbert isn't someone

who's making up some profession.

He's part of a very

24

large industry that has done this for a very long time.

And that industry, yes, like lawyers depend on

on access to the public archives.
And -- you know, it's true that -- that now

you have these modern public records laws, but I -- I

5

think Virginia's argument would be the same if you were

6

just talking about can -- can they bar the doors to the

7

archives building?

Can they bar the doors to the

8

property records?

So there's no -- I don't see any

9

distinction in kind -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this -- is this

11

your Privileges and Immunities argument or your dormant

12

Commerce Clause argument?

13

depends

MR. GUPTA:

You know, I think the logic of

14

both arguments are similar, but I think it, most

15

clearly, is illustrated in the Privileges and Immunities

16

context where -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

enough that this is a big deal to your client.

19

to be something that is essential to hold the country

20

together as a national unit.

21

a bit of a stretch to say somebody gathering records

about commercial -- under FOIA fits that description.

The -- the information that Mr. Hurlbert

The

That -- that information is essential to

16

these activities.

And Virginia, virtually alone among

18

that market and reserving the right to access that

19

market to only people who live in the State.

20

And -- and -- you know, this would be no

21

different if it were just talking about the archives

that -- that include all the information that the -

23

yes, it's true that Virginia has exempted of the title

itself, but I don't see that the logic of their position

25

allows them to make that distinction.

27

Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, that's

and

Official

1
2

just a feature of their -- of their statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I -- I'm still trying to

3

tease out what your claim is.

Let's suppose Virginia

4

passes a statute that says, We'll let nonresidents have

5

access, but they have to pay all the costs.

6

Nonresidents don't.

7

Would that satisfy you as valid?

8

MR. GUPTA:

9

I think that would be a closer

question, but I think that presents some problems as

10

well.

11

the citizens of the State, but they're just passing the

12

cost on to out-of-Staters.

13

I mean, so, in your hypothetical, it's free to

And -- you know, this -- this Court, in

14

cases like Toomer and Mullaney, have said that at

15

least -- you know, where the State can show that the

16

nonresidents pose some unique evil, that the -- the

17

State is entitled to pass the costs on.

18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't it just -- you

just being costs them more?

20

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That was Justice

22

Ginsburg's point, which is every time you've put in a

23

request, you're costing them more money.

24
25

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

But -- but that would be

discriminating against non as -- noncitizens solely

28

Alderson Reporting Company

because they're noncitizens.

So, if there's some

particular

-
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, why?

costing them more.
MR. GUPTA:

Right.

Well, that's -- that's

6

precisely the rationale that -- that in

7

Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Barnard v.

8

Thorstenn, this Court rejected.

9

Islands wanted to say if we open up our bar to people

10

from all over the country, it's going to increase the

11

administrative resources.

12

that's not a good enough reason.

13

discriminating on the basis of citizenship.

This -- the Virgin

And this Court said, no,
That's just

14

But if, for example, the State could show

15

that there was -- you know, there were shipping costs

16

that were uniquely posed by nonresidents and they wanted

17

to assess a $5 shipping fee for all nonresidents, that

18

might be permissible.

19
20

And, if there are no further questions, I'd
like to reserve my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EARLE DUNCAN GETCHELL, JR.,

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. GETCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

please the Court:

The -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

I'm not sure how you

3

save administrative costs under this statute.

They

4

could go to any Virginia resident, it's not illegal, and

5

probably will, it'll cost them something more, but not

6

you, and get the very same information.
So how do you justify this discrimination?

7
8

Because it's so easily -- the administrative cost is

9

going to be imposed anyway.
MR. GETCHELL:

10

I would -- would suggest that

11

the purpose of the statute, which is political, not

12

commercial, left the State with the position that it was

13

going to subsidize with tax dollars this function

14

because we can't recover our overhead; we can over -

15

only recover the actual cost.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

So you want to give more

17

businesses to Virginia citizens who will now charge

18

out-of-State residents money to process their FOIA

19

requests?

20

MR. GETCHELL:

No, Your Honor.

I don't

21

think anybody was thinking about businesses of any sort.

22

I think they were saying that we have a political

23

hygiene statute.

They were very much the fad.

Alderson Reporting Company

It

I remember when

3

they were adopted.

Nobody thought they were commercial

nature.
And I do want to -- want to repel the notion

4

that there is even substantial discrimination in this

5

case because Mr. Hurlbert, in his admission that this is

6

an as-applied challenge, has a difficulty with

7

substantial equality of access, because it turns out

8

that Mr. Hurlbert, in his reply brief, when he teed up

9

the 1786 statute, which does give access -- did give

10
11

access, he focused his argument on that statute.
And if you run that statute, you will find

12

that between 1830 -- 1813 and 1840, that you did not

13

have general access.

They went back to having to show a

14

particular interest.

But that -- from 1840, '41 until

15

today, through the codes of 1819 and -- and up until the

16

present code, Section 17.1208, he has the right of

17

access to tax assessment records.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the -- if I

19

understood your answer to Justice Sotomayor, the only

20

reason you don't let out-of-Staters get these records is

21

because of the added overhead costs?

22

MR. GETCHELL:

No, Your Honor.

It's just

23

not part of the interests the State was trying to serve.

24

The State -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know.

But -- but -- so why don't you do it anyways?

2

as I asked your friend, it doesn't seem like that

Just --

3

big a deal.

It doesn't seem like that big a deal for

4

you either.

If you can recoup overhead costs from

5

people who request -- and I'd assume you would be able

6

to -- why don't other people -- people from West

7

Virginia may have interest in how Virginia government

8

operates, too.
And -- and, again, if -- what cost is there to

9
10

you, other than overhead?

11

Virginia government operates quiet from outsiders when

12

you let in -- its citizens get the access, do you?
MR. GETCHELL:

13

You don't want to keep how

The -- we are here to defend

14

the decisions of the two lower courts that apply

15

existing doctrine.

8

analysis.

generating the database, which is, by definition,

address these things.

argument.

22

of the points of your law, which is they can hire a

Or even for commercial

Don't you think if -- if those who created

10

these government in the sunshine laws could have drafted

11

them in such a way that inquiries for commercial

12

purposes would not be allowed, but only those inquiries

13

that are intended to look into the workings of State

14

government and produce government in the sunshine, don't

15

you think that they probably would have excluded

16

commercial inquiries, if they could?
But you can't tell which ones are commercial

17
18

and which aren't.
MR. GETCHELL:

19

And we don't -- and we don't

20

try.

21

very simple system that allows our citizens to make

22

inquiries without a demonstrated need or cause because

23

we want there to be sunshine.

24
25

We have a policy decision that we want to have a

complicated a system if you let out-of-Staters have

You say we want a simple system.

It's

going to

be the same system, whether you win or lose.
MR. GETCHELL:

The thing that is of -- of

4

great concern -- why do we care, why do we bother -- is

5

the principle that when a government is providing a

6

taxpayer-subsidized service of recent origin to its

7

citizens, that it does not have to explain its choice,

8

either under the Privileges and Immunities Clause or

9

under the Dormant Commerce Clause.

10

It is very important that we not find

11

ourselves with lawsuits that say, "services."

12

services are, in fact, things that, now, have to be

13

justified under those two provisions of the

14

Constitution.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Voluntary

Well, that -- that's where

16

he comes in with his argument because I -- I agree, you

17

can -- you don't have -- let's say the most fabulous

18

reason for doing this, but you have a reason.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so the question is,

21

does it have to be better than that?

And -- and they

22

are saying yes.

would characterize as a strong argument -- this sort of,

24

first of all, strikes me as a stronger argument, is

25

that, look, if we go back into history, out-of-State

And, as I heard it, this -- what I

real estate people could always get information about
property -- let's say they had a client who wanted to
buy it.
Now, you've protected that.

4

But, in today's

5

world, it's important that we get statistics about this,

6

too, because our economy is national.

7

how States are taxing their real estate, we will know to

8

what extent they increase the value, to what extent they

9

increase the rate, to what extent they really get the

10

money they are supposed to, to what extent they might

11

get money or not get money in the future.

If we understand

And all of those things are nationally

12
13

important, so that people can put them together and

14

make -- better than we have done in the past -

15

predictions about what is likely to happen to States

16

and, hence, the national economy.

All right.

That's -- that's the kind of argument he's

making.

interest in the flow of this information.

20

means you have to have a better than "uh-huh" kind of

rationale.

And that

That's -- that's what he's saying, I think.
MR. GETCHELL:

But it's very difficult for

23

Mr. Hurlbert to make that fairly expansive argument

24

because it turns out -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, to be fair, I -- I

37

Alderson Reporting Company

was sort of expanding it.

2

MR. GETCHELL:

(Laughter.)
But, in point of fact,

3

because he is entitled to the tax assessment data in the

4

clerk's office, in the case of Henrico County, where he

5

went, you go in the same building and -- if you're

6

Mr. Hurlbert, you turn in one direction, you go to the

7

clerk's office.
And, if somebody in Virginia and wants to -

8
9

for whatever reason, get it from the tax assessor's

10

book, instead of from the clerk's book, you turn in the

11

other direction.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

But you don't deny that, in

13

general, this does affect out-of-State data collectors,

14

people who are engaged in the kind of business that

15

Justice Breyer was talking about, is that right?
MR. GETCHELL:

summary judgment, and the district court and the court of

19

appeals, both in our judgment, correctly ruled that

14

to rewrite the statute to -- subject to -- it to attack,

15

obviously, that would then raise questions about a

16

nongovernmental protectionist intent, but that's not the

It -- it has nothing to do with commerce.

question I'm -- I'm raising the best argument for your

adversary, okay?

MR. GETCHELL:

Right.

You say it's indirect.

How do

draw the line between direct and indirect, when the

3

bottom-line consequence is the same?

4

MR. GETCHELL:

I would -- I would have about

5

three answers to that.

that we don't trigger the dormant Commerce Clause

inquiry, even if it has an indirect effect on commerce.

Whereas, here, we have a statute that has a

solely political intent, the fact that -- that now that

the amici want to tell us about this great burgeoning

14

enterprise, they -- they want the Court to take that

15

into account.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you -- are you telling

17

us that there is simply no commercial consequences to

this statute at all, that Virginians find this to be of

no commercial value, in any instance?

come forward with the information, but we interpret

to this information.

MR. GETCHELL:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. GETCHELL:

It's not just political.

On this -- on this record -

on this record, the position that was accepted by the

10

two courts below, entirely in accordance with this

notice that there is.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think the thing, General,

20

that I was trying to get at, it seems to me you have a

21

very good case that these statutes were -- were meant

for a different purpose.

though your friends there have a good case that these

MR. GETCHELL:

7

If -- if we were going to

8

say, if you were going to say that -- that this is an

9

inquiry that needs to be made under the Commerce Clause,

10

this would be a particularly poor vehicle for doing it

11

because the Fourth Circuit held that the Pike analysis

12

of the district court was not appealed, and, therefore,

13

this case could not be sent back on remand to develop a

14

burden analysis of a record -

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GETCHELL:

1
2

Well, there's -- there's

discrimination, only in the sense that we discriminate

3

against people who we don't let vote because they don't

4

live in the Commonwealth as well.

5

6

and -

7

I mean, we -- this

It's a legitimate function

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you could say the

8

same thing, we don't discriminate against Californians

9

who want to come and pack their melons in Arizona.

10

MR. GETCHELL:

Well, I would say that -

11

that whether or not somebody can deal with an item in

12

commerce is -- is -- raises Commerce Clause questions.

13

And just, like in Reno v. Condon, where the State of

14

South Carolina was choosing to take its records and sell

15

them into the stream of commerce, there, the Court held

16

that -- that they thereby became a thing in commerce.

17

The records of the tax assessor of the

18

County of Henrico, which are available through the

19

clerk's office to Mr. Hurlbert, are not things or

20

persons in commerce, nor are they -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -- it would surprise me

22

if an out-of-State investor, who was thinking of putting

23

a large plant in Virginia, had absolutely no interest in

24

Virginia's tax policies.

25

MR. GETCHELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

There has

So -- so suppose -- I mean,

6

I think they have an argument, saying, of course, this

7

information would be useful for gathering national

8

statistics and helping the national economy.

9

that's true.

I think

10

On the other hand, you say, well, but, look,

11

there must be something left that the States can reserve

12

to their own citizens, there must be something.

They

13

can't protect their own commerce; that's clear.

They

14

can't discriminate against people who want to come here

15

and live here.

That's clear.

They can't do this and that and the other

16
17

thing, but, gee, there must be something.

18

they reserve at least their -- their beaches for their

No.

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the standard,

8

because you know the -- the Privileges and Immunities

9

10

few cases on it.

11

to -- to resolve that -- that tension because there is a

12

tension.

13

And so what -- how would you tell me

MR. GETCHELL:

I -- I think there that -

14

that the important policy issue in this case for us is

15

precisely as you articulated.

16

residual sovereign power in the State to act, and we

17

have to violate the Constitution, clearly, before we

18

lose that authority.

19

There -- there is

And, under existing privileges and

20

immunities doctrine, the privileges and immunities

21

are -- are few; they are -- they have been enumerated in

22

the courts, they are similar in character, having to do

23

with commerce, not governmental action.

24

you would not extend privileges and immunities.

6

MR. GETCHELL:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Tell us, under our

11

jurisprudence -- the dormant Common Commerce

12

jurisprudence -- and I have some colleagues who don't -- who

13

don't believe it should exist.

14

Why is this not a dormant Commerce Clause case?
MR. GETCHELL:

15

Take that argument out.

Because it is not an exercise

16

of the State police power to regulate commerce.

17

documents in the -- in the tax assessor's office of the

18

County of Henrico are not things or persons in commerce,

19

nor are they channels or instrumentalities of commerce.

20

They are just the records of the sovereign, which we

21

will allow our citizens to obtain.

think this argument has been developed from our

standpoint.
