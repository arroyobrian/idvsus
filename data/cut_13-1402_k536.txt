 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 131402, Kerry, 

5

Secretary of State, v. Fauzia Din. 

6

 Mr. Kneedler.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 

8

11

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 This Court has repeatedly held that the 

12

power to exclude aliens is inherent in sovereignty and 

13

necessary to defending the nation against encroachments 

14

and dangers.  It is a power exercised by the political 

15

branches of government. 

16

 Respondent's husband was denied a visa by a 

17

consular officer because he was found to be inadmissible 

18

under the terrorism provisions of the Immigration and 

19

Nationality Act.  It is firmly established that as an 

20

alien outside the United States, he had no right under 

21

the INA or the Constitution to seek judicial review of 

22

that determination or for a greater explanation of the 

23

grounds given. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could I ask you a 

question?  Assume the following hypothetical.  You had

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a erroneous name, meaning  or there's a duplicate 

2

name, a terrorist and a non  and a nonterrorist 

3

alien.  What you're telling us is that there's no remedy 

4

whatsoever for the alien to come in and try to show 

5

someone that he's not the guy who's the terrorist. 

6

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

At least two responses to 

7

that point.  First of all, no one is excluded under the 

8

terrorism provisions of the Act because their name 

9

appears in a database.  The databases are assembled as 

10

basically raising flags that might warrant further 

11

inquiry.  I'm informed by the State Department, and as 

12

we say on page 49 of our brief,  in any case in 

13

which an alien is going to be denied entry under the 

14

terrorism provisions, there is a request to the State 

15

Department in Washington for a security advisory 

16

opinion, which entails sending out notice to interested 

17

agencies who may have intelligence about the individual 

18

and report it back to the State Department for an 

19

advisory opinion. 

20

 And so it will not 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I asked  I have a real 

22

problem, which is that's what we were told after 

23

September 11th, and we have evidence that people were 

24

kept for months and months and months, and some were 

25

released after there was further probing by the courts,

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and it was determined that people had been erroneously 

2

identified. 

3

 So I'm not challenging good faith, but I'm 

4

just questioning how someone caught up in an 

5

administrative nightmare  you're suggesting that the 

6

wife has absolutely no interest in  in  in her 

7

marriage in not having the government arbitrarily keep 

8

her spouse out. 

9

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

She obviously has an 

10

interest, but  but she is affected only indirectly by 

11

the denial of the visa to her husband.  That 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, it  it would seem 

13

to me that you're fighting the hypothetical  you've 

14

basically said, well, that's not going to happen. 

15

Suppose it happened.  There are two Mr. Smiths, or 

16

whatever the foreign name is, and they just get the 

17

wrong one.  It seems to me your position is that the 

18

alien has no standing, period. 

19

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

The  it  I think it's 

20

clear under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, 

21

which is one subset of the recognition of Congress' 

22

broad power over the exclusion of aliens, which includes 

23

conferring the power on executive officers.  The Court 

24

has said 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the consular, you

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

have denied 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And then we can  and 

3

then we get to the question of whether  of whether or 

4

not the wife, in this case, has at least a minimum right 

5

to make sure that the identification is correct.  And 

6

you say as to that? 

7

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

There is no  there is no 

8

right of judicial review because the consular  the 

9

doctrine of consular nonreviewability applies equally to 

10

her.  In fact, it would be quite  it would be a 

11

license for circumvention of that doctrine to allow 

12

judicial review 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is there  is there 

14

no  is there no exception to the consular 

15

nonreviewability doctrine?  That is, assuming people 

16

make mistakes, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, 

17

bureaucrats  some consulates  consuls have been 

18

known to have a bureaucratic mentality and some may act 

19

for improper reasons.  But you are sticking to the 

20

position that consular of determinations are not subject 

21

to judicial review under  any  any and all 

22

circumstances, no exceptions? 

23

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

That  that is  that is 

24

our position with respect to a consular officer having a 

25

bureaucratic point of view.  I should point out that a

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

visa is not denied on a way that can't be corrected by 

2

additional evidence without it being approved by  by a 

3

supervisor to the consular officer.  So it's not 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, it's your position 

5

that the government could basically say to a wife in the 

6

United States, you have no rights whatsoever to 

7

challenge the arbitrary  or a statement by the 

8

government.  We believe your husband is a terrorist. 

9

You can't stay with him. 

10

 Only the husband could challenge them? 

11

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

12

Someone in the United States 

or 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Yes. 
In the United States, it 

15

would be different, although it would not confer rights 

16

on her but the  but the husband 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Ah, so you're saying in 

18

that situation marriage has  gives her no rights to 

19

say, you're interfering with my marriage by arbitrarily 

20

keeping my husband.  Not talking if he's arrested or if 

21

he's  but do  you're just saying 

22

 MR. KNEEDLER: I think that  Well, the 

23

husband would have  what  whatever  whatever action 

24

the government took against the husband, if he was in the 

25

United States, he would have his own due process rights.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

This would be 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I suppose the wife would 

3

have standing to appeal a wrongful conviction of her 

4

husband, right? 

5

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

6

to make.  And in fact 

7

That is the point I was going 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And in a regular criminal 

8

case, and he doesn't want to appeal, and she says, oh, 

9

I'm going to be deprived of my husband, so she has a 

10
11

right to appeal.  Is that  is that the law? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

It  it's not the law.  And 

12

in fact, the Court made exactly that point in the 

13

O'Bannon case that we cite in our briefs.  It 

14

O'Bannon arose in a different context, but the Court, in 

15

announcing its rule that someone indirectly affected is 

16

not deprived of liberties, used that very example. 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I understand  excuse me. 

18

I understand the O'Bannon case.  I think it's in point 

19

for you. 

20

 The Mandel case, you say in your brief in 

21

pages 38, 39, and 40 that the Court in Mandel simply 

22

assumed there was that right.  I  I'm not sure that's 

23

a fair reading of Justice Blackmun's opinion.  He says 

24

recognition that First Amendment rights are implicated, 

25

however, is nondispositive.  Then he goes on to find no

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

relief. 
 But I read that case as saying the 

3

professors had standing.  You don't  you don't read 

4

that? 

5

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

We're not saying they didn't 

6

have standing to make a First Amendment claim.  They did 

7

and  and we didn't argue  or aren't arguing here 

8

that she doesn't have a right to go to court to make her 

9

constitutional claim.  We're just saying it fails on the 

10

merits.  She  I  I don't think it can seriously be 

11

contended that it would be unconstitutional. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You  you  you say that 

13

she has the  the right to contest the denial of the 

14

visa. 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

No.  No, we don't.  All I'm 

16

saying  all I'm saying is she's entitled to come into 

17

court to make the argument that she's making here. 

18

 We think her argument loses, and therefore, 

19

she has no right to challenge to have the Court review 

20

the consular's denial  consul's denial of the visa 

21

abroad. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, you always have the 

23

right to come into court to  to say that you think 

24

you have  have a right to contest, and the court says 

25

you don't, and you throw it out.

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Right.  No.  But  but  I 

think 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that's not  I don't 

think that's the way you can read Mandel. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, I think  I think the 

6

predicate discussion of the First Amendment there was 

7

the government was arguing there's no  there's no real 

8

First Amendment problem just on First Amendment terms 

9

because you could always hear the same information by 

10

reading a book or  or the telephone or something like 

11

that, and the Court said the First Amendment interest 

12

looking at First Amendment interest doesn't disappear in 

13

 in that situation. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose I read the Mandel 

15

case to say that the professors have a right to contest 

16

the denial of the visa.  Suppose I read it that way. 

17

And then the Court at the end of the day says the visa 

18

was properly denied.  They lose on the merit, but they 

19

have the right to contest.  They have a right for a 

20

reason  to a reason.  How is that different from this 

21

case if I read it that way? 

22

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

First of all 
Then it  then it seems 

24

to me that the wife here has the right to demand a 

25

reason.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

First of all, Mandel involved 

2

the  a decision on the waiver, not on  not a 

3

decision by a consular officer abroad to deny a visa, 

4

which  which is really right at the teeth of the 

5

consular 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I don't see why that doesn't 

7

cut the other way, Mr. Kneedler.  You make this argument 

8

several times in your briefs.  But I would think that 

9

review would be at its nadir in the waiver authority 

10

because there, enormous amount of discretion is given to 

11

the executive official.  Whereas with respect to 

12

consular decisions over visas, Congress has set out 

13

clear rules for what those consular officials are 

14

supposed to be doing.  And it seems to me that the 

15

reason for review in that context where you're trying to 

16

figure out whether the consular official has, in fact, 

17

accorded with the congressional determination of who's 

18

entitled and who's not to a visa would be all the more 

19

important. 

20

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, I don't disagree  we 

21

don't think there should be review in  in either case. 

22

I think part of what might have been motivating the 

23

court in Mandel was that the discretionary denial of the 

24

waiver might have been based on the characteristics of 

25

the U.S. citizen seeking it.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 There can't be any claim like that here. 

2

This  this  the terrorism grounds go entirely to 

3

the  for a visa denial  go entirely to the 

4

characteristics of the alien abroad.  But beyond 

5

beyond that, what you're describing is the very thing 

6

that the doctrine of consular nonreviewability is 

7

designed to prohibit judicial review of. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So is it no matter what? 

Is that  I mean, a woman is married  an American 

10

woman is married to a foreign  foreign person, asks 

11

for a visa.  She has undeniable proof, the most  any 

12

proof you want that the reason it was denied is because 

13

the consular official believes that husbands and wives 

14

should live separately, or for racial reasons, or for 

15

First Amendment reasons.  Undeniable proof. 

16

 Is your position that it doesn't matter if 

17

they decide that  the consulate  that husbands and 

18

wives cannot live together, there is no review?  Is that 

19

your position? 

20

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

21

no judicial review. 

22

Our position is that there is 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Are you saying  I want a 

23

clear answer to my question because what I'm trying to 

24

do, obviously, is make the most far out case I can think 

25

of, and  and I want to know if the Government of the

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

United States thinks that if it is the policy even of 

2

the  of the consulars of the United States that 

3

husbands and wives must live separately, there is no 

4

judicial review no matter what?

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16

Well 
Is that the position or is 

it not? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

That is  that would be our 

position. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Now, if that is 

your 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let me give you an equally 

absurd hypothetical.  Okay? 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, I don't know if mine is 

so absurd. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Wait.  No, no, no, no.  I'm 

17

saying the  the feeling that the law can't be that. 

18

Assuming the man is not married and there is no wife who 

19

comes in and can make these points.  But assume, 

20

likewise, there is incontrovertible evidence that he was 

21

denied admission because of his race or because of some 

22

First Amendment statement he had made or for whatever 

23

other reasons Justice Breyer wants to bring forward. 

24

Your position would be  right  too bad. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not worried about that

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case. 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What? 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm worried about that case 

4

where there is an American citizen who is married and 

5

that the decision of the consular official will prevent 

6

her no matter how ridiculous, and take all of Justice 

7

Scalia's points to make it ridiculous as you want, but 

8

the result of this is that an American citizen either 

9

must live separately from her spouse forever or must 

10

give up her right as an American to live in her native 

11

land.  Now, that seems to me to be the government's 

12

position, and I just want to be assured that it is. 

13

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

That is our position.  Let 

14

let me just say one thing. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think he knew that. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No.  I didn't actually. 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

If I may  if I may add one 

19

point here.  There is no claim that the ground for the 

20

denial of the visa is itself unconstitutional.  The 

21

ground that was given here was that he had engaged in 

22

terrorist activities.  There can't be any serious claim 

23

that it  that it's permissible to exclude someone for 

24

engaging in terrorist activities. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, terrorist activities

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 are defined in this statute to include such things as, 

2

 let's say, you're in a  a particular country where 

3

 this could happen.  You decide to keep overnight at your 

4

 house and let him stay two people who sometimes go out 

5

 and solicit funds for any one of the 40 organizations on 

6

 the list.  You've given material aid to two or more 

7

 people, organized or not, who, in fact, themselves 

8

 solicit funds for one of these 40 organizations. 

9
10

 Now, that isn't much, and there are about 
 100 other words here or 200 words that seem 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Enough for me. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I'm just saying it 

13

 isn't obvious to me that you can tell  now deprive a 

14

 person of even telling him what the reason is for saying 

15

 he falls within this section. 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, on that  on that 

17

 point, now, first Shaughnessy and Musai are controlling. 

18

 In those situations, aliens who had even reached our 

19

 borders were  were denied entry on the basis of 

20

 confidential information that was deemed necessary for 

21

 the security of the United States.  A fortiori here 

22

 where the aliens are outside the  where the alien is 

23

 outside the United States now requires the conclusion 

24

 that  that neither he nor his wife is entitled to a 

25

 greater explanation than the  than the executive officer 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 believes is appropriate 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I come back to  can I 

3

 come back to Justice Breyer's earlier hypothetical. 

4

 Suppose there were a case where there is 

5

 incontrovertible proof that the consular officer denied 

6

 the visa for some incredible ground based on racism or 

7

 belief that husbands and wives shouldn't live together. 

8

 Suppose there's a  a tape  a video recording or 

9

 audio recording of the consular officer saying this is 

10

 what I believe, and this is what I do when I pass on 

11

 these visas. 

12

 Would there be no administrative avenue of 

13

 relief if that information was submitted to the State 

14

 Department?  Would there be no opportunity to  to get 

15

 a correction of the visa denial in that way? 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Of course there would.  And 

17

 that's  and that is what  that is what Congress 

18

 decided in 1952 by not establishing a centralized review 

19

 of all visas which could lead to judicial review, which 

20

 is what Congress was specifically concerned about. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How can you get that relief 

 if you don't tell the person what the reason is? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

It won't be denied.  The 

24

 visa  as I said, the visa will not be denied under 42 

25

 C.F.R. 

I mean, 22 C.F.R. 4261 unless it is reviewed 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 by a superior.  So one individual consular officer's

2

 approach to a case is not going to be sustained, it 

3

 will be reviewed by someone else. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that can't be.  That 

5

 process can't be initiated by the relative.  That's an 

6

 internal  you have described an internal check.  But 

7

 as in this case, the wife, she won't know whether that 

8

 check has gone. 

9

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well, as Justice Alito  I 

10

 think we have to assume the regularity that the 

11

 supervising consular officer would be asked. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can the person  the 

13

 relative who's claiming preferential status  can she 

14

 initiate such a review?  She can't.  It's entirely 

15

 internal. 

16

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

She has no  she has no 

17

 there's no procedure that gives her an entitlement, and 

18

 properly so because it's not about her, it's about him. 

19

 But she could certainly bring the information to the 

20

 attention of the State Department.  And, in fact, in 

21

 this case, she brought  brought it to the attention of 

22

 her representative in Congress, who, in turn, inquired 

23

 to the State Department about it. She could have 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And was given  given 

 the same  the  her representative was given the same 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 answer, citing the statute and saying we  we don't

2

 disclose any particulars. 

3

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Right, but that  but that's 

4

 the system Congress set up.  Congress specifically said 

5

 when it enacted this provision in 1996, it concluded 

6

 that the executive should be entitled to withhold the 

7

 grounds of the basis for denying a visa if that would 

8

 adversely impact the national security and.  That 

9

 descends directly from Knauff

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Kneedler 
 and Musai . 
If Mandel did control 

13

 this case, what argument would you make  or could you 

14

 make an argument that you  that you met the Mandel 

15

 standard?  And as I understood the Mandel standard, it 

16

 wasn't that high.  It was you have to provide a facially 

17

 legitimate and bona fide reason for your decision. 

18

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Okay.  If I could  if I 

19

 could make two points with respect to Mandel 

20

 controlling.  The Court specifically said in Mandel that 

21

 it was leaving open the question of whether there would be 

22

 judicial review if the attorney general had not offered 

23

 any explanation at all.  It  it concluded that the 

24

 explanation that appeared in the record was sufficient 

25

 if any  if any explanation at all was required, but it 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 did not hold that it was necessary.
 So if this case is controlled by Mandel, 

3

 we're in exactly the same position.  There is no 

4

 precedent of this Court saying that an explanation to 

5

 people in the U.S. is required.  It was just found to be 

6

 sufficient in that case. 

7

 Now, applying that test, we think that the 

8

 reason given here plainly satisfies the facially 

9

 legitimate standard.  What the consular officer did was 

10

 cite the statutory provision under which he was found to 

11

 be inadmissible.  Citing the statute is, by definition, 

12

 facially legitimate because it is the  it is the 

13

 standard that  that the consular officer is intended 

14

 to apply.  So even if we get that part out 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, do you have to  I 

16

 mean, what's the level of generality or specificity that 

17

 you have to cite?  Suppose they just said, well, you 

18

 know, this was done under 1182.  Would that be 

19

 sufficient? 

20
21
22
23
24
25

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

As a constitutional matter, 

 we think it would be sufficient, yes.  And again 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

We did this under the INA. 

 Is that facially legitimate? 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Yes.  I  I  I think it 

 is, but here we have something that 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So really, it's a reason

2

 that's not a reason at all.  At some point, I mean, 

3

 that's nice, you did it under the INA.  And that counts 

4

 as facially legitimate? 

5

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

6
7

But  but here we have the 

 specific paragraph dealing with terrorism. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It isn't  this is  this 

8

 is actually a serious point ; I didn't mean it 

9

 facetiously.  And go ba 

10

ck to Justice Alito's point, 

11

 which I think was quite a good point, frankly.  The 

12

 the statute that you're talking about labeled terrorist 

13

 activities is printed in your appendix from pages 7A to 

14

 pages 14A.  It covers everything from a person who is a 

15

 member of an organization that's about to throw a bomb 

16

 to somebody who says, as I said, once, has two members 

17

 of some organization or different organizations sleep on 

18

 his floor knowing that they solicit funds on other 

19

 occasions for these people, the bad ones. 

20

 Now, he just wants to know what 

21

 subprovision they're using because he wants to say, as 

22

 sometimes happens, to others in the State Department 

23

 your consulate over here in X city gets a little carried 

24

 away.  They're overly riskaverse.  They're interpreting 

25

 one of these hundreds of words in a way that's really 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 wrong. 
 Now, all he needs to know is what subsection

3

 under this 7page section is at issue so he can make the 

4

 internal appeal that Justice Alito has described.  Why 

5

 not? 

6

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8
9
10

I mean, that 
Does this fellow have a 

 wife?  Does this fellow have a wife or is this 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Yes. 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, it's the wife that's 

11

 that's making the claim. 

12

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I  I  I want to  I want 

13

 to make one thing very clear again with respect to 

14

 exclusions under paragraph (b), it is not done by the 

15

 consular officer alone.  No one can be excluded under 

16

 subparagraph (b) on terrorism activities without a 

17

 reference to the State Department for a special  or a 

18

 security advisory opinion.  And that review, since at 

19

 least 2010, has included review by a lawyer.  So this is 

20

 not some  a situation that could be decided by a rogue 

21

 consular officer in  in the field. 

22

 But what you 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr.  Mr. Kneedler, 

24

 could you give us an idea, before you conclude, about 

25

 what has been the consequence of a decision?  The Ninth 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Circuit in this Bustamante case  that was 2008  what 

2

 has happened in the Ninth Circuit between 2008 and 2014

3

 with respect to these relative applications?  How have 

4

 they fared? 

5

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

There  there have been 

6

 there have been a number that  that have arisen. 

7

 There's the Ibrahim case that was  that  that is 

8

 cited in the papers.  There's  there's a case called 

9

 Goltra, which I think involves extending Din to a 

10

 father.  There  there are other cases which  which 

11

 involve children, as I recall. 

12

 But if this Court were to hold that  that 

13

 a family member has a right to insert herself into 

14

 removal  or into proceedings involving an entirely 

15

 independent human being responsible for his own conduct, 

16

 then I think we could anticipate a number of cases 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But in the cases that we 

18

 have, you cited extending it to a child, but have any of 

19

 them held that the government failed to show a facially 

20

 legitimate bona fide reason? 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

The Ibrahim case required the 

22

 specification of a particular subsection based on Din, 

23

 said that there had to be a particular subsection of 

24

 (b). 

25

 And again, I want to step  I want to step 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 back.  In Knauff v. Shaughnessy and Musai, the Court 

2

 held that someone could be excluded simply by the

3

 attorney general saying there's confidential information 

4

 and there is no right to a hearing.  There is no 

5

 there was no suggestion there that  that the 

6

 government was required to at least be somewhat specific 

7

 in telling the person the basis for his removal. 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you  do you think 

9

 that in the instance, suppose that Justice Breyer asked 

10

 this particular subsection has to be cited, that if the 

11

 consular were to cite that, this might give some 

12

 indication as to our intelligencegathering capability 

13

 and the information that we have? 

14

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Absolutely.  That's  that's 

15

 the very reason why Congress said that it's not 

16

 necessary to give the particular subsection, or frankly, 

17

 to cite paragraph (b) at all.  It could just be under 

18

 1182(a). 

19

 And then in here 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21
22

But why not?  If there 

 is 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Whatever  whatever 

23

 interests the wife has in this situation, they are 

24

 derivative and indirect, even if this Court is going to 

25

 credit them with some force here.  They are derivative 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 and indirect as weighed against the powerful interests 

2

 of the United States in protecting its borders, which is

3

 a core aspect of sovereignty, protecting against 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course.  So  so in the 

5

 situation that Justice Kennedy just mentioned where 

6

 there's even a risk of harm to some 

7

 intelligencegathering or other national security 

8

 interest, can't the government come to the judge and say 

9

 just that?  And aren't there methods by which you can 

10

 allow a judge, even in camera if necessary 

11

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The case should 
 to review  to review a 

13

 matter where there is a national security interest at 

14

 stake. 

15

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

It is exceedingly rare for 

16

 the government to be put in a position where it has to 

17

 submit classified information to a court.  There are 

18

 situations that arise in a domestic 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Courts are very good at 

20

 this stuff, aren't they? 

21

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23
24
25

Well, as 
At assessing the  the 

 level of danger to  to operatives. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

This Court has said that 

 that they're not and  and in situations  in 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 situations in the domestic context, it may be necessary 

2

 to allow for some consideration of classified

3

 information because the person involved has due process 

4

 rights and  and can insist on some information. 

5

 Here we're in a situation where the person 

6

 directly affected, the person involved, an alien abroad, 

7

 has no rights of his own to know what the basis for the 

8

 government's action is. 

9
10
11

 I'd like to reserve the balance of my time. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, 

 Mr. Kneedler.

 Mr. Haddad. 

13

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK E. HADDAD 

14
15
16
17

 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 
 MR. HADDAD: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court: 
 There was substantial discussion of the 

18

 doctrine of consular nonreviewability thus far, but one 

19

 point that did not emerge is that this Court has never 

20

 articulated the doctrine in the way the government has 

21

 presented it today.  This Court has never said that the 

22

 decisions of a group, a large group of officials of the 

23

 Executive Branch are somehow immune from judicial review 

24

 in every instance because they are the decisions of 

25

 certain officials, consular officers in this case.  And 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 the record is 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What would the basis be,

3

 the Administrative Procedure Act?  It  it has a 

4

 provision exempting from review action committed to 

5

 agency discretion by law.  And I think what the 

6

 government is arguing is that this  you know, this law 

7

 commits this stuff to the discretion of the consular 

8

 officials and the State Department. 

9

 MR. HADDAD: 

I don't think the APA would get 

10

 the government where it needs to go in this case, 

11

 Justice Scalia, because ours is a constitutional claim. 

12

 It's not raised under the APA.  And as came out earlier 

13

 in the discussion, as Justice Kagan pointed out, unlike 

14

 the situation in Mandel, where all the Attorney General 

15

 was doing was implementing a statute that gave him, 

16

 quote/unquote, "discretion" to weigh the denial of a 

17

 visa, here we have an extensive statutory set of 

18

 exclusions, and the government has acknowledged in its 

19

 reply brief that it does not view its consular officers 

20

 as having discretion in how they apply and implement the 

21

 specific terms that Congress has set forward. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But to get to your 

23

 constitutional claim, explain to me the difference 

24

 between the marital basis in this case and, say, a 

25

 parental basis.  I mean, if the individual here was a 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 child, would the parent in the United States have the 

2

 same rights as the spouse?

3

 MR. HADDAD: 

If the U.S. citizen parent were 

4

 trying to get an immigration visa for his or her son or 

5

 daughter, yes, in our understanding of the liberty 

6

 interest that this Court has 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  So it's 

8

 spouses.  It's parents.  I suppose it's children as 

9

 well, right?  If the parent is  is the one who's being 

10

 denied access, a child in the United States to be able 

11

 to get 

12

 MR. HADDAD: 

Certainly a minor child, Your 

13

 Honor, yes.  If the Court looks to the grounding cases 

14

 that we cite, the Meyer case, the Pierce case, Griswold, 

15

 the cases the Court is very familiar with, those cases 

16

 involve the right to marriage and to raise a family. 

17
18
19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Brother  a brother 

 and sister? 
 MR. HADDAD: 

Brother and sister is  I 

20

 think the Court would look at, in all likelihood, for 

21

 the constitutional right, would look at whether the 

22

 brother and sister were part of a family unit that would 

23

 be living together.  That seems to be an important value 

24

 that the Court looks at. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about someone who 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 wanted to marry the immigrant?  Not yet married, but say 

2

 you're depriving me of marital bliss.  I want to marry

3

 this person, and I can't do it.  Would that be enough? 

4

 MR. HADDAD: 

I  I don't know that that 

5

 would be enough, Your Honor.  But certainly in this 

6

 case, where the United States has recognized that the 

7

 respondent has a valid marriage and there's no question 

8

 at all about the validity of the marriage, we are in the 

9

 heartland of what this Court has recognized is an 

10

 important constitutional right. 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 MR. HADDAD: 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Haddad 
Yes. 
 can  can I ask you how 

14

 exactly this case become this kind of constitutional 

15

 case?  Because I had thought that originally this case 

16

 was brought as an APA challenge, and that it was kind of 

17

 converted into this constitutional claim by the Ninth 

18

 Circuit.  Is  is that an incorrect understanding? 

19

 MR. HADDAD: 

I wouldn't describe it that 

20

 way, Justice Kagan.  The complaint had three causes of 

21

 action.  The third was an APA cause of action, but the 

22

 first two were not.  And at the time the case was 

23

 brought, the Bustamante decision had been decided by the 

24

 Ninth Circuit, and so there was a basis for bringing the 

25

 constitutional claims, as well as the APA claim.  And, 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 indeed, it was the constitutional claim that we pressed 

2

 in the Ninth Circuit.

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can you explain how we 

4

 get to the constitutional claim that she has a right to 

5

 live in the United States with her husband?  She has a 

6

 right by statute to put him at the top of the queue, 

7

 right?  She  she  before he can apply, she has to 

8

 get him the preferential status, right? 

9

 MR. HADDAD: 

That's correct as a matter of 

10

 statutory law, Justice Ginsburg.  But our claim is not 

11

 that her right arises from the statute and from the 

12

 rights conferred by statute.  Our argument is that her 

13

 rights arise as a constitutional matter from her 

14

 marriage. 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So we have  so she 

16

 has  she has marriage, and you rely on that the right 

17

 to marry includes the right to live with one's spouse. 

18

 What do you do with Turner against Safley?  The Court 

19

 held that the prisoner had a right to marry, but 

20

 certainly not a right to live with his spouse. 

21

 MR. HADDAD: 

We believe we're right on point 

22

 and consistent with Turner, because as we describe the 

23

 right, it's not the right of entry, of having her 

24

 husband admitted, any more than a petitioner in Turner's 

25

 circumstance could say, I have a right to have my 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 husband released from prison. 
 All we're saying is, there's a liberty

3

 interest in not being arbitrarily denied the opportunity 

4

 to live with your spouse through the erroneous 

5

 application or interpretation of law by an executive 

6

 decision. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well  well, it's 
If it 
 it's odd to presume 

10

 that there's a fundamental right and then say, well, all 

11

 we're saying is that it can't be arbitrary.  It's 

12

 you  you can't measure arbitrariness until you first 

13

 define the right.  You just want us to skip over that 

14

 critical step. 

15

 MR. HADDAD: 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17
18

Well, then, I 
It seems to me you're 

 reasoning backwards. 
 MR. HADDAD: 

Well, let me try to address it, 

19

 then, Justice Kennedy, so that I don't skip that step. 

20

 As we've laid out in our brief, there is a right that we 

21

 believe is inherent in the right to marry and to raise a 

22

 family, which this Court has recognized.  Inherent in 

23

 that right, for that right to have meaning, it 

24

 presupposes that the husband and wife can live together. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It would be 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 unconstitutional, then, for Congress to eliminate the 

2

 provisions of the current immigrations law which says

3

 that if  if the wife or the husband is in this 

4

 country, the spouse can come in.  It would be 

5

 unconstitutional for Congress to say we  we have 

6

 immigration quotas for certain countries for certain 

7

 things, and whether you have a husband or wife in this 

8

 country has nothing to do with whether you get in.  That 

9

 would be unconstitutional. 

10

 MR. HADDAD: 

The  the Court would review 

11

 such a law, were it ever passed, under the same standard 

12

 it used in Fiallo, which is the facially legitimate and 

13

 bona fide standard.  There is  and this Court has 

14

 recognized that 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's facially  it 

16

 it  you  you would have to say it's 

17

 unconstitutional, wouldn't you?  If your argument in 

18

 this case is correct, that would be unconstitutional. 

19

 MR. HADDAD: 

We would certainly argue that, 

20

 Your Honor.  The Court would review it under the Fiallo 

21

 standard, and the Court would need to find, at least if 

22

 it applied and followed Fiallo, just as there was a 

23

 constitutional challenge to the lines Congress drew in 

24

 that case 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And you  and you would 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 say the same thing if Congress did not give a visa 

2

 preference, putting the spouse to the head of the line?

3

 You'd say the same thing? 

4

 MR. HADDAD: 

I  I don't think we would 

5

 advance that argument, Your Honor.  We have conceded 

6

 that Congress has broad latitude, broad latitude, 

7

 plenary powers this Court has stated to set the terms 

8

 and  and define who comes in. 

9
10
11
12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
 MR. HADDAD: 

But it 

It's the application, Mr. Chief 

 Justice. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But  but it can 

13

 take a long time, depending upon the nature of the 

14

 preference, for somebody to get to the front of line.  I 

15

 mean, under some preferences, it's 20 years after you 

16

 apply.  Then you get to the point where you can actually 

17

 get a visa to come in.  I would assume that that would 

18

 not be satisfactory to you because the marital 

19

 relationship would be interrupted for  for 20 years. 

20

 MR. HADDAD: 

Were those the facts, Your 

21

 Honor, at the time Congress passed such a law 

22

 eliminating all spousal preference, then we may indeed 

23

 have a strong claim, even as to the elimination or 

24

 changing of the preference.  But our point is  is 

25

 simply this:  We are not dealing here with a challenge 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 to Congress's linedrawing.  We're dealing with a 

2

 challenge to the application.

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I  I 

4

 understand that.  But my point is that the logic of your 

5

 position gets to reordering the visa preferences.  If 

6

 you say the fact of the marital relationship gives these 

7

 certain rights, then it would seem to me  because they 

8

 can't keep the husband and wife apart, it seems to me 

9

 that goes to the length of  that you have to wait for 

10

 your  your visa.  So it does go to the  the tiniest 

11

 reordering of the immigration preferences. 

12

 MR. HADDAD: 

Your Honor, a tiny reordering 

13

 we don't think would be difficult at all for this Court 

14

 to accept under the facially legitimate and bona fide 

15

 standard. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, okay.  But I 

17

 mean, my point is, it goes  it goes to the big 

18

 reordering as well. 

19

 MR. HADDAD: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But 
I mean, you have 

21

 change  depending upon Congress's ordering of the 

22

 preferences, you might have to change a great deal. 

23

 MR. HADDAD: 

Well, as  as this Court 

24

 recognized in Fiallo, the Court was unwilling  as its 

25

 footnotes 5 and 6 made very clear, the Court was 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 unwilling to say that there would be no check whatsoever 

2

 by this Court in any  of any change Congress might

3

 make. 

4

 Now, the Court was extraordinarily 

5

 deferential to Congress in Fiallo, but it still 

6

 exercised review. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

May I ask you how this would 

8

 play out as a practical matter?  I  Congress 

9

 apparently believed that requiring the government to 

10

 specify the particular subsection under which the visa 

11

 was denied had the potential of providing information 

12

 that might be damaging to the security of the United 

13

 States. 

14

 So let's  let's say that the  the 

15

 government comes in and says that, that in this case 

16

 they say, we can't  we don't want to tell you which of 

17

 these particular subsections this action was taken under 

18

 because we believe that under the circumstances of this 

19

 case, revealing that information will tell  would tell 

20

 the alien, if the information reached the alien, how 

21

 much we know about him and possibly how we found that 

22

 out. 

23

 So you say  what? 

The information would 

24

 have to be provided to the judge alone?  Would the judge 

25

 provide it to the alien?  Would the judge provide it to 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 counsel?  How would that work out? 
 MR. HADDAD: 

Well, I'll explain how it would

3

 work out as a practical matter.  I do want to note that 

4

 the government has had now the opportunity to file seven 

5

 briefs at three levels of the court system and has yet 

6

 to say that that is an issue in our case.  But where 

7

 does it say that 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That is an issue in all of 

 these cases, but tell me how it would work out. 
 MR. HADDAD: 

And so in the cases where it

 was an issue  and the government has conceded it's not 

12

 always, but where it is an issue, the government has 

13

 and we've laid it out in footnote 20 of our brief. 

14

 The government has memoranda that give 

15

 guidelines for how the information is treated, because 

16

 these same provisions come up and are justiciable in 

17

 removal context and asylum context.  So the government 

18

 goes to the judge and says, We've got some confidential 

19

 information here.  We want to present it.  We want to 

20

 redact the confidential information, file it under a 

21

 protective order, the court can review it.  If counsel 

22

 for the individual has a security clearance, then the 

23

 counsel can review it.  If the counsel doesn't then  the 

24

 court concludes ex parte review is necessary, then 

25

 ex parte review happens.

 Ultimately, we can't control, in a given 

2

 circumstance, what the national security implications

3

 are.  If there are significant national security 

4

 implications, then that applicant may never find out the 

5

 reason but

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But can the judge say, I'm 

7

 not going to tell counsel?  I believe the government 

8

 that revealing this information would have an adverse 

9

 effect on  on national security, I am not going to 

10
11
12
13

 tell counsel? 
 MR. HADDAD: 

Yes.  The court could do that. 

 That what's the Ninth Circuit anticipated. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And that would be the end 

14

 of it? All right.  What if the 

15

 government thinks that the court had made a  I am 

16

 going to tell counsel and I trust counsel.  What if the 

17

 government has a problem with that? 

18

 MR. HADDAD: 

I imagine the government would 

19

 press that argument both to the court and, if need be, 

20

 would try to take an interlocutory appeal to have that 

21

 decided. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do we have to go into all 

23

 that here?  I mean, I thought  I mean, taking the 

24

 obvious thing, which would be most adverse to you or the 

25

 second most adverse would be a possible answer, is to 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 say all the government has to do is to tell the judge, 

2

 judge, if we tell you which of the 25 different 

3

 subsections apply here, that will hurt national

4

 security.  And that's the end of the case. 

5

 But your case, you say, is a case where the 

6

 government won't say that because they are honest.  When 

7

 they get into court, they'll tell the truth; and if the 

8

 truth is there is no adverse effect on national 

9

 security, we at least would like to know that.  That 

10

 will help us. 

11

 But they won't give us any reason, none. 

12

 And if you go back to King John and the rule of law 

13

 itself, certainly part of that is when you take action 

14

 that adversely and seriously affects the  a citizen of 

15

 the United States.  The norm is you at least have to 

16

 tell them why. 

17

 I mean, are you arguing for more than that 

18

 minimal position in this case?  Do we have to go beyond 

19

 it? 

20

 MR. HADDAD: 

I don't think you do, Justice 

21

 Breyer, because at page 52 of Petitioner's brief, they 

22

 concede that some of these denials under 1182(a)(3)(B) 

23

 do not involve sensitive, classified information.  They 

24

 admit that some cases fall in that. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Haddad, suppose  you 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 know, suppose that I agree with you that the Mandel 

2

 standard should apply, so it's facially legitimate and 

3

 bona fide.  Why isn't that met here?

4

 Why hasn't the government actually come up 

5

 with a facially legitimate reason when it said 

6

 1182(a)(3)(B)? 

7

 MR. HADDAD: 

Well, I think, as your 

8

 questions to my colleague illustrated earlier, Justice 

9

 Kagan, all they have done is cite authority that 

10

 Congress has given them to adjudicate and decide 

11

 eligibility for a visa.  They have not said why the 

12

 statute applies to this particular applicant, and it 

13

 can't be a facially legitimate application of the 

14

 statute unless you know why it's being applied. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, gosh, I would have 

16

 thought that it can't be a legitimate application of the 

17

 statute unless you knew why it was being applied; but 

18

 the facially legitimate actually is a lesser standard 

19

 than that.  It's just like, you know, on its face.  On 

20

 its face, it's legitimate because they are acting under 

21

 the authority that the law gives them, according to 

22

 them. 

23

 MR. HADDAD: 

Well, here's an example, 

24

 Justice Kagan.  If the Court looks, for example, at page 

25

 13a of the government's opening brief where the statute 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that was referred to earlier this morning, the Court 

2

 will see that Congress wrote in to the eligibility 

3

 criteria in certain circumstances an opportunity for the

4

 applicant, having received notice of the reason, to 

5

 rebut with clear and convincing evidence the stated 

6

 reason for the exclusion. 

7

 On its face, we have no idea whether that or 

8

 one of the other provisions that allows a rebuttal was 

9

 the one invoked here. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that the 

11

 statute includes a provision that notice of the reason 

12

 need not be given in the case of a national security. 

13

 MR. HADDAD: 

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.  That 

14

 was the status of the statute before Congress added 

15

 these provisions that allow for a rebuttal.  So, in our 

16

 view, it makes  it would make the statute nonsensical 

17

 if one were to think that Congress was adding a right to 

18

 rebuttal to a statute that barred notice. 

19

 All 1182(b)(3) does is say that it's not 

20

 required in the normal course when you announce the 

21

 decision to tell the applicant what the explanation is. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So would you please 

23

 answer Justice Scalia's earlier point, which is, are we 

24

 going to get a slew of lawsuits from wives saying that 

25

 their husbands were treated  had an unfair trial or were 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4
5

 unfairly accused? 
 MR. HADDAD: 

I can't imagine that you would, 

 Justice Sotomayor. and here is the reason.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, don't tell me it 

 won't happen cause it hasn't 

6

 MR. HADDAD: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well 
 because  tell me 

8

 what the argument would be as to why that case would not 

9

 be sustainable. 

10

 MR. HADDAD: 

The case would not be sustained 

11

 because in every case of a criminal conviction, to take 

12

 that example, there will be a conviction.  It will be 

13

 according to the rules of due process that this Court 

14

 has elaborated. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. HADDAD: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The husband may choose 
And that will extinguish 
 not to appeal.  The 

18

 husband may choose not to appeal.  He has a death wish, 

19

 or whatever, and he doesn't want to appeal.  Why would 

20

 the wife not be able to appeal? 

21

 MR. HADDAD: 

Because at the time of the 

22

 conviction, whatever rights the wife may have had, would 

23

 have been extinguished by the conviction, which was 

24

 final 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is that right? 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HADDAD: 

It certainly is distinct from a 

2

 situation like this where there is never any process at 

3

 any time.  There is no review at any time. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

A conviction eliminates

5

 your  your marriage?  Is that  you don't have to get 

6

 a divorce, you just have to get convicted?  That's a 

7

 good deal. 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 MR. HADDAD: 

I think it's a better deal to 

10

 go the other way.  But I think that  but I think, as a 

11

 practical matter, Justice Scalia, it would be very 

12

 straightforward for the court, were such a claim ever to 

13

 be raised, to know that there is a much higher floor of 

14

 due process, frankly, in the criminal arena that would 

15

 be preconditioned 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But she has been privy 

17

 to it, and she has, as Justice Scalia said, a husband 

18

 who's taking tactical steps that are against his 

19

 interests.  So this is a serious question.  I very much 

20

 am troubled by this part of your argument. 

21
22
23

 How do we announce, and what rule do we 
 announce? 
 MR. HADDAD: 

Your Honor, I think in this 

24

 situation, you note that this is an exceptional area of 

25

 the law where there is no process surrounding the 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 decision the government is making of any kind.  I can't 

2

 think of another area of law where there is a complete 

3

 absence of process at any stage surrounding a decision 

4

 that has such a profound 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, there is process in 

6

 that she was allowed to petition the visa be 

7

 entertained.  There was very substantial process.  She 

8

 was entitled and did file an application for visa on the 

9

 husband's behalf. 

10

 MR. HADDAD: 

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12
13

But that is 
So to say that, oh, 

 there's no process at all, that's not correct. 
 MR. HADDAD: 

Well, the part of the decision 

14

 that matters, though, that we think  and, really, that 

15

 I'm pointing to here is the ultimate decision on the 

16

 visa.  And that's where there is a complete absence of 

17

 process, where the entire decisionmaking is behind 

18

 closed doors. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Suppose a couple lived in 

20

 New York and one is convicted of a crime and the spouse 

21

 is convicted  is convicted of a Federal crime, sent to 

22

 an ultramaximum security prison in Colorado. 

23

 Does  can the other spouse contest that 

24

 because that will have the effect of making it virtually 

25

 impossible for there to be any communication between 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 them? 

2

 MR. HADDAD: 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

4
5

No, Your Honor. 
What would be the 

 difference?
 MR. HADDAD: 

The difference is that in the 

6

 situation you described, there is process surrounding 

7

 the conviction; and the Court has held that the Bureau 

8

 of Prisons has extraordinary latitude and deference 

9

 comporting with due process to deal with the assignment 

10

 of prisoners. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well what if there 

12

 weren't?  That just seems to me to be fighting the 

13

 hypothetical. Let's say there is no process established 

14

 to seek review of that. 

15

 MR. HADDAD: 

Assuming  my point, to be 

16

 clear, is that either the prisoner in that case has 

17

 additional due process interest or the prisoner doesn't. 

18

 But at the time of the conviction which separates the 

19

 husband and wife, there is process, and there is not in 

20

 this case. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I know, but 

22

 what if there weren't?  In other words, does the marital 

23

 relation entitle the wife to review of the decision to 

24

 imprison the convicted husband in Colorado rather than 

25

 in New York? 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HADDAD: 

No, I don't think it does. 

2

 Because the Court has addressed this, and frankly, the 

3

 framers addressed this, with the due process clause, 

4

 with the habeas requirement.  The  the fact of 

5
6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
 that go to the prisoner. 

7

 MR. HADDAD: 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9
10
11

Those are rights 

Correct, Your Honor. 
So the spouse has no 

 additional rights, even though her marital relationship 
 will be affected. 
 MR. HADDAD: 

That's correct, Your Honor, 

12

 because of the rights that are there at the outset of 

13

 the process.  There's no comparable 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I'm not aware of 

15

 rights to contest the placement of a prisoner after a 

16

 conviction.  I'm trying to think of it.  I just don't 

17

 think there is any.  So I think that hypothetical is 

18

 very apt. 

19

 You indicate that there's no remedy where 

20

 there are two citizens living in this country, and then 

21

 you want us to apply that remedy to a person who's 

22

 living out of the country. When national security 

23

 interests are involved. 

24
25

 MR. HADDAD: 

The reason, Justice Kennedy, is 

 that in the situation that we have here, and certainly 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 as it's put to the Court, the respondent is a United 

2

 States citizen and she knows of no reason why her 

3

 husband does not satisfy the eligibility requirements 

4

 and there's been no window into it of any kind.  So

5

 there is no process around the initial threshold 

6

 decision that separates the couple. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Haddad, I would have thought 

8

 that all these kind of parade of horribles could have been 

9

 played out from the Mandel case as well, that you would 

10

 have thought, oh, my gosh, we're giving all these 

11

 professors a chance to complain about people going to 

12

 prison because the professors want to be able to talk to 

13

 them.  And none of that, of course, ever happened.  And 

14

 I'm wondering, why do you think that is?  Is there any 

15

 difference between the two situations such that we need 

16

 to worry about the parade of horribles in one but not in 

17

 the other? 

18

 MR. HADDAD: 

I don't think there's any 

19

 reason to worry about it, because the standard that 

20

 Mandel set is very, very deferential and generous to the 

21

 government.  The only times that it's going to create an 

22

 incentive for a lawsuit is where the plaintiffs are 

23

 convinced that there has been a mistake or an abuse of 

24

 the process 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Maybe there are more 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 incentivized spouses than there are incentivized law 

2

 professors.  Don't you think that's possible? 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: No but law professors they're 
 very, very insistent, you know?
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But I think  I think what 

6

 you're saying, though I'm not certain, is simply 

7

 you're not saying that the wife should be able to sue to 

8

 get her husband out of prison, et cetera, but she does 

9

 have a constitutionally protected interest.  But to say 

10

 a person has an interest is not to say how that 

11

 protection goes. 

12

 If you say we have all the examples of what 

13

 would happen, if you say there is an interest and none 

14

 of them need happen, now try it the other way.  Suppose 

15

 you say there is no interest.  Then I guess if there's 

16

 no constitutionally protected interest in living 

17

 together with your spouse  you can make up a 

18

 hypothetical  Congress passes a law that says all 

19

 husbands and wives have to live separately, period.  Is 

20

 there anyone who thinks that there would be no court 

21

 action in such a case? 

22

 I mean, you can say a person has an 

23

 interest.  Then the next question is, what kind of 

24

 protection does the law give to that interest?  And 

25

 you're bringing a case where the answer is, virtually 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 none, and you want a little bit.  But it has the real 

2

 problems that people have raised.  Now, is that  is 

3

 that a fair description of what you're saying? 

4

 MR. HADDAD: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's very fair, Your Honor.
Well, then, I 

6

 thought you said no.  So you now think that the spouse 

7

 whose husband is convicted and sent to the maximum 

8

 security prison far away has a constitutionally 

9

 protected interest with respect to that separation? 

10
11
12
13
14

 MR. HADDAD: 

Your Honor, it's certainly not 

 an interest that we are arguing for. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  I know my 

 hypothetical is different from your case. 
 MR. HADDAD: 

But the reason I point that out 

15

 is, I think the Court, if it's truly concerned about 

16

 this kind of floodgates problem  which I don't think 

17

 is realistic, for the reasons discussed  the Court can 

18

 address it fairly, I think, either through saying, yes, 

19

 in the abstract, there's a liberty interest but one that 

20

 would never be 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's not such a matter 

22

 it's not such a matter of floodgates.  It's a matter of 

23

 defining the basic right for constitutional purposes. 

24
25

 MR. HADDAD: 

And the basic right is the 

 right to live together, but it is a right and not have 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 it be interfered with through an arbitrary 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Does that  would that 

3

 apply even if she didn't  she comes in because she has 

4

 a right to apply for priority status for her spouse.

5

 Suppose there were no such right, but he's her husband. 

6

 You seem to be arguing that the husband/wife 

7

 relationship is the constitutionally protected 

8

 relationship, so it wouldn't matter if there were no 

9

 priority status involved.  Or what do you get out of the 

10

 statute that says the wife can apply for priority status 

11

 for her husband? 

12

 MR. HADDAD: 

Well, certainly the statute and 

13

 the preferences, which go back to 1907, reflect, I 

14

 think, Congress's  is consistent, certainly, with the 

15

 constitutional value the Court has placed here.  And so 

16

 in that respect, it's helpful. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it's not necessary. 

18

 You would say the marital relationship, citizen 

19

 wife/alien husband, just by virtue of that relationship, 

20

 she can contest the government's refusal to explain why 

21

 this person was excluded. 

22

 MR. HADDAD: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

23

 And I think in terms of the concern about how far this 

24

 case would go, I think it is meaningful that the Court 

25

 does not have to deal with a situation, as it would in 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 these other circumstances, of a threshold finding that 

2

 led to separation and that involved process. 

3

 And I  it's actually interesting that the 

4

 Court looks at Turner against Safley.  Justice O'Connor

5

 recognized that there were spouses of these prisoners. 

6

 They weren't before the Court, but she noted that their 

7

 interest might be different or protected differently. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask, Mr. Haddad  and 

 this goes back to my earlier question about why this 

10

 isn't an APA case  it seems to me if it were an APA 

11

 case, we wouldn't have to go through all this  these 

12

 troubles about defining the scope of the right.  We 

13

 could just say, this is a person aggrieved, for obvious 

14

 reasons, that she can't live with her husband, and then 

15

 sort of go on to ask what kind of process she would do 

16

 under the APA.  Why wouldn't that be an easier way to 

17

 think about this case and to resolve this case? 

18

 MR. HADDAD: 

That is an attractive 

19

 framework, although there are other legal issues that 

20

 would have to be addressed.  Congress has amended the 

21

 INA to limit the right of action that would be available 

22

 under the statute under the INA.  So there's some 

23

 indication that Congress did not want private parties to 

24

 be able to sue the Agency as a statutory matter. 

25

 So the Court could certainly remand for 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 further consideration under the APA, but that has not 

2

 been the case that we have brought, and we think the 

3

 constitutional ground is the stronger ground. 

4

 If the Court has no further questions, we

5

 will submit.

 remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

11

 MR. KNEEDLER: 

12

 First of all, in terms of protections that 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: 

13

 have been afforded by the government, Congress enacted a 

14

 statute, referred to in footnote 6 of our brief, that 

15

 every denial under the security grounds for a visa has 

16

 to be reported to Congress.  So Congress has oversight 

17

 of  of what is going on here. 

18

 Secondly, respondent is proposing a radical 

19

 departure in due process law, one that  one that is 

20

 entirely inconsistent with what this Court took as 

21

 selfevident in the O'Bannon case, that where you have 

22

 one spouse or one family member who engages in wrongful 

23

 conduct or has characteristics that disentitle him to 

24

 benefits or subject him to punishment, that is his 

25

 problem, his issue, his to litigate 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You know, I think you're 

2

 overreading O'Bannon, Mr. Kneedler.  I think O'Bannon 

3

 makes it very clear that  a large part of what's going 

4

 on there is, it said the nursing home can do this

5

 itself.  It was almost like a Prudential Standing kind 

6

 of argument, that there's one party that has all this 

7

 motivation and incentive to challenge this; we don't 

8

 need all these other people doing it.  And that's 

9

 clearly not the case here.  So I think O'Bannon is a 

10
11

 very different factual circumstance. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

Well  but the importance of 

12

 O'Bannon is that it says that there's no constitutional 

13

 deprivation of liberty through the indirect impact of 

14

 action taken against one person by another. 

15
16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, in those 

 circumstances. 

17

 MR. KNEEDLER: Well but No, I think it was 

18

  and they used the prison  they used the prison 

19

 circumstance.  But if I could just pick up on what you 

20

 said.  This Court has said on a number of cases that 

21

 when it comes to the exclusion of aliens, whatever 

22

 process Congress provides is the process that is due. 

23

 And here we have process by Congress, but in 

24

 addition, by the Executive.  A fortiori that that is 

25

 true with respect to aliens outside the United States. 

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 As far as  as the wife is concerned, whatever due 

2

 process interest she has, has been satisfied by what 

3

 Congress has afforded.  That is the way the structure 

4

 works under our Constitution.  If Congress thinks that

5

 greater protection is required, it can do that. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's too far a 

7

 statement, Mr. Kneedler.  I can imagine too many 

8

 hypotheticals where the government could afford or could 

9

 treat aliens that are in the United States in an 

10
11

 unconstitutional way. 
 MR. KNEEDLER: 

I'm not saying in the United 

12

 States.  I'm saying the exclusion of aliens.  And those 

13

 statements were made where the alien had arrived at our 

14

 shores.  A fortiori it is true that with respect to an 

15

 alien abroad, that  that is correct.  If there are 

16

 additional rights to be afforded to spouses, it should 

17

 be up to Congress to do it.  As Justice Kennedy pointed 

18

 out, spouses are entitled to petition for eligibility 

19

 for a spouse to be considered for a visa.  Once that 

20

 petition is granted, the spouse's cognizable interest is 

21

 completed.  The alien, then, must satisfy on his own 

22

 terms the  the elements for admissibility and that 

23

 applies whatever the basis for  for his ability to 

24

 apply for a visa, whether it's an employment petition, a 

25

 spousal petition, a  a tourist visa, whatever it is.

 And I also wanted to respond to what Justice 

2

 Kagan  or pick up on what Justice Kagan said about 

3

 facially legitimate.  Nothing in  in Mandel suggests 

4

  even if we got to that point, even if the Court

5

 thought that there was a cognizable basis for the spouse 

6

 here, nothing in Mandel suggests that you could look 

7

 behind the stated reason.  You would never get to 

8

 classified information or other information underlying 

9

 the denial.  The Court made that perfectly clear.  And 

10

 here, we have a facially legitimate statement of the 

11

 reason for the denial, which is an act of Congress 

12

 identifying terrorism as the ground. 

13

 And Congress also decided that further 

14

 notice is not required in that circumstance, picking up 

15

 exactly on the point this Court made in Knauff v. 

16

 Shaughnessy, that it is not necessary to give 

17

 information to an alien about the basis for his excuse 

18

 and  and a spouse cannot get around that. 

19

 The history of consular nonreviewability is 

20

 extensive and it is not limited just to the alien.  I 

21

 would point the Court to 8 U.S.C. 1201(i) and 6 U.S.C. 

22

 236(f), both of which say  indicate the consular 

23

 officer decisions are not to be reviewed by anybody.
