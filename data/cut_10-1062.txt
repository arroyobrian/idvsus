CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 10-1062, Sackett v. The

5

Environmental Protection Agency.

6

Mr. Schiff.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAMIEN M. SCHIFF

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SCHIFF:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Mike and Chantell Sackett are here today

12

because 4 years ago the Environmental Protection Agency

13

issued against them a compliance order charging them

14

with violations of the Clean Water Act, requiring that

15

they restore their property to its alleged

16

predisturbance wetlands condition, and imposing upon

17

them the threat of tens of thousands of dollars per day

18

in civil fines if they did not immediately comply with

19

the order.

20

But in these 4 years, the Sacketts have

21

never been offered a meaningful opportunity for judicial

22

review of the compliance order, an opportunity that they

23

are guaranteed under the Due Process Clause and the

24

Administrative Procedure Act.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, there would have

3

Alderson Reporting Company

1

been a daily fine with or without the compliance order,

2

wouldn't there, if they were indeed in violation of

3

the -- the Act?

4

MR. SCHIFF:

Justice Scalia, the fine would

5

only have been attributable to the statute itself.

6

with the compliance order in effect, essentially, the

7

Sacketts are now subject to double liability.

8

be held liable for the statute as well as for actions

9

inconsistent with the compliance order.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

But

They can

So, Mr. Schiff, your

11

understanding is that each day your clients are subject

12

to $37,500 of fines for the violation of the statute,

13

and an additional 37.5 for violation of the compliance

14

order.

15

scheme to work?

16

Is that the way you understand the penalties

MR. SCHIFF:

Yes -- yes, Justice Kagan.

It

17

is -- it is in fact, I might add, how the EPA

18

understands the penalty provisions.

19

pages 30 and 31, they essentially concede that the

20

existence of the compliance order does subject the

21

Sacketts to liability for both violations of the statute

22

as well as violations of the compliance order.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In its brief at

But the court of appeals

24

did say that there would be no independent liability

25

under the -- for violation of the compliance order.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That is, unless there was a violation of the statute,


2

there would be no penalty for violation of the


3

compliance order.


4

MR. SCHIFF:

That is correct, Justice


5

Ginsburg.

The court held that as a predicate for any

6

liability for a compliance order violation, there must

7

be first a finding of a statutory violation.

8

doesn't change the fact -- even according to the Ninth

9

Circuit, doesn't change the fact that one can still be

But that

10

held liable for both, that there is a distinct civil

11

liability that is traceable only to the compliance

12

order.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what kind of

14

review are you seeking?

15

is you dispute that this property is subject to the Act.

16

That might be a question that's reviewable.

17

more than that?

18

anything more than whether the property is subject to

19

the Act?

20

I mean, one thing you could say

Do you seek

Do you seek review at this stage of

MR. SCHIFF:

No, Your Honor, we seek review

21

of that jurisdictional question as it is incorporated

22

into the compliance order.

23

agency action for which we believe the Sacketts have a

24

right of review under the Administrative Procedure Act.

25

And our challenge under the APA to the compliance order

The compliance order is the

5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

is precisely that there is no jurisdiction and,


2

therefore, there has been no statutory violation.


3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you tell me, what


4

would be the scope of your holding?

5

would -- if you could write the opinion for the Court on

6

this part of your case, what would the rule be?

7

How would -- how


I mean, health inspectors go into

8

restaurants all the time and say:

Unless you fix this,

9

I'm going to give you a citation.

Fire inspectors, the

10

same thing.

11

theory or your general principle that you want us to

12

adopt would fit with that rather routine type of

13

enforcement?

14

And I'm -- I'm wondering how your general

MR. SCHIFF:

Well, Justice Kennedy, we do

15

not believe that what we are articulating extends as far

16

as -- as creating a right under the APA for review

17

because a health inspector has come onto your property.

18

All we're arguing is that the compliance order is a

19

final agency action; it has stopped the Sacketts home

20

building; it has imposed upon them significant civil

21

liability; and, therefore, they should have a right

22

under the APA --

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, this is under -- this

is under the APA.
MR. SCHIFF:

Correct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This is the APA prong of

your argument.
MR. SCHIFF:

Correct, Justice Kennedy.

4

-- and we should emphasize that we believe that the

5

Sacketts' due process rights can be satisfied by

6

allowing their APA cause of action to go forward.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

It seems to me there --

8

there's another distinction, a more significant one,

9

between routine inspections by fire marshals or -- or

10

restaurant inspectors, and that is that if you -- if you

11

disobey their order, you're not subjected to any more

12

substantial liability than -- than you would have been

13

subjected to had they not issued the order.

14
15
16

It isn't the order that -- that produces
any -- any new fine, is it?
MR. SCHIFF:

That is exactly correct,

17

Justice Scalia.

18

distinction between the compliance order in this case

19

and many of the agency actions that the EPA has set

20

forth in its brief.

21

That's -- that's the principal

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the sanction

22

imposed each day was not the $37,000, but was $10?

23

you don't comply, you know, we can bring an action any

24

time to enforce this, and you'll be subject to the

25

statutory maximum, but during the period, the additional

If

1

sanction for the -- under the administrative order, or

2

the compliance order, is $10 a day.

3

MR. SCHIFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

4

believe that would change the Court's finality analysis

5

under Bennett.

6

$10 as opposed to 37,000 doesn't --

7

The -- the fact that the fine is only

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it might go to

8

adequacy of judicial review, the adequacy of the

9

judicial review that would come when the EPA brings the

10

enforcement action.

11

that there was a significant extortion impact from the

12

fact that these were such significant fines -- double,

13

as you say -- that you could rack up for 5 years.

14

if it's only $10 a day, that takes a lot of the wind out

15

of your sails, doesn't it?

16

I understood your argument to be

MR. SCHIFF:

But

Well, to begin with,

17

Mr. Chief Justice, in addition to the independent

18

liability that the compliance order imposes, there are

19

other legal effects.

20

no independent liability, there are other legal effects

21

that even EPA has conceded to.

22

existence of the compliance order makes it materially,

23

substantially more difficult for the Sacketts to apply

24

for an after-the-fact permit.

25

Even if the compliance order had

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

For example, the

2

The -- once an compliance order is issued, an

3

after-the-fact permit is -- can only be applied for

4

under the "clearly appropriate" standard in the Corps's

5

regulations.

6

But -- but, Mr. Chief Justice, in response

7

to the question, yes, of course, the amount of the fine

8

certainly factors into meaningfulness of review.

9

factors into coerciveness.

It

But even if there were no

10

fines, there is -- attributable to the compliance order,

11

there is still the fact that the Sacketts cannot

12

independently initiate, cannot trigger, review of the

13

compliance order.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what do you care?

15

I mean, you have the fines, don't you?

16

you just argue that?

Why do we have to wrestle with the

So, why don't

We don't have to

But, as I understand it, you can get review

24

by applying for an after-the-fact permit from the Corps,

25

and the only -- the only expense you would incur in
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

order to get that would be to fill in, as the order

7

Well, Justice Scalia -Is that such a hard -- a

That's a lot less than, you know, 37.5 a day.
MR. SCHIFF:

Well, the difficulty,

8

Justice Scalia, is that the Sacketts cannot obtain

9

judicial review of the compliance order within the

10

context of the permitting process.

11

is the order that has caused the deprivation, that has

12

imposed upon the Sacketts this double liability.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The compliance order

Well, but their challenge

14

to the compliance order is simply that they don't have

15

wetlands.

16

that can be raised in the -- before the Corps of

17

Engineers, no?

18

It's the jurisdiction of the EPA.

MR. SCHIFF:

And surely

That issue might be raised,

19

Your Honor, but the Sacketts could never get review of

20

that issue within the context of the compliance order,

21

which is, of course, the -- the agency action that has

22

caused their harm.

23

guarantee that the Sacketts could even get into court

24

through the permitting process, because the Corps might

25

very well say, well, you know, we don't believe that

Moreover, there's frankly no

1

going to issue you a permit.

nothing for the Sacketts to then litigate over in

Federal court.

And, therefore, there is

7

MR. SCHIFF:

How long does it take to

There -- there is a study, Your

8

Honor.

In terms of averages, I think it's about a year.

9

But there's nothing in our record that would show

10

necessarily that the Sacketts are eligible for a

11

nationwide permit.

12

that the permitting process doesn't provide review of

13

the burden of the deprivation that the Sacketts are

14

enduring right now.

15

But more importantly is the fact

do what you're hoping to do.

20

21

something in the middle, which is:

22

for us to tell; you're on your own?

23

MR. SCHIFF:

Obviously, they might give you a

They might say you don't
Can they do

It's kind of hard

Very much so.

In addition to

24

saying we're not going to issue a permit because we

25

don't believe there are wetlands on the property, they
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could also say, under the regulations that even EPA

2

cites in its brief, that we're not even going to

3

entertain your after-the-fact permit application while

4

the compliance order is still outstanding, meaning that

5

you will likely have to comply, be fully deprived, with

6

everything the compliance order says, allow EPA onto

7

your property, requiring significant expensive

8

restoration of your property to its alleged wetlands

9

state, before you even have the privilege of applying

10

for a permit.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is that what -- is that

12

what's critical, Mr. Schiff?

13

you could go in, even with the compliance order on your

14

property, and get an adjudication of whether you had

15

wetlands in the context of an after-the-fact permit

16

proceeding, would that be sufficient?

17

MR. SCHIFF:

If that were not true, if

No, it would not, Justice

18

Kagan, because, again, the fact is that the -- the

19

compliance order is -- well, the permitting process is

20

an entirely separate agency action.

21

agency action that the Army Corps goes through.

22

Sacketts could get no review of the -- of the compliance

23

order.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's -- it's an

4

problems are finished.

5

And if they said you don't have

MR. SCHIFF:

Justice Kagan, the difficulty

6

is that that judicial decision would have no impact and

7

would not remedy the deprivation that the Sacketts are

8

currently enduring.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do they issue permits when

10

there are no wetlands?

11

allowing you to do something on wetlands which otherwise

12

would -- would not be allowed?

13
14

MR. SCHIFF:

I thought it was a permit

That's -- that's correct,

Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

So, if they decide that

16

there's -- that it's not a wetland, what do they -- what

17

do they do?

18

They do nothing?
MR. SCHIFF:

Is that it?

That's my understanding.

The

19

Corps would simply say there's nothing to permit because

20

there are no wetlands to fill.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the difficult -But then the compliance

JUSTICE ALITO:

The Sacketts
And

That seems very strange for

8

that -- for a party to apply for a permit on -- on the

9

ground that they don't need a permit at all.

If you

10

apply for a permit, is the Army Corps of Engineers going

11

to decide whether you -- whether it's wetlands?

12

it presupposed if you're applying for a permit that you

13

-- you need one because there's -- they are wetlands?

14

MR. SCHIFF:

Isn't

That's -- that's exactly right,

15

Justice Alito.

16

is to force the Sacketts to go through a process.

17

They've been injured by the EPA, by a compliance order,

18

and they're told they must initiate an entirely separate

19

administrative action with an entirely different agency

20

in order to get indirect, tangential, possible review of

21

the compliance order that has turned their world upside

22

down for the last 4 years.

23

The -- that underscores how bizarre it

The -- that is why the permitting process

24

cannot provide meaningful judicial review to the

25

Sacketts.

That's why the Administrative Procedure Act
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is the ready-made answer.

And, frankly, there's no

2

indication that Congress intended anything other than

3

the Administrative Procedure Act to provide an adequate

4

administrative review for the -- for the adjudication of

5

compliance orders.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What would the standard

7

be that -- before -- you have APA review.

8

that -- that the EPA acted reasonably in determining

9

that you have wetlands?

10

MR. SCHIFF:

So, it's just

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it would

11

be your typical arbitrary and capricious standard of

12

review, substantial evidence based upon the record that

13

was before the EPA when it made its finding of statutory

14

violation, which is the statutory predicate for the

15

issuance of the compliance order.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait, wait.

Surely,

you wouldn't go in and -- and try to fight arbitrary or

18

capricious.

21

It's arbitrary or capricious or otherwise

MR. SCHIFF:

Wouldn't you go in and say

No, exactly, Justice Scalia.

22

mean, I don't mean to limit ourselves to just that one

23

standard of review.

24
25

But it would be a --

I don't think that one

standard of review would do you very much good, to tell

Alderson Reporting Company

I

you the truth.

2

got it wrong, but to say it's arbitrary or capricious,

3

you're going to lose.

4

They've thought about this.

MR. SCHIFF:

Maybe they

Well, I certainly hope not,

5

Justice Scalia.

But -- but the difficulty is we don't

6

even know at this point what sort of record the EPA has.

7

In fact, the law as it stands now is that EPA doesn't

8

even need probable cause to issue a compliance order.

9

And -JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Given -- given the rather

11

vague nature of the test that's been adopted for

12

determining whether something is part of the waters of

13

the United States, wouldn't you have a very difficult

14

time showing that a determination that it was, was

15

arbitrary and capricious?

There's no question,

17

Justice Alito, that there -- there -- yes, it would be a

difficult time.

reason to say that they should have no opportunity.

clause or -- or otherwise not in accordance with law?

5

If -- if then the court rules against you but you

8

MR. SCHIFF:

9

Yes.

The only way EPA can

agency action under the APA.

10

the Sacketts also contend, regardless of questions of --

11

of Rapanos and connection to navigable waters, the

12

Sacketts contend that there are no wetlands at all on

13

this property, and that ultimately is -- is, of course,

a factual question that would be informed by what's in

If they're wrong about

these are wetlands, is that the end of it?

21

that, the context of that review, can you say, well,

they are wetlands, but only to a minor extent, and these

23

conditions were onerous and -- and far more than

24

necessary to protect the wetlands?

25

in the APA review?

Or within

Can you argue that

Or is it just up or down:

Alderson Reporting Company

Wetlands,

1

you lose; not wetlands, you win.

2

MR. SCHIFF:

No.

That's it?

I mean -- Justice Kennedy,

3

we would argue that, even if there are wetlands on the

4

property, which we do not believe there are, that --

5

that the compliance order would still be invalidated if

6

there were not a significant nexus between the -- the

7

alleged wetlands on the property and some navigable

8

water in the vicinity.

9

But -- but --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Who would review that

10

and where?

Going back to Justice Kagan's question of --

11

let's assume you went through an APA process, and they

12

found it was wetlands and that the compliance terms

13

were -- had a substantial nexus.

14

go into an enforcement action?
MR. SCHIFF:

15

What happens when you

Well, at that point, then both

16

sides get to create a new record, consistent with what

17

the Ninth Circuit held.

18

That --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, the Chief Justice's

19

suggestion that there would be preclusion you do not

20

agree with?

21

MR. SCHIFF:

No.

In addition to the fact

22

that the standards of review would be different,

23

preponderance of the evidence in a civil action as

24

opposed to substantial evidence in the APA, it would

25

also be the fact that -- that, even as the Ninth Circuit
19

2

sides have an opportunity to create a new record or

I'm sorry, Justice -Does anything get

Assuming it's not a legal question, would the

10

factual findings that there's a substantial nexus

11

between the remedy ordered and the violation -- would

12

that get estoppel?

13

MR. SCHIFF:

It -- it would be difficult to

imagine a case of estoppel, because, again, in the APA

15

context, it's just based upon the record at the time the

compliance order is issued.

18

will build upon that administrative record.

secondly, in terms of the differing standards of review,

MR. SCHIFF:

may not be the best opportunity, but something is better

than nothing, an APA cause of action to review the EPA's

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I'd like to begin with the question of

2

double penalties because I think it helps to clarify

3

exactly what the compliance order does and does not do

4

in terms of altering the legal regime to which the

5

Sacketts are subject.

6

The compliance order is intended to specify

7

the violation that EPA believes to have occurred and the

8

measures that EPA believes are necessary in order to

9

achieve prospective compliance.

And the statute does

10

provide separately for penalties for violating the

11

statute and penalties for violating the compliance

12

order.

13

And, as an exercise of our duty of candor to

14

the Court, we acknowledged in our brief that the

15

Government reads the statute to allow the legal

16

possibility of double penalties; that is, up to 37,500

17

per day for violating the statute, up to 37,500 per day

18

for violating the compliance order.

19

really a theoretical rather than a practical --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

The order itself says that.

22

you're going to get penalized up to 32.5, which is now

23

37.

24
25

MR. STEWART:

Why?

I think that's

You say "practical."

It says you don't do it,

Well, that language in the

order would have been accurate even if the statute
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't authorize penalties for violating the -- the

2

order itself.

3

penalties only for violating the Act, it would have been

4

accurate for EPA to say we believe this is what is

5

necessary to achieve compliance, and if you don't do it,

6

you will potentially be subject to these civil

7

penalties; namely, civil penalties for violating the

8

statute.

9

That is, even if the statute authorized

But the reason I say that it's -- the double

10

penalties as a theoretical possible -- let me say that

11

again.

12

violating the compliance order, only penalties for

13

violating the statute, EPA could accurately have said we

14

believe that the following steps are necessary in order

15

to achieve prospective compliance with the Act, and if

16

you don't do these things, you will be subject to the

17

following penalties because you will then be in

18

violation of the Act and you will be subject to the

19

penalties --

If there were no provision for penalties for

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Stewart --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't follow -- I

22

didn't follow that.

What is your response to the

23

assertion that you're subject to double penalties?

24

MR. STEWART:

It is --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
27

Alderson Reporting Company

One, for violating

Official

1

the Act; two, for violating the compliance order.

2

MR. STEWART:

The first is it is a legal

3

possibility.

4

district court has ever imposed penalties of greater

5

than the 37,000 --

6

We're not aware of any case in which a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you don't

7

doubt that -- you don't doubt that they have the

8

authority to do that?

9

MR. STEWART:

They have the authority to do

10

that.

I guess the other thing I would say is the

11

possibility that penalties would be increased doesn't

12

distinguish this scheme from the sort of regime that

13

Justice Kennedy referred to or the sorts of regimes that

14

we've discussed in our brief.

15

for law enforcement agencies of all sorts to give

16

warnings to regulated parties:

17

violating the statute.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

That is, it's very common

violation?

3

violation of the compliance order?

4

It will not seek an additional penalty for

5

MR. STEWART:
to that effect.


6
7

And I guess what I -- I do want to

clarify --

8
9

We have not adopted a policy

JUSTICE ALITO:
theoretical, then.

So, it's more than


I don't really understand what


10

you're saying.

11

but it's unlikely courts will actually provide for more.

12

You're saying that we may ask for more,

MR. STEWART:

I guess the two -- I don't

13

know that we have ever asked for more than the 37,500

14

per day.

15

what district courts will do is, within the 37,500

16

statutory maximum, they will say we are imposing a

17

greater penalty for the period after the compliance

18

order was issued because it shows greater culpability to

19

continue with the violation after you've been warned.

20

Now, I think it is often the case what -- that

But that's not a feature of the compliance

21

order that distinguishes it from all manner of other

22

agency warnings.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, your order could have

24

read, it could have read -- "Notice is hereby given that

25

violation of or failure to comply with the foregoing
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Order" -- cap "O" -- "may subject Respondents to, one,

2

civil penalties" of up to 32.5 -- now 37.5 per day.

3

That's how it reads.

4

or failure to comply with the Environmental Protection

5

Act may subject Respondents to civil penalties.

6

It could have read:

Violation of

It's quite specific that it is violation of

7

-- failure to comply with the foregoing order, which

8

includes not letting -- filling in immediately and so

9

forth.

It says what it says.

It's the violation of the

10

order that -- that the additional penalties are attached

11

to.

12

MR. STEWART:

And, again, we don't dispute

13

that violating the order could as a realistic matter

14

cause the penalties to be greater within the statutory

15

maximum.

16

agencies give warnings to regulated parties:

17

keep doing this, you may be subject to penalties.

But, as I was saying, in many situations,

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

theoretical matter double the penalties.

20

MR. STEWART:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

If you

It could -- it could as a

That's correct.
You're just saying, as a

practical matter, it doesn't often do that.
MR. STEWART:

As a practical matter, we are

24

not aware of any case in which the penalties imposed

have been greater than the per-day statutory maximum for

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. STEWART:

It -- in terms -- I think,


5

first of all, we would say that until we floated the

6

theoretical possibility in our opening brief, the

7

Sacketts seemed to be entirely unaware of it.

8

all of the Sacketts' calculations as to the penalties to

in their present conduct were premised on the idea that

11

16

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. STEWART:

I don't think -- I guess

19

that's really my point, that the one thing the Sacketts

20

have never argued is, if it were just the 37,500 per day

21

for violating the statute, we would be willing to build

22

our house and take our chances, but once you double

23

that, we're not willing to take the risk any longer,

24

that the --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

their argument today, either.

2

MR. STEWART:

Right.

3

The one point before I move on that I do

4

want to make clear is, in a wide variety of contexts,

5

agencies will issue warnings to regulated parties that

6

they are believed to be in violation of a statute.

7

it is common under schemes where the amount of the

8

sanction is up to the judge's discretion that penalties

9

will -- may be greater for conduct that occurs after the

10

And

person has been warned --

17

order that tells you to do those things.

20

very theoretically different violation that's going on.

One is in the affirmative act prohibited by

MR. STEWART:

EPA's view of the statute is

that -- without regard to the issuance of a compliance

10

order, once fill material is deposited in waters of the

11

United States, EPA's view of the penalty provisions

12

would be that the violation continues for as long as the

13

fill remains in the wetlands.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That has nothing to do

15

with the fact that the Act doesn't specifically tell you

16

to remove it.

17

MR. STEWART:

The Act doesn't

18

specifically -- and the Act doesn't specifically tell

19

the person to remove it, but that's our interpretation

20

of the statute.

21

is, if we're wrong about that, if the only days on which

22

penalties can be assessed for violating the statute

23

itself are days on which fill was actually discharged,

24

then the provisions of the compliance order that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you


4

referred a couple of times to the EPA's view of the


5

statute.

I take it that's your view as well?

6

MR. STEWART:

That's our view as well.

I'm

7

just saying that hasn't been definitively resolved by

8

this Court.

9

with respect to the statute itself is that in computing

But the position that we've taken, again,

10

the daily penalties and asking how many days of

11

violation were there, the district court should take

12

into account not just the days on which fill was

13

actually deposited but the days on which fill remained

14

in the wetlands.

15

And Petitioners have specifically expressed

16

agreement this morning with that view of the statute.

17

think the view of the Petitioners' amici is to the same

18

effect, because in many of the amicus briefs there are

19

calculations of the very large penalties to which people

20

could be subject if they didn't adhere to compliance

21

orders, and they're all premised on the idea that every

22

day fill remains in the wetlands --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

What about those provisions

24

of the original order?

I must say I was not edified by

25

the fact that, when litigation was threatened or

actually brought, the EPA modified its order:

2

don't have to plant the trees.

5

what the EPA would -- would demand?

6

MR. STEWART:

I don't know about well

7

beyond.

I think the -- every version of the compliance

8

order said to the Sacketts if you think that there are

9

things here -- in here that are wrong or compliance

10

measures that you regard as infeasible, you're welcome

11

to tell us.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's very nice, when

you've received something called a compliance order,

17

for every day of violation.

18

MR. STEWART:

I think the portion of the

19

order dealing with the planting of plants, which is the

20

primary one that was eliminated in the final iteration

21

of the order, is really removed from what the Sacketts

22

have been complaining about.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

think in determining whether it's an unfair position or

compliance order would not be the first communication

from the agency that would alert the landowner to the

belief that there was a violation.

was followed in this case, but EPA's typical practice is

MR. STEWART:

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

Well, once that -Well, all right, I'm just

going to put it aside as a nature preserve.

4

MR. STEWART:

At the time that that sort of

5

letter is issued, there's no compliance order, and

6

there's no impediment to an after-the-fact permit.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That

In other words, what

10

the landowner is supposed to do -- the agency says,

12

because you didn't give us a chance to say whether we

13

were going to take away your constitutional rights or

14

not; so, we can do it.
MR. STEWART:

15

Well, the first two things I

16

would -- the first thing I would say is it's not simply

17

a hypothetical means of challenging CWA coverage to seek

18

a permit.

19

of Northern Cook County, and Carabell, which was one of

20

the two companion cases that this Court adjudicated in

21

Rapanos, that was the way that the suit got into Federal

22

court.

23

That is, in both SWANCC, Solid Waste Agency

The landowners applied for permits, they

24

were denied, they sought judicial review of the permit

25

denials and argued, inter alia, that there was no need
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for a permit because the relevant tracts were not waters

2

of the United States.

3

The second thing I would say is it's often

4

the case that judicial review is contingent upon

5

complying with some sort of deadline or some sort of

6

prerequisite, and once a person has missed the deadline,

7

that person may as a practical matter be in the same

8

position as if judicial review had not been made

9

available at all.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I'm --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose the Corps of

12

Engineers agrees that it's not a wetland, and its basis

13

for refusing to issue the permit is we don't give a

14

permit; you don't need a permit.
MR. STEWART:

15

It would issue a letter either

16

to the effect that there was no wetland or that it was a

17

wetland that was not covered by --

Is that binding on -Yes, we --- the Environmental

Protection Agency?

22

MR. STEWART:

Yes, we would --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

How can they bring an

24

action?

I'd like some clarification here.

25

regs say the Corps will accept an after-the-fact permit.
40

Alderson Reporting Company

The Corps's

Official

1

I mean, one after -- if they applied tomorrow, the day

2

after getting this order, you'd run up against the reg,

3

which says we won't give you any after the fact -- we

4

won't even consider this matter, until any required

5

initial corrective measures are made.

6

And then, just to be safe, they say that no

7

permit application will be accepted unless the Corps

8

determines that concurrent processing of an

9

after-the-fact permit application is clearly

10
11

appropriate.

"Clearly."
So, I looked at those two things and said,

12

of course, you can't apply to the Corps of Engineers;

13

they're not going to accept it unless you have a very

14

unusual case.

15

about that, if I am, or how many after-the-fact permit

16

applications has the Corps of Engineers accepted.

17

there are a lot.

18

So, I expect you to tell me why I'm wrong

MR. STEWART:

Maybe

It's not precluded, but I

19

would agree with you:

It's very unlikely that without

20

complying with the order --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

All right.

I agree.

22

Then, if we agree, then look, for 75 years the courts

23

have interpreted statutes with an eye towards permitting

24

judicial review, not the opposite.

25

MR. STEWART:

But -41


Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And yet -- so, here you're

2

saying this statute that says nothing about it precludes

3

review, and then the second thing you say is that this

4

isn't final.

So, I read the order.

It looks like about

5

as final a thing as I've ever seen.

So, tell me why I'm

6

wrong on those two points.

7

MR. STEWART:

Well, we're not arguing that

8

the statute precludes all judicial review.

That is, the

9

question whether the Clean Water Act applied to this

But they asked -- they

2

asked for a hearing.

3

on whether their lands fell within the statute?

4

did ask for a hearing, and the EPA said no.

5

Didn't they ask EPA for a hearing

MR. STEWART:

They

EPA said no to a formal

6

hearing, but I think that would be characteristic agency

7

practice; that is, when the agency is exercising what is

8

essentially its prosecutorial function, that is, warning

9

regulated parties we may do -- we may sue you if you

10

don't do the following things.

11

for enforcement personnel to entertain informal

12

overtures from the regulated party or his legal

13

representative, but I think it would be extraordinary,

14

for instance, for a U.S. Attorney's Office to grant a

15

formal hearing to a potential criminal defendant in

16

order to discuss the -- in order to resolve the question

17

criminal charges should be brought.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It would be quite common

But --

There's -- there's one

19

thing I do want you to tell us is -- EPA has three

20

choices.

21

an administrative -- trigger an administrative penalty

22

when -- where there would be APA review; or it can bring

23

an enforcement action.

24

of those three routes it's going to take in a given

25

case?

It can go to a compliance order; it can issue

How does the agency decide which

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. STEWART:

I think the -- the agency's

2

normal practice would be to issue an administrative

3

compliance order before initiating judicial proceedings.

4

That is, the statute doesn't require it, but the EPA

5

ordinarily would not commence a lawsuit without first

6

giving the regulated party one final opportunity to come

7

into compliance.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what about this

administrative order that -- the administrative order

10

internally within EPA subject to judicial review?

11

does it use that as opposed to a compliance order?

12

MR. STEWART:

It could use that.

When

It would

13

typically use that for violations that it perceived to

14

be less serious.

15

lower than the cap in the judicial enforcement actions.

16

I think it would probably be the case that it would

17

issue an administrative compliance order in those

18

situations as well.

The statutory cap on penalties is much

19

Now, one of the things that the

20

administrative -- the cover letter to the administrative

21

compliance order does say is, even if you comply, you

22

are still not immune from the possibility of enforcement

23

proceedings with respect to past violations.

24

think that's --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I

Can -- can the EPA issue a

44

Alderson Reporting Company

1

warning instead of using this -- this order procedure?

2

Compliance order procedure?

3

MR. STEWART:

Oh, absolutely.

I mean, there

4

is no express statutory authorization for that, but I

5

think most agencies regard it as within their ordinary

6

authority to enforce the statute to send less formal

7

communication.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And doesn't most of --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, they could just -- just

10

dispense with this compliance order and tell the

11

Sacketts, in our view, this is a warning; we believe

12

you're in violation of the Act; and you'll be subject

13

to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for

14

that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our

15

judgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you

16

know, pine trees on the lot.

17
18

20
21

MR. STEWART:
that mechanism.

It could do that?

They could use the letter for

And --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And there would be no

review of that.
MR. STEWART:

We would certainly argue there

22

would be no review of that.

And if the Court said that

23

there was review of the administrative compliance order

24

based on features that were distinct to the order,

25

namely, the fact that it is couched as an order, the
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fact that penalties can be imposed for violation of the

2

order itself, an opinion along those lines wouldn't

3

suggest that.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there anything you've

5

got by -- I mean, I'm -- you've got me now into the

6

area; we're applying the APA; and the question is Abbott

7

Labs and is it final?

8

anything more for the agency to do, and here the -- the

9

person whom the order is directed against is being hurt

10

Well, here there doesn't seem

a lot.

11

So, the only thing I -- left in my mind here

12

is the order itself does say come in and talk to us

13

about this.

14

you have any information on that point?

15

you looked up or has the EPA told you that really when

16

we issue these things, in fact people come in and we

17

modify them X percent of the time?

impression that it's -- in a nontrivial number of cases,

Do they --

MR. STEWART:

that the statistics I do have are that only a very small

3

percentage, you know, a rough estimate somewhere on the

4

order of 3 percent of wetlands-related compliance orders

5

under the Clean Water Act ultimately culminate in

lawsuits for enforcement.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

encompass both the cases in which the landowners came in

and talked to EPA and those in which they just complied.

I'm sorry.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stewart, you suggested

14

that -- that some communication occurs before this

15

compliance order.

16

the back and forth between the agency and the person

17

does happen before the compliance order rather than

18

after.

19

And my guess would be that most of

And the notion that the person can come in

20

after the compliance order and say you were wrong --

21

well, they can, but they can do that with respect to any

22

administrative action.

23

really the back and forth here takes place before the

24

compliance order issues rather than after?

25

So, am I wrong about that?

MR. STEWART:

That

I mean, I think you're right
47


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as a matter of typical agency practice that there would

2

be an invitation well before the compliance order was

3

issued to come in and give your side of the story.

4

you're probably right that, if we got to the point where

5

a compliance order was issued, then the likelihood that

6

further communications would sway the agency

7

substantially might be reduced.

that.

You were cut-off.

You

16

were saying if we were troubled by the additional

17

penalties, and you were going to suggest something.

18

we were troubled by that aspect of the order alone, and

19

you haven't dealt with the permit issue after the fact,

20

what would be your approach to the case then?

21

MR. STEWART:

If

Well, I guess the two things,

22

one of which may be more troubling rather than less

23

troubling, is to say that if you're troubled by this,

24

then there are a lot of other things that might be

25

troubling as well because it's often the case that
48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

warnings are issued to regulated parties, and it's often

2

the case that if the regulated party continues with the

3

conduct after receiving the warning, the penalties may

4

be enhanced.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is not a warning.

I

6

mean, really all you have to do is look at it.

7

quite moved by the fact when I looked at it, it didn't

8

say a warning.

9

extremely formal.

It said this is an order.

It looks

I even overstated in your favor the

10

question of negotiating because it doesn't say

11

negotiating about changing the order; it says

12

negotiating about amending the order.

13

is not just a warning, is it?

14

I was

MR. STEWART:

And -- so, this

It is not -- it is phrased as

15

an order, but the only thing that EPA is authorized to

16

do under section 1319(a)(3) is to order people to do

17

what they were already legally complied -- required to

18

do; that is, order them to comply with their legal

19

obligations.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

Can't you usually obtain a

21

declaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and

22

you think that there is no basis for it, and you

23

can't -- you're not -- you're not compelled to just

24

stand there and wait for the prosecutor to -- to drop

25

the hammer?

Can't you normally bring a declaratory
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

judgment action saying there's no basis for prosecution?
MR. STEWART:

There is no -- the Court has

3

held that there is no constitutional bar to that and

4

that a declaratory judgment remedy can be made available

5

in that circumstance.

6

cause a huge upheaval in the practices of many agencies

7

to say that declaratory relief is --

But, again, I think it would

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. STEWART:

No, but the --

-- typically available when

the agency issues an informal warning.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, in -- maybe with an

12

informal warning, but when you have something as formal

13

as this which shows that the agency does intend to

14

prosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a

15

declaratory judgment action?

16

MR. STEWART:

Again, I don't think that

17

there would be any value to agencies or to regulated

18

parties to encourage the agencies to hedge their bets or

19

to say less than what they really mean.

12

the reasons that we think judicial review of the

make no sense, would be out of keeping with the rest of

the -- the problem, that if Petitioners' claim were

23

reviewable and a court held EPA didn't do sufficient

investigation based on the record before it at the time,

there was no sound basis --

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

That makes the EPA's conduct

2

here even more outrageous:

We -- we think now that this

3

is wetlands that are -- that qualify; so, we're going to

4

hit you with this compliance order, but, you know, when

5

we look into it more thoroughly in the future, we might

6

change our mind.

7

MR. STEWART:

I would assume that any

8

prosecutor, any enforcement person, would want to be

9

better prepared when a case actually went to trial than

10

when he was communicating to the potential defendant

11

that there's a real likelihood that we would sue you.

MR. SCHIFF:

I think, Justice Breyer, the --

14

the fear of it being too pro-homeowner is in fact

15

protected by the fact of the APA standard of review.

16

We're not talking about -- about the agency being forced

17

to sort of --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but maybe the agency

19

is only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a

20

record.

21

reason to give it deference.

22

When it hasn't made a record, maybe there's no

MR. SCHIFF:

You're correct, Justice Scalia.

23

If there is no record, certainly there's by necessity no

24

substantial evidence, and in that case, the compliance

25

order would be -56

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, they might -- the

2

might change their -- their system here, if you -- if

3

you win this, and provide for various kinds of pre-order

4

procedure or post-order procedure where they'd be open

5

to change.

6

their dilemma.

7

9

I see a number of possibilities.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I can see

But they'll just issue

warnings, is what they'll do.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there cases in the

10

courts of appeals or the district courts where

11

landowners, having received these notices or compliance

12

orders, have said that there's a taking of the property,

13

inverse condemnation?

14

MR. SCHIFF:

I'm not aware of that, Your

15

Honor, but -- Justice Kennedy, but, as this Court I

16

believe held in Riverside Bayview, a takings claim under

17

the Clean Water Act is not considered ripe until a

18

permit application has been -- has been attempted.

19

Now, if a compliance order is issued, then

20

the permit application might be off the table.

21

fact, one could see that a compliance order might

22

potentially have a total taking effect in this case.

23

And, in

But certainly, at this point, we are willing

24

to let EPA have the power.

Yes, let EPA administer the

25

Act and issue compliance orders, but let's also give

landowners a fair shake, too.

2

in court to contest what the agency has done.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let them have their day

Mr. Schiff, I take it -- the

4

Government agrees that there's not much of a chance that

5

you could get an after-the-fact permit, but its view is

6

you should have gotten a before-the-fact permit.

7

putting aside the weirdness which Justice Alito points

8

out of making you go get a permit for something you

9

don't think you need a permit for -- putting that aside,

And

10

couldn't you have gotten the legal determination that

11

you wanted through that process?

12

MR. SCHIFF:

We -- Justice Kagan, we don't

13

deny that by applying for a permit and having the Corps

14

make a decision on the permit that that's one way to get

15

into court.

16

for, you know, the thousands of folks in this country

17

who are recipients of compliance orders is that that's

18

small or no solace once EPA has already acted, you know,

19

once EPA has made the finding of violation and then

20

threatens these ruinous penalties on -- on landowners.

21

But the difficulty for the Sacketts and

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think what EPA is

22

saying is, as long as you knew that your lands were

23

potentially wetlands, you could have gone in from the

24

get-go and -- and sought a determination that they were

25

not wetlands through the permit process.
58

MR. SCHIFF:

That's correct, Justice Kagan.

2

But, frankly, the way EPA and the Corps interpret the

3

scope of their jurisdiction, that would make essentially

4

every landowner in this country potentially on notice

5

requiring them to apply for a permit or some other

6

manner, and the agency will then probably have even a

7

worse situation; it will be flooded by permits.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
