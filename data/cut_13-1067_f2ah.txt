3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  We'll hear argument

4

first this morning, first this term, in Case 131067,

5

OBB Personenverkehr v. Sachs.

6

            Mr. Basombrio.

7

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUAN C. BASOMBRIO

8

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10

it please the Court:

11

            This personal injury action is based upon an

12

accident that occurred in Austria.  If this Court

13

agrees, there's no need to reach the other question

14

related to agency, so I will start first with the

15

basedupon issue.

16

            In Nelson, this Court set forth a framework

17

to analyze the basedupon question.  And this Court held

18

that courts must begin their analysis by identifying the

19

particular conduct on which the action is based.  The

20

decision uses words such as basis, foundation, and

21

gravamen.  So here 

22

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But in  in that case,

23

there was a distinction between State activity  that

24

is, police activity  and the commercial activity in

25

hiring the plaintiff.  Here, I think it's conceded that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

the activity  running a railroad  that's commercial.

2

So we don't have the commercial/State action division.

3

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor, that's

4

correct.  Here, there are two alleged commercial

5

activities.  One of them is the sale of the ticket in

6

the United States, and the other one are the acts and

7

omissions that resulted in the accident in Austria.

8

            So what I would suggest is that we look at

9

the complaint and see what it is that the plaintiff has

10

alleged.

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just as a matter of

12

background, suppose a hypothetical case  no foreign

13

sovereign.  It was a private corporation in Austria.

14

Would there then be jurisdiction under the Due Process

15

Clause in your view?  You don't have to prevail on  on

16

that issue, but as a background issue, what  do you

17

have a position?

18

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Our position is that if OBB

19

was a private entity, there would not be jurisdiction

20

over OBB.  There would not be general jurisdiction after

21

this Court holding in Daimler and there would also 

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And Daimler is your best

23

case for that proposition?

24

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor.

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Do  do you think that it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

the same test?  In other words, is the test a specific

2

jurisdiction test here, basedon, arisingfrom, that we

3

are basically asking the same question as we would be

4

asking if this were a  a foreign corporation?

5

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  I don't believe so, Your

6

Honor.  Let me explain, if I may, why not.  Congress

7

could have chosen that wording in the personal

8

jurisdiction analysis in the case law, but they decided

9

on another phrase, basedupon, instead.  So I believe

10

that what this Court needs to do is give some

11

guidance 

12

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but why  I mean, it

13

doesn't seem to me that that wording is very different

14

from the wording that we've used in specific

15

jurisdiction cases.  The wording here is "based on" 

16

we've used "arising out of."  Sometimes we've used

17

"related to."  In some respects  I mean, it's pretty

18

clear that the FSIA is meant to ensure that when a

19

foreign government is acting as a commercial actor, it

20

gets treated like a foreign corporation.  And the

21

language here is very similar, right?  There's the

22

insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact,

23

and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of

24

relationship between that contact  contact and the

25

claim.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

            So it seems  I guess the question is:  Why

2

should we think of these two questions as at all

3

different?  And I don't know, by the way, I mean, that

4

it would hurt you if they were the same, because it

5

might just be there would be no specific jurisdiction

6

here, you know?  But I guess I'm having trouble of

7

thinking why it is that there  that there would be a

8

different test.

9

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  The reason why is because

10

the FSIA takes place of the  both the subject matter

11

jurisdiction analysis and the personal jurisdiction

12

analysis.  Both are combined into one test.  So although

13

I would agree certainly that some aspects of the

14

personal jurisdictional analysis are part of that test,

15

it goes beyond that.  It also goes into subject matter

16

jurisdiction which is a different set of policy

17

determinations that Congress made that are in some way

18

overlapping of the personal jurisdiction questions, but

19

I don't think they're completely aligned.

20

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm  I'm sorry.

21

I'm  I don't even understand why we're talking about

22

basedupon.

23

            As Justice Ginsburg said, there's no dispute

24

here that whether the basedupon is the ticket sale or

25

the operation of the train, both of them are commercial

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

activities.

2

            Isn't the work in substantial contact with

3

the United States?  Isn't that what we should be looking

4

at instead?  Was this commercial activity substantial

5

enough?  The operation of the train and the ticket sale

6

here, did it have a substantial contact with the

7

United States?

8

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  There's a threestep

9

analysis, Your Honor, in Nelson.  First, you have to

10

identify the particular conduct, the actions, not the

11

causes of action, which is what the en banc court did.

12

They focused on the legal claims.

13

            This Court said you have to focus on the

14

acts.  Here, the acts 

15

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So we did that in the

16

context of deciding when something was a sovereign act

17

as opposed to a commercial act.  We know this is a

18

commercial act.

19

            So  and we  I'm just confused.  Why

20

isn't the work  why shouldn't the work be done by

21

substantial contact with the U.S.?

22

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  It's a threestep analysis.

23

First, you identify the activity.  Secondly, you decide

24

whether it is commercial or not.

25

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Whether it's 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  And third, whether there's

2

substantial contact.

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   commercial or

4

sovereign.

5

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  So there are three steps.

6

            What I'm saying is that the Ninth Circuit

7

erred.  They didn't look at the conduct first.  They

8

looked at the legal claims.  If you look at the 

9

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Even if they had looked

10

at the conduct, it's commercial.

11

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  It's commercial.  But if you

12

look at the conduct and you identify it as the accident

13

in Austria  which is what the plaintiff claimed.  In

14

JA 15, paragraphs 3 to 8, they alleged that there was an

15

unsafe boarding platform, a gap at the platform,

16

et cetera, et cetera.

17

            All of these things happened in Austria 

18

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But how do you propose 

19

how do you propose that we determine whether it's based

20

on commercial activity?

21

            Take their failuretowarn claim.  Why isn't

22

that based on something that occurred in the

23

United States?  You're just  are you just asking us

24

to  to step back and say, well, in that case we  we

25

really think they're just trying  they have a  they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

have a tort that occurred in Austria, a negligence tort

2

that occurred in Austria, and they're just trying to

3

plead around it with these other claims?

4

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, there's no allegation

5

in the Complaint that the failure to warn was something

6

that happened in the United States.  It's found in the

7

same set of paragraphs, 3 through 8, that relate to the

8

acts and omissions in Austria.

9

            It also would make no sense to argue that

10

there was a failure to warn in the United States because

11

that would mean that the Eurail Pass itself would have

12

to warn about all conditions at hundreds of potential

13

railroad stations in Europe.

14

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it might be  it

15

might be a claim that couldn't prevail, but why does

16

that answer the question?

17

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, the failure to warn

18

that's alleged relates to the facts that arise in

19

Austria, and, therefore, the cause of action arises in

20

Austria because that's where the acts or omissions

21

occurred if  if one looks at what's alleged in the

22

Complaint itself.

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Would  would you agree

24

and  and, as you've been doing, take out the agency

25

question  but would you agree if  if what had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

happened here was that the ticket was not honored.  You

2

know, the plaintiff bought a ticket, and the ticket was

3

not honored, and  and the suit was where the ticket

4

was purchased, would you agree that that's basedon?

5

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  If this was a breach of

6

contract case 

7

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Just a breach of contract

8

case.

9

            MR. BASOMBRIO:   and the breach  the

10

allegation of the breach was that when the Respondent

11

showed up they did not honor the ticket, that would be

12

based upon an activity in Austria because it's in

13

Austria that that ticket got honored.

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  In Austria, even though she

15

bought the ticket in the United States?  You think even

16

the breach of contract case could not be brought in the

17

United States?

18

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Correct, because the  the

19

wrongful act, the breach, arises in Austria.

20

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What about 

21

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we disagree

22

with that 

23

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  I'm sorry?

24

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we disagree with

25

that answer?  Do you lose the case?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  I'm sorry?

2

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose we disagree with

3

the answer that you gave to Justice Kagan.  Suppose we

4

disagree that that suit has to be in Austria.  Can you

5

still prevail on the facts of this case?

6

            The hypothetical was the ticket is not

7

honored.  Suppose we disagree with your answer.  Can you

8

still prevail on the facts that it  that it did, in

9

fact, occur in this case?

10

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, but I would still

11

prevail based on the agency argument that we have

12

presented.

13

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  On what 

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But you 

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Could you go back and

16

explain to me what  I'm sorry.

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you'd lose on  on

18

the other point.

19

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You  you acknowledge that

21

you would lose on the other point if  if that

22

hypothetical came out the other way?

23

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  No, I do not.

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Oh.

25

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  I believe  let me clarify,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

Your Honor, if I may.

2

            My answer to Justice  Justice Kagan was

3

that I believe that a breach of contract claim for

4

dishonor of the ticket in Austria has to be brought in

5

Austria.

6

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Because 

7

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Justice  because that's

8

where the breach occurred that gives rise to the cause

9

of action.

10

            Justice Kennedy said to me, suppose that we

11

disagree with you, can you still win the case?  And my

12

answer was, I could still win, I believe, under the

13

agency alternative argument.

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not 

15

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What about apart 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   not under  under the

17

argument you're  you're first making?

18

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Not if the Court ruled

19

against me, no.  But I believe 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  On that  why?  Why?  I

21

mean, couldn't  couldn't you make the argument that

22

the question ought to be decided not  not by where

23

the  where the contract was breached but where the

24

contract was made?  I mean, we could hold  we could

25

hold that, and that would not affect your case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  That's true.  I  I do not

2

believe that a breach of contract claim under the fact

3

scenario that you provided, Your Honor, would give rise

4

to a claim in the United States because the breach

5

happened  would have happened in Austria.

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Counsel, I want to come

7

back to Justice Kagan's speculation of  of whether

8

basedon is  is nothing more than due process.

9

            It seems to me that the definition of

10

commercial activity carried on in the United States by a

11

foreign state is the due process test.  The definition

12

is, "A commercial activity carried on in the

13

United States by a foreign state means commercial

14

activity carried on by such state and having substantial

15

contact with the United States."  That sounds to me

16

like  like the due process test.

17

            But what is required here is not just a

18

commercial activity carried on in the United States, it

19

has to be based on a commercial activity carried on in

20

the United States.  And it seems to me that is

21

something  something added to the  to the

22

constitutional test.

23

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor.  And that's

24

why I started my discussion by referring to this

25

holding  the holding of this Court in Nelson which has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

to look at the particular conduct.

2

            The particular conduct at issue is not the

3

sale of the ticket, it's the acts and omissions that

4

resulted in the accident in Austria.

5

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  What  what if

6

there are acts or omissions in two  let's say you have

7

a flight from New York to Vienna.  And in New York,

8

someone negligently sets or whatever they do with the

9

landing gear, okay?

10

            So then the plane takes off, and then in

11

Vienna, because of the negligence in New York, it's a

12

rough landing, somebody gets a concussion.

13

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Uhhuh.

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Where is the

15

gravamen of the action in that case?  Can you bring that

16

in  in the United States?

17

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Potentially, you could bring

18

it in the United States.  And the difference between

19

your scenario and this case is that in that scenario,

20

the service was provided, started in  starting in the

21

United States.  There's contact with the United States

22

because the foreign airline came here and conducted a

23

commercial activity in the United States.

24

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Because it's 

25

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  That's what different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:   a typical tort.  If

2

the negligence occurs in one place, and the impact is

3

the other, you could bring the suit in either place, as

4

far as our notions of personal jurisdictions, either

5

injury in the state or conduct in the state causing

6

injury outside it.  Those are typical longarm bases of

7

jurisdictions.

8

            So the Chief's hypothetical where the

9

negligence occurred in the United States, that you agree

10

would be a case that could be brought in the

11

United States because the relevant conduct occurred

12

there.

13

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Correct, in that case 

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, correct.  I

15

don't understand, then, what gravamen means in the

16

Nelson decision.  Gravamen means one place, right?

17

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

18

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Or do you think you

19

could have a lot of different  I mean, if it's the

20

gravamen of your complaint, I think you have to choose,

21

don't you, one or the other?

22

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, I would  I was  I

23

would understand your example, Chief Justice, to mean

24

that the act that caused the injury was whatever they

25

didn't do upon takeoff to the plane, or  or  as I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

understood your example, that cause of that injury was

2

in the United States.

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So can you have more

4

than one place under the basedupon analysis in Nelson,

5

or has you  have you got to decide there's only one

6

place where you could bring the action?

7

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, the airline example 

8

and this is something I thought about.  It's somewhat a

9

complicated example because we have conventions,

10

international treaties that deal with  with airline

11

cases.

12

            I would imagine that, theoretically, there

13

could be one more  more than one location, but not on

14

the facts of this case.

15

            JUSTICE ALITO:  In the Chief Justice's

16

example, he  he stated that there was negligence in

17

the United States.  But what if there's no evidence of

18

that?

19

            There's a  there's a problem with the

20

landing gear when the plane lands in Austria, and the

21

claim is that there was a failure to inspect in the

22

United States, or a failure to do proper maintenance in

23

the United States.  Would that be different?

24

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  That may be different.

25

Again, because the transportation was provided from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

United States geographically, there  there is no doubt

2

in that question that commercial act was carried on in

3

the United States by the airline.  And that's different

4

here.

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I suppose it's  it's 

6

it's proper to say that where you have negligence that

7

causes an injury, the  the complaint is based on both.

8

You  you don't have liability without the negligence.

9

You don't have liability without the injury.  So why

10

can't you say basedon, in  in that situation, would

11

enable either one to  to sustain the cause of action?

12

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  In the airplane example,

13

perhaps either jurisdiction.  In this example, if you

14

look at the Complaint  and we're guided by the

15

allegations of the Complaint, it is  the acts are only

16

alleged to have happened and the omissions to have

17

happened 

18

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Getting back to our

19

earlier discussion, questions from me and from Justice

20

Kagan, it seemed to me you have to say the due process

21

analysis is insufficient under this statute because 

22

then fill in the blank.  And Justice Scalia was asking

23

you the same question.

24

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yeah.

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  One  one answer might be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

because otherwise there would be no necessity for a

2

statute.  Due process applies anyway.  But the

3

counterargument is, well, there has to be because the

4

statute makes the distinction between sovereign and

5

commercial and so it has a real purpose.

6

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.  The due process

7

analysis is incorporated into the statute, but it's not

8

the only thing to think about.  For example 

9

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  You did answer, I

10

think  you did answer, rendering Justice Kennedy's

11

question somewhat academic, that there would be no

12

specific jurisdiction in the United States if all that

13

happened here was a ticket purchase from an agent where

14

the injurious conduct occurred abroad and the railroad

15

operates solely abroad.

16

            You answered that whether it were the due

17

process specific jurisdiction inquiry or the Foreign

18

Sovereign Immunities Act, the answer would be the same,

19

that the ticket sale in the United States was not

20

enough.

21

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, Your Honor.

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But, of course, my

23

question was suppose that the due process analysis is

24

sufficient to sustain jurisdiction.  Then what?  Then

25

does basedon still have a separate meaning as a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

separate requirement that has to be met and has not been

2

met here?  And if so, why?

3

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  It has not been met here

4

because from a general jurisdictional perspective 

5

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But not general

6

jurisdiction.

7

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  I was really talking about

9

specific jurisdiction.

10

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Okay.

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And, of course, Justice

12

Scalia is absolutely right with respect to general

13

jurisdiction, that all you look at is the contacts.  But

14

with respect to specific jurisdiction  this is a

15

company that doesn't have pervasive contacts 

16

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

17

            JUSTICE KAGAN:   it's critical to the due

18

process analysis that there be a relationship, and a

19

real relationship between the particular contact with

20

the United States and the lawsuit in the exact same way

21

that this statute focuses on.

22

            And so, again, I don't know if it hurts you.

23

It might be, as Justice Ginsburg says, that there

24

wouldn't be specific jurisdiction here for a

25

corporation.  But  but  but why shouldn't we treat

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

those two things exactly the same way?

2

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  There is  there is  if I

3

may answer that two parts of your question.  First,

4

there is no specific jurisdiction if OBB were a private

5

entity because the Respondent is not suing for breach of

6

the ticket; it's not alleging that it was not honored.

7

She's suing for something that happened in Austria.  The

8

specific acts happened outside the United States.

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  Well, that's an answer

10

for why there is no specific jurisdiction here.

11

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

12

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And you can make the exact

13

same answer in the completely private context.  And

14

you 

15

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  could well be right.  I'm

17

want to ask Mr. Fisher about that.

18

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Right.

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it's not an answer for

20

why the tests should be different.

21

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  The test  the test  my

22

belief is that the test should incorporate due process

23

analysis.  But because we are also dealing with subject

24

matter jurisdiction, which is a different analysis than

25

personal jurisdiction, there are other policy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

considerations.

2

            The policy considerations decisions that

3

Congress made were based on territory.  If one want 

4

if one looks at the first, the second, and the third

5

clause, they're all territorybased distinctions.  In 

6

in the case Amerada Hess, this Court held that tort

7

actions are meant to be encompassed by the second

8

section of the  of the exception, the non 

9

noncommercial torts exception.  That requires that the

10

tort happened in the United States in order to be  to

11

have subject matter on personal jurisdiction.  It

12

wouldn't fit here.

13

            Justice Ginsburg referred to direct effects.

14

That would come under the third clause, which deals with

15

commercial activity outside of the U.S.; again, a

16

territorial line, having an effect here.

17

            The first clause draws the territorial line

18

here and says that commercial activity has to happen in

19

this side of the line within the United States.  And

20

that's what we don't have here.

21

            I would like to 

22

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What provision are you 

23

what provision are you referring to?

24

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  I'm pro  referring to the

25

first clause of the commercial activity exception, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

it requires that the commercial activity be conducted,

2

carried out in the United States.  That means that

3

within the territory of the United States.  And I

4

reached that conclusion by comparing it to the third

5

clause, which refers to commercial activity outside of

6

the United States having a direct effect in the

7

United States, Your Honor.

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I see.

9

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Now if I may just say one

10

point about agency.  There is no dispute here that if

11

the definition in the Act applies, RP doesn't fit within

12

it.

13

            Now, this Court has recently held that we

14

are guided by the language of the statute.  I understand

15

that arguments have been made by my colleagues and also

16

by the Ninth Circuit that there is a difference between

17

invocation of immunity and attribution.  This is the

18

point I want to make.  Section 1604 is the invocation

19

section.  That's the section that states that certain

20

people, those defined as the foreign state, can invoke

21

immunity.

22

            Section 1605 is an attribution section.  It

23

says whose acts deprive you of immunity.  And because

24

foreign state is a defined term, we are limited to the

25

limitations in the FSIA.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

            In the alternative, if this Court were to

2

move away from the definition, I believe we would all

3

agree that there has to be some element of control.  The

4

test that this Court develops for agent has to have

5

either the degree of control in Bancec or something

6

lesser.  But all agency law requires control, and that's

7

where the en banc court missed the mark.  They didn't

8

require any control.  And if one requires control, it

9

has to be reversed because there was no control here.

10

            If there are no pending questions, I would

11

appreciate reserving the balance of my time for

12

rebuttal.

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

14

            Mr. Kneedler.

15

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

16

   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

17

                  SUPPORTING REVERSAL

18

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19

please the Court:

20

            I'd like to start with the point about

21

whether the FSIA simply incorporates due process

22

standards, and we think it does not.  It contains its

23

own statutory terms which require interpretation.

24

Congress did not simply incorporate the D.C. LongArm

25

Statute or due process principles or phrase the  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

statute in that way.  It enacted specific statutory

2

terms.  And it's 

3

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So is it the basedupon

4

language or the substantialcontext language?

5

            MR. KNEEDLER:  It's both.  It's both and in

6

the  in the United States, which is an important point

7

I want to make.  The  one of the reasons it's very

8

different from just due process is because this  the

9

FSIA governs subject matter jurisdiction and personal

10

jurisdiction to be sure, but based  based upon a

11

determination of immunity of a foreign state.  And it

12

does that by drawing, as was mentioned before, a strict

13

territorial line that runs throughout all the

14

exceptions.  For example, the intentional  the tort

15

exception applies only to torts in the United States.

16

And the property exception concerns property in the

17

United States.  And the focus of the commercial activity

18

exception is also, at least under clause one  well,

19

all of them  but clause one is commercial activity in

20

the United States that also has a substantial

21

connection, but the action has to be based upon, as

22

Justice Scalia pointed out.

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, but how is basedupon

24

different from the language we routinely use in specific

25

jurisdiction cases?  In other words, it just seems as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

though Congress, in line with its objective of treating

2

foreign government engaging in commercial activity in

3

the same way as they would be treated in the foreign

4

corporations case, in line with that objective, used

5

language that's virtually synonymous with the language

6

that we use in specific jurisdiction cases.

7

            MR. KNEEDLER:  But  but it  it did it in

8

the context of a statutory structure that is designed to

9

protect foreign sovereign immunity and not to draw U.S.

10

courts into what could be very sensitive international

11

questions of having U.S. courts pass judgment on what

12

happens in a foreign country.  For example 

13

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, except it did so in

14

the context of distinguishing between commercial

15

activity and sovereign activity.

16

            MR. KNEEDLER:  In  in Nelson  actually,

17

the pertinent paragraph in Nelson that discusses

18

basedupon, as counsel pointed out, the Court said you

19

start with what is the conduct that  that the suit is

20

based upon.  And the Court said the conduct there was

21

the conduct that took place in Saudi Arabia.  And then

22

it had a discussion that said, to be sure, there was

23

recruitment that  that preceded that, and that

24

recruitment put the employee in the position to be in

25

the hospital in Saudi Arabia where the conduct occurred.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

            But the focus was on, as the Court said,

2

those torts in Saudi Arabia, not the  not the

3

antecedent commercial activity in the United States.

4

That discussion in the Court's opinion preceded its

5

discussion of the distinction between commercial

6

activity and  and sovereign activity.  It had to do

7

what  with what is the focus of the claim.  And there

8

the Court was focusing on tort claims that happened

9

outside the United States.  And we think it's very

10

important in this case to distinguish between tort

11

claims and contract claims.

12

            JUSTICE ALITO:  What if you have a tort

13

claim that has one element in the United States?  How

14

do  how does a court determine whether the gravamen of

15

the claim is in the United States or elsewhere?

16

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think  I think focusing

17

on what  on what the defendant's conduct is that

18

actually caused the injury.  And here, the  the only

19

difference between this case and Nelson is the argument

20

that the purchase of the ticket, which is the  by the

21

way, the only commercial activity that was relied upon

22

below.  The Ninth Circuit says this at Phaneuf 13 and

23

Footnote 4.  Respondent is now trying to broaden that

24

into the entire operations of the railroad which would

25

actually be an assertion of general jurisdiction.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

Anything that would arise in the operation of a railroad

2

in  in Austria could be the subject of a suit if it

3

was deemed to have substantial connection with the

4

United States.

5

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If we want to give

6

basedupon a separate substantive effect in this statute

7

and so that it means something more substantial than

8

mere due  than what would suffice for due process,

9

what  what body of law, case law do we look to?

10

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, I think in Nelson 

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  If I want to find out

12

about basedon, what kind of cases am I supposed to

13

read?

14

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well  well  and Nelson

15

itself, I think, is very instructive on this because,

16

first of all, the Court in Nelson did not  did not

17

describe what it was doing as simply applying due

18

process standards.  It was applying the statutory terms.

19

And it  again, it  it focused on the particular

20

conduct  and this goes to Justice Alito's question as

21

well  it focused on the conduct that really caused the

22

injury, which in that case was the  were the

23

intentional torts 

24

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So Mr. 

25

            MR. KNEEDLER:   that happened in Saudi

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

Arabia.

2

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  In  in my contract hypo,

3

if the  if the suit was a breach of contract action,

4

do you think it would be basedupon?  Just a straight,

5

like, you don't  you didn't honor my ticket?

6

            MR. KNEEDLER:  On  on a contract claim, I

7

think that there well  may well be a contract claim

8

here.  But I think it's important to recognize that a

9

breach of contract claim, just because there is some

10

connection with the United States, does not

11

automatically  even for due process purposes, some

12

connection of a contract to the forum is not enough.

13

The Court made that point in Burger King about contracts

14

which was discussed in the  in the Court's Walden v.

15

Fiore case.

16

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Kneedler, before

17

you  before you finish, you bring up an interest in

18

relations with other nations.

19

            Do you know  I mean, there are other

20

nations that have similar legislation to the Foreign

21

Sovereign Immunities Act.  Do we know how this case

22

would come out, say, in Canada, Germany, or France under

23

similar legislation?

24

            MR. KNEEDLER:  The European Convention

25

provides for jurisdiction over tort claims, which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

this  which this basically is, only with respect to

2

torts that arise in the territory, which is  which is

3

the case here in our own tort exception, which is an

4

important  going back to Justice Kagan's question 

5

an important reason why this is different from due

6

process.

7

            Tort claims under the FSIA, under  under

8

Exemption (5), Paragraph (a)(5), arise only when the

9

tort occurs in the United States.  And even business

10

torts  the House Report refers to business torts in

11

the United States because there was a  Congress was

12

drawing a territorial line.  And we 

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The Netherlands  the

14

Netherlands and Switzerland have filed a brief, haven't

15

they, in which they said that this injury, the claim

16

that's pursued against here, the facts that underlie it,

17

are based upon activity that took place in Switzerland.

18

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.

19

            JUSTICE BREYER:  In Austria.

20

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And so they wouldn't 

22

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Right.

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:   under their law.

24

            Is there any indication  I saw none in any

25

of these briefs  that there's any country in the world

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

that would reach a different result?

2

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I  as far as  

3

            JUSTICE BREYER:  They've put lawyers on both

4

sides, and I'm sure one of the lawyers would have told

5

us if they'd found a country that would have reached 

6

            MR. KNEEDLER:  And this 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:   result.

8

            MR. KNEEDLER:  The same general point is

9

true in the UN convention on  on immunity with respect

10

to tort claims 

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Kneedler, how about 

12

there is a contract claim in this lawsuit, so there is

13

a  is a kind of warranty of fitness kind of claim.

14

How  how about that?  Why  if you think that the 

15

let's assume that the contract claim, which is like you

16

didn't honor my ticket, that there would be personal

17

jurisdiction over, how do we separate out the warranty

18

of habitability or fitness claim?

19

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Because I think  I think

20

that's very parallel to what this Court confronted in

21

the Nelson case where the  the Court said the failure

22

to warn  there was a claim there too, a failure to

23

warn about the hazard  about the potential tort.  And

24

the  and the court said, it  it would not recognize

25

jurisdiction by that sort of feint of language.  You

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

can't recharacterize something that is basically a tort

2

abroad by claiming that there was a failure to warn 

3

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is  is that a typical

4

thing 

5

            MR. KNEEDLER:  about the tort.  We think

6

that's true here.

7

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Is that a typical thing or

8

an unusual thing to do in jurisdiction cases?  In other

9

words, to say, we're just not going to look at this

10

claim by claim, we're going to ask about the whole gist

11

of the lawsuit.

12

            MR. KNEEDLER:  We think that, at least for

13

tort claims, that, again, under our  our position you

14

look at the foundation of the claim, the gravamen of the

15

claim.  And applying that principle to tort claims,

16

anyway, it's proper to look about where  where the

17

conduct occurred, the tortious  the injurycausing

18

conduct occurred rather than the injury itself?

19

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Can the gravamen be in more

20

than one place?

21

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Pardon me?

22

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is  the basedupon

23

language, does it identify a single place, or could it

24

be basedupon activity in  in two jurisdictions?

25

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Well, it  it could be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

basedupon activity in two jurisdiction  two

2

jurisdictions.  The House Report describing this talks

3

about commercial activities occurring in whole or in

4

part in the United States.

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But not in the airline

6

case.  You would not say that the airline case, the

7

gravamen was the negligence in the United States and the

8

injury when the plane landed?

9

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think, depending on where

10

the tort occurred, it may  it may just be in the place

11

where the  where the negligence occurred.

12

            But I do want to say that for airlines 

13

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It can't be both?

14

            MR. KNEEDLER:  Oh, it could be  it could

15

be because the question under the FSIA is whether you

16

can sue in the United States.  Whether you can sue

17

abroad is not determined by basedupon language in

18

the  in the FSIA.

19

            But the  with respect to airlines,

20

those  those are covered by the Montreal Protocol

21

which provides a variety of jurisdictions for suits to

22

be brought 

23

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, you're not

24

suggesting the result be different if it were a boat,

25

are you?

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well 

3

            MR. KNEEDLER:  No, but I  but the

with 

6

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If this was a private

8

            MR. KNEEDLER:   an airline.

9

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In your hypothetical.

10

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   would there be

11

jurisdiction here?

12

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I'm sorry?

13

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  If this were a private

14

company, not the state, would there be jurisdiction

15

here?

16

            MR. KNEEDLER:  I think probably not, but

17

I  but I think it's  I think it would be a good idea

18

for the Court not to address the due process and just

19

focus on the  on the statutory terms here, because the

20

question  question of virtual presence by purchasing a

21

ticket on the Internet can arise in all sorts of ways

22

for due process purposes in private cases.  And  and

23

here, we have a statute to focus on.

           ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

3

              ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4

            MR. FISHER:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

please the Court:

6

            I'd like to start with Justice Sotomayor's

7

question which I think has been asked a couple of other

8

times today, which is, what would the answer be if this

9

were a private defendant?  And in footnote 11 of our

10

brief on page 33, we explain why the answer would be

11

that there would be specific jurisdiction.

12

            And in the GibsonDunn amicus brief at pages

13

25 to 29 they give a fuller explanation.  No response 

14

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Why  why, Mr. Fisher?

15

There is one contact with the United States.  A pass is

16

bought from a travel agent in Massachusetts, a pass

17

covering 30odd railroads.  That's all that happened in

18

the United States.  All of the relevant conduct, the

19

tortious conduct occurred abroad.

20

            I don't know of a single case where we have

21

said specific jurisdiction can be based on a connection

22

that had nothing to do with the injurious conduct.

23

            MR. FISHER:  But, Justice Ginsburg, I think

24

there are plenty of cases that support the proposition

25

that when a company markets and sells a product in a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

jurisdiction, that creates specific jurisdiction.

2

That's what OBB did through its agent, RPE, is market

3

and sell its product.

4

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but not for everything.

5

I mean, let's assume this.  Let's assume that I get a

6

brochure from the Vienna Opera Company, and I send back

7

the order form, I'd like to buy tickets, okay?  Now, for

8

sure, if the Vienna Opera Company refused to honor my

9

tickets, I have a claim, and it arises out of the fact

10

that they have marketed my tickets in the United States.

11

            But now they honor my tickets, and I go up

12

the stairs, and I slip in a puddle, and I injure myself.

13

What does that have to do with the only contact that

14

they've in the United States?  I mean, at that point,

15

you're just saying it's a butfor test, and everything

16

would be included.  But I don't know of a sensible

17

specific jurisdiction analysis that would  that would

18

run like that.

19

            MR. FISHER:  I agree with everything you

20

said.  But this case is different because our lawsuit is

21

based on the duty of safe passage that gave rise in that

22

sale  in that ticket sale.  So we're suing based on

23

the promise and the offer 

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  In the  in the Austrian

25

case of the Opera, there is an implied warranty that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

Opera is fit for the purposes  the opera house is fit

2

for the purposes which it serves.  Okay?  Same thing.

3

Not too hard to draft that.

4

            MR. FISHER:  I'm not sure.  And if somebody

5

did draft that, it would certainly be subject to a

6

12(b)(6) 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the difference

8

between saying that they have to warrant their product,

9

which is an opera house, to be safe, to say that they

10

have to warrant their trains safe for  for passage?  I

11

can't see a difference.  And it seems to me it's very

12

normal in a contract to say that the seller of the

13

product is implicitly warranting fitness.  Isn't it?

14

            MR. FISHER:  Well, all I can say is in this

15

case, we're suing on the exact warranty that gives rise

16

from this ticket sale, Justice Breyer.  And I think 

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  That's  that's the

18

problem.  I take it to go back to the questions you were

19

asked, from your answer, you have found no case in any

20

country where a waiver of sovereign immunity based on

21

commercial activity supports you.  And if so, what is

22

that case?  Switzerland and Britain  or rather,

23

Netherlands, say no.  The EU Treaty says no.  The

24

UN Charter says no.  And they have all these lists of

25

language which, while not absolutely against you, leans

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

against you.

2

            So I want to know what is there, in the law

3

of sovereign immunity particularly, that argue  leans

4

in your favor.

5

            MR. FISHER:  So, Justice Breyer, to  let

6

me be clear about what is and is not in that brief.

7

There are no cases that I don't think any party has

8

cited.  What the  what that brief says is that based

9

on the language in various conventions, that this claim

10

wouldn't be able to be brought somewhere else.  But the

11

language in those conventions are things like arise

12

under, based upon, and so you basically end up in the

13

same situation as you are here which is having to decide

14

whether this claim can be brought.

15

            Remember that brief also alleges and it

16

actually spends more time alleging that there is no

17

proper principleagent relationship, which I think is 

18

the Court has probably realized is not a very credible

19

argument.  So I think you should be careful about

20

putting too much weight on a brief that simply cites

21

some treaty language.

22

            But I think the point I want to make, and

23

this  for the hypotheticals and to bring it back to my

24

case, and I also tie in the contract 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  But I'm taking your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

answer to my question being we have none.

2

            MR. FISHER:  We have none, and they have

3

none.  I have not found 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  Okay.  All

5

right.

6

            MR. FISHER:  You can ask him on rebuttal.

7

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Could you tell me, your

8

adversary claims you've been trying to change what your

9

claim is.  Is it based on the ticket sale?  Or is it

10

based on the operation of the train?

11

            MR. FISHER:  I think the better reading of

12

the word "activity" in the statute for the reasons we

13

describe in our brief is the overall integrated activity

14

of running the railway train enterprise, which includes

15

selling the product and delivering the product.

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I see our interests, but

17

I'm thinking there are 190someodd countries in the

18

world.  Many of them do have governments that run

19

various kinds of enterprises.  When they come to the

20

United States, perhaps not being totally conversant with

21

American law, they might think if my commercial activity

22

in the United States really gives rise to some problem

23

in the United States, I expect to be sued.  But where

24

what really gives rise to it  you see, I have to use

25

language like that  takes place in my country, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

expect it will be my courts that will deal with it.

2

            MR. FISHER:  Well, I don't know why any

3

country would have thought that about this country's

4

law, because before this  you know, up until this

5

point, the law in the lower courts, the D.C. Circuit and

6

the Second Circuit, and most  most specifically, have

7

held that in this exact situation, there is

8

jurisdiction.

9

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, maybe 

10

            MR. FISHER:  And Justice Breyer 

11

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   they would've

12

read  if they had read our opinion in Nelson, that

13

would have given them a good inclination to read

14

sovereign immunity the way Justice Breyer suggests.

15

            MR. FISHER:  No.  I'm glad you asked about

16

Nelson, Mr. Chief Justice, because the paragraph in

17

Nelson that Mr. Kneedler is referring to is

18

distinguishing sovereign activity from commercial

19

activity.  The Court in Nelson did not have before it

20

and was not concerned with the geographic nexus, and you

21

know that because in that paragraph where it lists the

22

things upon which the Nelsons' claim is not truly based,

23

it lists not only the recruitment in the United States

24

but the actual employment in Saudi Arabia.

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, he has a paragraph in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

Nelson, one sentence of which helps you, that he says

2

the Nelsons  you know, they negotiated with the

3

Nelsons in the United States.  They entered into a

4

contract in the United States.  The Nelsons are heard

5

aborad.  I take it that's the basis of it, and this

6

helps you.

7

            But he says before even taking each of the

8

Nelsons' allegations about the recruitment and

9

employment is true, those facts entitle the Nelsons to

10

nothing under their theory of the case, which isn't

11

contract.  But, he goes on to say, it's these torts,

12

which happened in the hospital abroad and not the

13

arguably commercial activities that preceded their

14

commission that formed the basis for the Nelsons' suit.

15

            MR. FISHER:  So 

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  The basis for.  You see.

17

And so 

18

            MR. FISHER:  Justice Breyer 

19

            JUSTICE BREYER:   that's why I'm thinking

20

it does not help you.

21

            MR. FISHER:  When the Court said the

22

arguable commercial activities that preceded it, they

23

were talking not only about the recruitment in the

24

United States but also the employment itself in Saudi

25

Arabia.  And they were distinguishing that from the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

police activity of seizing somebody and holding him in

2

jail, which was what the case was really about which

3

were sovereign activities.

4

            So the Court in Nelson  Mr. Chief Justice,

5

to be clear, I'm not saying Nelson supports me.  I think

6

Nelson simply doesn't answer this question because you

7

were concerned in that case with sovereign versus

8

commercial, not geographic nexus.

9

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So in line with the

10

discussion we had earlier about specific jurisdiction,

11

is your argument that general jurisdiction is enough to

12

support basedupon under the statute?

13

            MR. FISHER:  No, Your Honor.  I 

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I thought you

15

talked about just all of the different commercial

16

activities that the Austrian airline engaged in in the

17

United States.  And if it's all of the different

18

commercial activities, that sounds like general

19

jurisdiction, not the specific jurisdiction.

20

            MR. FISHER:  No.  I think OBB is subject to

21

jurisdiction under the  or  I'm sorry, I should say

22

does not have sovereign immunity under the FSIA for its

23

train operation of selling tickets and getting people

24

rides on the trains.  It wouldn't be subject to

25

jurisdiction if it had some  if it had a mining

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

enterprise on the side or something else that didn't

2

even touch the United States.

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose 

4

            MR. FISHER:  So the activity 

5

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Yes.  But in point of fact,

6

that's all OBB does.  So, effectively, your argument is

7

an argument that OBB is subject to jurisdiction in a

8

general jurisdiction kind of way with respect to

9

everything that they do.  And, you know, I think what

10

the Chief Justice is suggesting is, like, that seems

11

wrong.

12

            MR. FISHER:  Well, let me say two things,

13

Justice Kagan.

14

            (Laughter.)

15

            MR. FISHER:  Thank you.  I think that is the

16

fairest reading of the statute, and Mr. Kneedler was

17

talking about the House Report.  One of the examples in

18

the House Report of a commercial activity was running an

19

airline.  It's hard to distinguish running an airline

20

from running a train system.

21

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, suppose 

22

            MR. FISHER:  So the terms of the statue do

23

cover that.

24

            If  Justice Alito, may I  may I just say

25

one more thing to Justice Kagan?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Sure.  Finish your answer.

2

            MR. FISHER:  Which is if you didn't agree

3

that the term "commercial activity" covered the entire

4

enterprise, then you would ask the question whether the

5

activity of selling tickets is enough to create a

6

basedupon argument in a specific jurisdiction since we

7

went back to the conversation we've been having.

8

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Suppose Ms. Sachs was

9

Australian, and she bought this ticket on the Internet

10

in Australia.  Would you say that there would be no

11

sovereign immunity in the suit in the United States?

12

            MR. FISHER:  Well, there wouldn't

13

necessarily be sovereign  there may not be sovereign

14

immunity under the terms of the Act.  But obviously,

15

there would be a number of reasons why that case

16

couldn't be brought 

17

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But there would be  there

18

would be  there would not be immunity because it was

19

based on the running of the railroad.

20

            MR. FISHER:  Right.  Which  which  on

21

the  taking everything else the same, has substantial

22

contact to the United States.  But all the  all we're

23

talking about in this case is immunity.  Section 1330,

24

where it has jurisdiction over foreign states,

25

has  says that that jurisdiction has to be in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

personam.  And obviously, that would carry with it the

2

requirements for in personam jurisdiction which would

3

require a contact in this country.

4

            And this is one thing I want to make sure,

5

is the Court understands to bring us back to the

6

hypotheticals we were talking about earlier and to tie

7

in the contract hypothetical, it's important for the

8

Court to understand there are all manner of cases where

9

a duty is created in this country by way of a foreign

10

state's commercial activities, and then injuries or

11

breaches occur a broad.  In fact, this is rather the

12

oddball case.

13

            The more typical case is a highfinance deal

14

like the bonds case in the Weltover case, other kinds of

15

international finance and loans.  There are many

16

employment cases where United States citizens sign an

17

employment contract or are lured abroad, study abroad

18

programs in the educational sphere, all kinds of

19

situations where a duty is created in this country, but

20

then all of the events that the lawsuit turns out to be

21

about happen abroad.

22

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, if 

23

            MR. FISHER:  If that's the case 

24

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, you  you

25

recognize  I think you recognized in your brief that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

this  you can call it a question of first impression.

2

You  you said, I believe, based on  the meaning of

3

basedon in this context is an open question.

4

            And if it is an open question, why should we

5

allow a foreign carrier to be sued in the United States

6

for acts or omissions overseas  the negligent conduct

7

occurred overseas  when the only link, the single link

8

is a ticket, a pass, purchased from a  a travel agent

9

in the United States?

10

            MR. FISHER:  For all the reasons I was just

11

saying, Justice Ginsburg, because it is utterly common

12

for duties to be created in this country  here, the

13

duty of safe passage and of utmost care  and then the

14

breach to occur a broad.

15

            My  my friend on the other side was

16

correct to say this case is indistinguishable from

17

contract cases.  There are  there are all kinds of

18

cases where duties are created in this country and then

19

breached abroad.

20

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But if that's true 

21

            MR. FISHER:  The lower courts have always

22

held that the FSIA 

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  If that's true, I don't

24

understand why you answered my hypothetical question the

25

way you did, because in my hypothetical question I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

thought you said that there would not be jurisdiction to

2

sue in the United States when I slip and fall in Vienna.

3

            And  but you could make the same argument.

4

Well, there was a duty created in the United States, and

5

that's what I'm suing on.

6

            MR. FISHER:  I think when I answered your

7

question I was imagining there wasn't a duty created.

8

Maybe as Justice Breyer amended the hypothetical, there

9

might be 

10

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, there's  I mean, the

11

only thing that's happened in the United States is that

12

I've purchased a ticket there.  That's  that's what

13

I've done.

14

            MR. FISHER:  Right.

15

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  So I take it that your

16

argument is that purchase of a ticket gives rise to a

17

duty which is then violated when I slip and fall in

18

another country.

19

            MR. FISHER:  I would say if the plaintiff

20

alleges that in the lawsuit, then there would not be

21

sovereign immunity.  And then Justice Alito's  I think

22

as he was saying earlier, you would have a  perhaps a

23

very strong 12(b)(6) argument that there's no such State

24

law claim that actually gave rise in that context.

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  If  if you get on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

the train in Vienna, and you buy your ticket in Vienna

2

and you get on the train in Vienna, there is on the

3

train operator some duty of care, isn't there?

4

            Without regard to  in other words, there's

5

nothing special about buying a ticket in the

6

United States that gives rise to a unique duty of care

7

that's any different from the duty of care that the

8

railroad owes its passengers in Austria.

9

            MR. FISHER:  I think that's right, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, but  as long as you're talking about buying a

11

ticket one place to the other.  But of course that's

12

true of any seller of any product that they  that they

13

stand  you know, they offer the same thing depending

14

on where you buy it.

15

            But the critical thing is where did they

16

sell their ticket?  They reached out to this country 

17

and it is worth answering your question with this

18

important point, which is the product that they sold to

19

Ms. Sachs is not available to Austrian citizens.  This

20

is a speciallytailored product available only 

21

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I understand.  But

22

there's nothing unique about the standard of care based

23

upon whether it's a Eurail Pass or something else, is

24

there?

25

            I'm just trying to suggest that you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

putting an awful lot of weight on the standard of care

2

created by the purchase of the ticket.  And  and

3

that's no different here or whether the ticket was

4

purchased in  in Austria.

5

            MR. FISHER:  It would 

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It makes no

7

difference to what standard of care she would allege if

8

there were some other basis for jurisdiction in the

9

United States?

10

            MR. FISHER:  That might be correct, but it

11

is important not to lose sight of the fact that she

12

didn't buy her ticket there.  OBB reached out into this

forum.

14

            And just going back to this Court's ordinary

15

due process cases, when a business purposefully avails

16

itself of the protections and the opportunities of a

17

particular jurisdiction 

18

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Fisher, the

19

purposefullyavailedof test relates to specific

20

jurisdiction, and there has to be an instant connecting.

21

If there is that connection, then you must have, in

22

addition, purposefullyavailedof.

23

            But purposefullyavailedof, standing alone,

24

doesn't give you general jurisdiction, and it doesn't

25

give you specific jurisdiction.

            MR. FISHER:  No.  Fair enough.  But you have

2

to have a contact, and that's the substantial contact

3

test in this  in this case 

4

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But you also have to have a

5

relationship.

6

            MR. FISHER:  And you have to have a

7

relationship, which we do, because we purchased it here.

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, let's say that I don't

9

accept that argument, okay?  Let's just for a moment

10

assume that on a straight negligence claim, the idea

11

that a negligence claim arising from an accident in

12

Austria arises  let's say I think it arises from the

13

accident in Austria.  It does not arise from the

14

purchase of a ticket in the United States, okay?

15

            MR. FISHER:  Yeah.

16

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Now, I guess there's still a

17

question as to whether your warranty claims ought to be

18

treated differently.  And I take it what Mr. Kneedler

19

has said about that is, no, they shouldn't be, that's

20

just fancy pleading, it's just a way of converting a

21

negligence claim into a contract claim.  It's the same

22

kind of thing that happened in Nelson that we refused to

23

allow.  Why isn't that right?

24

            MR. FISHER:  It's not right because what you

25

were worried about in Nelson is artful pleading to get

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

around true sovereign immunity; in other words, to

2

challenge sovereign acts dressed up as something else.

3

            Here there's no allegation that we're

4

challenging sovereign acts.  Everybody agrees we're

5

challenging commercial acts.  There's only the

6

geographic nexus question.  So we can plead a tort

7

however we like subject to Rule 12(b)(6), which they can

8

make on remand.

9

            And, Mr. Chief Justice, maybe I could turn

10

back to one of yours questions, because I think it

11

further highlights the difficulty with the other side's

12

test.

13

            It has to be enough for a duty to create a

14

cause of action, we say, because otherwise you're left

15

with this gravamen test.  And either  gravamen test

16

has to mean one of two things:  Either it has to mean

17

that only one particular place can be the gravamen,

18

which is the way I understood it from their briefing.

19

But as the Court, I think, is figuring out from this

20

argument, you get into all heaps of troubles with

21

contracts, employment, all kinds of other things where

22

the injuries occur abroad, and how on earth is the Court

23

to determine where the gravamen is.

24

            On the other hand, if gravamen is sort of a

25

gravaperson's test so that you can have many multiple

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

places where a claim can be brought, then I'm at a loss

2

to understand how it's any improvement over the one

3

element 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  How does it work with a

5

domestic contract, an ordinary domestic contract entered

6

into in Nevada, and the breach of the contract, which

7

consisted of a failure, for example, to deliver goods to

8

San Francisco, took place in California, and the lawsuit

9

is brought in Nevada?

10

            How does that work?  They move  well, how

11

does it happen?

12

            MR. FISHER:  Under due process, you'd have

13

jurisdiction in Nevada.

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I know that, but I mean

15

where does the  where does the 

16

            MR. FISHER:  The gravamen?

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah, yeah.  Does that not

18

come up as to what law applies, as to a factor in forum

19

non conveniens.

20

            MR. FISHER:  No, it 

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it doesn't?  How do you

22

decide what law applies?  The contract doesn't say.

23

            MR. FISHER:  The most  there's a most

24

significant relationship 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Ah.  Most significant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

relationship.  I see.

2

            MR. FISHER:   every State, it says.

3

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And does it matter whether

4

it's  is it to the formation of the contract or is it

5

to the breach?

6

            MR. FISHER:  I think it's sometimes one and

7

sometimes the other, Justice Breyer.

8

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And what's the difference

9

whether it's the one or the other?

10

            MR. FISHER:  Pardon me?

11

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What's the difference?

12

            MR. FISHER:  It depends 

13

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I mean how does the Court

14

decide?

15

            MR. FISHER:  It depends 

16

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm  I'm simply pointing

17

out that these kinds of problems are not unique to the

18

international context.

19

            MR. FISHER:  No, I think 

20

            JUSTICE BREYER:  They arise in many

21

different legal circumstances, and courts have to decide

22

what is the gravamen, and sometimes that's difficult and

23

sometimes it's not.

24

            MR. FISHER:  Well 

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Am I right about that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

            MR. FISHER:  I've never seen this term used

2

in the case law.  And I think the other side was correct

3

when they answered 

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:   the weight of the  I

5

don't know.  You're the one  I'm not very

6

knowledgeable, and I  I tend to believe you're more

7

knowledgeable.  Therefore, I'm asking you the question.

8

            MR. FISHER:  Well, all I can do is honestly

9

answer that I've never seen this test used in any choice

10

of law analysis.

11

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we're dealing 

12

            MR. FISHER:  I will add that 

13

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  If we're dealing with

14

choice of law, is  is there any serious question of

15

what law would govern the adequacy of OBB's boarding

16

protocol, or their platform design?  Would that be any

17

law other than Austria?

18

            MR. FISHER:  Well, the Ninth Circuit held

19

that California law applies in this case, and OBB has

20

never  has not challenged that holding.  So as the

21

case comes to this Court, California law applies for

22

purposes of the one element 

23

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And I'm  I'm asking

24

you.  Never mind what the California court said.

25

            We have an accident in Austria, and it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

based on  the allegation is the boarding protocol was

2

negligently designed, or the platform, the space between

3

the train and the platform, negligently designed.

4

            What law would govern whether that platform

5

was negligently designed, whether the boarding protocol,

6

operating protocol was negligent?

7

            MR. FISHER:  In all candor, Justice

8

Ginsburg, there'd be a pretty good argument that Austria

9

law should apply.  And it is important for the Court to

10

understand that simply holding that a suit under the

11

FSIA can be brought in this country does not mean that

12

U.S. law applies.  There's a separate choice of law

13

analysis that can be made.  And so OBB had the

14

opportunity to make choice of law arguments and has

15

decided not to.

16

            But remember, they can do choice of law

17

analysis not only in terms of ordinary common law

18

principles that might apply in a court, but there's a

19

number of ways that a defendant in OBB's position can

20

protect itself in a case like this.

21

            First of all, they can put a choice of law

22

provision in the ticket, or in the contract, or whatever

23

might be at issue.

24

            Second of all, even as to forum, forum

25

selection clauses can be put into tickets like this, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

contracts, and in fact they are.  As the United States

2

told the Court at the cert stage of this case, all of

3

these tickets now are governed by a forum selection

4

clause provision, so you'll never see a case like this

5

again, not only in the railroad context, but even in the

6

airline industry.

7

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And that  and that

8

works, even though it's an adhesion contract, and it's

9

small print 

10

            MR. FISHER:  Under Carnival Cruise Lines,

11

this Court's decision, those kinds of forum selection

12

clauses are perfectly enforceable.

13

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That  that was an

14

admiralty case, though.

15

            MR. FISHER:  Well, I don't know why it would

16

be different in this context, Justice Kennedy.

17

Certainly the government says that these are all

18

governed by forum selection clauses now.  We think they

19

are, too.

20

            So what you're really deciding in this case,

21

if I could end where perhaps I began, is you're not

22

deciding transportation in this case, because all

23

transportation cases are now covered by conventions and

24

forum selection causes.  What you're really deciding is

25

what the law should be in the mainstream FSIA cases,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

like finance, like contracts.  That's why GibsonDunn

2

has filed a case on behalf of a  of a large hedge fund

3

that says, we do business all the time with foreign

4

sovereigns and we're very worried that if the Court

5

adopts this gravamen basedupon, we will not be able to

6

enforce contracts and duties in this country that have

7

given rise under negotiations in this country and then

8

are breached abroad.

9

            Employment situations, like the hypothetical

10

we give in our brief, where a United States citizen is

11

hired as an engineer to go do oil and gas exploration

12

and then something happens abroad.

13

            Those cases have always been brought in this

14

country.  And if this Court adopts the gravamen test,

15

what you'll be saying is the courts now have some

16

amorphous test that would seem, especially if there is

17

only a single gravamen, that would seem to bounce all of

18

these cases out of the United States courts, which would

19

be dramatically 

20

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, suppose  suppose

21

the Court simply said, buying a ticket from an agent in

22

the United States is not enough, period.  We don't adopt

23

any gravamen.  The question is, what does basedon mean.

24

And the Court could say basedon is not basedon if all

25

that happened in the United States is the purchase of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

the ticket.  We don't have to buy any gravamen or

2

anything else.

3

            MR. FISHER:  Well, I think there is two

4

reasons why you couldn't just limit it to that,

5

Justice Ginsburg.  First, as a legal matter, our claim

6

depends on the duty that arose when that ticket's

7

purchase was made.  And I don't see any legal way to

8

distinguish duties that arose in a ticket sale from

9

other kinds of duties that arise and all kinds of other

10

marketing and contract settings.

11

            And second of all, just as a matter of

12

common sense, remember  let's go back to where we

13

began  this is a commercial activity exception.  If

14

they weren't selling tickets, it wouldn't even be

15

commercial to begin with.  So it would be a highly odd

16

holding to say that the one thing that makes this

17

commercial is what prevents it from being brought in the

18

United States.

19

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  What makes it commercial

20

is it's a railroad doing the same thing a private

21

railroad would do.  It's in  its business is operating

22

a railroad.

23

            MR. FISHER:  That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

24

And if you want us to ask the question in terms of

25

whether a private company would be subject to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

jurisdiction under the same settings here, at least all

2

you have to hold is that OBB should be in the same shoes

3

as a private company.

4

            Now, we say in our brief and in the Gibson

5

brief in more detail, why due process wouldn't stand in

6

the way of jurisdiction there.  But if you have any

7

doubt about that, you can note that OBB has made a

8

personal jurisdiction argument in the district court

9

that the district court never reached.  And so that is

10

available on remand.

11

            The only thing before this Court is

12

sovereign immunity and whether OBB is entitled to

13

sovereign immunity for commercial acts in this country

14

and the teeth of a congressional statute that says in

15

the declaration of purpose in Section 1602 that foreign

16

states doing commercial activities in this country

17

should not be entitled to sovereign immunity.

18

            And then in Section 1606 says:  What we want

19

to do is 

20

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And we say, look, did 

21

they're  your exact words.

22

            MR. FISHER:  Pardon me?

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Are they liable for

24

activity that took place in this country?  They are

25

liable for the breach of the contract.  The breach of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

the contract took place in Austria.

2

            MR. FISHER:  No.

3

            JUSTICE BREYER:  End of case.

4

            MR. FISHER:  No.

5

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why not?

6

            MR. FISHER:  Because  because what the

7

definition of in the United States, Justice Breyer, and

8

this is sub (D) of 1603(c), says that  I'm sorry, it's

9

sub  sub (E) of 1603(c) says that "in the

10

United States" is defined as substantial contact with

11

the United States.  And so that can occur in whole or in

12

part in this country, and in part  I'm sorry, in part

13

includes the ticket sale.

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

            Mr. Basombrio, you have three minutes

17

           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MR. BASOMBRIO

18

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Thank you, Mr. Chief

20

Justice, and may it please the Court:

21

            Much of our discussion today has been in

22

separating the torts from the contractual claims here in

23

this case, implied warranty claims.  Let me tell you why

24

I believe it's a bad idea to split claims on causes of

25

action.  This Court decided recently a case called

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

Pimentel in which the Republic of the Philippines had

2

sovereign immunity.  But there were also a number of

3

other defendants that did not enjoy sovereign immunity.

4

And this Court, taking into consideration important

5

issues such as international comity, decided that under

6

Rule 19, the entire lawsuit had to be dismissed,

7

including as to nonsovereign entities, in order to give

8

full effect to the sovereign immunity of the Republic of

9

the Philippines.

10

            In light of that holding, it would make

11

little sense that when the defendant has the right to

12

invoke immunity, that we would split the causes of

13

action so that some of them would proceed in Austria and

14

some of them would proceed in the United States.

15

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Are you suggesting the

16

basedupon determination is not done on a claimbyclaim

17

basis, it's  you look at the entire complaint?

18

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  That's why 

19

            JUSTICE ALITO:  You find the gravamen of the

20

entire complaint?

21

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Yes, exactly, Your Honor.

22

And the circuit courts and the State courts have all

23

understood what gravamen means.  They know what it

24

means.  And if we just took anybody off the street here

25

and we asked them, why is the Respondent suing, each

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

person would say, because she was injured in a terrible

2

accident in Austria.

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, what if the only claim

4

were the breach of warranty claim?

5

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Then we would have to ask

6

where did the breach occur.  As in Justice Kagan's

7

question, I would answer, if the breach occurred in

8

Austria, then the claim would arise in Austria.

9

            Now, the warranty, in terms of the duty of

10

care, there is no duty of care until she arrives at the

11

station and tries to board that train.  And even if she

12

didn't have a ticket at all, the record establishes that

13

we would still owe her a duty of care.

14

            JUSTICE ALITO:  What if she also had, in

15

addition to the claims she's asserted, a conventional

16

breach of contract claim?  She said that when they 

17

when she tried to get on the train, they said no, your

18

Eurail Pass doesn't let you get on free, you have to pay

19

an additional amount?

20

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  That would have said 

21

            JUSTICE ALITO:  We look to the gravamen of

22

the whole thing and we say, well, the tort claims are in

23

Austria and therefore she can't bring this breach of

24

contract claim in the United States?

25

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Well, if she had been  if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62
1

she had been hurt and in addition to that, they would

2

have told her 

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, exactly what happened

4

here, plus she said they made me pay extra.

5

            MR. BASOMBRIO:  Then the gravamen would

6

still be Austria because that's where all those events

7

took place.

8

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

9

The case is submitted.
