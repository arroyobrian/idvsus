ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDOLPH H. BARNHOUSE

The Federal district court dismissed all

5

claims.

6

one of the city's RICO claims against the Petitioners,

7

the Hemi Group and its sole owner, Kai Gachupin, and

8

affirmed dismissal of the city's other RICO and its

9

common law fraud claims.

10

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated

Yet reinstating the one RICO claim was

11

improper because the city does not have standing to sue,

12

based on the injuries that it has alleged.

13

sovereign opportunity to tax is not an injury to -- to

MR. BARNHOUSE:

Money in the bank would be

4

until there was an amount of money assigned to it.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is no such

6

adjective -- I know we have used it, but there is no

7

such adjective as "choate."

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is "inchoate," but

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

It's like

"gruntled."

assessed the tax -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the status of

4

taxes owing for wire fraud purposes was settled in

5

Pasquantino.

6

owed to Canada.

7

There it was a question of alcohol taxes

There were taxes due, but not paid.

So why

8

doesn't Pasquantino settle at least the property

9

question that taxes owed to a sovereign qualify as

10

property?

11

MR. BARNHOUSE:

Justice Ginsburg,

12

Pasquantino, the holding there was -- it was a criminal

13

prosecution by the U.S. Government, and it dealt with

14

the term "property" in the -- in the Mail and Wire Fraud

15

Statute, not the overlying 1964(c) requirement of injury

16

to business or property.

17

Moreover, it was the taxpayer who was being

18

prosecuted, the person who actually had taken the liquor

19

into Canada, not some third party that said, let me sell

20

you the liquor.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there are certainly

22

differences from this case, and it wasn't a RICO case,

23

either.

24

whether an amount owed to a government qualifies as

25

property, why wouldn't -- why would that answer differ?

But why would the determination of what -

6

MR. BARNHOUSE:

Justice Ginsburg, once the

2

amount owed is assessed, once there's a determination of

the amount owed -

4
5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was no assessment

by Canada in the Pasquantino case.

6

MR. BARNHOUSE:

There was -

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They said the -- the

8

defendant was smuggling liquor into Canada and getting

9

it there without paying the Canadians' exorbitant taxes.

10

MR. BARNHOUSE:

The prosecution on the mail

11

and wire fraud criminal -- well, criminal standing was

12

not an issue there.

13

It was the U.S. Government -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we're talking

14

about -- only about property, not standing or anything

15

else.

16

aimed -- aimed at depriving Canada of money to which it

17

was entitled by law qualifies as property for wire fraud

18

purposes.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

So it can mean that.

Now

why -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?

6

MR. BARNHOUSE:

At the time, because of the

7

overlying standing requirement Congress placed in RICO

8

of injury to a person's business or property, and

9

because of Congress's reliance at that time on the

10

antitrust laws and the general understanding at that

11

time that business or property did not include the type

12

of sovereign interest in an opportunity to collect tax,

13

as confirmed by the Ninth Circuit and this Court in

14

Hawaii v. Standard Oil of California that this Court

15

affirmed, where the sovereign opportunity to tax is much

MR. BARNHOUSE:

In Hawaii,

this Court made it clear that -

11
12

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they?

Wouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?

I mean, just because some of them might be difficult to

prove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that

are very clear do not constitute property.

4

MR. BARNHOUSE:

The -- the -- what they've

5

alleged here is not that they've lost the taxes, but

6

that they've lost the opportunity to tax.

7

they should not be able to reach that point because the

allegations themselves are that the injury is not

proximate.

It is the city itself -

be said that at this stage of the litigation that it's

10

farfetched that having a statement on the website "No

taxes due" is -- doesn't cause people to purchase those

12

cigarettes for the very purpose of avoiding the taxes?

13

MR. BARNHOUSE:

Well, Justice Alito, the

14

allegations here are not that there were no taxes due.

15

There wasn't someone waving a tea bag and saying, "Don't

Pardon me?
Just like automobiles.

If

4

you buy a car out of the State, you haven't paid the

5

State sales tax, but if you bring it into the State, you

6

have to pay a use tax.

7

MR. BARNHOUSE:

That's right.

That's right,

8

Justice Scalia, and the obligation to pay that tax is on

9

the person who brings the car into the State.

The

10

obligation to pay the possessory use tax is on the

11

citizens of the city of New York.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it -- is it fraudulent to

say "sales are tax-free" as opposed to, you know, saying

10

MR. BARNHOUSE:

Well, it has to do with the

11

intervening, Justice Alito, with -- with intervening

12

causes of the city's failure to collect these taxes.

13

The -- RICO requires someone who has been

14

injured in their business or property by reason of the

15

alleged proximate act, and the fact is the city here was

16

injured in its -- was injured, if at all, by reason of

17

its citizens' failure to self-assess and pay their

18

taxes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was injured because it

20

couldn't find its citizens because it didn't know who

Even though those are the

only two people that have made the arrangement, and that

was the whole purpose and intent of the arrangement?

5

And you still say there's no proximate cause?

6

MR. BARNHOUSE:

Your Honor, the intent to

7

injure, even if specific, as the Court held in

8

Associated General Contractors, is not itself sufficient

9

to change -- to give someone standing under RICO.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does your answer to

11

Justice Kennedy depend upon a notion that the causation

12

standard as -- in RICO is different than general

13

proximate cause standards in tort law?

14

MR. BARNHOUSE:

No, Your Honor, because I

believe that the proximate cause standard that the Court

16

has adopted rests at its core in proximate cause

17

analysis in tort law.

18

applying proximate cause requirements in the antitrust

19

law and in RICO, it was looking at, as I understand it,

20

the -- the common law analysis of proximate cause,

21

and -- and it really discussed the elements of that

quite clearly in the Associated General Contractors case

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Thank you, counsel.

MR. KOERNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

With respect to the definition of property,

10

this goes back to Wyoming v. Oklahoma, where in an

11

original jurisdiction case Wyoming sued the State of

12

Oklahoma on the ground that the State's regulation which

13

attempted to require Oklahoma coal-fired generation

14

plants to use 10 percent of Oklahoma coal, and prior to

15

the legislation all of Wyoming coal was used in the

16

generation plant.

17

Wyoming sued in this Court and the defense

18

was that Wyoming didn't have an interest because it lost

19

the opportunity to collect taxes.

19

issue was whether or not the opportunity to collect

20

taxes which Canada lost, whether that was an injury to

21

property.

22

equating the lost opportunity with embezzlement from the

23

Canadian treasury and pointing out in the definition of

24

Black's and the Webster's definition that property

25

includes not only that which you actually have, but that

And there was a long discussion by this Court

26
Alderson Reporting Company

which you were denied the opportunity.
In this particular case, the reason we don't

3

have the taxes is because of the act of fraud as we

4

allege of the defendant.

5
6
7

It's a little tough -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, because

of -- because of what?
MR. KOERNER:

The fraud of the defendant.

8

It's a little hard to argue when you've created the

9

situation so we can't collect that an inability to

10

collect then becomes no property.

11

this Court decided the Anza case, which I'll discuss for

12

both issues.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

After Pasquantino

Before you get to Anza,

14

this might be a good time to ask because I don't think

15

we focused on this in Pasquantino.

16

failure of a State to collect a tax is property, then

17

why isn't every corporation that files an income tax

18

return and makes two false statements automatically

19

liable for RICO?

21
22

But if in fact the

I mean -

MR. KOERNER:

As long as they meet the

definition of JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that would mean the

23

States have a new method, which I don't think they use,

24

a new method of collecting treble taxes from anyone who

25

makes two false statements or a false statement in two

expansionist mode, and despite that Congress has not

ample remedies in securities law, and because they

thought it was inappropriate to use exclusively mail and

wire fraud.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

If Congress wanted that

20

result, why didn't they put in as a predicate act not

21

paying your income tax or not paying your State tax?

22

MR. KOERNER:

Because they had a more

23

general definition, and they wanted the broadest

24

possible interpretation.

But the Cigarette Contraband

Alderson Reporting Company

The sole economic injury in that act is lost taxes to

2

the State and the city.

3

It's hard to say that Congress didn't contemplate this

4

when, in addition to the general definition, they put

5

this in.

6

It's the only economic injury.

In addition, the Jenkins Act was passed in

1949 precisely for this problem, so it was on

congressional minds.

that there are other factors that are not associated

that those out-of-State sales entities don't exist

14
15

MR. BARNHOUSE:

But it's not a definition of

proximate cause.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. BARNHOUSE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

ago.

You need more than that.
That, itself is not I took torts a long time

I thought that was part of it.
MR. BARNHOUSE:

What -- what the Court said

21

in Associated General Contractors is, even if it's not

22

only foreseeable, but that's your intent, but that-

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

There can be other

24

things that cut it off.

Proximate cause.

25

No kind of an event that would cut the causal chain,

1

like some odd fluke or something.

2

MR. BARNHOUSE:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

for cutting the chain.

5

okay?

But No policy reason or others

I mean, it's Torts 1 in 1962,

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't it -- well, I

7

don't know, maybe it's more -- but isn't it a

8

proposition that you don't rely on illegal conduct, that

9

the -- the assumption of illegal conduct cuts the chain?

10

In other words, there's only proximate cause

11

if you assume people are going to not pay taxes that

12

they're due, contrary to law, and that that breaks the

13

proximate cause chain?

14

MR. BARNHOUSE:

It -- if we assume that -

15

that the assumption that they will pay their taxes

16

breaks the proximate cause?

17

I'm not -- I'm sorry -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, that you have

18

to -- in order to maintain -- this is a helpful

19

question.

20

In order -

21

MR. BARNHOUSE:

22

Yes, sir.

that's why I'm trying to understand.

23

(Laughter.)

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

That's why -

In order to maintain

the chain of connection, I thought you cannot rely, for
57

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one of those links in the chain, that a party is going

2

to commit illegal action.

3

MR. BARNHOUSE:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's wrong.

I

5

mean, at least for civil torts, you can -- there are a

6

lot of cases where the landlord leaves out the bulb

7

in the -- in the stairway and one of the residents gets

8

mugged and he sues the landlord and wins, even though

9

there is an intervening criminal act.

10

Now, maybe what you want to argue is that

11

that -- that has never been applied, to my knowledge, to

12

either criminal liability or -- or penal provisions, and

13

that maybe the -- an intervening criminal act does cut

14

off causality, for purposes of penal statute, such as -

15

such as RICO.

16
17

That would be a reasonable argument.

MR. BARNHOUSE:

That's a great argument,

Justice Scalia.

18

(Laughter.)

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

And a good place to

end.

21

Thank you, counsel.

22

The case is submitted.

23

(Whereupon, at 2:01 p.m., the case in the

24

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
