JUSTICE STEVENS:

We will hear argument in

No. 06-618, the Office of Senator Mark Dayton against

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN M. MANNING

7

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

8
9

MS. MANNING:

Justice Stevens and may it

please the Court:

10

If I may, I would like to quickly frame the

11

merits of the case and then turn to the jurisdictional

12

issue.

13

recognized that members of Congress have to delegate

14

some of their legislative authority to employees and

15

these employees are a second self to the member.

16

are performing some of the legislative duties the member

17

himself would otherwise perform.

18

integral part of the legislative process of the member's

19

office.

20

trust and confidence that these employees are in fact

21

performing as his second self, and to do that the member

22

has to have complete discretion in selecting who these

23

employees are and in managing them.

24
25

In United States vs. Gravel this Court

They

Therefore, they are an

For that reason, the member must have absolute

If a court oversees a member's selection of
these employees and his management of these employees,
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

then the court and not the member is managing part of

2

his legislative process and that is a violation of the

3

Speech or Debate Clause because the purpose of the

4

clause is to ensure that the legislative process will be

5

performed independently.

6

Now -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think -- do you

7

think that we owe any special measure of respect to the

8

Congress, that is most intimately concerned with the

9

Speech or Debate Clause, with their view that this is,

10

this legislation is compatible with that clause?

11

MS. MANNING:

I do not, Justice Ginsburg.

12

This Court has never deferred to Congress with respect

13

to its interpretation and in fact has disagreed with

14

Congress, for example, in the Gravel case.

15

other reason is that the Congress of course is a

16

political body and because of that it will make

17

decisions that are politically expedient at times, which

18

means that over time their decisions can change, while

19

the Court is uniquely designed and intended to decide

20

cases on something other than what is politically

21

expedient.

22

dealing with the Constitution and interpreting the

23

Constitution.

24
25

But the

This is especially important when we are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what we are involved

with in this case is Congress subjecting itself to the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

laws that govern all other employers.

2

MS. MANNING:

It did, Justice Ginsburg,

3

subject itself, but it also in Section 413 recognized

4

that there may be Speech or Debate Clause issues and

5

maybe not all of these cases can be adjudicated in a

6

court.

7

not in a court.

8

and doing the best it could to do that, it also cannot

9

trump the Constitution.

10

Not that they can't be adjudicated, but maybe
So while subjecting itself to the law

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is what the statute

11

says, and so how could the statute possibly be

12

unconstitutional?

13

MS. MANNING:

We are not -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, the Constitution -

15

I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate

16

Clause exception.

17

lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or

18

Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that

19

doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional

20

requirement that, that the constitutionality of the

21

statute be called into question.

22

Now, I guess you can argue that a

MS. MANNING:

Well, Justice Scalia, we are

23

not arguing that the statute is unconstitutional.

24

Rather, it's an as-applied argument.

25

arguing is that the issue that was before the circuit
5

Alderson Reporting Company

What we are

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court was whether the application of Section 408 to this

2

particular case -- and of course 408 is what gives the

3

Court jurisdiction -- whether applying that to this case

4

violates the Constitution.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that doesn't comply

6

with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken

7

directly to the Supreme Court from "any interlocutory or

8

final judgment decree of order of court upon the

9

constitutionality of any provision of the Act."

Now,

10

and as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the

11

constitutionality of the provision.

12

MS. MANNING:

Justice Scalia, in the United

13

States versus Eichman, that statute at issue there had

14

statutory direct appeal language that was exactly the

15

language of 412.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't there a further

17

problem here, though, that the order of the district

18

court gave no explanation?

19

exactly why the court ruled the way it did, and for that

20

reason the appeal, the review, was that the original

21

appeal was taken properly to the court of appeals, so

22

that we are here not on appellate jurisdiction, but cert

23

jurisdiction, if at all.

24

MS. MANNING:

25

We have no way of knowing

I believe that you can take

appellate jurisdiction of this case because, as I was
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

saying, in United -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, there'S no direct

3

4

a direct appeal and there's no direct appeal.

5

coming from the court of appeals.

6

We have appellate jurisdiction only if there's

MS. MANNING:

This is

Oh, Section 412 provides

7

direct appeal from either court, unlike the Flag

8

Protection Act direct appeal language, which must be

9

from the district court.

Section 412 doesn't limit it

10

to an appeal from the district court.

11

one.

12
13

JUSTICE SOUTER:
412 set out on?

14

It can be either

What pages are the text of

You're going to have to help me here.

MS. MANNING:

I'm sorry.

With respect to -

15

it's at the jurisdictional statement at page 65a.

16

the direct appellate language that was at issue in the

17

Flag Protection Act did limit the appeal to appeals from

18

the district court.

19

that.

20

And

But Section 412 is different from

It doesn't JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why wasn't the ruling

21

of the district court a ruling upon the

22

constitutionality of the statute as applied?

23

understand it, you moved to dismiss the case on the

24

ground that an individual performing the duties that

25

Mr. Dayton performed cannot sue a member of Congress for

As I

employment discrimination and the district court denied

2

that.

3

of the, of the statute as applied?

4

Why isn't that a ruling on the constitutionality

MS. MANNING:

Well, Justice Alito, the

5

argument we made was that to reach that decision there

6

were a couple of sub-arguments the court had to reach.

7

We had argued that, number one, is there a waiver of

8

sovereign immunity?

9

meets the I'll call the duties test that we've set out

If not, then is an employee who

10

in our brief, is that employee's claim jurisdictionally

11

barred from court review, and if so does Mr. Hanson meet

12

that duties test?

13

that Mr. Hanson doesn't meet the duties test, therefore

14

we never have to reach the constitutional issue, and

15

that would have been a decision on his duties, not on

16

the Constitution.

17
18

Now, the court could have decided

JUSTICE ALITO:

Was there a dispute about

the nature of his duties?

19

MS. MANNING:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm sorry?
Not how you characterize his

21

duties, but what his duties actually were.

22

dispute about that?

23

MS. MANNING:

Was there a

He did not dispute his duties.

24

What he disputed was -- what he said was that of the

25

duties we set forth in the affidavit -- and that was
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Mr. Kimball's declaration, which is at the

2

jurisdictional statement at 66a -- he said that they

3

represent only 5 percent of his legislative duties over

4

the course of his employment.

5

not setting forth every jurisdictional duty he had over

6

the course of his employment.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, of course, we're

So he -

But didn't the district

8

court rule that somebody performing those duties can

9

constitutionally be tried -- bring suit, and it doesn't,

10

and it doesn't violate the Speech or Debate Clause?

11

I don't see how that's not a ruling on the

12

constitutionality of the statute as applied.

13

MS. MANNING:

So

No, Justice Alito, the court

14

didn't rule that.

15

order, and there's a possibility that it ruled that, but

16

there is a possibility that it just said it doesn't

matter what test you're telling me, counsel, because

18

this particular employee doesn't meet your test to begin

19

with.

MS. MANNING:

Well, when Congress -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

It says "The constitutionality of any provision of this

5

act," not "the constitutionality of the application of

6

any provision of this act."

7

MS. MANNING:

Yes, and in United States

-- you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by

just saying we don't have to reach the facial question;

14

we can decide it on an as applied question.

is his self evaluation and Mr. Kimball, his supervisor

Some of the things Mr. Hanson did was he did

talk to constituents, but remember of course the member

source if it's not contested is his affidavit.

solution is that when a member, as I was explaining in

response to Justice Stevens' questions, when a member

has a second self who is in the legislative process and

3

the member says you know, I'm pulling him out of the

4

process because he doesn't perform well, he -- I don't

5

think he is my second self, that termination for

6

whatever reason is part of the process because the

7

member has changed the process.

JUSTICE BREYER:

absurd case out of it which I'm trying to do a little

bit to get you to focus on it.

MS. MANNING:

Let's suppose he got

The -- it is a whole employee.

13

When he is removed from the process for whatever reason,

14

he is gone from the process so that is part of the

15

functioning of the process.

16

let's say that the Senator is at Union Station and he is

17

buying a gift for someone and he hears someone making

18

very derogatory statements to the cashier, and he turns

19

around and lo and behold, this is his legislative

director.

22

has nothing to do with my legislative process but this

23

is a second self and he is not my second self and I pull

24

him out of the process.

If I may give an example,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sorry?
Can you give me instances

in which employees of an the office of a Senator are

10

covered by these obligations and cannot invoke the

11

Speech or Debate Clause?

12

where you can't invoke the Speech or Debate Clause?

13

MS. MANNING:

Speech or Debate Clause.

What's the classic example

Where you cannot invoke the

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MS. MANNING:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yeah.

Was that the question, or can?
Yes.

Because it seems to

18

me that your argument just completely eviscerates the

19

intent of the Congress in passing this Act.

20

MS. MANNING:

If I may answer the second

21

question first, approximately 75 percent of the people

22

who are covered by this Act, the employees who are

23

covered by this Act are not employed by members of

24

Congress or committees.

25

most part -- and not all of them, because some of those

Now those employees for the

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

employees do work on the floor, but for the most part -

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, except the Act

itself has a provision for office of Senators.

4

MS. MANNING:

And those employees -

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so it seems to me

6

you're giving no effect to that.

7

hole in the process the minute the furniture mover is

8

gone?

9

MS. MANNING:

You say there is a

No, Justice Kennedy, those

10

employees -- first of all some of those employees can

11

sue.

12

releases or newsletters to constituents, this is in the

13

Brewster case, are not, that is not a legislative act.

14

So if we have an employee in a member's office like the

15

deputy press secretary who does those kind of things,

16

that person is not performing legislative acts.

17

addition to that these employees still have a -- a

18

forum; their forum is the Office of Compliance, which is

19

unique to the Congressional Accountability Act.

20

Office of Compliance has cases heard before retired

21

judges; the employees get the same remedies as they

22

would in court.

23

is an expedited procedure and it is a confidential

24

procedure.

25

For example the Court has said that writing news

But in

And the

It is the same procedure except that it

So these employees are, it's not that they

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Wouldn't they get into -

JUSTICE ALITO:

If this statute was set up

4
5

If this statute -

no, you.

6

so that the defendant here was the Senate, as opposed to

7

the office of a Senator, would you still say that this

8

suit couldn't go forward?

9

MS. MANNING:

With respect to the abatement

10

issue, I would -- this is with respect to the abatement

11

issue -- I would say that the case would not be abated,

12

because the defendant would still exist.

13

respect to the Speech or Debate Clause issue I would say

14

it could not still go forward, and the reason for that

15

is the immunity is, as this Court stated in Gravel, is

16

not like a badge that attaches to different people and

17

different entities.

18

which means that whenever a case is going to infringe

19

into this legislative sphere, irrespective of who the

20

defendant is, then the case could not be adjudicated in

21

a Federal court.

22

But with

It's an expression of a policy,

And so for example in Eastland versus

23

Servicemen's Fund this Court stated that a committee of

24

the Senate is covered by the Speech or Debate Clause.

25

And in Tenney although that was a State case, the Court
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did apply the Speech or Debate Clause jurisprudence.

2

The Court there said that a committee of the State is

3

covered by the Speech or Debate Clause and the case

4

would be dismissed.

5

And then in Doe vs. McMillan, in that case

6

there was a consultant to Congress and he was sued.

7

There was functionaries of Congress that did not work

8

for a member, did not work for a committee and the Court

9

held in that case that if those, if the consultant and

10

the functionaries were performing duties that were

11

within this legislative sphere, the Speech or Debate

12

Clause clause applies and the case was dismissed.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

In what sense would the

14

member be called to answer under those circumstances, if

15

the member isn't a defendant and has no financial

16

liability and is able to invoke the clause as an

17

evidentiary privilege?

if, if that office is gone now and getting to your

11

hypothesis, if the, if -- if the true party is the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. SALZMAN

10

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE

11
12

Mr. Salzman.

MR. SALZMAN:

Justice Stevens and may it

please the Court:

13

The motion to dismiss in this case raised a

14

single issue, the issue of absolute immunity; more

15

specifically, whether the employing office created by

16

Congress as the defendant in these kinds of cases can be

17

sued by a member of a Senator or a House of

18

Representatives staff.

19

Senator's personnel decisions are always a legislative

20

act that are always absolutely immunized by the Speech

21

or Debate Clause.

He was

in the Minnesota office.

is that he was a valued employee until he became ill and

3

disclosed his illness and need for surgery, at which

4

point he was fired.

5

that they were not even aware, that Senator Dayton was

6

unaware of the need for surgery at the time he made the

7

decision to fire Mr. Hanson, and then says that the

8

reason for the firing was Mr. Hanson's work on a classic

9

constituent service.

10

His, the nature of his claim

Senator Dayton's office first says

This case presents exactly the hypothetical

11

that Justice Breyer was asking about.

12

Mr. Hanson had a very small, he says 5 percent of his

13

duties, that were in some way related to the legislative

14

process, no one contends, not Mr. Kimball, not Senator

15

Dayton's office, that that had anything to do with the

16

reason for his firing.

17

the record, in this record so far, is that on that small

18

amount of work that Mr. Hanson did with respect to

19

ambulance legislation, he did a, quote unquote, "great

20

job."

21

Although

In fact, the only evidence in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The other side's contention

22

is that the firing is itself a legislative act and so

23

when you challenge the firing you are challenging the

24

legislative act.

25

What do you say to that?

MR. SALZMAN:

We say that's absolutely wrong
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Scalia, that is absolutely wrong.

The reason is

2

that this Court has said that conduct that is related to

to the legislative process, is not itself a part of the

Dayton had notice of the need for surgery, whether or

not Mr. Hanson's performance of classic constituent

services was bad or good, as we contend.

There was no legislative act

But none of that involves legislative

activity as this Court has described it under the speech

10

Justice Stevens, certainly the

MR. SALZMAN:

if the reason for the firing would shed light if the

district court would show that the allowing the evidence

legislative act, then the district court can excise that

evidence from the case.

It either can be taken out, as

function in future cases, or if it requires him to talk

MR. SALZMAN:

I think, as this Court has

13

described it, Justice Kennedy, if it would compel the

14

Senator to testify about his motives for legislation or

15

for a legislative act, then a district court could

16

decide that that evidence would not come in.

itself, however, is not a legislative act and the

motivation behind the firing is not precluded by the

What if it required him to

say how he allocated his resources, that he allocate his

particular piece of legislation or with respect to a

that his testifying about how he has allocated money in

the office, for example, would be anything other than

certainly attempted to introduce evidence in a case

about a speech that the Senator gave on the floor of the

11

Senate in which he was accused of making maybe a bigoted

12

or a sexist remark, Section 413 would clearly preclude

13

that.

14

if a plaintiff wanted to introduce a draft of the speech

15

or a draft of legislation, that a court, district court,

16

could in those circumstances say that that intrudes so

much on a true legislative act that the court could

preclude that testimony from going in.

the problem that I'm having.

plaintiff.

7

MR. SALZMAN:

So he's sort of in a dilemma.

Understood, Justice Stevens.

8

I think that in most cases that will not present a

9

dilemma.

Even if the Senator's explanation is, I

10

assigned a real legislative aide to research a piece of

11

legislation and I was dissatisfied for whatever reason,

12

suppose the reason is that the aide simply didn't turn

13

in the memo that that he was assigned to do.

8

will be presenting does not so intrude on the

9

legislative process that it would be precluded but that

10

the Defendant may decide that in order to explain the

11

accusation he needs to rely on legislative acts.

12

the court recognized that that may be the situation that

13

the Senator is in.

14

decision written by Justice Alito, the McDade case,

talks about that circumstance, where the Senator at that

point can choose to put in his explanation and be

MR. SALZMAN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. SALZMAN:

Yes.

If he chooses to stay silent,

7

then perhaps the case just goes forward without an

The defendant -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, why don't, why

10

doesn't that -- why doesn't being placed in that dilemma

11

in effect implicate the clause, and why can't he invoke

12

the clause as a basis for dismissal?

13

MR. SALZMAN:

Well, Judge Randolph below

14

thought that there may be circumstances where the

15

evidence is so, all of the evidence is so bound up in a

16

legislative act that the case might not go forward.

17

respectfully disagree with that.

We think that that

18

will rarely be the circumstance.

But this is the system

19

that Congress set up and Congress created the system in

20

a, in a careful way.

The member faces no financial liability whatsoever from

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, yes, so far as the

it.

Alderson Reporting Company

They in

2

Debate Clause issues they prevail.

3

just leaves us with no solution for the problem that

4

Justice Stevens raised and that I'm concerning with,

5

unless there's, there's going to be an automatic

6

dismissal when the member says, look, I cannot respond

7

to this without getting into, into acts within the

8

legislative process which are privileged.

And that kind of

9

Unless you want to recognize that as kind of

10

an absolute defense upon its invocation, I don't see how

11

we get out of the problem.

12

MR. CABALLERO:

Well, Justice Souter, our

13

argument is that the decision itself is certainly not a

14

legislative act, and the most -- and that is in

15

accordance with this Court's view of the judicial

16

privilege in Forrester that the decision itself is not a

17

judicial act.

18

legislative context could be shielded by the evidentiary

19

privilege, but we think there's a clear difference

20

between the employees performing a duty that is related

21

to the legislative process being different than a

22

legislative act itself.

23

The reasons behind the decision in the

It may be that in some rare circumstances

24

the Senator in order to fully defend himself feels the

25

need to actually testify about real legislative acts,

such as votes on something or his conduct in a committee

proceeding.

3

performance, just as Judge White's assessment in the

4

Forrester case of Miss Forrester's performance, is not

5

legislative activity.

6

important to the legislative process.

7

for a sound legislative arena, just as in the judicial

8

sphere.

9

unanimously that when Judge White was assessing the

But his assessment of an employee's

It may be activity that is
It may provide

But when this Court found unanimous,

10

performance of Miss Forrester in the judicial context

11

and deciding, I don't think she did a good job on

12

delegated judicial functions, that's not a judicial act.

13

And we would say the same with respect to a legislative

14

act, so -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would go for a

16

stenographer in a committee hearing?

17

MR. SALZMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, and I believe

18

that's the Browning case, that the D.C. Circuit

19

originally had found would be considered a legislative

20

act.

21

the, whoever supervised Miss Browning that her

22

performance was inadequate is not itself a legislative

23

activity.

24

involved, was closely tied to the legislative process

25

because she was a stenographer at hearings.

And we do believe that, yes, the assessment by

Miss Browning's performance obviously was

41
Alderson Reporting Company

If the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

committee, if the committee decided in a committee

2

proceeding and took a vote that they were not going to

3

use stenographers any more and Miss Browning had brought

4

a challenge with respect to that, alleging that it was

5

focused personally on her and racially motivated, then

6

we think a legislative immunity might apply as it did in

7

the Bogan case.

8

But absent that, it's our belief that an

9

assessment of an employee's performance, even if the

10

employee is performing duties that are related to the

11

legislative process, is not itself a legislative act.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it could or couldn't

13

be.

14

says, I think relevant to my dismissal of this

15

individual is the individual's performance that revealed

16

itself in a speech or debate that I gave in the House,

17

and if that's relevant, then why isn't that the end of

18

the case, they can't bring it?

19

I mean, I mean if the legislator, the Senator,

MR. SALZMAN:

Justice Breyer, I think that

20

that is one of the rare circumstances where the, the

21

Senator's assessment of the performance is very tied up

22

with a legislative act.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, all he'd have to say

24

is it's relevant to my decision to fire the person.

25

Now, surely a jury or whoever -- it's probably a jury
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

matter, I guess, on this -- is entitled to take that

2

into account.

3

take into account, you are questioning what that Senator

4

did in the speech or debate and you are questioning it

5

in another place, namely, a court.

6

If it's something the jury is entitled to

MR. SALZMAN:

You are, Justice Breyer.

The

7

employee's performance, we believe, of the speech

8

writing would not be considered a legislative act.

9

Court said in Gravel that there is a difference between

This

10

a legislative act which goes on in a committee

11

proceeding and preparation for that proceeding, and the

12

employee's performance getting the Senator ready to give

13

his speech would not itself be considered a legislative

14

act, but in that circumstance the district court might

15

say that because the Senator's explanation is so clearly

16

tied to a real legislative act, a speech that he

17

actually gave on the floor of the Congress, perhaps that

18

might be a circumstance where judge Randolph's view that

19

that case could not go forward might apply.

20

That's not this case.

This case deals with

21

threshold immunity issues, where the Senator's office is

22

saying that any personnel decision that it engages in is

23

by definition a legislative act if it relates to anybody

24

who works in their office.

25

of that view.

And Congress clearly was not

It defined every employee of the Senate,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. SALZMAN:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

Have any cases gone

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg?
Have any cases under this

Act gone to a district court to judgment on the merits?

9

MR. SALZMAN:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

The

10

closest -- my understanding is the closest we have

11

gotten is the companion case in this case, the Fields

12

case, is scheduled for trial in October and it is my

13

understanding that they have gone through some discovery

14

in that case.

15

any cases under the Congressional Accountability Act in

16

court, that have made it past that.

I don't believe that there have been any,

17

If there are no further questions -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I have one question.

The

19

Appellants here were the ones that appealed to the court

20

of appeals?

Did they appeal from the district court?

21

MR. SALZMAN:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But under 1291, the United

23

States Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction where

24

direct review may be had in the Supreme Court.

25

seems to me that their position contradicts their own
44
Alderson Reporting Company

So it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

basis for jurisdiction here.

2

MR. SALZMAN:

Do you agree with that?

Not entirely, Justice Kennedy.

3

We do -- we had thought that initially and then upon

4

reflection it seemed to us that because the minute order

5

of the district -- because the order of the district

6

court was a minute order that did not explain its

7

reasoning, perhaps there was some ambiguity about

8

whether he was simply finding that Mr. Hanson had so

9

little contact with the legislative process that, that

10

the case should go forward or whether he was in essence

11

--

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but my point is that

13

the Appellants are telling us that this is appealable

14

here directly, but if that's so they shouldn't have gone

15

to court of appeals, they shouldn't have gone to the

16

court of appeals; they're untimely when they come here.

17

MR. SALZMAN:

That is our understanding of

18

the way it generally works.

We believe that the GYRA

19

statute, which was the predecessor to the Congressional

20

Accountability Act, may have permitted appeals directly

21

from the court of appeals to this court.

22

appears to be some ambiguity.

23

with respect to the appeal, we did argue that if Senator

24

Dayton's office wanted to appeal directly they needed to

25

do that two years ago when the district court had ruled.

So there

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS E. CABALLERO

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE

7

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING APPELLEE

8

MR. CABALLERO:

Justice Stevens and may it

please the Court:

10

We agree that there is no jurisdiction in

11

this Court under Section 412.

12

correct one of the answers regarding cases under this

13

Congressional Accountability Act.

14

But I first would like to

Two cases have been finally adjudicated by

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The other case

And there's no jurisdiction

under 412 because?
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. CABALLERO:

Because, as we said in our

2

brief, the decision of the court of appeals was a

3

decision on the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause as

4

that clause is preserved in Section 413 of the act and

5

therefore there would be no appeal under Section 412.

6

If the court does go to the merits in this

7

matter, I think it's important to effectuate Congress'

8

intent in enacting the statute along with its concerns

9

with the Speech or Debate Clause.

The Speech or Debate

10

Clause provides senators and representatives with a

11

constitutional privilege that is critical to securing

12

the independence of the legislative branch in our system

13

of government.

14

Certainly, Congress is the institution that

15

has the greatest interest in and is most sensitive to

16

maintaining a robust speech or debate privilege under

17

this Court's precedence.

18

Accountability Act, however, Congress concluded that it

19

could provide its own employees with the same employment

20

law protections that it had already provided Executive

21

Branch employees and private sector employees, including

22

the critical right of action for victims of illegal

23

discrimination to bring suit in the Federal court; and

24

that a suit under the Act would not infringe upon the

25

Speech or Debate Clause.

In enacting the Congressional

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress relied on this Court's own

2

precedent in making that determination.

3

Speech or Debate Clause, this Court has made clear that

4

the clause is robust, protects activities outside of

5

just speech and debate on the floor of either House, but

6

that it shouldn't be extended beyond what is necessary

7

to preserve the independence of the legislative process.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Under the

Can we go back a step.

I

just -- you said this is appealable and your reason for

10

it being appealable was because the statute itself -

11

you said it was not appealable and the reason not is

12

because the statute itself said that this has to be

13

applied consistent with the Speech or Debate Clause?

14

MR. CABALLERO:

Correct.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's your reason.

So I

16

take it, what about the reason that's been given, that

17

this is an as-applied challenge instead of on its face?

18

What about that as a reason for it not being appealable?

19

MR. CABALLERO:

Well, that is an application

20

of Section 412, the preservation of Speech or Debate

21

Clause in the statute.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no, I'm not asking

23

about the argument you are making.

24

an argument you aren't making, that the reason -- I'll

25

ask about the one you are making in a second.
48
Alderson Reporting Company

I want to ask about

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason I want to know about -- I want to know about the

2

other possible reason for not being appealed, namely

3

that this is as applied and not on its face.

4

strike down any provision.

5

one?

6
7
8
9

They don't

What's your view about that

MR. CABALLERO:

Our view is that that is

correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

That is correct.

And what

you do about this case, what is it, Eichman?

10

MR. CABALLERO:

The Eichman case they cited.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In Eichman, I was able to

12

get out the district court and the last part of the

13

district court, the last line of the district court, it

14

says the law under which these three -- let me begin

15

again -- the law under which these three defendants have

16

been prosecuted is unconstitutional, which seems to me

17

to contradict what Appellant's counsel told us about

18

what happened in the district court.

19

MR. CABALLERO:

I think that's correct.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It wouldn't matter anyway,

21

because our prior decisions that do not explicitly refer

22

to jurisdictional questions are not authority on

23

jurisdiction.

24

MR. CABALLERO:

That's correct.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We have that firm rule:

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

When we take a case and don't get into the

2

jurisdictional question, it is not precedent for the

3

fact --

4
5

MR. CABALLERO:

For a finding of

jurisdiction later, that's correct.

6

I would say -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then a holding of a

8

district court in your opinion, the holdings say,

9

imaginary, is that no one who actually works in an

10

office of a Senator and who ever worked on any matter

11

having to do with legislation falls within this Act

12

because that would violate the speech and debate clause.

13

That would be quite major in its implication.

14

you're saying there is no appeal on that because it's as

15

applied.

16

MR. CABALLERO:

Right.

But

Based on the court

17

of appeals decision, I would say the two arguments as

18

applied in the preservation of Section 413 aren't wholly

19

separate.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does that mean if I go to

21

your argument -- I mean, the problem with your argument

22

it seems to me is that that leaves no room for this

23

appellate provision at law, because the only reason that

24

anything is likely to be unconstitutional in this area,

25

at least 99 percent of it, would be Speech or Debate
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Clause violation.

2

statute there is no direct appeal, or hardly ever.

3

So in that interpretation of the

MR. CABALLERO:

Well, there was a lot of

4

discussion in the legislative history about the

5

separation of powers generally.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

We were told that 75 percent

7

of the employees who were covered by the Act do not work

8

for an individual member.

9

provision to be facially unconstitutional under the

10

So how could, how could a

Speech or Debate Clause?

11

MR. CABALLERO:

Well, I think the provision

12

wasn't held facially unconstitutional.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

What could it possibly be?

14

And if it couldn't possibly be then what did Congress

15

have in mind when it provided it for an interlocutory

16

appeal from a ruling on the constitutionality of the

17

statute.

18

MR. CABALLERO:

Again, there was major

19

debate in the Congress over whether or not the provision

20

of judicial hearing of suits over congressional

21

employment decisions, separate from the Speech or Debate

22

Clause, just a separation of powers concern of having

23

the judiciary oversee the workings of Congress, and

24

there was a concern about that separation of powers

25

issue, which would be a facial issue.
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Can you hear any

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suits by employees of Congress who are employed in a

2

separate branch?

3

And that was where this provision has life,

4

and is meant to protect the ability for a litigant to

5

bring it before this Court immediately; it would be a

6

facial challenge.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

That, that may make

8

sense.

I, I wondered why -- why they would provide for

9

an appeal on constitutionality if they had in mind the

10

Speech or Debate Clause stuff, when the legislation

11

itself says that nothing herein shall be deemed a

12

violation of speech.

13

MR. CABALLERO:

member's -- exactly.

Right.

It preserves a

It preserves a member's speech or

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. CABALLERO:

Yeah.
And when Congress did

18

provide these rights under the statute, it was very

19

important for the Congress under the previous regime

20

affecting the Senate, employees had employment

21

protections and they had administrative processes that

22

they could go to.

23

And Congress made a specific decision that providing

24

that right of action was an important employment law

25

protection employees needed.

But they lacked a judicial right.

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

And again it relied on this Court's

2

decisions both under the Speech or Debate Clause as to

3

the scope of the clause and under Forrester where this

4

Court held that a judge's employment decision as to an

5

employee who did judicial duties was not a judicial act,

did -- achieve absolute immunity.

13

does the Speech or Debate Clause bar the jurisdiction of

think the question, the answer to that question has to

17

be no.

There has been

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it will -- the money is

simply Senate money.
MR. CABALLERO:

Yes.

The money is an

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appropriation of Senate -- and under the fund, the money

2

is an appropriation for the specific fund under the Act

3

for paying judgements in these cases.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But none of those funds

5

are, as I understand it, are somehow subtracted from or

6

contributed by the funds of individual senatorial

7

offices while a Senator is in office.

8

that those, that there is a separate appropriation for

9

the payment of -- of any such judgment, is that correct?

10

MR. CABALLERO:

I am assuming

Under the Act there is.

11

Congress decided to not have any personal liability for

a member to shield them from that, and also not to

13

require the member's office in cases such as illegal

discrimination cases, to pay the awards or judgments.

This goes to the question that Justice
Stevens asked.

In Gravel the Court made it clear that

10

if the member is made to answer in his defense for a

11

legislative act, that violates the Speech or Debate

12

Clause.

13

does, would have to come forward and explain a

14

legislative act:

15

employee?

Under the, these types of cases the member

16

that is, why did I terminate this

That is the explanation, because the

17

termination itself is a legislative act, he is being

questioned about a legislative act.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. MANNING:

All right.

So for that reason the Senate
