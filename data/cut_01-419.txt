ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


9
10
11

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May


it please the Court:

The question presented in this case is whether


12

Congress in 1994 divested the States of their traditional


13

authority to delegate police powers over local safety


14

matters to their political subdivisions.

15

small matter for Congress to impose such a restriction on


16

the States, and we submit they did no such thing in this


17

instance. 


It would be no


18

In making that point, it may be helpful to look


19

at the text of the statute, which is reprinted in full in


20

the appendix to our brief, the blue brief.

21

of that appendix specifically repeats the language of


22

(c)(2)(A), the operative provision at issue here. 


23

And page A-2


And our first point, as a matter of the language


24

of the statute, is that Congress specifically said that


25

the preemption provision, quote, "shall not restrict the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

safety regulatory authority of a State."


2

Now, prior to 1994, Ohio, the State of Ohio, had


3

exercised regulatory authority in this area by delegating


4

its power specifically over tow truck regulations to local


5

political subdivisions.

6

understand how the court of appeals interpretation does


7

not in fact, quote, "restrict the safety regulatory


8

authority of a State."

9

QUESTION:

It's very difficult for us to


That's --


Well, I think the argument on the


10

other side, Mr. Sutton, is that the first section (a)(1)


11

does say, no State or political subdivision thereof and no


12

interstate agency.

13

so that when you come down to the section you've just


14

quoted, and it only says State, there's perhaps a fair


15

inference that only a State and not a political


16

subdivision is included. 


17

It talks about a political subdivision


MR. SUTTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the normal


18

Russello argument is that a litigant like myself is trying


19

to read into another provision a term that is specifically


20

mentioned elsewhere in the statute.

21

is that we're trying to read the term, political


22

subdivision, into (c)(2)(A).

23

to do. 


24
25

Here the suggestion


That's not what we're trying


What we're saying is the traditional safety

regulatory authority of a State was preserved by (c)(2)(A)

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and traditionally States, including Ohio, had specifically


2

exercised that authority by delegating it in some


3

instances to State executive branch agencies and in other


4

instances, specifically here, to political subdivisions.


5

QUESTION:

Would your argument be the same if


6

the State had not made a specific delegation?

7

a specific delegation with respect to tow trucks?


8
9

MR. SUTTON:

Did it make


Actually it did, although it's --


it's backwards, in the sense that they generally regulate


10

all motor carriers at the State level, but they exempted


11

tow trucks, therefore allowing political subdivisions like


12

Columbus to enact their own tow truck ordinances.

13

fact, in this case it would be specific, although I


14

wouldn't say our argument rests on that point.

15

States like Ohio are home rule States, which in their


16

constitutions give general grants to political


17

subdivisions to have powers of local self-government.

18

in this case, I -- I would say it's a little easier


19

because there was something specific as to tow trucks, but


20

I wouldn't say that our argument rests on that point.


21

QUESTION:

So, in


Many


So,


Mr. Sutton, would -- would you look a


22

little further down in, in the provision set forth in the


23

appendix to your brief?

24

reading from (c)(2)(A) --


25

MR. SUTTON:

Look on page A-3.

You were


Yes, Your Honor. 

5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

-- in which it says, shall not


2

restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.

3

you say that includes, you know, political subdivisions of


4

a State.


5
6
7
8
9
10

MR. SUTTON:

No.

And


That it includes the right to


delegate political subdivisions.

QUESTION:

All right.

Okay.

Just read two --


two lines later, (2)(C) where it says, does not apply.

Right. 


MR. SUTTON:
QUESTION:

Again, it uses the same -- shall not


11

restrict, does not apply to the authority of a State, or a


12

political subdivision of a State, to enact or enforce a


13

law, regulation, or other provision.

14

provision does it say does not apply to a State or a


15

political subdivision?

16

you say State, it includes whatever authority the State


17

has to delegate to a political subdivision.


18

MR. SUTTON:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SUTTON:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Why in that


Because you're telling us, when


We're not saying --

You wouldn't have --

We're not --

-- you wouldn't have needed that


language there.

MR. SUTTON:

We're not saying States are


24

political subdivisions.

We're simply saying the


25

preservation of a State, deregulatory authority of a State

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

includes the power to delegate. 


2

But as to (c)(2)(C), keep in mind that was a


3

1995 amendment.

4

legislation.

5

Congress's --


That was not part of the original


So, the suggestion would be that


6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SUTTON:

8

act.

Well --

-- style in 1995 modified the 1994


And no one is arguing --


9

QUESTION:

I think we always look at an act in


10

toto and -- and don't try to piece it apart as to what was


11

enacted when.

12

this statute as a whole.


13

It seems to me we have to make sense of


MR. SUTTON:

That's -- that's true, Your Honor. 


14

But I -- in O'Gilve, the Court said specifically that a


15

later act cannot modify the terms of an earlier act.


16
17
18

But let me -- I think there's another answer

that --

QUESTION:

It doesn't modify it, but it -- it


19

can give clear indication of what -- of what it meant. 
 I

20

mean, you're assuming that it modifies it.


21

MR. SUTTON:

Right.

Well, Your Honor, the --


22

the thing that I think may be helpful in thinking about


23

(c)(2)(C) and the other mentions of political subdivision


24

throughout 14501 is they're all in the context of --


25

context of the enact or enforce language, which is exactly

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

how (c)(1) reads.

2

not enact or enforce these particular laws.

3

course, is not the way (c)(2)(A) or, for that matter,


4

(a)(2) -- (a)(2) does exactly the same thing.

5

preserves the safety regulatory authority of the State


6

over these various other provisions elsewhere identified


7

in title 49.


8
9

(c)(1) says these political bodies may

That, of


It


When it comes to (c)(2)(C), it's dealing with a

topic specifically mentioned in (c)(1), prices.

And it


10

follows the exact same structure of(c)(1), not


11

surprisingly, because it's dealing with a topic that is


12

covered in (c)(1).


13

(c)(2)(A) --


14

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, are you making the


15

distinction there between the safety regulations which


16

would be covered under (c)(2) and the economic regulation


17

which would be the main prohibition?


18

MR. SUTTON:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And there was


19

a division of authority, going back to 1966, where the old


20

ICC had regulated all of the economic issues over motor


21

carriers, and the Department of Transportation had


22

regulated all the safety issues.

23

is they're simply deregulating.

24

this area.

25

in Morales, that States wouldn't undo that particular


And what happens in 1994

The ICC is deregulating


They wanted to make sure, as this Court said


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

deregulatory effort.

But at the same time, as (c)(2)(A)


2

and (a)(2) makes clear, they wanted to preserve the


3

provisions of a separate part of title 49 dealing with


4

safety issues, something that DOT, a separate agency, had


5

always regulated.

6

help in getting to your -- your point.


And I hope, Justice Scalia, this will


7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SUTTON:

9

QUESTION:

There's a --

Oh, I'm sorry. 

There's a question I think that still


10

would be left open even if you prevail; that is, whether


11

these regulations are appropriately characterized as


12

economic or safety.

13

MR. SUTTON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SUTTON:

You say they're all safety. 

Absolutely. 

But that hasn't been adjudicated yet.

Absolutely.

And -- and if -- if


16

the court of appeals decision would reverse, it would


17

certainly be within the rights of respondents to go back


18

to the Sixth Circuit and say, as to some of these


19

provisions of the Columbus code, they are not in fact


20

safety ordinances or safety provisions, and therefore they


21

could be regulated as a price, route, or service. 


22

But there's another, I think, important point


23

that responds to this issue of the mention of political


24

subdivisions elsewhere in 14501.

25

agreement in the case that as to (c)(2)(A), all of the


I think there is general

1

other words, every single other word in (c)(2)(A)


2

including, for example, the definition of the term safety,


3

is defined not from 1994 on by looking at the difference


4

of -- between safety and price, routes, or services


5

mentioned in (c)(1) -- in other words, you would not


6

define safety after 1994 based on its contextual


7

comparison to prices --


8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SUTTON:

10

Excuse me, Your Honor.

It's on


A-2 of our appendix, and it's -- it's labeled motor


11

carriers of property.

12

more clear.


13

Where -- where exactly is (c)(2)(A)?


Excuse me.

I should have made that


The point I was trying to make is that these


14

other terms in (c)(2)(A) I think all would agree would be


15

defined by other provisions in title 49.

16

word safety would be defined by the provisions in chapter


17

311 of title 49, which is a large -- a large section of


18

the code dealing with safety provisions.

19

within the States' rights after 1994 to suddenly start


20

reinventing new definitions of safety, new definitions of


21

hazardous materials routing restrictions or size and


22

weight routing restrictions.

23

of those definitions, including notably those preemption


24

provisions.

25

interpretation of (c)(2)(A) to say that, yes, you


For example, the


It would not be


We would be stuck with all

1

determine the meaning of all of these preserved matters by


2

reference to other parts of title 49, but you do not do so


3

when it comes to what the meaning of safety regulatory


4

authority of a State is.


5

And when you look at those other provisions of


6

title 49, it's quite clear that Congress contemplated in


7

all of them -- routing restrictions, safety -- that States


8

could delegate their power to local subdivisions.

9

not only in some of the statutory provisions, but it's in


10

That's


the regulations. 


11

QUESTION:

Well, but it's not defined.

It


12

doesn't -- there's not a definition that says, State


13

includes political subdivision of a State.

15

MR. SUTTON:
Honor.

We're not saying a State --

MR. SUTTON:

19

That's not our argument, Your


I understand it's not your argument. 

We're not saying --

It would be a stronger argument if


that were your argument.

20

(Laughter.) 


21

MR. SUTTON:

That -- that's my point. 


I -- I disagree, Your Honor.

We're


22

not saying that -- Congress -- let me put it this way. 


23

Congress has no right to empower a city.

24

create a city.

25

power the States have.

Congress can't


They can't give it a power.

That's a


It made perfect sense in (c)(2)(A)

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to preserve the safety regulatory authority of a State


2

because it's the State legislature's job to determine what


3

other political bodies, if any, regulate in that area.


4

QUESTION:

Well, in that connection, I was going


5

to ask could this -- suppose that you do not prevail in


6

this case and we accept the respondents' interpretation. 


7

Could the State then every year have a cleanup statute in


8

which it says the State hereby adopts -- or authorizes


9

cities that are no less than X number of persons, no


10

greater than Y number of persons, obviously referring to


11

the City of Columbus, that -- that the State then allows


12

specifically Columbus to regulate, that it have an


13

ordinance and it just tracks the whole ordinance?


14
15

MR. SUTTON:

And that


we think --


16

QUESTION:

17

much in your view. 


18

Absolutely, Your Honor.

MR. SUTTON:

So, then we're not arguing about very


Well, Your Honor, that would strike


19

me as an extraordinary hoop for Congress to ask the States


20

to step through.

21

this Court has ever construed to mean that State


22

legislatures alone, but not their political subdivisions,


23

can regulate a particular area.

24

statute where that's ever happened. 


25

We're not aware of a single statute that


QUESTION:

I'm not aware of a single


There's a -- there's a problem with

12

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cities when you get to safety regulation for trucks.

2

you give me an example of a safety regulation that a city


3

might want to have that wouldn't have a negative impact or


4

some impact on routes? 


5

MR. SUTTON:

QUESTION:

7

MR. SUTTON:

Right.

Excuse me?

Can


The last word?


On routes. 

Right.

The -- and I think the


8

respondents' point is or suggestion is that it would be


9

quite natural for Congress to say, as to routing


10

restrictions, we want uniform laws.

11

the same throughout the State, and we don't want to bother


12

with municipalities establishing different regulations for


13

a routing restriction.

14

routing restriction is to account for differences within


15

the topography or geography of the States.


16

QUESTION:

We want them to be


Well, the -- the whole point of a


Yes, but I mean, there's a long


17

history in the ICC of trying to create, say, dynamite


18

truck routes.

19

that does once you start talking about it within the city. 


20

And -- and every neighborhood in sight says, send it


21

somewhere else.

22

are worried about creating uniformity of routes would say,


23

keep the cities out of this.

24
25

Well, you can imagine what something like


So, it's not illogical that people who


It's -- it's a nightmare.


And -- and -- but I have no reason to know

whether this is so or not.

And so I ask you, is there any

13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

kind of safety regulation that doesn't get into that kind


2

of routing nightmare when you talk about cities?


3

MR. SUTTON:

Well, hazardous -- I -- I don't


4

think the general rule has been that either the Federal


5

Government or the States have been concerned about heavily


6

populated regions deciding, for example, to route


7

hazardous materials around their beltway as opposed to


8

through the middle.

9

and the cities generally, including Columbus, have been


Everyone thinks that's a good idea,


10

left in control of that kind of decision, which is


11

something obviously one doesn't need to worry about --


12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SUTTON:

But I'm looking for specifically --

In a size and weight situation, of


14

course, you're going to situations where bridges or


15

particular roads in, you know, densely populated areas


16

require different rules than in rural regions of a State


17

where, for example, the roads are bigger and even if


18

they're not bigger, they're not as near to either


19

businesses or heavily populated areas.


20

QUESTION:

How about a restriction that on a


21

particular residential street that's, nonetheless, an


22

arterial highway, no trucks over 10 tons?


23

MR. SUTTON:

Could -- could a -- a -- the


24

question, first of all, would be whether that relates to


25

interstate commerce, and if it relates to interstate

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

commerce -- that is, commerce between States -- then the


2

Department of Transportation is -- is going to very


3

heavily regulate that particular route restriction and --


4

and has authority to preempt it, even as a matter of


5

regulation.

6

that's been something that Congress or the agencies hardly


7

regulated at all, and to the extent they regulated them,


8

it was only when there was Federal funding.

9

most part, the regime has been that a locality makes that


If it's purely intrastate, traditionally


But for the


10

decision through a delegation of power from their State


11

legislature. 


12

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, can I ask you, do you


13

regard -- just assume the -- assume the other side is


14

right on their interpretation.

15

city could not fix speed limits in neighborhoods?

16

limit is a safety regulation, isn't it? 


17

MR. SUTTON:

Would that mean that a

Speed


It is, Your Honor, but title 49 --


18

I think it's 31147 -- specifically says that traffic laws


19

-- I think a speeding limit would fall under that --


20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SUTTON:

It would be a traffic law?

-- is something that the Department


22

of Transportation does not regulate and neither does


23

Congress, which to me is one more indicator that you


24

don't, after 1994, start having free-form debates about


25

what safety means. 

15
Alderson Reporting Company

1

QUESTION:

But even if the -- if it's not


2

federally regulated, would there, nevertheless, not be


3

preemption under their interpretation of this provision of


4

speed limit rules?


5

MR. SUTTON:

On what ground?

I mean, it would


6

have to be a price, route, or service for there to be


7

preemption.

9

QUESTION:

No.

I mean, if -- if you read the


(c)(2)(A) --


10

MR. SUTTON:

QUESTION:

As -- I see what you're saying.

-- as -- as saying only States are --


12

can -- are -- preserve the right to -- to regulate


13

safety --


14

MR. SUTTON:

15

QUESTION:

Right. 

-- it seems to me that would preempt


16

a local government's right to fix a 15-mile limit in a


17

school zone. 


18

MR. SUTTON:

I understand what you're saying. 
 I

19

think the position they would take -- and maybe they could


20

clarify this -- is that if it's not a price, route, or


21

service, you ignore (c)(2)(A), and you simply go to the


22

rest of title 49.

23

to that. 


But I'm not -- I don't know the answer


24

If I could make one more point, Justice Scalia,


25

and I hope this responds somewhat to the point you raised

The city power comes from the

13

traditional safety regulatory authority of a State.

And we think, as


If I could save the rest of my time for

QUESTION:

17

Mr. Stewart, we'll hear from you. 


18

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART


19

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


20
21
22
23

Let's


AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

The phrase, safety regulatory authority of a


24

State, in section 14501(c)(2)(A) is most naturally read to


25

encompass the State's traditional authority to delegate

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

its powers to political subdivisions.

2

supported by the larger statutory context in which the


3

phrase appears and by the purposes of the 1994 act. 


4

That view is


As Mr. Sutton has explained and as this Court


5

has frequently recognized, one integral component of the


6

State's ability to regulate within its borders is to


7

delegate as much or as little power as it wishes to


8

subordinate political units. 


9

QUESTION:

We understand all that, of course. 


10

And -- and in isolation, that phrase most naturally would


11

-- would mean safety regulatory authority of a State,


12

including, of course, its ability to delegate it to


13

municipalities. 


14

But what is sticking in our craw is the fact


15

that elsewhere in the statute, the language is very


16

careful to distinguish between the authority of a State,


17

on the one hand, and the -- and the separate authority of


18

political subdivisions of the State.

19

your explanation for those other separations?


20
21
22

MR. STEWART:

Now, what -- what is


I guess there are about three


responses we would make. 

The first is, as Mr. Sutton points out, this is


23

not a case in which the other provisions are identical but


24

Right. 


2

QUESTION:

3

MR. STEWART:

-- petitioners' brief, it refers


4

to the authority of a State or a political subdivision of


5

a State to enact or enforce a law.

6

delegating power to municipalities is an integral feature


7

of the State's regulatory authority, it would certainly be


8

less than clear that when a municipality enacted or


9

enforced a law, pursuant to such delegation, it could not


Now, even though


10

necessarily be said that the State had enacted or enforced


11

that law. 


12

And so, if the provision left out political


13

subdivisions and simply said that the preemption rule does


14

not apply to the authority of a State to enact or enforce


15

a law, there would be ambiguity, and Congress -- whether


16

it was necessary or not, Congress might rationally choose


17

to eliminate that potential ambiguity through an express


18

reference to political subdivision. 


19

But the phrase that appears in subsection (2)(A)


20

is simply safety regulatory authority of a State, and


21

that, as you say, would most naturally be construed to


22

encompass the authority to delegate power to


23

municipalities. 


24
25

The second point is that based on the country's

traditions, it would certainly be an unusual thing for

19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress to interfere with the States' decisions as to the


2

amount of power that should be delegated to subordinate


3

political units.


4

QUESTION:

Has there been any -- what's the


5

closest case respondents could cite to show a contrary


6

practice? 


7

MR. STEWART:

I believe the respondents have


8

cited a couple of court of appeals cases which have


9

held --


10

QUESTION:

From this Court?


11

MR. STEWART:

None from this Court.

The -- the


12

respondents have not cited any case in which this Court


13

has held that any Federal statute had the effect of


14

divesting a State of its authority to delegate power to


15

political subdivisions. 


16

QUESTION:

Well, there are many Federal statutes


17

that -- that make grants to municipalities for various


18

functions and don't make it to the State.

19

certainly the Federal Government interfering in the


20

relationship between the State and its municipalities. 


21

And the State has no -- no ability to veto whether the


22

municipality is going to accept those funds or not.

23

there's -- there's been a lot of controversy within the


24

States between the municipalities and the State government


25

as to -- as to what money should be accepted and so forth. 


This is a --


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And


1

It seems to me that has exactly the same effect as what


2

you're talking about here.

3

indeed, indeed, intervened in the relationship between the


4

State and its -- and its political subdivisions.


5

MR. STEWART:

The Federal Government has,


We cited the Lee Deadwood case in


6

our brief as support for the proposition that Congress


7

would constitutionally be authorized to preempt municipal


8

law without preempting State law if it chose.

9

point is it would be sufficiently unusual that we would


10

Our only


expect Congress to address the matter fairly directly.


11

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, would you be able to


12

give us any examples of municipal safety regulations that


13

are preempted by this section as it's been interpreted


14

below?


15
16

MR. STEWART:

We -- I think that as it's been


interpreted --


17

QUESTION:

As a practical matter?


18

MR. STEWART:

As it's been interpreted below, I


19

believe the types of regulations that have been held


20

preempted are -- are fairly similar to the City of


21

Columbus's regulation, namely, a licensing scheme in which


22

the vehicle is inspected, the driver is tested to ensure


23

proficiency in the operation of the vehicle.

24

have been held to be preempted on the ground that they


25

relate to routes --


And those

1

QUESTION:

2

licensing schemes. 


3

So, we're really talking about


Is this anything that the State couldn't


4

undertake to do itself with its State driver's license and


5

so forth?


6

MR. STEWART:

I -- I think that the licensing


7

scheme, while we would respect Ohio's decision to delegate


8

that to municipalities, it -- in truth I think this is


9

something that could fairly realistically be accomplished


10
11

at the State level. 

Now, with respect to some of the other matters


12

that are specified in (c)(2)(A), for instance, route


13

controls based on size and weight or hazardous nature of


14

the cargo, because the determination at issue is whether a


15

particular vehicle or a particular cargo is suitable for a


16

particular stretch of road, those are the sorts of things


17

that can't realistically be expected to be done in their


18

entirety at the State level.

19

particular disruption of the State's processes --


20

QUESTION:

And therefore, it would be a


Mr. Stewart, before your time goes


21

out, will you give us your third point too?

22

the first two. 


23

MR. STEWART:

You gave us


The third point is that to the


24

extent that the provision at issue here is ambiguous and


25

the Court wants to interpret it by reference to other

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

relevant statutory provisions, it is important to examine


2

the larger statutory context.

3

limited to safety.

4

as Mr. Sutton was pointing out, the other matters are


5

covered in detail in different provisions of title 49.

6

general, those other provisions of title 49 contain their


7

own preemption provisions.

8

length what States can and can't do.

9

of safety, State law is specifically defined to include


That is, (c)(2)(A) is not


It specifies these other matters, and


In


They explain at -- at great

At least in the area


10

the law of the local governmental unit, and so the -- the


11

safety regime in the other parts of title 49 specifically


12

contemplates municipal safety regulation.

13

odd to think that Congress, in this oblique way, has


14

superseded that carefully developed statutory framework.


And it would be


15

And to put this in larger historical context, to


16

follow up on Mr. Sutton's point, from 1966 to 1995, at the


17

Federal level there was division of regulatory authority


18

between the ICC which did economic regulation and the


19

Department of Transportation which did safety regulation.


20

And it's no coincidence that State law as to economic


21

matters was preempted at about the same time that the ICC


22

saw its powers diminished and the ICC was eventually


23

eliminated altogether.

24

of deregulating the economics of commercial trucking. 


25

But --


This was part of a larger program

1

QUESTION:

Who -- who administers this statute? 


2

Is there a Federal agency that -- that can be said to be


3

administering this -- this statute?


4

MR. STEWART:

There -- there is no Federal


5

agency entrusted with the administration of this


6

particular statute.

7

administers the related provisions of title 49 that are


8

specifically addressed to these matters, and their


9

implementation of their responsibilities under those


The Department of Transportation


10

provisions would be affected by this Court's decision in


11

this case because if there is no municipal safety


12

regulation at all, that would obviously have an impact on


13

their administration of the scheme for determining when


14

municipal regulation is and is not permitted.

15

are not specifically entrusted with authority over this


16

scheme.


17

But they


So -- so to return to the point about the


18

division of responsibilities, Congress eliminated the ICC,


19

eliminated Federal economic regulation of commercial


20

trucking, and at the same time it preempted State law in


21

order to ensure that the States didn't undo the Federal


22

deregulatory efforts.

23

deregulation in matters of trucking safety.

24

provisions of title 49 remain on the books.


25

But there's been no Federal

1

discontent with the manner in which power in those areas


2

has been divided between the Federal, State, and local


3

governments.

4

accompanying the 1994 act refers specifically to those


5

preexisting provisions and expresses the intent that their


6

administration continue unchanged.


7

To the contrary, the conference report


QUESTION:

May I ask this question on the


8

division of responsibility?

Is it your view -- your


9

understanding that the cities would not be able in their


10

licensing scheme to regulate the rates that the truckers


11

charge? 

That's correct. 


12

MR. STEWART:

13

If there are no further questions, I have


14
15

nothing further. 

QUESTION:

To what extent, Mr. Stewart, does the


16

Department of Transportation -- you said there's no


17

administrator of the statute, but they do have authority


18

under the motor safety -- motor carrier safety assistance


19

program that seems to be relevant. 


20

MR. STEWART:

The motor carrier safety


21

assistance program, and they also have authority under


22

other provisions of title 49 to review and declare to be


23

preempted State and local laws -- State and local safety


24

laws that apply to transportation in interstate commerce. 


25

Again, those are not provisions of this particular

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statute.

They are among the preexisting provisions of


2

title 49 that were intended to be preserved by subsection


3

(c)(2)(A).

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, I hope you'll tell us


the practical effects of the decision below.


10

MR. CORDRAY:

The practical effect of the


11

decision below, as you uncovered it in your questioning


12

earlier, is that Federal law preempts municipalities and


13

other local governments from imposing their own individual


14

licensing schemes upon motor carriers of property and that

is --

weight limitations.

Are there situations where the city


MR. CORDRAY:

Size and weight limitations, as


22

the other matters addressed in (c)(2)(A), would be

that Congress did not want to open up the trucking

industry, where it was attempting to do something new,


2

which is deregulate it nationwide and create an unfettered


3

free market for trucking and transportation services. 


4

QUESTION:

So that if a city says no trucks


5

through the park with the public playground between


6

certain hours, that has to be the -- the State?

7

the only one that could do that? 


8
9

MR. CORDRAY:

That's


That could be done at the State


level and it could be done either by going to the State


10

legislature, as you suggested, or it could be done by


11

setting up a very simple administrative scheme at the


12

State level where you would go to the State department --


13

QUESTION:

Well, why would --


14

QUESTION:

Well, most cities I've been in had --


15

QUESTION:

-- why would Congress choose to -- to


16

regulate in that way, say we want the State to do it but


17

not the locality? 


18

MR. CORDRAY:

Specifically because they were


19

trying to deregulate this market nationwide.

20

place every municipality with the option to license


21

different motor carriers of property is not only --


22

QUESTION:

No.

To leave in


I'm not talking about licensing. 


23

I'm talking about the -- the example of, say, that no


24

trucks over 10 tons on this particular road. 


25

MR. CORDRAY:

Again, I think that petitioners

27

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

agree and all the courts have agreed that every subsection


2

of (c)(2)(A) has to be read together, and to the extent


3

municipal authority is being preempted in one respect,


4

it's being preempted in all.

5

Congress was recognizing that schemes directed


6

specifically to motor carriers of property at the local


7

level simply incorporated too much regulation that would


8

interfere with and impede a free market for transportation


9

services and motor carriers --


10

QUESTION:

And the reason is that


May I ask a similar question? 


11

Supposing that there's a heavy rain storm in a city or


12

something and it becomes unsafe to use a certain street if


13

the truck is over a certain size.

14

would not be permitted to divert the traffic around that


15

particular flooded area, I suppose. 


16

MR. CORDRAY:

Could -- the police


Certainly they could.

This goes


17

to your question you asked earlier which is whether


18

traffic laws, ordinary, general traffic laws, would be


19

preempted under our --


20

QUESTION:

No.

21

MR. CORDRAY:

22

QUESTION:

This is for safety reasons.

-- statute --


They figure it's -- it's dangerous


23

because the thing is too deep and the trucks have to over-


24

set -- overturn or something like that. 


25

MR. CORDRAY:

They -- they would be -- they

28

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would be diverting --

It would be preempted, I guess. 


2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CORDRAY:

They would be -- no.

They would


4

be diverting presumably all traffic that's heavy enough to


5

create a safety problem. 


6

QUESTION:

Supposing -- truck size traffic, yes.


7

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes, but -- but it's not directed


8

simply to motor carriers of property.

9

all trucks, all oversize vehicles.

It's directed to


It could be private


10

vehicles, RVs that people use to take vacations, whatever


11

it might be.

12

That would be permissible. 


And traffic laws, I want to stress, are not


13

preempted by this statute.

14

As this Court has --


15

QUESTION:

This statute is not limitless. 


Well, then what about the -- the


16

answer that you gave earlier to the question that the


17

Chief Justice and I had?

18

playground or -- or through a residential neighborhood at


19

a certain time.

20

preempted, but now you're saying it applies only if


21

they're motor carriers of property?


22

No -- no trucks through the


I thought you said that would be


MR. CORDRAY:

Let me step back.

If the


23

ordinance related to all oversize vehicles -- that would


24

be a general traffic regulation -- that would be


25

permissible.

And I'll -- and I'll get to that in a

29

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

moment, why traffic laws are not preempted by the statute. 


2

They -- they are not related to price, route, or service


3

of motor carriers of property.


4

If it was directed specifically to a type of


5

motor carrier of property, as this licensing scheme is --


6

it applies directly, specifically, and only to tow trucks


7

-- that would be a different matter.

8

not permitted to do that, and Congress specifically wanted


9

to do that because although there was a tradition of lots


Municipalities are


10

of regulation at the State and local level, Congress was


11

making a policy decision, as it's free to do, to say that


12

all of that is impeding a free market for transportation


13

services and motor carriers that's affecting broad


14

segments of the American economy.

15

costs, rid us of these inefficiencies --


16

QUESTION:

We want to bring down


I understand that, but I'm at the


17

same question that I think everyone has asked.

In my mind


18

-- and I might be misremembering -- there are lots of


19

streets -- there used to be in San Francisco and you'd see


20

a sign, and it would say, no trucks over 3-and-a-half


21

tons.

22

signs.

23

such.

24

And my impression is that in many cities there are many


25

such streets, and which streets there are is a matter for


And it seems to me in Boston I can think of seeing

I thought maybe they said, no trucks over such and

Maybe they just say no vehicle over such and such.

1

the municipality to decide.

2

and typically it's in residential areas.

3

of local regulation of that kind.

4

And it's a shifting pattern,

And there's lots


That's my impression.


And I want to know, on your reading of this


5

statute, does this change when I'm thinking of those signs


6

on one street after another?

7

they're preempted, and now each neighborhood has to go to


8

Sacramento, if they're in California, and convince the --


9

the legislature?

Does that all change because


I'd be very surprised if that is so,


10

that Congress changed so well established a municipal


11

pattern of behavior without saying anything about it.

12

therefore, I think everyone is driving at the same


13

question.

14

I want to know the answer to that question. 


15

And


I understand about all the licensing stuff, but


MR. CORDRAY:

All right.

Again, it's not what's


16

specifically at issue in this case, but I understand the


17

Court wants the answer to the hypothetical.

18

QUESTION:

Absolutely.


It has nothing to do with this case. 


19

I'm saying when your -- accept the fact that if I accept


20

your position in this case --


21

MR. CORDRAY:

22

QUESTION:

Yes. 


-- at the moment I'm thinking all


23

this traditional regulation of what street you can use if


24

you're a truck is being wiped out.

25

relevant.


I mean, that's

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CORDRAY:

It could be dealt with either of


2

two ways, Your Honor.

3

general traffic law, like a one-way street, like a speed


4

limit, and the like, in which case we believe that it


5

would not come within the preemption clause ex ante


6

because it has to have a connection with or reference to


7

motor carriers of property to come within the terms of


8

this preemption clause --


9
10

QUESTION:

Motor carriers of property or just


motor carriers? 


11
12

Either it could be regarded as a


MR. CORDRAY:

Motor carriers of property which


is what --


13

QUESTION:

In other words, if they -- if they


14

don't say on the street motor carriers of property cannot


15

use this, then it's not preempted. 


16

MR. CORDRAY:

Then it is a general traffic


17

regulation no different from where the speed limit says 55


18

miles per hour and trucks have to obey it, just as cars


19

do.

20

And motor carriers --

QUESTION:

Well, does the term, motor carriers


21

of property -- does that mean motor carriers of property


22

for hire or any motor carrier that is carrying property?


23
24
25

MR. CORDRAY:

Well, it would be those who come


within the terms of this specific preemption clause.

QUESTION:

Yes, that's what I want to know.

32

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Which does it mean? 


2

MR. CORDRAY:

Yes.

I -- I believe that this


3

statute is referring to for hire carriers of -- motor


4

carriers of property.


5

QUESTION:

So -- so, if a State were to say all


6

prices of all trucks in this State have to be $50 -- all


7

trucks -- and they don't say motor carriers of property,


8

that's not preempted. 


9

MR. CORDRAY:

10

No, that is not correct because


it's specifically referenced --


11

QUESTION:

Of course, it's not correct.

And


12

similarly, if they say on a street, no truck can use this


13

street --

Yes. 


14

MR. CORDRAY:

15

QUESTION:

16

of property, it's the same. 


17

-- and they don't say motor carriers


MR. CORDRAY:

The reason is -- no.

The reason


18

is that specifically references price.

There are lots of


19

laws that in -- tangentially will affect routes.

20

right?

21

obeyed by trucks, just as it is by cars.

within this preemption clause.

23

address it.

all general traffic laws, just as it's true of all general

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, on this point, look at


2

on page A-2, (c)(1), the general rule.

It has at the very

of property.

Right. 


5

MR. CORDRAY:

6

Where are you reading from?


7

QUESTION:

I'm reading on page A-2, (c)(1), the


8

general rule from which (c)(2) is -- is an exception.

And


9

the general rule is, except as provided, blah, blah, blah,


10

blah, no State, political subdivision shall enact any


11

provision having the force and effect of law related to a


12

price, route, or service of any motor carrier.

13

there's a lot of other language.

14

end, with respect to the transportation of property.

15

that phrase at the end go all the way back to related to a

price, route, or service with respect to the

transportation of property?

20

MR. CORDRAY:

And then

narrow provision then, wouldn't it, that -- that we're

excluding the -- the municipalities from?

It's not the best statute. 


It's -- it's clear enough with


respect to the things we care about here, which is that --

QUESTION:

Well, but I don't think it is.


MR. CORDRAY:

-- Congress very carefully

attempted to distinguish between a State and a political

subdivision of a State.

13

statute for the specific purpose of drawing a distinction


14

between them.

And it did so repeatedly in the


And the only way --


QUESTION:

There's not a word of legislative


history I take it --

QUESTION:

If you read (c)(1) as narrowly as


18

you're suggesting, you don't even need the exemption


19

because it only relates to law, regulation, or other


20

provision related to price, route, or service.

21

it doesn't even reach safety. 


22

MR. CORDRAY:

So -- and


No, that's not true, Your Honor. 


23

And this case is a good example of it.

They are


24

attempting to impose a licensing scheme with respect to


25

tow trucks and could do it with respect to any motor

2

And their -- their rationale for doing so apparently is


3

safety.

this statute and by this clause. 


5

But in fact, that is exactly what is preempted by


QUESTION:

But, Mr. Cordray, that's open.

Mr.

Sutton said that that question whether these regulations

are genuine safety regulations or, on the other hand,

I did want to get your response to a question

15

simply take the municipal regulation of Toledo and the

Suppose the State says, okay, we do

So, we will

Yes, it would, Your Honor.

If the State is doing the regulating or enacting

the way it was designed, that would be permissible, even

if it's nonuniform.

If we wanted to make it uniform, we'd

2

transportation which also could do this through an


3

administrative scheme. 


4

QUESTION:

So, it's strictly a question of form


5

that we're dealing with, that States, you can delegate to


6

your cities, as you always have, just say, cities, what do


7

you want and we'll give it to you by enacting a State law.


8
9

MR. CORDRAY:

No.

It's not simply a matter of


form because Congress made a judgment that if there were


10

50 different States imposing their own schemes, that would


11

be less impediments and -- and tangle of restrictions


12

impeding a free market than if 39,000 municipalities and


13

local governments around the country were free on their


14

own to do what they wished, and that that -- that was in


15

fact very much undercutting the desire to get to a free


16

market in transportation services. 


17

But I also want to go back to your comment and


18

your question earlier.

This statute does not itself


19

distinguish between economic regulation that's preempted


20

on the one hand and safety regulation that's not on the


21

other.

22

is related to price, route, and services of a motor


23

carrier of property.

24

regulation.

25

we can simply remand, the lower court can sort it out, I


The phrasing of the statute is much broader.

It


That may not only be economic


And so the notion that that's the divide and


38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

believe is not correct. 


2

Now, as we've seen here, the fact that the --


3

the statute is broad does not mean it's all encompassing. 


4

I mean, I could see an argument that truck -- trucking


5

companies no longer now have to pay corporate tax because


6

that affects their price.

7

As this Court has said in construing ERISA and needs to be


8

imported here in the Dillingham case and the like, there

has to be a connection with or reference to the specific

10

item at issue.

11

that's what we have with this licensing scheme here which


12

is directed specifically at tow trucks and will have a


13

very direct relation and -- and effect on their prices and


14

services. 


15

Here motor carriers of property.

And


I also want to mention the problem of surplusage


16

because it's not been mentioned on the other side, and

it's very important here.

when you speak of the regulatory authority of a State,

that naturally connotes the authority to -- to delegate

MR. CORDRAY:

Two reasons why that does not

work, Your Honor.

They agreed that the subsections of

say anything about regulatory authority.

It just says

I --I missed that.

Yes. 

But they're not talking about

They're just talking about


40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And


1

insurance is an excellent example I'll get to in a moment.


2

But also in the preemption clause itself,


3

(c)(1), it refers to the authority of a State to enact or


4

enforce a law or regulation.

5

authority, and it distinguishes it full stop from the


6

authority of a political subdivision of a State to do the


7

same thing.

8

the regulatory authority is being discussed specifically


9

in the preemption clause itself.


10

What?

That is regulatory


Enact or enforce a regulation.

So,


That's the fallacy of starting the analysis here


11

by jumping all the way to (c)(2)(A) and wrenching that


12

text out of context and divorcing it from the preemption


13

clause that it's meant to be a savings subordinate to. 


14

But the preemption clause itself --


15

QUESTION:

No, but (c)(1) uses may enact or


16

enforce just as -- as (c)(2)(C) does, whereas (c)(2)(A)


17

does not.

18

every subsection except the one that we're arguing about.

The to enact or enforce language applies in

That's correct, which is a telling

point.

to add political subdivision of a State.

22

heard a single sensible explanation for why they would


23

bother to do that. 


24

QUESTION:

25

In every subsection, Congress went out of its way

I've still not


Well, if -- but if you didn't add the


political subdivision in those States and if you had a

not be affected by it. 


3

MR. CORDRAY:

No, not correct because their

notion is that State includes delegating to its local


5

government as a delegated power from the State.

6

to read the two as being encompassed within one another.


7

QUESTION:

They want


When you described the regulatory --


8

regulatory authority in gross as you do in (2)(A), then it


9

would apply to the authority to delegate.

But when you're


10

talking about authority to enact or enforce, then you have


11

to identify the entities that do the enacting and the


12

enforcing.

13

distinction. 


14

It seems to me that's a perfectly logical


MR. CORDRAY:

Well, I don't believe it is, Your


15

Honor.

16

authority that is unique in this statute because (c)(2)(A)


17

does refer to regulatory authority with respect to safety,


18

but it doesn't refer to regulatory authority with


19

respect --


20

And again, there's nothing about regulatory


QUESTION:

Well, don't you agree that if you


21

didn't have all the other subdivisions in here, that would


22

be the normal reading of regulatory authority, which would


23

include the authority to delegate?


24
25

MR. CORDRAY:

I would agree that if (c)(2)(A)


alone were the statute --

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Correct.

MR. CORDRAY:

-- that would be a sensible

reading.

5

State and a political subdivision regularly in the statute


6

and then in one instance a special kind --


7

But if you -- that -- that's taking it out of a


QUESTION:

Yes, but in one -- but in one


8

provision, they say regulatory authority, which has a


9

plain meaning that you'd be -- brings a result you


10

disagree with.

In the other they consistently use


11

authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact

13

MR. CORDRAY:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

But it doesn't --


If you don't refer to political


subdivision, it just wouldn't include it. 

MR. CORDRAY:

It doesn't have a plain meaning. 


17

It doesn't really have any meaning because in the

preemption clause itself, they're referring to the


19

authority of a State to regulate, and they're separately

referring to the authority of --

of the preemption clause.

Correct.

That's the language


That's right.

Enact or

That was my point.

I -- I didn't make it as clearly as

Trying to give some special meaning --

Where?

MR. CORDRAY:

We're talking about (c)(2)(A).

earlier and I did not make it as clearly as the Chief


21

I didn't get it. 


22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CORDRAY:

But they're attempting to give


24

some special meaning to the phrase safety regulatory


25

authority, but by their own argument, that can't follow

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because they want to -- they have to read all these

provisions the same way.

refers --

QUESTION:

5

MR. CORDRAY:

And the second subclause there


The authority of a State.

-- to the authority of a State,


6

nothing about safety, nothing about regulatory, and has to


7

be read in the same fashion. 


8

I would also point out that the third subclause


9

there, which relates to insurance requirements, they would


10

be saying that municipalities are free to impose their own


11

insurance requirements upon motor carriers of property. 


12

So, FedEx, UPS in different municipalities would have to


13

meet different insurance requirements.

14

different kinds of filings and have very different kinds


15

of --


16
17

QUESTION:

You're too fast for me.

Where is the


insurance requirement? 


18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CORDRAY:

20

They'd have to do


At the very end of that provision.

It's the third subclause in


(2)(A).


21

QUESTION:

(2)(A).


22

QUESTION:

Oh, in -- in (2)(A), okay.


23

MR. CORDRAY:

And that is completely at odds

with the statute because in 14504, which this Court is

term, it says specifically there -- Congress said even 50


2

registrations by motor carriers of property in different


3

States for insurance purposes is too many for our taste. 


4

We think there should only be one, and they said the


5

single State --


6

QUESTION:

Well, what about the middle one? 


7

What about the middle one?

8

State to impose highway limitations.


9

MR. CORDRAY:

10

QUESTION:

It says, the authority of a


Yes.


Now, I can't figure out, for the life


11

of me, how -- why Congress would have wanted to say the


12

State can impose limitations on the use of highways, but


13

the city cannot impose limitations on the use of streets.


14

But your reading would lead to that.


15

MR. CORDRAY:

That would be one respect, Your


16

Honor, in which either -- if it was a general traffic


17

regulation, then it would not be preempted at all.

18

it were preempted, it would have to be done at the State


19

level and it could be done by the --


20

QUESTION:

Or if


I thought part of your argument was


21

also that streets are not highways, and I'm surprised you


22

didn't make that point when we were talking about the --


23

you know, no trucks on a school street or something like


24

that.

25

from local residential neighborhood streets?


Isn't the term highways arguably different from --


46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CORDRAY:

Arguably it could be, but I


2

believe for purposes of title 49, it's a defined term to


3

include streets.

4

perfectly sensible for Congress to say that the States


5

shall deal with these issues, but not the municipality.


6

But our point there was that it's

Mr. Cordray, is there -- is there an

example -- any other example of a Federal statute -- I


7

mean, it is unusual to say, States, you can no longer


8

decide how your authority is going to be exercised.

9

ordinary mode of a State exercising its authority is to

10

delegate it to localities.

11

there any other Federal statute that says, State, you may


12

do it but you may not delegate it to a regional or local


13

or municipal unit?


14

MR. CORDRAY:

Apart from this statute, is


There are two responses to that


15

question.

16

which is when the Federal Government puts a grant to a


17

municipality full stop and doesn't allow the State to


18

control the use of that grant, that's an example like


19

this.


20

The first is the example that was already given


But the other point I would make is throughout

its history, Congress has --

State, you may do it but you, State, may not delegate.


3

I asked an instance in which Congress says,


MR. CORDRAY:

I know of none, but this is a new


4

departure for Congress.

5

markets and sought to regulate them.

6

a market they had regulated and the States and localities


7

had regulated and they're now trying to deregulate it.


8

That's a new development and it calls for new measures. 


9

And the measure here was to try to clear away all this


10
11

They have always taken free

Here they're taking

QUESTION:

Since it was -- since you say it's


12

singular and this is new, wouldn't you expect Congress to


13

make a clear statement that the State may not delegate


14

this authority because --


15

MR. CORDRAY:

Congress did make a clear


16

statement by including the term, political subdivision,


17

whenever it wanted political subdivisions to either have


18

authority or be restricted in that authority, and then


19

specifically speaking only to States here.

20

not be a clearer statement of that.

21

term, political subdivision?

22

QUESTION:

There could


Why else ever use the


That is unexplained.


And the State may not delegate this

Now, you -- I

know you have said, and I quite agree, that the Department

of Transportation has no supervisory authority, it has no

Chevron deference.

16

from the courts simply because it has familiarity with the


17

area of motor carrier regulation that the courts don't?

But doesn't it deserve some respect

weight, if any, should this Court give to the Department


8

of Transportation's view, this is what the statute means? 


9

Not as an umpire, not as a referee.


10

MR. CORDRAY:

What


Their construction is to leave


11

them as an umpire.

But I would say certainly not Chevron


12

deference.

13

that's only entitled where there's some sort of reason to


14

think that before they got to their litigation position


15

here, which has migrated in the course of this case -- it


16

started off as an argument about repeal by implication. 


17

It's now turned into argument about sort of reading


18

statutes together to import them into this statute -- is


19

entitled to really, I think, no respect here because it is


20

not persuasive.

21

detail --


At most some sort of Skidmore respect, but


They have not analyzed the statute in


22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CORDRAY:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, if -- if you lose, you know --

-- in any of their prior --


If you're changing your argument --


you know, if you lost in the lower court, you'd probably

51

1

be well advised to change your argument. 


2

(Laughter.) 


3

MR. CORDRAY:

4

Your Honor.

5

I wouldn't disagree with that,


But again --


QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, what -- what about the


6

point made that if -- if you accept your interpretation,


7

municipalities not only would not be able to enact


8

regulations themselves, they would not be able to enforce


9

regulations adopted by the -- by the State, which would be


10

a great inconvenience, that the only enforcement can be by


11

the State police and not by local -- local police.


12

MR. CORDRAY:

We agree, but that's not what this


13

preemption clause is about or any preemption clause is


14

ever about.

15

don't use it in the terms of making law and executing the


16

law.

17

law or applying -- or enforcing and applying preexisting


18

law.


19

When they say enact or enforce here, they


They use it in the -- in the sense of enacting new


And the point of this preemption clause is to


20

say that municipalities do not have the authority to act


21

in this realm by imposing their own public policies.

22

a matter of either new law or preexisting law.

23

structure of many of these preemption statutes the Court


24

has dealt with.


25

QUESTION:

It's


That's the


If we think this statute is -- that

52

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there are arguments either way for interpreting it,


2

shouldn't we pay heed to the petitioners' point that it's


3

a very serious matter for the Congress of the United


4

States to tell States how they should govern themselves?


5

MR. CORDRAY:

We think the language of the


6

statute is clear here, Your Honor.

7

extinguished the power of the municipality --


8
9

QUESTION:
with that.

They explicitly


Let's -- let's say we -- we disagree


Is -- is that not -- let's say we find the


10

statute in -- in equipoise, or the arguments.

11

not give force to the argument petitioner makes that the


12

States should be presumed to have the authority to


13

determine how best to govern themselves?


14

MR. CORDRAY:

No.

Should we


There's no substantive Tenth


15

Amendment issue here.

16

or local governments to enact some sort of program.

17

is the same as the Court in Wolens where they said this


18

statute must be read to say the State cannot legislate in


19

this area, but they can enforce contracts through their


20

courts.

21

That's Congress exercising its power under the Supremacy


22

Clause, anything in the laws or constitution of the States


23

notwithstanding.


24
25

There's no commandeering of States

This


There's no Tenth Amendment problem with that. 


And as the Solicitor General said in the brief

in the Mortier case, the notion that when Congress decided

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that there could be State regulation but they had to


2

preempt local regulation, that they would somehow have to


3

be forced to preempt State regulation as well, simply


4

turns the Tenth Amendment on its head.

5

that there's any -- any serious constitutional issue here.


6

QUESTION:

So, we don't think


It seems to me your argument boils


7

down to the point that there are 10 provisions in the


8

statute.

9

says the same thing, but we're not going to read it the


Nine of them are perfectly clear.

The tenth


10

way it seems to read because it's not as clear as the


11

other nine. 


12

MR. CORDRAY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CORDRAY:

No, that's not what it boils down.


That's about all it amounts to.

It boils down to the fact that


15

Congress deliberately inserted a phrase here, political


16

subdivision of a State, so that it can preempt --


17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CORDRAY:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

In the -- in the nine, right.

And -- and it --


If you just read the one all by


itself, it's perfectly clear too. 

MR. CORDRAY:

Well, it's -- it is clear, I


22

believe, because it's clear because they said a State


23

cannot -- a political subdivision cannot --


24

QUESTION:

But the only reason --


25

MR. CORDRAY:

-- and they state the authority of

54

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a State to do certain things.


2

QUESTION:

The only support you have is they're


3

not as detailed and specific in the one in question as


4

they are in the other nine.


5

MR. CORDRAY:

6

detailed and specific.

7

for Congress legislating in this way or drafting this


8

language or enacting it unless they intended to make a


9

difference.

10

And -- and there's no rationale


That's -- that's the whole purpose of


QUESTION:

Your support is the context of the


statute, which --


13
14

I think it is equally


including that language. 


11
12

No.

MR. CORDRAY:
context.

No.

Text and context.

Text and


That's correct. 

Thank you, Mr. Cordray.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY S. SUTTON


18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS


19

21

MR. SUTTON:

I'd like to respond to a few of the


points --

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, could you ask one --


22

answer one factual question for me?

Your -- your

23

made the argument that in -- in reading (c)(2)(A), he went


24

to the last clause and said on your theory every political


25

subdivision could enact its own financial responsibility

brother


1

and insurance laws and so on.


2

MR. SUTTON:

3

QUESTION:

Yes. 

And that would be a crazy scheme.

4

-- my question is, is there in fact any history of


5

municipalities enacting these kinds of statutes so that


6

it's something that might have been in Congress's mind?


7

MR. SUTTON:

My


No, Your Honor, not in -- in the


8

insurance area.

But there's a -- I think a better answer


9

to that concern, and the better answer is, our point is


10

that (c)(2)(A) incorporates all of these preexisting


11

preemption provisions.

12

other parts of title 49, whether it's insurance, safety,


13

size and weight routing, or hazardous material routing.


14

They are preemption provisions in


So, the problem with Justice O'Connor's point of


15

practical consequences -- in reversing the Sixth Circuit,


16

there is no gap here.

17

Congress and the Department of Transportation have been


18

regulating these very areas, both with respect to State


19

laws and city laws, to the extent they've been enacted. 


20

So, the multiplicity of insurance regulations is a false


21

concern.

22

31138 and 39 what the rules are there.

23

Transportation has implemented regulations that do get


24

Chevron deference, and they lay out what the rules are.


25

Why?

Because for 60 years,


I mean, the -- Congress has already indicated in


QUESTION:

The Department of


The same problem, you didn't, is --

56

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to me anyway, is -- is (3)(A).

Do you see what I'm


2

thinking?

3

wrote the words in -- in (c)(2)(A) and he used the word


4

State, and at precisely the same time, he wrote the second


5

exception, which is (3)(A) --


I mean, the same human being at the same time


6

MR. SUTTON:

7

QUESTION:

Right. 

-- and he put in political


8

subdivision.

And what I cannot get over is I don't see


9

how a single human being on the same day at the same time


10

could write two exceptions, use the word "State" in one


11

and use the word "political subdivision" in the other,


12

without meaning a difference. 


13

MR. SUTTON:

Right.

Your Honor, look -- compare


14

(3)(A) to (c)(1).

They follow the exact same enact or


15

enforce language.

(c)(2)(A) does not use the enact or


16

enforce language. 

That's the answer. 


17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SUTTON:

19

Number two, remember, (c)(3) is for the benefit


That's the answer, number one.


20

of motor carriers.

21

these rules, whether city or State, apply to them on a


22

city-by-city not State-by-State basis. 


23

They want to make sure they could have


Now, the -- the regulatory purpose, Your Honor


24

-- the landmark legislation in this area was the 1980 law


25

that deregulated interstate commerce.

Everyone agrees


57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that did not divest cities of authority. 

The 1994 law at issue here was about intrastate


3

commerce, primarily to put FedEx and UPS on a level


4

playing field, and suddenly respondents are saying that


5

deregulated -- regulatory purpose required the divestment


6

of local authority? 


7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, what's -- what's Congress's


authority to regulate intrastate commerce?

MR. SUTTON:

It's at its outer edges, and that


10

to me is what is so odd about this particular


11

interpretation.

12

you could divest States of their authority to delegate,


13

but they've not done it in the interstate area?

14

how absurd is that?

15

backwards.


16

They're saying in the intrastate area,


I mean,


It's -- it's got it exactly


Now, the practical consequences -- I want to go


17

back to again -- of their interpretation.

18

they've agreed, has to be construed the same way


19

throughout, and there are countless -- as we indicated in


20

our opening brief, every State in the country has


21

delegations to cities that have size and weight controls,


22

size and weight rules that would be eliminated by this


23

particular construction.

Thank you.
