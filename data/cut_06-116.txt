ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case is properly before this Court,

12

which should reverse under the plain language and

13

purpose of the Organic Act of Guam.

14

at the time Congress amended the Organic Act to replace

15

the certiorari jurisdiction of the Ninth Circuit with

16

direct review in this Court, the Ninth Circuit had

17

already granted the writ of certiorari that had been

18

timely filed and the case had been briefed, argued and

19

submitted.

20

application to pending appeals, and someone had to

21

decide whether and how it applied to this case.

22

Ninth Circuit was the proper body to do that, at least

23

in the first instance, and until it did, this case was

24

before that Court within the meaning of Gibbs versus

25

Wynn.

As to jurisdiction,

The amendment said nothing about its

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Waxman, I thought the

2

Ninth Circuit did decide that question in another case

3

that was pending, Santos.

4
5

MR. WAXMAN:

It did decide it in Santos,

Justice Scalia.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wasn't that the time at

7

which it was clear that the Ninth Circuit no longer had

8

jurisdiction?

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, for reasons that we

10

articulate, Your Honor, in a -- I forget the footnote

11

number, but a footnote in our brief, there are some

12

important distinctions, although they turned out not to

13

be dispositive, between the nature and position of this

14

case and Santos.

15

But in any event, we know from the Ninth

16

Circuit that it did not consider it otherwise, because

17

if the Court will refer to I believe it's page 50a or

18

51a of the joint appendix, after the Court decided

19

Santos, it sua sponte issued an order in this case -- it

20

is on page 51a -- resubmitting this case effective

21

February 1 to the Ninth Circuit's active consideration.

22

And shortly thereafter, it filed the order in this case

23

from that -- in our view, triggered the 2101(c) 90-day

24

period.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are you suggesting that

4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

the test is whether under colorable jurisdiction -- a

2

hypothetical case, suppose the statute, Federal statute

3

is very clear that it applies in any case.

4

argument be the same?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Would your

Well, I wouldn't have the most,

6

the strongest argument that I have in this case.

I

7

think -- now, the Court's cases are not clear here but

8

it does seem to me that in the instance as here, where

9

it isn't just that a party has made some application or

10

filed a cert petition with a court, but the court has

11

actually reached out and asserted jurisdiction, surely

12

anything other than an amendment withdrawing -- that an

13

active withdrawing -- withdrawing jurisdiction that

14

requires anything other than merely a ministerial act,

15

where there can be no possible confusion about what

16

Congress intended to do, certainly anything short of

17

that, it lies with the Court to ascertain it.

18

--

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And here

But if we accept that in

20

the opinion, what was the phrase you used, colorable

21

jurisdiction, or -- it's something I made up, I suppose

22

-- is there some concept that we can refer to or some

23

phrase that works to -- in order to incorporate your

24

test that you seem to be suggesting?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

I actually would not embrace
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that test.

I think that in an instance, Your Honor,

2

where a court in which, properly had jurisdiction and

3

affirmatively asserted it and issued -- and I can take

4

the Court through this -- a series of orders of the

5

Court, following this 19, the October 19, 2004 enactment

6

leading up to the decision in Santos and thereafter,

7

which the Court continued to rule, continued to issue

8

orders in this case, I think a good argument can be made

9

that on a theory of constitutional avoidance the court

10

ought to construe any enactment of Congress, no matter

11

how pellucid it is, as not constituting a self-effecting

12

reversal of a preexisting order of the Court in which

13

the case had been pending per order of the Court.

14

And so I'm not sure that I would even

15

embrace a ministerial test concept in the context in

16

which a case is properly pending in front of a court

17

which has affirmatively asserted jurisdiction over it.

18

And indeed here -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

this question?

21

this order on page 51 is.

22

What did that do?

after the order entered than -

on 49a of the joint appendix.

3

remember, the Guam Organic Act was amended I believe

4

October 30, 19 -- or 2004, and it was silent as to its

5

effect on cases that had already been filed and were

6

pending in the Ninth Circuit.

7

But let's, maybe it would be as well to start
In December 15 -

Sua sponte, the Court -- well, actually it

8

was not sua sponte.

Almost two months after Congress

9

enacted the Organic Act, the respondent in this case,

10

Governor Camacho filed a motion on December 8 with the

11

Court renewing a previous motion for the Court to

12

expedite its resolution in this case.

13

Camacho's affidavit in support of that motion is

14

included in the joint appendix.

15

And Governor

In response to the motion, not telling the

16

Court hey, by the way, it's been nice doing business

17

with you but we have no further truck with your court

18

because Congress passed the statute and you are ipso

19

facto by operation of law no longer in business, the

20

Ninth Circuit issued the order on page 49a that says no

21

opinion in this case can issue until the case of Santos

22

is decided clarifying our continuing certiorari

23

jurisdiction over decisions from the Guam Supreme Court.

24

Now the contention of the respondent in this

10

case that the attorney general should immediately upon

11

enactment of the Organic Act amendment have also filed a

12

petition with this Court would do one of two things.

13

either would have put this Court in the position of

14

determining the effect of the amendment at the very same

15

time that the Ninth Circuit was doing so, which is a

16

state of affairs that this Court has repeatedly

17

rejected, most notably in Andrews versus Virginia

18

Railway, or it would have amounted to nothing more than

19

what this Court has called, quote, "the filing of a

20

redundant slip of paper."

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, am I wrong?

In Santos, but not in this case, the Court

10

attorney general did so in this case, and it's discussed

11

in our reply brief.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, going back to

13

what you just said, isn't a third possibility, the most

14

likely possibility, that this Court would simply hold

15

the petition if there were -- if the attorney general

16

filed a cert petition here while the Ninth Circuit had

17

not yet disposed of the case, this Court could have just

18

held it because the Ninth Circuit was likely soon to

19

dispose of it.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, the attorney general

21

could have filed a petition for writ of certiorari

22

before judgment in this Court, you know, at any time

23

prior to the time that the Ninth Circuit issued its

24

order dismissing jurisdiction.

25

This Court has said uniformly outside the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

special context of three-judge courts that it will not

2

require the mere filing of a redundant piece of paper,

3

to quote the Colville Indian Reservation case, and it

4

has declined to extend this well, why don't you just

5

file a notice of appeal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's no sense in

which it's redundant, though.

8

first piece of paper that this Court would have seen in

9

the matter.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

It would have been the

But that is actually what

11

this Court was referring to in the Colville Indian

12

Reservation case and other cases in calling it redundant

13

in the sense that it was identical or effectively

14

identical to a piece of paper that had invoked the

15

jurisdiction of another court at the same time.

16

In the three-judge court context,

17

Justice Ginsburg, although this Court's jurisdiction to

18

hear direct appeals in three-judge courts has been

19

greatly reduced since the 1950s and sixties and early

20

seventies, there are certain instances that this Court

21

has realized where it is unclear whether an appeal lies

22

to a regional court of appeals or to this Court and it

23

is unavoidable there that you would file a notice of

24

appeal in both instances; but this is not a situation in

25

which there was any uncertainty about where the petition
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for a writ of certiorari from the Guam Supreme Court's

2

decision had to be filed.

3

Ninth Circuit had certiorari jurisdiction.

4

Circuit granted the petition in this case and had

5

assumed authority over it, and so -

6

The Organic Act said the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Ninth

case -- you've made several arguments, but you have a

case that's lodged in the court of appeals.

simply a petition there.

It's not

review.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So in the normal course

13

when you have a district court decision, a trial court

14

decision, then you're on appeal and the case is fully

15

lodged in the court of appeals, it's like the judgment

16

is suspended until the appellate court is done.

17

have no final judgment that is properly taken anyplace

18

else until that judgment is entered.

19

essence of your argument, isn't it?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

So you

I think that's the

Yes, and in fact -- I mean,

21

it's -- I don't think that anything actually turns on

22

this in the context of this case, but it is quite

23

significant that at the time -- there has yet never been

24

any appellate determination of the substantive question

25

in this case.

The Guam Supreme Court considered this as
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a court of first instance that original petition was

2

filed in the Guam Supreme Court.

3

And the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals at

4

the time that the attorney general filed the petition

5

for a writ of certiorari was the only place the attorney

6

general of Guam could go to get review of this

7

construction by a territorial court sitting as a trial

8

court in the first instance of an act of Congress.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does it make any difference

10

that the review was discretionary in the Ninth Circuit?

11

What if before the act was passed there was an appeal as

12

of right to the Ninth Circuit?

13

be exactly the same?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Wouldn't your argument

It would be exactly the same.

15

We just think that, given the fact that this is an

16

instance in which the Ninth Circuit granted the writ of

17

certiorari and issued both before -- both before the

18

amendment and after the amendment and both before Santos

19

and after Santos orders reflecting the fact that it

20

believed it continued to have authority over this case,

21

the appropriate outcome in this case is more

22

straightforward than it might be in some other closer

23

instances.

Perhaps you should go on

to the merits.

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. WAXMAN:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And on that I have a

3

preliminary question, because we have a new attorney

general and the question is whether the new attorney

5

general continues to oppose the legislature and the

6

governor on this bond issue.

7

we still have a case or controversy?

8
9

MR. WAXMAN:

Do -- in other words, do

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do.

I have spoken personally and repeatedly with the

10

attorney general, who is with me at counsel table, who

11

has instructed me unequivocally to continue vigorously

12

to advocate the construction of the Organic Act that

13

reflected in our petition and in our merits and reply

brief.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I have a more basic

16

question, whether we had a case or controversy to start

17

with.

18

Guamanian officials about what Guam's position should be

19

with respect to the Organic Act and I'm wondering why

20

that's a justiciable controversy under Article III.

21

cases you cited in your petition all involved on its -

22

only facially intra -- interbranch disputes within the

23

Federal Government; but the agencies in those cases

24

always -- were representing a real party in interest.

25

United States versus ICC, the ICC was actually the

This is kind of an intramural dispute between two

13
Alderson Reporting Company

The

railroad in whose favor the had commission ruled.

2

shouldn't we just let Guam figure out its position on

3

its own and then when a private party with standing

4

challenges something then we'll have a case or

5

controversy.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Why

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, this

7

is actually an a fortiori.

If you don't agree with me

8

and you think that there really wasn't a case or

9

controversy, then we would respectfully submit the

10

appropriate resolution would be to dismiss and vacate

11

the Guam Supreme Court's decision so that the attorney

12

general -

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no.

Guam -

14

presumably, some state courts issue advisory opinions.

15

We don't -- that's their business.

16

of whether we have jurisdiction to address the question

17

in that context.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Indeed.

It's just a question

situation here, and this is why I think it's an a

JUSTICE BREYER:

I looked up, my law clerk

24

has, and found eight States that seem roughly

25

comparable.

Those that go to assessed value, every
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

single one of them -- and most of them do -- they have

2

the word like "assessment.

3

we found are Puerto Rico, Philippines in 1916, and Guam

4

here which don't use the word "assessment," but use the

5

words "aggregate taxable value."

6

All right.

The only comparable places

Now, what's happened in those

7

places?

8

with the Philippines in 1916 and Puerto Rico, there

9

ought to be some experience there even if we couldn't

10

We know what's happening in Guam.

I can't -

find a case how they treated it.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, they -- what's happening

12

in all those jurisdictions will certainly consume at

13

least the rest of the balance of my time.

14

answer is that -- is the following.

15

looking first at the States, there are States that use

16

the term "the valuation."

17

"the assessed valuation," "aggregate assessed

18

valuation," and there are a few States that use "tax

19

valuation."

20

elsewhere that the word "assessed" in this context is

21

understood to refer to the valuation against which the

22

property tax is based, whether that happens to be a

23

place where it is full value or a fractional value; but

24

it is also the case that at the time that the Guam

25

Supreme -- that the Guam Organic Act was enacted

The simple

There are -

There are States that use

It is uniformly the case in the States and

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fractional valuation was a commonplace for purposes of

2

assessing property tax.

Now, in the territories -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Try Utah, try Iowa.

Try -

There were three States that we

5

discussed, Passy is one, Halsey is the other and I can't

6

remember the name of the other one, where they used -

7

where the State constitution just said "aggregate

8

valuation" or "the valuation" and the State supreme

9

court said:

10

There's no modifier for valuation; that

must mean full value.

11

There are, conversely, the State supreme

12

court in Fishburn in the Illinois context and in the

13

Indiana context where even that formulation, "the

14

valuation," the State supreme court said:

15

is -- the debt limitation is always calculated -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Come on, it

Mr. Waxman, can I ask you

17

this, just about Guam, not about the other territories.

18

Is there anything in the Organic Act that would prevent

19

Guam from changing the assessed percentage from 35

20

percent to 100 or 150?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23
24
25

Absolutely nothing.
So there's no, no limit in

the Organic Act of any real meaning?
MR. WAXMAN:

That's -- the limit in the

Organic Act, and it makes it entirely consistent with
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

all of the other territories that I -- are not that many

2

and I will explicate -- which is the uniform rule has

3

been that the basis for valuation of property against

4

which the debt limitation percentage is multiplied is

5

the same as the valuation of property against which the

6

property taxes apply.

7

Congress has used essentially two formulations:

8

Springer Act it was "assessed value of taxable

9

property."

And in the territories the

In Alaska, it was "aggregate taxable value."

10

In Guam it's "aggregate tax valuation."

11

was "assessed value;" in the Northern Marianas,

12

"aggregate assessed valuation."

13

In the

In Hawaii, it

The Philippines, which you mentioned, is a

14

particularly instructive example because in 1902 and

15

1905 it was "assessed valuation," but then in 1916 and

16

1922, it was altered to be "aggregate tax valuation."

17

And then the Virgin -- Puerto Rico is "aggregate tax

18

valuation" and the virgin Islands, which we've

19

discussed, is "aggregate assessed valuation."

20

Now, the legislative histories of these

21

provisions, including the Guam provision, are lengthy,

22

obscure and frankly have been very difficult to obtain

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Please don't.

14

following.

15

1916, and in Alaska, were there any instances in which

16

they issued bonds that exceeded the 10 percent of the

17

assessed value as opposed to the aggregate market value?

18

They either did or didn't and that shouldn't be hard to

19

find out.

20

In Puerto Rico and in the Philippines after

MR. WAXMAN:

I think that would be hard to

21

find out, and I don't know.

legislative history with respect to the use of the word

23

"assessed" and tax in this context both in Puerto Rico

24

and in the Philippines.

25

I do know that there is

I don't know about Alaska.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Just on the merits, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

first thing that the tax authorities have to do is they

2

have to value the property.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

Correct.
And they're valuing it for

tax purposes, so that sounds like tax valuation.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm not -- our argument is that

7

the word "tax valuation" has to have meaning; and the

8

plainest meaning is the meaning, we respectfully submit,

9

the most natural meaning of "tax valuation" is the

10

valuation that is used by Guam for the calculation of

11

tax.

12

And that's true not only as a matter of

13

plain language, but for three other reasons.

14

all, as I indicated, it puts Guam in harmony with the

15

regime that has existed in every other U.S. territory in

16

which the value of property against which the debt

17

limitation rate is assessed is the same as the value of

18

property against which the tax rate is assessed.

19

secondly, or thirdly, that fully accords with the

20

statutory and legislative history both with respect to

21

the territories and the states that reflects that it has

22

always been understood that tax valuation and assessed

23

valuation are equivalent in this context, and

24

understanding that furthers Congress's consistent goal

25

of restraining borrowing by territories.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

First of

And

And finally, interpreting tax to mean full

2

renders the word tax all but meaningless.

3

Justice Kennedy, that it is possible to come up with a

4

meaning.

5

Court adopted but it is a possible meaning; but the Guam

6

Supreme Court interprets -- actually said in its

7

opinion, tax has to mean something.

8

not to modify valuation, the word that follows it, but

9

to modify the word "property," and to read it as taxable

10

I grant you,

It is not a meaning that the Guam Supreme

JUSTICE BREYER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BETH S. BRINKMANN,

3

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

4
5

MS. BRINKMANN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

6

This case should be dismissed for want of

7

jurisdiction because the certiorari petition filed in

8

this Court to review the judgment of the Guam Supreme

9

Court was untimely.

If the Court were nonetheless to

10

reach the merits of the opinion of the case, the opinion

11

of the Guam Supreme Court interpreting section 11 of the

12

Organic Act should be affirmed.

13

There are three principal reasons supporting

14

both of these positions.

15

Dismissal is required, one, because when the Ninth

16

Circuit was divested of authority to adjudicate the

17

merits of the case, on October 30th, 2004, this Court

18

was then the only court that could review that judgment.

19

First, on the dismissal:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Brinkmann, Congress

20

sometimes withdraws jurisdictions from courts, but while

21

the case is spending it isn't until the court issues the

22

order -- there's no automatic dismissal of the case when

23

Congress passes an act.

24

court, and that court will follow Congress's directions

25

and dismiss it.

There is a case lodged in the

Alderson Reporting Company

judgment.

2

suspended while it's sub judicata before the Ninth

3

Circuit, and then when the Ninth Circuit acts, then

4

there is a trigger.

5

The judgment of the Guam Supreme Court is

But until there isn't.

MS. BRINKMANN:

Your Honor, we respectfully

6

disagree.

We don't believe that there was any

7

suspension of the time for filing once the Ninth Circuit

8

was divested of jurisdiction.

9

the Eisenberg case has recognized that the time for

This Court as long ago as

10

filing certiorari is suspended so long as a lower court

11

has jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the case.

12

The Court reinforced that more recently -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if, what if you have

14

an ambiguous statute where it really is not clear

15

whether it applies to pending cases or not?

16

-- you say if it turns out after the fact that it does

17

apply to pending cases, you are out of time, if you

18

haven't immediately filed here while the case is still

19

-- is still pending.

20

MS. BRINKMANN:

What, what

No, Your Honor, that is the

21

situation that the Court confronts in the three-judge

22

district court cases within in the instances in which

23

there was a mistake made as to where the appeal should

24

be taken.

25

jurisdiction in those instances has vacated and remanded

And the Court has jurisdiction to decide, the

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the order.

2

I want to emphasize to this Court that in

3

the Santos case, Petitioner requested that the Ninth

4

Circuit remand the order to the Guam Supreme Court, and

5

in the language of this Court, what that does is it

6

refreshes the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court so that

7

it can timely brought here.

8
9

If Petitioner -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask, would the Ninth

Circuit have had jurisdiction after October 30, 2004 to

10

vacate the judgment of the Guam Supreme Court and send

11

the case back?

12

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes.

We believe under the

13

authority of this Court in those three-judge courts,

14

that is the solution that this Court has established -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We did that.

"We don't

16

have jurisdiction but we are nevertheless going to enter

17

the following order, which presumably depends on our

18

having jurisdiction, that the judgment is vacated,"

19

assuming it's bad.

20

could have done that?

21

You agree that the Ninth Circuit

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Petitioner

22

agreed that, he asked for that relief in the Santos

23

case.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't that subject

Parties that are out of time in this

Alderson Reporting Company

2

vacate and re-enter, and then I can start all over

3

again?

4

We've discouraged that.
MS. BRINKMANN:

We think not, Your Honor.

5

In the Donovan Ricky Richland case, the Court made clear

6

you would not vacate it when it was simply a failure to

7

obey the rules.

8

in that case, as we point out in our brief.

9

case such as Justice Scalia was positing where there is

10

an actual issue of, colorable question of jurisdiction.

11

The proper course would to be to challenge, and here

12

Petitioner did not even try to litigate the question,

13

did not file any brief after Santos came down, never

14

tried to distinguish this case from Santos.

15

waited and did not timely pursue the writ of the Guam

16

Supreme Court, the judgment that was final at that point

17

in time.

18

The Court refused to vacate and remand

JUSTICE SCALIA:

then, is -- is -- is the Rubicon?

MS. BRINKMANN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your last argument,

then, is irrelevant.

matter what they did before.

3

I mean if it's clear, it doesn't

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well, I'm suggesting in

4

response to your question, Justice Scalia, that in those

5

other situations where there may be a question, that

6

does not put the Petitioner in a situation of not being

7

able to seek review.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

10

Which is not this case.
That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Ninth Circuit would

11

have been without authority to issue the orders in

12

Santos under your reasoning.

13

powerless because the authority had been transferred by

14

virtue of the statute to this Court, so the Ninth

15

Circuit was wrong in any orders it issued.

16

MS. BRINKMANN:

The Ninth Circuit is

No, Your Honor, the Ninth

17

Circuit maintained jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction.

18

And indeed if Petitioner had litigated the question of

19

jurisdiction they could have brought a writ to the Ninth

20

Circuit and come to this Court and litigated the

21

question of jurisdiction.

22

was jurisdiction it could have reached the merits.

23

the Court had found it was not, there was no

24

jurisdiction, it would have -- in the three-judge courts

25

and said no, you need to come directly up from the Guam

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask, how much time

4

did the Petitioners have after the statute passed?

5

days?

6

been run?

Or the interval of 90 days minus whatever had

7
8

90

MS. BRINKMANN:

90 days Your Honor.

We

believe that the -

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

MS. BRINKMANN:

Why would that be so?
The timely petition to the

11

Ninth Circuit and the grant of certiorari would have

12

suspended the finality of the Guam Supreme Court

13

judgment.

14

the jurisdictions of the lower Federal courts had passed

15

that the statute, it was no --

16

that, was divested jurisdiction at that time.

18

days to petition.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, in this case if it

3

was not a false exercise in Santos, why was it a false

4

exercise here?

5

MS. BRINKMANN:

6

Your Honor, until October 30 of 2004.

7

Congress spoke.

8

It was not a false exercise,
At that time

And what that -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it, it, it was still an

9

exercise -- it was an exercise in this case of the same

which you conceded.

12

13

jurisdiction is determined on a case by case basis when

14

a case has already been accepted by the Court, and as

15

Justice Ginsburg said is sub judice.

16

if there was jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction in

17

Santos, I don't see why there wasn't likewise

18

jurisdiction to determine it here.

19

And that is the authority to

MS. BRINKMANN:

I presume that

So if there was,

There was jurisdiction, Your

20

Honor.

Our position is the same in both of those cases.

21

And indeed if that issue of jurisdiction had been

22

litigated in this case, Petitioner could have brought a

23

writ to the Ninth Circuit judgment and litigated

24

jurisdiction in this case.

25

determined that there was not jurisdiction, it had -

But if the courts ultimately

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Once the -- once the Ninth

2

Circuit determined that it had no longer a continuing

3

jurisdiction to do anything more than it did, in the

4

order that finally dismissed this, the other side wasn't

5

bound to litigate that here.

6

All the other side is saying is that up to

7

that point, the court was determining its own

8

jurisdiction.

9

determined that its jurisdiction no longer existed, that

10

And therefore it is only when it

the filing period began to run.

11

So it seems to me that the crucial question

12

is if it could determine its own jurisdiction in Santos

13

which you concede, why can't it determine its own

14

jurisdiction here?

15

MS. BRINKMANN:

It can, Your Honor, but -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't that what it was

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, but if it is found

17
18

doing?

19

there is no jurisdiction, then the party cannot have

20

relied on that to suspend -

I guess I'm still at a loss

22

on the point that for one purpose, the purpose of the

24

Circuit did not have jurisdiction; but for another

25

purpose, the determination of whether it had

Am I misunderstanding your argument?

I think

that's very common -

5
6

I don't believe so.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't see how you can

have it both ways.

7

MS. BRINKMANN:

Well this Court has made

8

clear, for example, in the three-judge district court

9

cases, that this Court has jurisdiction when an appeal

10

comes before it, to decide whether or not it has

11

jurisdiction over that appeal.

12

--

13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

(Laughter.)

know why this Court can have it both ways.

17

When parties have made

Don't, don't we have to

choose one analytical path or the other analytical path?
MS. BRINKMANN:

No, Your Honor, I think it

rests in this whole idea that courts have to have

jurisdiction to decide jurisdiction.

they didn't have jurisdiction, then it's retroactive?

it would have been a wrong ruling.

we discussed, where in the three-judge district court

when that turns out, the court says we don't have

route, we will dismiss, vacate and send back and come

are not on point.

It just seems to me very strange to say the

Your Honor, I think that

19

this Court addressed this scenario, and one of two

20

things could have happened.

21

Petitioner's argument, it would have been an easy thing

22

to file a protective cert position.

familiar, has recognized the appropriate of protective

24

filings -- certainly in the Federal habeas situation

25

where there are mixed petitions and we go back in

As you pointed out during

36
Alderson Reporting Company

This Court is well

thought, protective filing within the 90-day period

2

would have been appropriate.

3

because Petitioner filed a brief within that period in

4

the Santos case, recognizing that Brunner required that

5

there was a divestiture of Ninth Circuit jurisdiction as

6

of the day of the statute enactment.

7

And I urge, particularly

Even if there had not been that protective

8

filing, if Petitioner had a colorable jurisdiction

9

argument and litigated it, this Court has made clear

10

that once that has been determined adversely, there can

11

be a vacation and remand back to the Guam Supreme Court

12

so that judgment can be brought up.

13

turn to the merits if I could, Your Honor.

I would like to

the Guam Supreme Court should be affirmed for three

reasons.

of the text of the statute.

thought, well, one thing is clear.

18

to do here is they take out of the box, if you look at

or something.

22

What they're trying

I guess a school, maybe some tax exempt business

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now their reason for doing

23

that must be that those people who they've exempted

24

entirely by statute are not going to be much help in

25

paying Guam.

Well, if that's true, isn't precisely the

same thing true of the two-thirds of the property that

2

they don't take into account when they set their taxes?

3

MS. BRINKMANN:

No, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MS. BRINKMANN:

Because?
Because that property in

6

Guam is still securing this debt to a certain degree.

7

It is property that must be valued for tax purposes.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

It doesn't secure it

one bit if, in fact, the tax statute says you can't take

10

it into account when you set your taxes.

11

true of, let's say, a tax free business of some kind.

12

Now Guam doesn't have to do that, it could change its

13

statute, but so could it change its statute in respect

14

to a school, a university, or whatever the other things

15

are that are off those tax rolls.

Because that could be

the legislature could change that assessment to increase

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

With respect to much

14

of the tax exempt property, that could be changed by the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, whether it was their

intent or not, is it not the case that Guam could say

5

all property will be valued at 150 percent of its fair

6

market value and we will then impose a 1 percent real

7

estate tax instead of the 2 percent, or instead of the

8

1.5 percent we had before?

9

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes, they certainly could do

10

that as a matter of fact.

11

alter the debt limitation Congress enacted, and that's

12

precisely why we believe that the Guam Supreme Court

opinion gives a meaningful interpretation of the purpose

14

of Congress and gives a real debt limitation that

15

exactly should be affirmed as exactly the purpose that

Congress intended.

however, that the debt limitation is a real limitation

2

that serves the purpose of Congress in order to have

some kind of fiscal responsibility to the Territory is

what is furthered by the real limitation of having a

calculations.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you do have a

concrete appraisal, but it's just reduced to 35 percent.

the whim of the legislature without any accountability

MS. BRINKMANN:

Yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

appraisal practice?

I mean, in a lot of these

be 30 percent of the actual market value.

11

MS. BRINKMANN:

But here, in the Virgin

12

Islands and Alaska, Federal law requires that the taxes

13

be imposed on the actual value.

14

it said your assessment will be actual value.

15

why the term assessment was used in the Virgin Islands

The preexisting law in

Hawaii before it became a territory had tax imposed on

the actual value, and subsequent to the debt limitation,

20

the territorial law also put it on actual value.

21

I would suggest, Your Honor, certainly if

there is any debate that there's more than one

interpretation of the Organic Act, that deference should

to direct the court to two pages of the Guam Supreme

2

Court's opinion, and I'm going to summarize them for you

now, but for purposes of what's the difference between

4

in terms of bond holders, the fact that certain property

5

isn't taxed at all and certain property is only taxed at

6

35 percent, what's important to note here, and that is

7

reflected at page 26a of the petition appendix, the tax

8

roll on Guam includes a valuation of all nontaxable

9

property.

The Guam Supreme Court then has to go back

10

and say, well, of this approximately 183 million is

11

exempt.

12

courts are treating property that is wholly exempt from

taxation the same way that it treats the two-thirds of

fair market value that is exempt from application of the

Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's

17

questions about why are we focusing -- why wouldn't bond

18

holders focus on assessed valuation rather than the rest

19

and what difference does all of this make, page 18a of

20

the joint appendix, which is footnote 8 of the Guam

21

Supreme Court's opinion, which comes in the -- the

22

portion of the opinion where the court says, look, "tax"

23

has to mean something; we think it means taxable

24

property, not tax valuation.

25

The Guam Supreme Court in its opinion in

footnote 8, quoting from some language from a dissenting

opinion in the Hawaii Supreme Court, says as follows,

measure of the State debt limit is without

7

"The people that buy the bonds are interested in the

8

ratio of your debt to your assessed value because, while

9

all of the tax revenues of the State or the counties

10

naturally are available for the payment of the debt,

11

it's been customary for bond holders to look to the real

12

property tax as their collateral."

13

"It has been argued

That is the authority on which the Guam

14

Supreme Court relied and it applies to this case and it

15

explain why the word "assessed" and the word "taxable"

17

the legislative history of these territorial statutes

18

and why assessed value is understood to be usually

19

fractional value for reasons of political psychology
