 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

next this morning in Case 131428, Davis v. Ayala. 

5

 Ms. Urbanski.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN URBANSKI 

7

10

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

please the Court: 
 The California Supreme Court's harmlessness 

11

determination was an adjudication on the merits because 

12

it denied relief on the basis of the intrinsic rights 

13

and wrongs of Mr. Ayala's claim. 

14

 A Federal habeas court is authorized to set 

15

aside that final State judgment only if Ayala can show 

16

two things.  First, a legal error as a matter of this 

17

Court's clearly established laws; and second, actual 

18

prejudice under Brecht. 

19

 As to the first point, the Ninth Circuit 

20

took the view here that there was no adjudication on the 

21

merits, and it proceeded to review the entirety of Mr. 

22

Ayala's claim under the de novo 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You know, your  your 

24

brief confused me, and it took me a while to pull it 

25

apart.  All right.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 I don't know that there's a dispute  or at 

2

least there's a dispute in the application.  But really, 

3

the deference here was given to the harmless error 

4

finding or purported to have been given.  So there's 

5

no  there's no dispute that the court below committed 

6

an error, meaning that the court below didn't apply the 

7

right standards, a factual question.  The issue, I 

8

think, that you're trying to arrive at is under the 

9

circumstances of this case, that the Court also reached 

10

the performance prod of Strickland, and that's really 

11

where the dispute is, isn't it? 

12

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Well, the issue before the 

13

court was a Batson issue.  It was whether the procedures 

14

employed by the trial court had in fact  were the 

15

proper procedures in terms of excluding defense counsel. 

16

And the Ninth Circuit in this case took the view that 

17

there was no adjudication on the merits with respect to 

18

the State court's finding of harmlessness.  And it 

19

proceeded to review the legal claim de novo. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Urbanski, let's say that 

21

they  that the Ninth Circuit is wrong in that respect. 

22

Let's say that there is an adjudication on the merits 

23

here.  All right?  But I think that that doesn't solve 

24

the basic problem of this case.  There's an adjudication 

25

on the merits, but there are these two prongs; there's

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the harmlessness prong, and then there's the substantive 

2

violation prong, whether a Batson violation occurred. 

3

And what the court here said was if a Batson violation 

4

occurred, it doesn't matter.  It would be harmless. 

5

 So if you  for whatever reason, right or 

6

wrong  if you take that harmlessness determination out 

7

of the picture, if you say that that was an unreasonable 

8

application of law, all right, we're left with 

9

essentially a vacuum; right? 

10

 And so what happens? 

What does the court do 

11

where there's been no finding as to a Bat  Batson 

12

violation?  And you're saying that it should kind of 

13

make up a reason why there might not have been a Batson 

14

violation and  and go with that.  And why is that the 

15

proper approach? 

16

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Your Honor, the reason why 

17

that is a proper approach is because on Federal habeas 

18

corpus, what the Federal court is doing is deferring to 

19

the State  the final State court judgment of 

20

conviction.  Even in the case that Your Honor has 

21

presented, the State court has ultimately denied relief. 

22

It simply did so on harmless error grounds.  Had the 

23

State court done precisely the same thing as a matter of 

24

a silent denial, that decision would have been entitled 

25

to deference.

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why is  why is the 

2

harmless error thing out of  out of the picture?  I 

3

I don't really understand that.  I mean, if in fact the 

4

State court found that whatever error there was, if 

5

there was any, was harmless and if that's a merits 

6

determination, why do we even have to get to the point 

7

of whether there was a violation? 

8
9

 MS. URBANSKI: 

The problem, Your Honor 

that is correct.  But the problem, Your Honor, is it 

10

leaves us with what the Ninth Circuit did here, which 

11

was to look at the underlying constitutional issue from 

12

a de novo perspective.  That is not the proper start for 

13



14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm saying you don't have 

15

to look at the underlying constitutional issue.  Once 

16

there's been a determination that it's harmless 

17

whether there was a violation or not.  If there was one, 

18

it was harmless.  Once there's been that determination, 

19

why do you have to investigate whether there was one or 

20

not? 

21

 MS. URBANSKI: 

And that's correct, Your 

22

Honor.  The harmlessness determination would resolve the 

23

claim. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, you only do if the 

harmlessness determination is an unreasonable

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

application under AEDPA.  So if that is an unreasonable 

2

application, you face the quandary of what you do with 

3

respect to the substantive violation. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

6

 MS. URBANSKI: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

contend that it was fine? 

11
12
13
14

It obviously doesn't arise 

if the harmlessness determination is perfectly fine. 

7

10

Right.  Right. 

Correct, Your Honor. 
And  and don't you 

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Yes.  Certainly in this case, 

that 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So that ought to be the end 

of the case as far as you're concerned, right? 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

In this case that isn't an 

15

issue.  However, in the case where the State court has 

16

left unresolved the issue of the underlying 

17

constitutional error, we still do have the problem for 

18

future cases of how are we going to review that aspect 

19

of the claim.  The Ninth Circuit took the approach here 

20

that the proper standard 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We review judgments.  We 

22

don't review legal issues.  I mean, you'd like us to 

23

answer that question even though it's unnecessary to 

24

this case, right? 

25

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Well  and I don't disagree

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with Your Honor that if the finding of harmlessness is 

2

a  is a reasonable application of the Chapman standard 

3

in this case, then that certainly is the end of the 

4

inquiry. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  if we were to find 

6

that it wasn't a reasonable finding, then we would have 

7

to reach the first issue . 

8

 MS. URBANSKI: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 
So assume that it was 

10

unreasonable.  Let's go back to the first issue.  Yes, 

11

in Williams and Harrington, we have said that if there 

12

are multiple claims and the State court just says 

13

everything's denied, you assume that means Federal and 

14

State.  If the State claim is the same as the Federal 

15

claim, we say, they  they  they  we assume they 

16

meant the Federal claim as well.  But this is sort of an 

17

interesting case because the  they said there was 

18

constitutional error under State law, but they 

19

studiously avoided Federal saying there was one or not 

20

under Federal law.  And they dismissed the Federal claim 

21

just on the harmlessness prong. 

22

 And what the Ninth Circuit said, as I 

23

understand, they didn't reach it.  Constitutional 

24

avoidance made them decide that it was easier for them 

25

to just say there was State error.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Why do we reach a different conclusion? 

2

 MS. URBANSKI: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

3

The State court here did not resolve the underlying 

4

constitutional aspect of the claim.  And it proceeded to 

5

under  to resolve the claim based on the harmless 

6

error grounds alone.  That is an adjudication on the 

7

merits.  What the Ninth Circuit could not do is 

8

precisely what it did in this case, which was out the 

9

gate look to the underlying constitutional issue and 

10

simply resolve that based on what it would have done on 

11

the issue. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Why not?  If 

13

the State court didn't reach the Federal constitutional 

14

error, you're asking us to assume it did when you've 

15

admitted it didn't? 

16

 MS. URBANSKI: 

No.  I'm not asking the Court 

17

to assume that it did.  What I'm saying is that on 

18

Federal habeas corpus, the deference that is owed is to 

19

the final State court judgment.  And in this case, the 

20

final State court judgment was a denial of relief. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, suppose  I mean, 

22

that's a very broad kind of rationale.  It would apply 

23

even if the State court said that there was a violation; 

24

right?  Then you would  there's a violation, but no 

25

worries, it's harmless.  And then you decide that the

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

harmlessness issue is  is out because that's an 

2

unreasonable application.  And then you're going to have 

3

a reviewing court say, notwithstanding, that the State 

4

court found that there was a violation, we think that 

5

there's a credible argument that there wasn't such that 

6

we can support the judgment.  Is that what you're 

7

asking? 

8
9
10
11
12
13

 MS. URBANSKI: 

And that is correct.  That is 

how the scenario would play out, Your Honor.  And I 
recognize that that is a more 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's a little bit 

counterintuitive. 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

A little more challenging 

14

case for sure.  However, again, what a Federal court is 

15

deferring to is the finality of the State court's 

16

judgment.  And on Federal habeas, the question is 

17

whether the habeas can  petitioner can meet his very 

18

high burden of showing both clear error under this 

19

Court's precedence and actual prejudice under Brecht. 

20

And that does not depend on what the State court may 

21

have thought about 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why do we bother 

23

saying in Williams that there are circumstances  I 

24

happen to think this one of them  where  and you do, 

25

too  where a State court hasn't reached an issue, that

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we don't give it deference.  Under your judgment, we 

2

made a mistake when we said that in Williams. 

3

 MS. URBANSKI: 

No, your Honor, because 

4

the  what this Court also said in Richter is that you 

5

look to the  the decision of the claim as a whole. 

6

You do not parse it into its components. 

7

 And here the decision on the claim as a 

8

whole was that no relief was warranted because any error 

9

did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation 

10

such that the Defendant suffered sufficient harm to 

11

grant relief. 

12
13
14

 So that is the decision that the  that 
resolves the claim, and that's 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why do we apply AEDPA at 

15

all?  Meaning  I think we've said repeatedly that 

16

Brecht's actual prejudice standard is higher than the 

17

the AEDPA standard.  So why are we applying it at all? 

18

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Your Honor, if  if the 

19

Court were to proceed directly to the question of 

20

prejudice, then yes, Brecht would be the standard that 

21

applies. 

22

 However, before you even get to that 

23

question, the Court should look to what the State court 

24

did here first and determine whether that was 

25

reasonable.  If it was unreasonable or if there was no

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adjudication on the merits to begin with, then you reach 

2

the second question. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, you've  you've 

4

already admitted there's sort of an illogic when the 

5

State court says there was a Federal violation but no 

6

harmlessness and we say, "Yes, there was harm." 

7

 MS. URBANSKI: 

No, your Honor.  I don't 

8

think there's an illogic.  I actually think that the 

9

rule is all the more logical when you look to the facts, 

10

if there is a decision denying relief, and that is the 

11

decision that is owed deference under AEDPA standard and 

12

that is 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So we don't give it 

14

deference that there was a Federal error.  We don't say 

15

it was a reasonable mistake but they found error and we 

16

accept the error. 

17

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Correct, Your Honor, because 

18

the  what the State court may have thought about the 

19

underlying issue on de novo review is not controlling 

20

for purposes of AEDPA.  That is a different standard. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean, would that  would 

22

that also apply  I'm just sort of trying to figure out 

23

the reach of this claim. 

24
25

 Just take a case where there was no 
harmlessness determination.  There was just a single

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision about a Batson claim, but it was an egregious 

2

decision.  It was, Hispanics aren't entitled to make 

3

Batson claims, something like that, egregiously wrong. 

4

 But I guess under your theory, we just look 

5

to the judgment and then we decide, there is a credible 

6

way in which to say that this Batson claim was not a 

7

good one and that we should defer to that; is that 

8

right? 

9

 MS. URBANSKI: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

10

If there is a denial of relief, then that is all the 

11

Federal habeas court needs to look to and then look 

12

backwards and ask whether there was a reasonable basis 

13

to support it, and that follows directly from this 

14

Court's decisions in Richter and Williams. 

15

 There is no principled way to distinguish 

16

between where a State court does precisely that in 

17

silence and where the State court does it with a 

18

reasoned decision. 

19
20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Wiggins, Rompilla, or Porter, did we? 

21

 MS. URBANSKI: 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23
24
25

We didn't do that in 

No, your Honor.  Those are 
So we would have to 

overturn those cases to accept your proposition. 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

The results in the cases 

would not have to be overturned.  However, to be sure,

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this Court did apply a de novo standard of review to one 

2

prong of a multiprong claim where the State court 

3
4
5
6
7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That the State had not 

addressed? 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

Where the State court had 

left it 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Identical to this case. 

8

The State had not addressed one prong, and we said 

9

de novo review. 

10

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Correct, Your Honor.  And 

11

those decisions, I would agree, cannot be reconciled 

12

with this Court's later decisions in Richter and in Tara 

13

Williams, which precisely addressed the issue of, what 

14

do we do when the State court says nothing at all? 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

We added the question, 

16

whether or not  and the Court of Appeals properly 

17

applied the standards set forth in  in Brecht. 

18

 Do you want to address that briefly? 

And 

19

I  if we get into the details of this case, it seems 

20

to me that the key person is Olanders. 

21

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Yes, Your Honor.  First of 

22

all, with respect to the  did the Court have a  a 

23

particular question about Olanders D.? 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I want you to  to 

discuss that  this argument.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Yes, Your Honor.  Well, first 

2

of all, with respect to the standard that is to be 

3

applied in this case, the  this Court did make clear 

4

that it is the actual prejudice standard of Brecht that 

5

is to apply in virtually all 2254 cases, and that is to 

6

be the case regardless of whether the State court 

7

conducted a Chapman analysis. 

8
9

 What the Ninth Circuit did here was take 
this Court's language and say that it could apply the 

10

Brecht standard without regard for the State court's 

11

very careful analysis in this case. 

12

 Fry makes clear, though, that in order to 

13

give effect  to AEDPA's purpose in limiting the 

14

availability of this extraordinary remedy and preserving 

15

the finality of State court judgments, the Brecht 

16

standard, properly understood and applied, is to be the 

17

most protective of final State court judgments .  It is 

18

more protective than the AEDPA Chapman standard.  It 

19

subsumes that standard. 

20

 So what we were ask  asking this Court to 

21

clarify in this case with respect to how a Federal 

22

habeas court is to apply the Brecht standard is that in 

23

a case such as this one, where the State court has, in 

24

fact, conducted a Chapman analysis and found an error to 

25

be harmless, then the Federal court has to be able to

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fairly say that the State court's Chapman analysis was 

2

unreasonable. 

3

 If the Court cannot find the Chapman 

4

analysis objectively unreasonable, then the prejudice 

5

inquiry is at an end.  And in this case, the Ninth 

6

Circuit misapplied the Brecht actual prejudice standard. 

7

 The 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10

I have a bit of a hard 

time with the  this  assume I accept your 
proposition that it's actual prejudice. 

11

 In a process claim, generally, we don't talk 

12

about what the outcome was going to be.  We talk about 

13

what the process was and whether there was an 

14

opportunity for you to make arguments you couldn't have 

15

made.  All right? 

16

 That's our normal jurisprudence in a due 

17

process claim.  And we basically say you get a doover 

18

because you weren't permitted to have the process you 

19

were entitled to.  So you're saying we've got to treat 

20

this differently under Brecht; this person wasn't 

21

permitted to be there.  I think there's some very 

22

convincing arguments, potentially, on at least one 

23

juror, Olanders.  There, the comparison was not 

24

speculative.  It was based on the answers provided by 

25

jurors who had both questionnaires and voir dire that

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

was available. 
 And the briefs point out  and so does the 

3

Ninth Circuit, very convincingly  all the excuses 

4

given by the prosecutor are rebutted by either identical 

5

answers by one juror, Ana L.  Ana or Ana L., or other 

6

jurors who did exactly the same thing and were permitted 

7

to sit on the jury. 

8
9
10

 So why are we doing anything different with 
this actual prejudice standard? 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

Well, first of all, Your 

11

Honor, anytime counsel is absented from a portion of the 

12

proceedings or anytime a portion of the record winds up 

13

missing, it is often going to be the case that you might 

14

had a very different record had those things been 

15

present.  But the question before this Court on Federal 

16

habeas is whether the California Supreme Court believed 

17

that it had sufficient information before it from which 

18

to meaningfully address the issue on appeal. 

19

 And with respect to Olanders D. in this 

20

case, the prosecutor felt that Olanders D.'s answers 

21

were not particularly responsive to the question, to the 

22

questions being presented.  The prosecutor's primary 

23

concern was with Olanders D.'s ability to vote for the 

24

death penalty, and the trial court conducted a 

25

meaningful inquiry with the prosecutor and gave a

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

firsthand credibility determination. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But don't  don't 

3

don't talk to me generally.  Ana L. said more equivocal 

4

things about the death penalty than Olanders D., so did 

5

another juror, and they still went on. 

6

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Ana L. expressed that she had 

7

changed her mind about the views on the death penalty, 

8

similar to the fact that Olanders D. did.  However, what 

9

Ana L. said was that she hadn't given it a great deal of 

10

thought until being called as a juror.  And once she was 

11

called as a juror to sit on a  potentially, on a death 

12

penalty case, she now sat down and considered the issue. 

13

And after careful thought and consideration, she 

14

believed that she, in fact, could make that decision if 

15

called upon to do it. 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's what Olanders D. 

said, essentially. 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

To the  I would disagree 

19

with that, Your Honor.  Olanders D. specifically said on 

20

the death  on the questionnaire that he did not 

21

believe in the death penalty. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 MS. URBANSKI: 

So did she. 
But now called into voir 

24

dire, Olanders D. could not provide the prosecutor with 

25

a satisfactory explanation for why his views had

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

changed. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

He thought  "I thought 

about it and realized I  I could." 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

The  the  Olanders D.'s 

5

response at page 178 of the Joint Appendix, when 

6

specifically asked what caused the change was, "I mean, 

7

examining it more closely, I think  and becoming more 

8

familiar with the laws and the behavior, I mean, the 

9

change in people, I think." 

10

 That is a far  a significantly different 

11

response than somebody coming in and saying, "This case 

12

caused me to think about it, and now that I have been 

13

forced to think about it, I believe that I can choose 

14

this as the penalty. " 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That  you see the two 

16

of them substantially different?  One said, "I thought. 

17

I've listened to what the law is.  I've done"  it's 

18

hard for me to imagine how they're substantively 

19

different. 

20

 MS. URBANSKI: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think 
And do you think that 

22

defense counsel wouldn't have been able to point that 

23

out to the judge? 

24
25

 And, you know, there were a lot of people 
questioned in this.

 How many days of voir dire was there? 

2

 MS. URBANSKI: 

3
4

I believe it was three 

three weeks of voir dire. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Three weeks of voir 

5

dire.  Do you suspect that the judge, or think that the 

6

judge had clearly in mind every set of questions, and 

7

their responses. 

8
9
10
11

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Well, the California Supreme 

Court did credit this judge as being very diligent, very 
wellrespected 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's clear he was.  I'm 

12

not doubting that.  But my point is simply, do you think 

13

that pointing this out to the judge could not have had a 

14

substantial influence on his decision?  Because all 

15

three prongs, he could have pointed to almost identical 

16

comments by other jurors. 

17

 MS. URBANSKI: 

I would disagree that the 

18

comments would have been identical.  I think that there 

19

are substantial differences between Olanders D.'s 

20

unconvincing answers and the very convincing answers of 

21

the other jurors. 

22

 And in any event, what we look to is what 

23

the trial court, and then subsequently, the California 

24

Supreme Court, had before it at the time that this 

25

decision was made.  The trial court, as the

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecutor  while the prosecutor is making these 

2

raceneutral proffers, is  has the benefit of the 

3

questionnaire responses right in front of him.  The 

4

trial court has all of the information in front of it, 

5

from which it can make a credibility determination based 

6

on this record. 

7

 There is no reason to believe that the trial 

8

court was considering anything less, than all of the 

9

information available to it, and there is no reason to 

10

believe that defense counsel would have had any 

11

substantial impact in pointing things out that the trial 

12

court already had before it. 

13

 The Ninth Circuit here, in its application 

14

of Brecht, demonstrating that it was not applying that 

15

standard in a manner consistent with this Court's 

16

opinions.  Brecht speaks to actual prejudice.  It does 

17

not speak to the kind of prejudice analysis like the 

18

Ninth Circuit did in this case, which was marred by 

19

speculation and hypothesis, where the court of appeals 

20

is hypothesizing about what a prospective juror might 

21

have been wearing, or whether he was gathering 

22

prospective jurors for a social outing. 

23

 The Ninth Circuit used a debatable set of 

24

inferences in this case, to set aside the conclusion of 

25

the State court that a prospective juror's following of

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a very controversial trial out of San Diego, where the 

2

very D.A.'s office and police department that were 

3

investigating and trying Mr. Ayala's case, were the 

4

subject of serious misconduct allegations and suggesting 

5

that somehow a prosecutor basing his reasoning on that, 

6

was a pretext for a racial discrimination challenge. 

7

 The trial  the Ninth Circuit gave no 

8

credit to the trial court's firsthand observations in 

9

which the trial court found this prosecutor to be 

10

credible, and this was not a trial court that simply 

11

accepted the prosecutor's reasons at face value.  This 

12

was a trial court that was discerning and critical of 

13

the prosecutor's reasons, and even disagreed with him at 

14

times. 

15

 And when you look  compare what the 

16

California Supreme Court did here, the California 

17

Supreme Court did it right.  It credited the trial 

18

court's firsthand observations.  It looked at the 

19

colloquy between the prosecutor and the trial judge and 

20

found support for each of those individual's assertions 

21

in the record. 

22

 The court was confident that the prosecutor 

23

had not exercised challenges based on race in this case. 

24

The State court analyzed the very same 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How can you be

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

confident?  I mean, the whole purpose of an adversarial 

2

system is so that the other side of an argument is 

3

presented to the judge.  Was he playing defense attorney 

4

too?  Is that  and defense attorney with the same 

5

purpose? 

6

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Not literally, no, Your 

7

Honor.  However, certainly the trial court must consider 

8

all of the information before it.  And so it was looking 

9

at the very same things for 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Then I  why don't we 

11

just have a trial ex parte?  Presumably that's what 

12

you're arguing. 

13

 MS. URBANSKI: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15
16

I'm sorry? 
We should have the 

entire trial ex parte, because the judge can do that. 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

No, Your Honor, certainly we 

17

would prefer the counsel 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I thought  you were arguing 

19

the much narrower point that the absence of counsel for 

20

this one incident was harmless. 

21

 MS. URBANSKI: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

That's correct, Your Honor. 
  You're not arguing 

for ex parte trials? 

24

 MS. URBANSKI: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, Your Honor. 
I didn't think so.

23

Alderson Reporting Company

 MS. URBANSKI: 

We certainly don't condone 

2

that approach here, and there is  we certainly don't 

3

condone that approach here.  The 

4
5

else? 

6

 (Laughter.) 

7

 MS. URBANSKI: 

8
9

Anywhere  anywhere 

No, no.  We would certainly 

prefer the defense counsel be present, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I guess my question is, 

10

the Ninth Circuit, at least with this juror  I'm not 

11

talking about the other things, I'm talking about this 

12

juror  as I pointed out earlier, pointed out two 

13

situations that were almost identical to the one that 

14

the op  the prosecutor pointed to with this juror. 

15

Anna L. also said something that was totally 

16

nonresponsive to a question; it was like, "that's 

17

correct," rather than answering the question. 

18

 So you can say with complete confidence that 

19

that would never have made a difference to the judge? 

20

If he had had a real adversary able to point all of 

21

these things out, you're confident the judge would not 

22

have made up his mind.  That's what you're saying. 

23

 MS. URBANSKI: 

Based on the record in this 

24

case and what the trial judge had before him and the 

25

fact that this was a critical trial judge, yes.  I think

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the California Supreme Court had an ample record before 

2

it from which to conclude that defense counsel's 

3

presence would not have made a difference in this case, 

4

and I would go back 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, there  there's a 

6

real problem here, you do understand.  We're only 

7

pointing to the things for which there is a record. 

8

There is another component to this, which is that all 

9

the other questionnaires and the entire transcript 

10
11

wasn't available. 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

That is true, Your Honor. 

12

And certainly, anytime counsel is absent or anytime a 

13

portion of the record is missing, it will be the case 

14

that it is possible that the record might have been 

15

different.  But what we should look to is what was left 

16

in the record, and what was left was a  was thousands 

17

of pages of a voir dire transcript.  It was all of the 

18

questionnaires of the seated jurors, which are the most 

19

important ones for purposes of comparative analysis, and 

20

the firsthand observation 

21
22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Three weeks, is that 

standard?  Three weeks?  Is that standard out there? 
 MS. URBANSKI:

Your Honor.

 Mr. Dain.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY J. DAIN 

7
8
9
10

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. DAIN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Let me start by answering the question that 

11

Justice Scalia, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan 

12

asked when this first began.  And, that is, yes, this 

13

was an adjudication on the merits, based on the 

14

harmlessness determination.  The reason the State wants 

15

to address the first prong in the first instance, is 

16

because it wants to create the fiction that by treating 

17

this holistically, the California Supreme Court actually 

18

found no Federal error, and that is what this Court must 

19

grant deference to. 

20

 So let's start with the second question. 

21

The second question is the question at heart:  Was 

22

Brecht applied appropriately?  And we only get to that 

23

in the  the general context, if there was an 

24

unreasonable determination of Chapman by the State 

25

Supreme Court.  And the Ninth Circuit said, we grant

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

deference on that point to the California Supreme Court. 
 I'll address Olanders D., but let me even 

3

show you why this is case closed in an overarching 

4

pretext by the prosecutor, that led to all the harm in 

5

this case. 

6

 When the trial court asked the prosecutor to 

7

State his raceneutral reasons, the first words out of 

8

the prosecutor's mar  mouth, were pretext, active 

9

pretext, using a shield as a sword. 

10

 The prosecutor said, and I quote, We can do 

11

that but we will do it in chambers, because they have no 

12

right  the defense  to our strategy.  That was 

13

pretext. 

14

 The prosecutor was stating on an overarching 

15

level for Olanders D., Galileo S.  or Galileo, 

16

Barbara S., Gerardo O., and the others, that his primary 

17

reason for challenge was strategy.  And that was 

18

pretext.  The trial court, which the State says we 

19

much  must give great deference to because it 

20

conducted credibility determinations, didn't question 

21

that.  Defense counsel was primed to question that 

22

because defense counsel responded:  But we have a right 

23

to be present, to hear that statement, in case the 

24

prosecution is misstating the facts. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I don't  I don't really

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understand what you're saying.  Maybe it was wrong to 

2

have this in camera, but why was the statement that we 

3

don't want to disclose our strategy a statement that 

4

that challenges that  that the challenges that I'm 

5

going to make are going to be pretextual? 

6

 MR. DAIN: 

Because when the prosecution 

7

said, I'll give you my reasons, but I don't want my 

8

adversary  I don't want my adversary to be present to 

9

test this in the crucible of an adversarial situation, 

10

which is what the Constitution requires.  When he says, 

11

my reasons for challenging these jurors involves 

12

strategy, it's a pretext.  It did not involve strategy. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I don't understand that. 

14

When you  when you're trying a case and you're 

15

deciding which jurors to exercise peremptory challenges 

16

against, do you not take into account what your defense 

17

is going to be?  What your defense strategy in the case 

18

is going to be. 

19

 MR. DAIN: 

You might  you might, but from 

20

Georgia v. McCollom to  in this case, the State court 

21

analyzed it under its own State law equivalent. 

22

Strategy is not why you would say I don't like this 

23

person or I don't trust this person, he doesn't dress 

24

right, he doesn't fit in.  The courts have said all of 

25

those are reasons for which the defense counsel can,

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

should participate and respond. 
 Strategy involves a much more deep analysis 

3

that is very rare as this Court has said in prior cases. 

4

It's in the rare instance.  It's very rare.  This isn't 

5

a general argument that everything I do is strategy, but 

6

the prosecutor was saying it involves strategy which is 

7

a very rare situation.  And in none of  as the 

8

California Supreme Court recognized, none of his 

9

statements involved strategy. 

10

 So at a minimum, the State says we must 

11

credit and give deference to not only the trial court, 

12

but the California Supreme Court's credibility 

13

determinations.  If, as the California Supreme Court 

14

found, in determining error that it was not credible, 

15

that we  that strategy was not involved, then a 

16

credibility determination was not made.  And 

17

furthermore, the trial court missed that.  Defense 

18

counsel said, I don't want to be involved in their 

19

strategy, but I want to hear the statement because I 

20

want to be present to tell you it's a misstatement. 

21

Why have we instruct our 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Give an example of a 

strategy. 
 MR. DAIN: 

The trial strategy might be I'm 

calling  in near cases of this  might be calling an

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

informant, and this informant might be living in the 

2

same neighborhood as this person.  I don't want this 

3

person on there.  Trial strategy might be that I'm going 

4

to be calling a witness who dresses in exactly the same 

5

way as that witness and again 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

 MR. DAIN: 

As that juror. 

As a juror.  I'm sorry.  There 

8

could be very deep levels of that.  But the California 

9

Supreme Court astutely recognized that was not the case. 

10

More importantly, it specifically, in opposition to 

11

Chief Justice George in dissent, said that the 

12

strategy  that  that the lack of strategy was error. 

13

What it didn't recognize  and this is why there was an 

14

unreasonable application of Chapman. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me give you an 

16

example.  Let's say your defense strategy is going to be 

17

that the police officers planted incriminating evidence. 

18

All right?  And if that's going to be your defense 

19

strategy, will you not be particularly diligent in 

20

exercising your peremptory challenges to try to get rid 

21

of anybody who seems to have sympathy or an 

22

identification with the police.  That's a strategy. 

23

It's not pretextual. 

24

 MR. DAIN: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Two 
Now, there may not have been

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that here.  The prosecutor may not have had a strategy 

2

like that.  I  but I just don't understand this 

3

argument that you're making, that merely stating I don't 

4

want to disclose to my adversary what my trial strategy 

5

will be is a confession that I am going to exercise 

6

peremptory challenges pretextually, and I just don't 

7

want defense counsel there to call me on it. 

8
9

 MR. DAIN: 

Well, let me take that from the 

beginning.  The answer to your question is, no, that's 

10

not a trial strategy in the context of the cases. 

11

Everything's a strategy.  How  you could argue 

12

strategy is what order I'm going to call the witnesses 

13

in. 

14

 The reason it's not a strategy, and 

15

certainly not a reason for an ex parte communication, is 

16

defense counsel would already know that.  The witness 

17

would have been listed; discovery would have been given. 

18

That would have been in the police reports.  So let 

19

I  I want to be careful we don't confuse just the 

20

general strategy every attorney has in approaching a 

21

case with what 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Prosecutor doesn't have 

23

to say, it's because of planting of police, the pros 

24

of planting of evidence is going to be at issue.  He 

25

could just say, I don't like people who distrust the

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4
5
6

police. 
 MR. DAIN: 

He absolutely could, and that 

could be heard by the defendant.  It is 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Actually, it's said 

quite often. 
 MR. DAIN: 

It is a strategy, but that's not 

7

the trial strategy we're talking about that in the rare 

8

instance, as this Court has said, would require an ex 

9

parte communication. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Could you at the 

11

other side  I understand the idea that you're saying 

12

that just, you know, basically you'd like jurors who are 

13

going to be sympathetic with your case.  You say that's 

14

not a strategy, but what's the  what is a strategy? 

15

An example of that? 

16

 MR. DAIN: 

No.  And again, that's why I'm 

17

saying trial strategy isn't in the broad sense.  Trial 

18

strategy is something that really is truly confidential. 

19

Like, I have  you could say in a domestic violence 

20

case, I have a witness that is afraid to testify but may 

21

have some connection or knowledge that pay  that 

22

person may know the witness.  I need to tell the judge 

23

that in camera and say, I can't take that risk.  It 

24

could be a gang case where you have informants.  It's a 

25

rare situation is what they're talking about.

32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, even  even if the 

2

strategy was an overblown statement by the prosecutor. 

3

Suppose that in this case defense counsel is absent, but 

4

what the juror says is clearly grounds for the 

5

prosecutor to  excuse me, the juror says I've thought 

6

about this.  I can't  I don't believe in the death 

7

penalty supposedly.  That's the hypothetical.  That's 

8

not this case. 

9
10
11
12
13
14

 MR. DAIN: 

Of course. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Then we still look to see 

whether or not there was harmless error. 
 MR. DAIN: 

And I'm going to get to that. 

Absolutely. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And it's true that the 

15

harmless error in this case loops back in your  your 

16

concern that there was not full crossexam.  So they 

17

come together a bit.  But it does  it does seem to me 

18

that this district judge exercised care in listening to 

19

the answer.  And we are required  the Federal courts 

20

are required under Brecht to give very substantial 

21

deference to that finding.  So if you could address 

22

that. 

23

 MR. DAIN: 

And that's what  what I'm going 

24

to say in addressing that.  You do start with the 

25

premise that, as the California Supreme Court said,

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there was no strategy.  So  so that's the pretext I'm 

2

talking about.  If you start with that, that was missed 

3

by the trial court and only discussed in terms of error 

4

by the California Supreme Court, the California Supreme 

5

Court should have said in its harmless error analysis, I 

6

start with the reason defense counsel was excluded was 

7

pretextual whether  or was false.  Was false. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
was a violation 

10

 MR. DAIN: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12
13
14

That goes to whether there 

No. 
 not to whether the 

violation was harmless or not. 
 MR. DAIN: 

I disagree.  And let me  and 

let me state why. 

15

 The fact that you're assessing, as the State 

16

says, the credibility of the prosecution's reasons, if 

17

the prosecution starts with the reason that is false, 

18

saying, I don't even want my adversary in the room.  And 

19

he didn't say it like, Your Honor, I have concerns.  Can 

20

I discuss them?  He said, we'll do it, but not in their 

21

presence. 

22

 The State caused the removal of defense 

23

counsel, and if we just take Olanders  Olanders D. 

24

Anna L. not only had questions, she responded to 

25

virtually identical, she actually said she would be a

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

holdout.  She made a statement if the other jurors voted 

2

for death, I might not.  In fact, I think she said I 

3

would not.  Olanders D. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the problem with 

5

that  I mean, you're looking at  and we have said 

6

this often in Batson type cases.  You're looking at a 

7

cold transcript.  You don't know what the difference in 

8

intonation was.  You don't know if Olanders is saying, 

9

yeah, you know, I thought about it, and blah, blah, 

10

blah, blah.  And the other one is saying, I thought 

11

about it  about this trial, and now  I mean, you 

12

know, we don't know that. 

13

 MR. DAIN: 

But that serves our purpose. 

14

That serves our purpose because what we didn't have is 

15

the adversarial crucible.  We didn't have defense 

16

counsel saying exactly what you said, well, wait a 

17

minute 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose the defense 

19

counsel were present and the  a transcript said 

20

exactly what it says here.  Defense counsel made no 

21

objection.  It seems to me that that's how you have to 

22

analyze this case because we're  we're assuming no 

23

error. 

24

 MR. DAIN: 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The  what you 
Now, I  I understand

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it would have been a much better record if the 

2

counsel were there.  That's the reason why there's a 

3

likely error here under a matter of law, but we're 

4

talking about the harmlessness, the  the deference that 

5

must be given to the State judge. 

6

 MR. DAIN: 

Absolutely.  And the deference 

7

under Brecht, and I would even say under Richter, 

8

requires a fair and balanced playing field.  At least 

9

you have to start every case from Feltner  every case 

10

that has addressed Batson has had a level playing field. 

11

All the participants have contributed, and there was a 

12

complete record. 

13

 But the reason I'm saying this is prejudice 

14

is it was the State that actively corrupted the record. 

15

The State excluded the defendant.  So now the State 

16

turns around and says, well, you're speculating.  It 

17

caused the need to speculate.  And what I'm saying is if 

18

the California Supreme Court had taken into account in 

19

its prejudice analysis that it was the State, through a 

20

pretext, that excluded the defendant, we wouldn't have 

21

to speculate.  We wouldn't have what  what is a 

22

corrupt record. 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, we're speculating 

24

the judge would not  that defense attorney remained 

25

silent or that defense attorney 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DAIN: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No. 
Either way.  We would be 

3

speculating if defense attorney remained silent, or we'd 

4

be speculating that the judge would have ruled the same 

5

way. The question is on this record. 

6

 MR. DAIN: 

Had he ruled the same way  had 

7

defense counsel participated and he ruled the same way, 

8

we would have a Batson challenge in substance, not, as 

9

Your Honor has recognized, a procedural issue.  At that 

10

point, all this Court has said, all we can do is say 

11

would it have likely changed the outcome, we can't 

12

speculate either way.  But the problem is it's the State 

13

that caused that and that's the prejudice.  The State 

14

caused the inability to have a complete record, 

15

actually, in two ways, it also lost, inadvertently in 

16

that instance, it lost the MillerEl v. Dretke 

17

opportunity through the questionnaires. 

18

 But the State actively caused the exclusion 

19

of defendant, it caused the inability to have a complete 

20

record, and that's different from merely saying that 

21

there was an ex parte proceeding but we followed it 

22

up 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I'll go back and 

24

look at this.  I did not think that this was really the 

25

basis for the Ninth Circuit's conclusion that Olanders'

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

testimony showed that he was improperly excused, I just 

2

don't see 

3

 MR. DAIN: 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Or it's  I can give you that. 
I mean, it's a long 

5

opinion but Page 678 talks about Olanders just in the 

6

term that we're talking about. 

7

 MR. DAIN: 

It said  the prosecutor had 

8

said that he was not responsive  the Ninth Circuit, to 

9

address your question, Justice Kennedy.  The Ninth 

10

Circuit said that in its review of the existing 

11

transcript, he was very responsive. 

12

 So there  there was a disagreement there. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

14

 MR. DAIN: 

He meant 
The Court disagreed with the 

15

statement that he wouldn't fit in.  The Court said, I 

16

believe he would fit in with the rest of the 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, the trial court 

said that. 
 MR. DAIN: 

I'm sorry, but the Ninth Circuit 

20

pointed out the trial court said that.  So the reason 

21

Olanders D is so compelling is because the trial court 

22

itself questioned some of the prosecutor's reasons, but 

23

there were others. 

24
25

 For instance, the prosecutor said the 
questionnaire indicated he opposed the death penalty.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We actually don't have the questionnaires because 

2

they're gone.  We have to take it at its word that it 

3

did.  Defense counsel again, had the prosecutor not 

4

proactively excluded him, might have said, well, the 

5

questionnaire said A, B, C.  We might have had a 

6

complete record 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's speculation. 

8

What the Ninth Circuit did with Olanders B is point to 

9

the actual existing record 

10

 MR. DAIN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12
13

Understood. 
 and show that there 

were contradictions to  in the record as it existed. 
 MR. DAIN: 

And that's what our argument 

14

you can even take the existing record and show the 

15

inconsistencies that show Chapman was not appropriately 

16

applied. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Of course it's speculative 

18

that defense counsel, had defense counsel been present, 

19

would have been able to point to the other juror, Anna. 

20

We've had a number of cases where defense counsel was 

21

present at the voir dire, which I think should be the 

22

rule in almost every situation, and only later, years 

23

later on appeal when  as particularly when you have 

24

many, many jurors questioned, as apparently was the case 

25

here, does somebody realize, well, this juror who was

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dismissed, has answers seem to be somewhat similar to 

2

this other juror who  who wasn't challenged. 

3

 MR. DAIN: 

And then had that been the facts, 

4

we lose, under AEDPA, we lose.  Because you do have to 

5

give deference under AEDPA to the California Supreme 

6

Court.  I agree. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But what reason is there to 

8

think that defense counsel would have had better recall 

9

of this than the trial judge who was there? 

10

 MR. DAIN: 

Defense counsel  first of all, 

11

there were two of them.  First of all, they're more 

12

focused on each of the jurors that were excused.  The 

13

judge had  as the Ninth Circuit noted, there were 70 

14

questions for each of these questionnaires, they 

15

involved 17 pages.  The judge had to take  and he may 

16

have had his own notes that he thought were important, 

17

they may have been complete or not incomplete.  A judge 

18

certainly has many more tasks that don't involve just 

19

the direct advocacy, as defense counsel has.  But that's 

20

when I add, it's the prosecution, the State that caused 

21

that.  And then uses its sword to say, well, now you're 

22

speculating. 

23

 We can do nothing more. 

But with Olanders D 

24

on the existing record, we can show that was wrong.  The 

25

reason I'm saying it was unreasonable is because the

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court should have taken into account in prejudice that 

2

there is a lack of credibility when a prosecutor comes 

3

in and causes all these problems and the State Supreme 

4

Court says, and that wasn't correct.  There was no 

5

strategy involved here.  By the way, they use  the 

6

Courts use the term "strategy" and "confidential 

7

information."  Those are generally tied.  They're used 

8

where you have informants, they're used where you have 

9

gang activity, very rare circumstances that occurs. 

10

 But how  even if you said under Richter, 

11

how can any reasonable judge or justice disagree that if 

12

the State, through a false basis, excluded defense 

13

counsel, eliminated defense counsel from challenging the 

14

questions and assisting the judge where the judge didn't 

15

recognize that  that strategy was not involved, 

16

prevented further voir dire which might have corrected 

17

the situation, prevented a proper record and then later 

18

lost all of the ability to do a comparative analysis, 

19

could be harmless, I'm  and let me even use in the 

20

Brecht standard, this Court has eloquently said that 

21

and if you'll give me a moment of unprofessionality 

22

while I shuffle my pages  but this Court has said that 

23

it undermines the very integrity of the court system. 

24

 And in McCollom, it actually described that 

25

it  it may be obvious to the jury, it undermines the

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

parties' understanding and the Court's ability to  to 

2

maintain integrity through the entire trial.  So under 

3

Brecht, this error caused injury to the jury verdict. 

4

And, moreover, the questionnaires are lost, even Brecht 

5

can't address that, because they were lost post verdict. 

6

 But under any standard, there was an 

7

unreasonable application of Chapman by the State Supreme 

8

Court and it had actual prejudice in this case.  Justice 

9

George in his dissent was correct.  How can anybody 

10

credit this record?  It wasn't accidental.  It wasn't as 

11

though defense counsel were arguing defense counsel was 

12

in  ineffective.  The State caused this.  And it 

13

didn't cause it through inadvertence, it actively 

14

insisted that it would do this only in chambers, in 

15

camera. 

16

 And going back to Cronic and going back to 

17

Wade, this was a critical portion.  Forget ex parte, 

18

there are many times you can do ex parte proceedings if 

19

you make a proper record.  They're all rare, but there 

20

are times you can do them.  But in this instance, in the 

21

critical Batson phase, to exclude the defendants  I 

22

use pretext  it's a false statement that the 

23

prosecutor gave that it was strategy.  That's 

24

prejudicial. 

25

 It's prejudicial under Brecht, and it's

42

Alderson Reporting Company

certainly prejudicial under Richter.  Thank you, Your

Honors.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Thank you. 
This doesn't relate to the 

5

issues you've been arguing.  This crime was, what,

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

1996, yeah, very close. 
Has he spent time in 

solitary confinement, and, if so, how much? 
 MR. DAIN: 

He has spent his entire time in 

11

what's called administrative segregation.  When I visit 

12

him, I visit him through glass and wire bars. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

14

 MR. DAIN: 

Is that a single cell? 
It is a single cell.  They're all 

15

single cells.  Well, San Quentin is on the most  it's 

16

on Heaven's land in Marin County.  It's a 150yearold 

17

prison and their administrative segregation is single 

18

cells, a very old system, very small, and  and  you're 

19

not allowed 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it the same thing as 

solitary confinement? 
 MR. DAIN: 

No, it's 23 hours out of the day, 

23

that probably is the same.  They generally 

24

administrative segregation you're not allowed in the 

25

general yard anymore.  But you are allowed an hour a

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN URBANSKI 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

10

 MS. URBANSKI: 

11

 Just a few brief points. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: 
First of all, with 

12

respect to the prosecutor stating that he believes he 

13

would reveal trial strategy, there is no reason to think 

14

that that was any kind of a pretext for then exercising 

15

peremptory challenges on the basis of race.  The trial 

16

court never found this prosecutor to be anything less 

17

than credible, and that determination is entitled to 

18

great deference in a Federal habeas collateral 

19

proceeding. 

20

 With respect to Olanders 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

What was the trial strategy 

that displayed itself in his strikes? 
 MS. URBANSKI: 

I cannot tell the Court what 

24

it was, but I don't think there is any reason to take 

25

the trial  the prosecutor at anything less than his 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

word.  We don't have anything in the record to refute

2

it.  Certainly that is not what ended up happening, but 

3

it is also not a reason to suggest that this was a 

4

pretext for race. 

5

 With respect to Olanders D, this juror gave 

6

responses that were not only not responsive, but they 

7

were responses that would cause any prosecutor to have 

8

doubt about that particular juror serving on a capital 

9

case.  There were clearly grounds for the prosecutor to 

10
11

have wanted to excuse that juror. 
 But most importantly, the California Supreme 

12

Court looked at this record and it found support for the 

13

assertions in the record; with respect to Olanders D., 

14

that appears at Petition Appendix page 203a. 

15

 What we have here is the Ninth Circuit 

16

substituting its own view without ever showing how the 

17

State court was objectively unreasonable in its 

18

analysis.  We have a State court here that analyzed the 

19

very same harmlessness question under a much higher 

20

standard, the Chapman standard, and found no harm.  And 

21

to proceed without regard for the State court's very 

22

careful determination in that regard seems antithetical 

23

to the spirit of AEDPA. 

24

 Thank you.
