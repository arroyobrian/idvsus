CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Ordinarily do not

think of that as covered in this Court.


4

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, the Court of Criminal


5

Appeals did not specify; but we find, of course,


6

ourselves in an unusual posture, in the sense that the


7

sequence of events here are such that even -- the Court


8

of Appeals has decided the Avena judgement claim, the


9

Court has --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But has this Court ever

I can't recall that we've done that.

an unusual posture.

Well, it's an -- it is, in fact,

that, in fact, the United States will comply.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, it's so odd, because

occur at the state court level, is the state court

request.

9

So, this is a very unusual

MR. DONOVAN:

We recognize that it's an

10

unusual request, because of the unusual circumstances.

11

And, of course, the alternative, if the Court is not

12

prepared to stay, or, for example, vacate, in light of

13

the presidential determination, remand to the Court of

14

Appeals --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, I think -- I

16

think granting a stay could be seen as validating the

17

position of the government without ever having an

18

opinion on it.

19

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, actually, I think that a

20

stay would actually show respect to each of the

21

relevant actors here.

22
23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, why shouldn't we just

go ahead and decide the case, if we can?

24
25

And so --

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, we believe that there are,

in fact, firm grounds on which this Court could grant Page 5

- could decide the question presented, because, in


2

fact, for the reasons -- there are really three points


3

here -- for the reasons we've laid out, the Court,


4

under the direct command of the Supremacy Clause, has -


5

- can give effect to the Avena judgement as the rule of


6

decision.

7

eliminates the -- even setting aside its independent


8

force, eliminates the basic objection of Texas to that


9

course of action.

10

The President's determination, in fact,


And then, of course, there's the


basic independent full force of the Supremacy Clause.

11

So if I may move to that, the Court, as I

12

said, has recognized the importance of the United

13

States complying with an international obligation

14

reflected in treaties entered into by the

15

democratically elected representatives of the American

16

people.

17

I want to address the question presented

18

first, because, I -- before -- setting aside the

19

presidential determination -- and just take a look at

20

where we stand after the briefing by the parties as a -

21

- on the question whether or not the Avena judgement

22

provides the rule of decision.

23

First of all, there's an extraordinary amount

24

of agreement between petitioner and respondent.

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, there is a -- there is a

Respondents made.

14

But the Respondent confuses the creation of a cause of

15

16

One of them is the cause of action.

The private right of action is

found here in the habeas statute itself, which provides

10

that a person in custody in violation of laws,

11

treaties, or the Constitution of the United States can

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So, presumably, that could

provide some cause of action, quite irrespective of the

claim under the federal habeas statute -- and it is

8

unusual, is it not, for a judgement of the

9

International Court of Justice to recognize the right

10

of an individual, as opposed to being just a judgement

11

between nations?

12

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, it may be that, because of

First, they've said there are no individual

But, of course, the treaty, as this Court

MR. DONOVAN:

that the only limitations of the treaty-making power

are affirmative litigations -- affirmative limitations

within the Constitution, itself.

Not a question concerning

10

MR. DONOVAN:

But this is a question --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're talking here about a

12

question of United States law, What is the meaning of

13

this treaty that the United States has entered into?

14

Do you know another case where we have -- we have been

15

bound by a judgement of a foreign court or an

16

international court concerning the meaning of United

17

States law?

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, what the Court would be

19

giving effect to is the determination by the political

20

branches themselves to enter into the treaty.

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I have a question

22

that is much along the same lines, whether this Court

23

must apply Avena as the rule of decision, or perhaps

24

say, "No, it does not have to do that."

Then you're

left with looking at the treaty itself.

Well, the Court could, in fact,

It could reach its own

interpretation of the treaty, in accord with the Avena

judgement.

But we think --

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

13

MR. DONOVAN:

Is that open in this case?

Well, it surely would be open in

14

this case, but it would not be open at this point.

15

We've suggested alternative bases by which the Court

16

could conform with Avena.

17

Avena, in fact, controls the decision, for this reason,

18

that, in the first instance, the political branches

19

have agreed to the substantive obligations under the

20

treaty; in the second place --

21
22

But we do believe that

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
can't control?

23

Well, suppose we think it

Now, then what's open to us?
MR. DONOVAN:

Well, if the -- if the Court

MR. DONOVAN:

-- the Court can decide the


question presented.


3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're simply saying that any


4

court has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction. 


5

We grant you that.

6

what is your answer to the claim that the COA requires


7

a showing of substantial infringement of


8

constitutional, as distinct from other sources of,


9

rights?


10

But, granted that, if we reach it,


MR. DONOVAN:

Well, first of all, we believe

11

that in the posture that this case comes to this Court,

12

there has been a substantial denial of a constitutional

13

right, even in the terms that Texas defines the

14

statute, because what we have here is a claim based on

15

the Avena judgement -- I mean, the ICJ's interpretation

16

and application of the Avena judgement that the Court

17

of Appeals held in effect that had been defaulted prior

18

to its coming into existence.

19

the Court of Appeals judgement that the Avena --

20

dismissing the -- or denying the Avena -- deciding the

21

Avena judgement claim -- was to say -- was to give

22

effect to a procedural default of the Avena judgement

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- the constitutional

violation is the violation of the Supremacy Clause.

3

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, in that --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. DONOVAN:

Is that what you're saying?

Well, it's a violation here of

6

both the Due Process Clause and the Supremacy Clause.

7

Due process --

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. DONOVAN:

Due Process Clause because?

Because it was an arbitrary

10

denial of a forum in which to hear the Avena judgement

11

claim, not simply the -- a different source of right.

12

In other words, although the Avena judgement claim

13

comes up on Texas as a proposition as a -- under a

14

treaty, the action of the Court of Appeals was to deny

15

that claim without giving it a forum.

16

without -- that -- before it had been raised itself,

17

before it even existed

18

Court of Appeals was to give effect to a procedural

19

default of a right that hadn't come into effect.

process claim.

So why did -- why isn't the AEDPA

context here, you don't have -- you don't have a

12

conflict with respect to the constitutional claims

themselves; you have a constitutional claim based on a

denial a right that did not exist, and you also have a

constitutional claim based on the Supremacy Clause

whether there are other grounds; in which case, they

those other interesting arguments that we could write

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Breyer, there are

alternative jurisdictional grounds this Court could

address, but the COA ground is straightforward.

14

flows from the direct text.

this Court no reason to disagree with every Court of

16

Appeals that has looked at this question, all of whom

17

have determined that "constitutional" means

authorize a subsequent state habeas proceeding based

upon the President's determination, which he

characterizes as the predicate for a new claim.

his getting relief here, which is that he has failed to

MR. CRUZ:

Because whatever the resolution in

the State Court litigation, the resolution of that

question will not impact the legal question before this

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but is it not true that

11

it's entirely possible that the Texas proceeding would

12

make this issue moot --

13

MR. CRUZ:

That is true.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- and, therefore, avoid the

15

necessity for deciding a lot of very difficult

16

questions?

17

MR. CRUZ:

That is true.

That is frequently

the case, that in a -- in a case that is being

19

litigated, there are other proceedings that have the

20

potential to make something moot.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And is it also true that, in

22

the Texas proceedings, they necessarily would involve a

federal question on which this Court could, if it

24

chose, grant certiorari on direct review?

MR. CRUZ:

Absolutely.

questions about the constitutional authority for the

2

Executive determination may come back to this Court,

3

but they're not presented by the case right now before

4

the Court.

5

The most direct avenue, I would submit, for

6

this Court is to resolve this decision by affirming the

7

Fifth Circuit judgement, and by affirming it on the

8

grounds that a COA could not issue because this was not

9

a constitutional claim.

And that would necessarily

10

entail affirming Breard to the extent that Breard noted

11

that a subsequently enacted statute, the AEDPA, to the

12

extent of a conflict, superceded the Vienna Convention.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is the question -- how

14

difficult is the question?

15

States has issued a document where he says, "Exercising

16

my foreign-affairs power, in my opinion the treaty, as

responsibility for determining the remedy to the Avena

judgement is found in the political branches.

3

fact that the President is acting underscores this,

4

that there is no precedent for an ICJ judgement being

judicially enforceable.

no country in the world that accords binding effect to

7

ICJ judgements in their own domestic courts.

treaty becomes part of federal law if it's properly

12

individually enforceable rights to Mr. Medellin.

we can disregard the question of whether the Avena

judgement is enforceable.

rises to the individual rights.

3

however, would conflict with the express language of

the preamble to the treaty, and would also conflict


5

with the consistent position of the Executive Branch


6

since 1969, when this treaty was ratified.

7

36 years, the State Department has consistently

answered the question, that the Vienna Convention does

not give rise to individual rights.

Did the Breard case speak

to that issue?

MR. CRUZ:

The Breard case simply made

15

even if there were, it is barred by AEDPA.

16

believe the Breard case answers it, one way or the

other; but, given the United States' consistent

position -- and, indeed, it uses very similar language

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, if we came to

3

the conclusion that the treaty, by its own force, did

4

not create enforceable individual rights, then we would

5

have to get to the question of whether the President's

6

proclamation changes that result.

7

MR. CRUZ:

Only in the most threshold sense;

8

because, on its face, the President's proclamation, or

9

determination, is focused only on state courts, and

10

what the President says is that he has determined that

11

the Avena decision will have binding effect in state

12

courts.

13

that does not have a binding effect on this proceeding;

14

but, rather, on a subsequent

So, according to the Executive determination,

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But that seems to be

topsy-turvy, that a treaty would have effect in state

17

courts but not in federal court.

18

MR. CRUZ:

We don't disagree that the

19

Executive could have chosen other avenues.

20

Nevertheless, Medellin's argument that, given the

21

Executive has said, "This should have effect in some

22

other proceeding," we should disregard what the

23

Executive has said about this proceeding and apply it

24

here, notwithstanding the President's express

determination it wouldn't apply here.

the ICJ said that these people are entitled to review

should be enforced, and the only place it can be

enforced is in the state court that rendered the

has to implement is, they have to give a review and

Now, I suppose, as far as the ICJ is

concerned, they don't care if it's done by some federal

tribunal, or state, but within our system, it must be

pointed out, may never need to be reached at all if the

8

Texas courts recognize the President's determination

with respect to the Avena decision or apply the Avena

10

And just as a notice of appeal is a

decision itself.

11

And I think it's very noteworthy that the

12

filing that Petitioner made at the end of last week in

13

the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals seeking a

14

successive petition for a writ of habeas corpus under

15

Texas law specifically, at page 25, says that

16

Petitioner is relying on the Avena judgement and he's

17

relying on the President's determination, which are two

18

new sources of law that were not available at the time

19

the Texas courts previously addressed the matter and

20

that now are available, which constitutes a ground for

21

a second petition under Texas law, and that,

accordingly, the Texas courts should allow this claim

23

to be developed in the state courts and to be litigated

there.

have the option of availing itself of extraordinary

14

jurisdiction, but, as the Court made clear in the

15

Felker case, its exercise of extraordinary original

16

writs would be informed by the limitations that the

17

AEDPA imposes upon the grant of habeas corpus relief;

18

and, therefore, the Court should look to at least the

19

additional jurisdictional obstacle that the United

20

States and Texas has raised; and, namely, that is that

21

the decision that the Texas courts raised -- issued in
