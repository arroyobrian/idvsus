This is Case Number

Mr. Kellogg.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. KELLOGG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

The court below thrice refused to enforce

11

the parties' arbitration agreement because he thought

12

that class procedures were necessary to vindicate the

13

plaintiff's Sherman Act claims.

14

That holding was reversible error for at

15

least three reasons.

16

the FAA or the Sherman Act.

17

unworkable threshold inquiry.

18

unnecessary to any legitimate policy concerns raised by

19

the court below.

20

First, it has no basis in either

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Second, it creates an
And third, it is

Mr. Kellogg, suppose it

21

goes to arbitration as you think it should, and the

22

arbitrator says to the merchant, to prove your case, you

23

have to show the relevant market, you have to show that

24

American Express had market power, that it used that

25

power to the detriment of its competitors, and the way
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these sections -- the way these tying cases have gone

2

is you get an expert.

3

prove it in -- in a new way.

4

And I don't see that you can

I mean, the whole point of this is that the

5

expense to win one of these cases is enormous.

6

single person is not worth that person's while.

7

MR. KELLOGG:

And no

Well, three responses to that,

8

Your Honor.

The first is, that it is up to the

9

arbitrator in the first instance to devise procedures to

10

deal with claims in an efficient and cost-effective

11

manner.

12

Second, to the extent that an expert report

13

is required that would cost a lot of money, we have

14

conceded below that the parties could share costs of

15

that expert just as they could share the costs of a

16

lawyer.
And, third, the alternative is to have an

17
18

inquiry upfront, that this Court has rejected in

19

Concepcion, that you cannot condition the enforcement of

20

an arbitration agreement on the availability of class

21

procedures.

22

It's up to --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

the -- I missed that.

25

does that work?

What was the -- what was

The sharing of the costs, how

It's certainly not in the agreement,
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not in the arbitration agreement, that -- that American

2

Express is going to pay for the expert for the other

3

side.

4
5

MR. KELLOGG:

We acknowledge below that they

could share costs among multiple plaintiffs --

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. KELLOGG:

8

of costs.

Oh.

Oh.

-- before that.

The sharing

Now, under the court below's regime --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then what you would

10

you have, five, six different arbitrations going, and in

11

each of those five or six cases, you would have -- they

12

could share?

13

of this -- the experts?

14

They could share the million dollar cost

MR. KELLOGG:

They can share the cost of the

15

expert.

And, of course, they get their attorneys' fees

16

back, plus reasonable statutory costs, plus potentially

17

treble damages.

18

The alternative, as the court below held, is

19

that the district court has to decide in the first

20

instance, I'm not going to send it to arbitration

21

because I think they need a class action.

22

determination, he first has to do a Rule 23 analysis.

23

Would there even be a class certified in this case?

24

Only 20 percent of putative classes are

25

certified.

To make that

And that's not an inquiry that the Court
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should be making at the outset.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I -- I'm sorry, but I

3

don't think I got the answer to my question.

4

arbitrator has now said we have to have an expert, and

5

the plaintiff says -- or the complainant says, I haven't

6

got the wherewithal, and if I have six friends who bring

7

individual arbitrations, that's not nearly enough.

8
9

Is -- the

So what happens then, the case ends, and
it's not possible --

10

MR. KELLOGG:

As we said, they would be able

11

to share an expert between multiple plaintiffs, but

12

there is no guarantee in the law that every claim has a

13

procedural path to its effective vindication.

14

This Court held in Eisen, for example, even

15

though the Court acknowledged that it was a $70 claim,

16

it could only be brought as a class action, but the

17

plaintiff in that case said, I can't afford to do the

18

notice costs, and the Court said well, then, the class

19

is decertified because the plaintiff has to put up the

20

notice.

21

The whole point of arbitration of course is

22

that it expands the universe of claims that can be

23

brought efficiently and effectively for small consumers.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kellogg, do you think

that if in your arbitration agreement you had a clause
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which just said, I hereby agree not to bring any Sherman

2

Act claim against American Express, could -- could your

3

arbitration agreement do that?

4

MR. KELLOGG:

Under this Court's decision in

5

Mitsubishi, I believe not.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It -- it couldn't,

7

right because we would say no, there has to be an -- an

8

opportunity for a vindication of statutory rights, is

9

that right?

10

MR. KELLOGG:

Correct.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and suppose that the

12

arbitration clause said something different.

13

that the arbitration clause said, I -- I hereby agree

14

that I will not present any economic evidence in an

15

antitrust action against American Express.

16

Could it do that?

17

MR. KELLOGG:

Suppose

I think that would be subject

18

to review under State unconscionability principles, and

19

would probably be struck down, Your Honor, just like any

20

other provision that essentially prevents --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, even putting aside

22

State unconscionability principles, wouldn't you think

23

that our Mitsubishi case and our Randolph case would

24

again come in and say, my gosh, this arbitration clause

25

prevents any effective vindication of the rights to
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bring an antitrust suit.

2

Wouldn't you say that.

3

MR. KELLOGG:

I -- I don't think Mitsubishi

4

can be read that broadly, Your Honor.

5

the whole point of Mitsubishi was that arbitration is an

6

effective forum for vindicating Federal statutory

7

rights.

8
9
10

To the contrary,

Mitsubishi -JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you think -- I'm sorry.

Go ahead.
MR. KELLOGG:

I'm sorry.

Mitsubishi dealt

11

with the very specific question of a waiver, a

12

substantive waiver of your rights, not with the

13

procedures to vindicate those rights.

14

As, for example, in the Vimar Seguros case,

15

where the Court said, well, you might have to go to

16

Japan, but we're not going to get into the business of

17

weighing the costs and benefits.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I just want to make sure

19

I understand your answer, which is that you read

20

Mitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say

21

that the principle that they embody does not prevent

22

American Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you

23

cannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony

24

in an antitrust suit.

25

MR. KELLOGG:

You know, I think the better
8


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

place to handle that would be State unconscionability

2

law.

3

of Mitsubishi to say that.

Whether the Court would want to expand the ports

4

It's not clear to me what the statutory

5

justification for that would be, given that the Sherman

6

Act -- the question here, of course, concerns class

7

procedures.

8

at a time when there were no class procedures, and given

9

that the Court in Concepcion --

10

And given that the Sherman Act was passed

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, my -- my question is

11

not about class procedures, it's about allowing economic

12

evidence to help prove your claim.

13

problem, even though it is, of course, true in the real

14

world that to prove a successful antitrust claim, you

15

need economic evidence.

16

MR. KELLOGG:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you said, no

Correct.
And you said that's

18

fine because you're going to read Mitsubishi and

19

Randolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration

20

clause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate

21

your ability to bring a Sherman Act suit.

22

MR. KELLOGG:

I have no doubt that such a

23

provision would be struck down.

I think the proper way

24

to do that would be under State unconscionability law,

25

which Section 2 specifically preserves.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

But if the

Official

1

Court felt the need to expand Mitsubishi in that narrow

2

respect, that would still not help the Respondents here,

3

who are saying that you should condition the enforcement

4

of the arbitration clause on the availability of class

5

procedures, which this Court held in Concepcion is

6

fundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of the FAA.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

Well, I think -- I think

8

what they are saying is something a little bit

9

different, which is that if you go -- if you accept my

10

premise that the arbitration clause could not say no

11

economic evidence, what the -- Respondents here are

12

saying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to

13

produce economic evidence and maybe that involves class

14

procedures, maybe it involves something else.
It could involve some other cost-sharing

15
16

mechanism.

But if the arbitration clause works to

17

prevent us from sharing costs in such a way that we can

18

produce that evidence, then once again we have a problem

19

about completely frustrating the effect of the Sherman

20

Act.
MR. KELLOGG:

21

Well, I think -- I think not

22

Your Honor.

And I think we have to return to the fact that

23

the only provision at issue here was the class action

24

waiver.

25

It was the issue decided by the Court.

That was the only issue that they raised below.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

It was the issue

Official

1

on which this Court granted certiorari, and it's

2

directly contrary to this Court's decision in

3

Concepcion.

4

I have no doubt that if there were

5

provisions in a contract that essentially prevented a

6

plaintiff from raising a substantive claim or from

7

presenting evidence that they might have in support of

8

that claim, that it would be struck down under State

9

unconscionability principles or under Mitsubishi.

But I

10

don't think we can expand Mitsubishi into a

11

free-floating inquiry for district courts into the costs

12

and benefits of each case.

13

They would have to sit down and say, well,

14

what evidence is going to be needed in this case and how

15

much evidence is going to be required.

16

to say, what are the document production costs?

17

According to the court of appeals, they would even need

18

to say, what are your chances of winning?

19

it's going to cost a million dollars, but you only have

20

a 50 percent chance --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They would have

Because, say

I thought that the only thing

22

that the court of appeals said is, you have to pay

23

300,000 minimum for the expert, the most you can get in

24

treble damages is 5,000.

25

other things that you were saying.

It didn't go into all the
It said nobody in

his right mind will bring such a lawsuit to pay $300,000

2

to get $5,000.

3

MR. KELLOGG:

And nobody in their right mind

4

in Eisen would -- would pay a million dollars in notice

5

costs to get $70 on --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess you could have said

7

the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23

8

existed, right?

MR. KELLOGG:

You could have.

Before there was such as

12

MR. KELLOGG:

Under that position --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The same thing would have

14

been true.

15

can't claim -- can't pay an expert, you, as a practical

16

matter, don't bring the suit.

17

If, indeed, your claim was so small that you

MR. KELLOGG:

That was true.

In fact,

18

Congress at the time of passing the Sherman Act

19

specifically considered adding class procedures and

20

declined to do so.

21

Sherman Act, there were no class procedures even left.

22

For the first 4 decades of the

Even today, in court, as I noted, only

23

20 percent of cases actually get the class certified.

24

The whole point of arbitration, as I noted, is to expand

25

the scope of claims, small consumer claims, that can be

Alderson Reporting Company

brought in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think the nature of

3

their underlying -- their antitrust claim is relevant to

4

this?

5

compelled to enter into the contract that they say, as a

6

practical matter, precludes them from raising the

7

antitrust issue.

They are claiming that they were unlawfully

8
9

Does that -- does it matter?

MR. KELLOGG:
that.

Well, a couple of points on

They certainly weren't compelled to enter the

10

contract.

11

Express.

12

more fundamentally, the only provision that they have

13

ever challenged in this case is the class action waiver.

14

They have not suggested below that there was any problem

15

with cost-sharing or other ways that they might deal

16

with the specific question how to present their case in

17

arbitration.

18

Lots of merchants don't take American
It was a voluntary choice on their part.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

In the AT&T Mobility

19

case, the Court remarked that this was a -- that the

20

arbitration agreement had certain provisions that made

21

it easier for the consumer to use the arbitral forum.

22

Is there anything like that in this arbitration clause?

23

MR. KELLOGG:

I'm sorry, I didn't -- I

24

didn't quite follow that, Your Honor.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, where not some other

2

consumer in another arbitration, not that sharing of the

3

costs, but wasn't AT&T Mobility going to pick up a good

4

part of the tab of the cost of the arbitration?

5

MR. KELLOGG:

That's correct, there were

6

provisions in AT&T that the Court said would make small

7

value claims easier to process.

8

Concepcion the Court said even if small value claims

9

could not be brought, it would still fundamentally

I would note that in

10

change the nature of arbitration to insist upon class

11

procedures.

12

distinguishing Concepcion.

13

So I don't think that helps them in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One of the ways I have

14

been thinking about this case is to think about

15

arbitration and the whole point of arbitration is to

16

have a procedure where you don't have costs, you have as

17

an arbitrator an antitrust expert or the best in the

18

class in the third year antitrust course in law school.

19

And they cite reports, and -- you know, it's

20

classic to have contractors sit in as arbitrators in

21

construction claims; just because it's cheaper and they

22

know -- so I was thinking that that's substantial

23

justification for your position.

24

far seems to say that doesn't make any difference.

25

if they can't bring the suit in an economic way -- the

But your argument so

Even

Official

arbitration in an economic way, that that's irrelevant.

That's -- that's what I'm getting from your argument.

MR. KELLOGG:

I did not mean to imply that,

4

Your Honor.

5

arbitrator in the first instance to find the most

6

efficient and cost effective way to resolve a particular

7

claim.

8
9

The key point is that it's up to the

And it's not necessarily the case that
complicated -- that huge numbers of documents --

10

plaintiff said, we will need 5 million documents and we

11

will need a very, very expensive expert and they got an

12

affidavit from a very, very expensive expert saying,

13

this is what I would charge to do this.

14

The whole point of arbitration, of course,

15

is that its informality actually expands the universe of

16

claims, of small value claims that can be brought

17

effectively.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kellogg, are you

19

suggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in

20

arbitration without presenting economic evidence of such

21

things as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages?

22

How could somebody do that?

23
24
25

MR. KELLOGG:

No, I acknowledge that they

would probably need a report in this case.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Kagan.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. KELLOGG:

Yes, maybe.

But in this case, if you look

13

at the complaint, the market definition that they're

14

seeking to establish is, if I might put it, somewhat

15

gerrymandered.

16

It essentially consists --

JUSTICE BREYER:

stuff, which I -- then I guess maybe they're right.

Maybe you do need experts on that.

want to concede that there is no way to win this case in

21

arbitration unless they spend $300,000.

inquiry here.

But obviously there's nothing either in the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I

10

go back to Justice Alito's point because I'm not sure I

11

quite understood your -- your answer to it.

12

Essentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a

13

party with a monopolistic power, such that -- and this

14

is just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be

15

true, but -- but they say that American Express is using

16

its market power to impose particular contract terms.

17

And they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily

18

be the case that American Express could be using its

19

economic power to impose terms essentially making

20

arbitration of antitrust claims impossible.

21

And why shouldn't we understand this problem

22

as connected to the very allegation that's being

23

brought?

24

to be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power

25

able -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you

That -- you know, how is it, how is it going

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can create an arbitration clause, which essentially

2

prevents that from being challenged?

3

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, there is a separate

4

issue below which the court did not reach about whether

5

the arbitration clause itself had been improperly

6

imposed.

7

with the class action waiver, which this Court in

8

Concepcion said there's no statutory basis for the

9

courts to preclude application of that waiver.

10

But the question before the Court has to do

It's also -- would create a completely

11

unworkable inquiry at the outset of litigation in order

12

to determine whether to refer a case to arbitration in

13

the first place, and it's unnecessary because State law

14

unconscionability, can deal with contracts of adhesion

15

or unfair terms.

16

can deal with how to cost effectively arbitrate the

17

claims in issue.

18

The arbitrator in the first instance

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did -- did American

19

Express say, as Justice Breyer suggested, that, well we

20

will concede A, B, and C, so the only issue on which you

21

need proof is D?

22

never took the position that it would -- it would

23

concede certain issues so that you could limit the

24

proof.

25

As I understood it, American Express

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, Your Honor, we took the
18


Alderson Reporting Company

position even in district court that they could pool

2

their resources --

talking about --

No, I'm not

MR. KELLOGG:

-- and share the cost of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not talking about

pooling with other single merchants bringing single

arbitrations.

I'm asking whether American Express -- so

here's the complaint.

markets separately.

12

position, no, you don't have to prove all that.

13

that's what Justice Breyer was suggesting.

14

one thing that's really in controversy, and the rest we

15

could stipulate.

16

It says, I have to prove relevant
And did American Express take the
I think

There's only

But I didn't see anything in all the time

17

this case has been in the courts on American Express's

18

part to say that we are not going to demand the

19

full breadth of proof.

20

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, that's -- that's not

21

actually correct.

We did not say that we're going to

22

relieve them of their burden of proof on any issues, but

23

we did say, and the district court agreed with us, that

24

the arbitrators are capable of dealing with these claims

25

in an efficient and cost-effective way that would allow
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the plaintiffs to bring them.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose that American

3

Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at

4

all, right?

5

you -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court,

6

right?

They could have just said -- you know,

They could say that, legally, couldn't they?

7

MR. KELLOGG:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

We could.

And indeed --

And until Rule 23 was

adopted, that would mean -- you know, if you had a small

10

claim, tough luck, right?

De minimis non curate lex.

11

If it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to

12

bring a Federal claim.

13

Sherman Act, would it?

And that would not violate the

14

MR. KELLOGG:

15

issue was present in the Eisen case.

16

Correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That -- that very

I'm a little

17

confused about this business about pooling resources and

18

whether it's prohibited or permitted.

19

what your position is on that.

20

MR. KELLOGG:

Tell me exactly

Our position is that multiple

21

claimants in arbitration could share the costs of an

22

expert for preparation of a report.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it seems to

24

me -- I don't see how that concession is at all needed

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

This case is about the scope and continuing

6

existence of a doctrine that has been a feature of this

7

Court's cases and a necessary corollary of its

8

willingness to extend arbitration to Federal statutory

9

claims, the vindication of rights doctrine.

10

Ever since this Court 30 years ago, roughly,

11

got in the business of extending arbitration to Federal

12

statutory claims, it's used the effective vindication

13

doctrine as an assurance that Federal statutory claims

14

would not go unvindicated just because of the arbitral

15

forum.

16

And so, if you look at this Court's cases,

17

they stand for a simple proposition.

18

arbitration or litigation, surely the FAA favors

19

arbitration and it's no threat to the underlying

20

statute because the underlying statutory claim is

21

vindicated in the arbitral forum.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When the choice is

I don't see -- I don't see

23

how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be

24

vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal

25

suit.

That happened for years before there was such a
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing as class action in Federal courts.

2

the Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be

3

vindicated.

4
5

MR. CLEMENT:

Nobody thought

Well, Justice Scalia, let me

take --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I don't see why it's

7

any different when you transpose the situation to the --

8

to the arbitration situation.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Scalia, let me take on

10

the premise and then we get -- then also say where

11

really the concern comes in for the differential

12

treatment.

13

I would take issue with the premise, which

14

is, sure, there wasn't a Sherman Act -- there wasn't a

15

class action Rule 23 back when the Sherman Act was first

16

passed.

17

allowed for multiple claims to be litigated together;

18

there were not confidentiality agreements that came in

19

and limited your ability to share information from one

20

claim to another, and, of course, back in the good old

21

days, you didn't necessarily need a $300,000 expert to

22

bring a Sherman Act claim.

23

But there were procedures in like joinder that

But what I think is the problem is when you

24

have a difference, and that is the assumption on which

25

this case comes to the Court, where you could vindicate
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this claim in court because there are mechanisms to

2

share or shift costs and you cannot vindicate them in

3

the arbitration because of a combination of features of

4

the arbitration agreement that prevent any sharing or

5

shifting of costs.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Before you get to that, I

7

have two questions.

8

made because I -- I agree, I understand it is fairly

9

well established, this doctrine, but I don't see quite

10

One is on the point you've just

how it works.

11

Suppose there's a Tyler claim, a Truth in

12

Lending Act -- you know, something like that, and the

13

claim is a fairly -- it's worth about $10,000 or so.

14

And so the plaintiff says you violated the act, pay me

15

the $10,000.

16

that is really far out; and the more far out the theory,

17

the harder it is to prove.

18

prove, the more you need expensive experts.

19

Now, he happens to come up with a theory

And the harder it is to

And do we go case by case, saying -- you

20

know, where you have a really weird theory that's going to

21

require 17 experts and endless studies, you don't have

22

to have an arbitration claim, or you don't have to

23

follow it in this instance, but everybody else does.

24
25

Now -- now, is -- is that something, in
other words, we're supposed to look at case by case,

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which would produce the odd result I suggested?

2

we do it by categories?

3

Or do

How does the doctrine work?

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, you could do it by

4

category, and I suppose you could treat antitrust claims

5

differently, but I think there's an answer that's

6

already built into the Court's cases, which is Randolph,

7

and it's putting the burden on the plaintiff to make a

8

nonspeculative showing.

9

And in the case you've described, I would

10

think you would say, boy, that's speculative.

11

you know, you don't need that --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean --

No, what I'll do because I

13

work with my own hypothetical, I'll have a far-out case,

14

but yet not quite speculative.

15

trying to suggest is it's an odd doctrine that just

16

says, plaintiff by plaintiff, you can ignore an

17

arbitration clause if you can get a case that's

18

expensive enough, and there we are.

19

In other words, what I'm

I haven't seen it work, and I haven't seen

20

enough to know how it does work.

21

haven't either, but -- but I'm concerned about that.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

And I guess you

Well -- well, don't be too

23

concerned, Justice Breyer.

First of all, if you look at

24

the cases where the doctrine's been applied, it's

25

largely been in antitrust cases.

Justice Breyer, is the place for that debate, if it were

conceded, but for one thing:

their money on that extreme position that the effective

vindication doctrine doesn't exist, I think it's --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

One other thing which I

5

didn't understand, and that's why I am asking.

6

they chose as the remedy here was sever the arbitration

7

clause if you want, it seemed to be, and go to court.

8

All right.

9

What

Now, I don't know where that power comes

10

from.

So if you were going to improve this contract in

11

the direction that you would like, why couldn't you

12

sever the part about the confidentiality, or why

13

couldn't you require -- you have some awfully big

Like, I don't know -- probably, you have

there are many ways you can treat this particular set of

What's your

What do you think?

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, our -- our view on that

is -- you know, the Court is balancing two things here.
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's trying to apply the effective vindication doctrine,

2

but it's also trying to honor the principle of this

3

Court that you treat the parties to the bargain that

4

they have committed.

5

Now, if they would have come in and said in

6

the district court -- which they didn't -- that we'll

7

get rid of the confidentiality -- they said you could

8

share costs, but they -- you know, the confidentiality

9

was the problem.

10

It was the problem the Second Circuit saw.

11

You can look at 92a of the Petition appendix.

12

didn't petition on that issue, so I don't know how they

13

get to say, well, the Second Circuit was wrong about

14

that, but isn't that a shame.

15

that was wrong, they should have petitioned.

I mean, if they thought

2

Second Circuit held that the confidentiality agreement

3

precludes the sharing of this information from

4

arbitration to arbitration.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me ask you.

Your

6

effective vindicability principle depends upon a

7

comparison with what you could do in Court.

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. CLEMENT:

It doesn't, Justice Scalia.
It doesn't?

It doesn't.

It's a simple

11

comparison of the necessary unrecoupable costs of

12

bringing the claim in arbitration compared to the

13

maximum recovery.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but if you couldn't do

15

it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had

16

been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration

17

agreement be -- be harming you?

18

that.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't understand

If you have -- if you have a

20

claim, Justice Scalia, that can't be vindicated in

21

arbitration or in court, that claim's not going --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. CLEMENT:

24

Or in court.

Right.

But that's --

You have to compare it to

court.
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

No you don't.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you couldn't do it in

3

court, you don't have to be able to do it in

4

arbitration, it seems to me.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice Scalia,

6

you don't have to make that comparison part of the

7

test because the cases that can't be vindicated in

8

either place won't show up at the courthouse door.

9

once you show up at the courthouse door, you've got a

10

plaintiff's lawyer.

11

plaintiff's lawyer that thinks I can do this in the

12

litigation system.

13

So

They may be crazy, but you have a

And so at that point, the only question is,

14

all right, I think I can do this in the litigation

15

system.

16

doing it is this arbitration agreement -- so this

17

arbitration agreement is not operating as a real

18

arbitration agreement, it's operating as a de facto

19

as-applied exculpatory clause.

20

showing, then -- and the option is not arbitration or

21

litigation --

22

If the only thing that's precluding me from

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If they can make that

No.

No.

It's saying that

23

there's an alternate mechanism for resolving disputes.

24

It's called arbitration.

25

necessarily or even as a matter of fact often as a

And arbitration does not

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

practical matter involve the costs and the formalities of

2

litigation.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and God bless it,

4

Justice Kennedy -- when it does that, and it can

5

effectively address claims that can't be addressed in

6

the litigation system, that's exactly what we want

7

arbitration to do.

8

But there are some cases where the

9

arbitration system -- not generally -- I mean, if you

10

have the kind of pro-vindication agreement you had in

11

Concepcion, or that Sovereign Bank has that we mentioned

12

in our brief, then you can vindicate these claims in

13

arbitration.

14

But when you have a specific arbitration

15

agreement that has a variety of clauses that don't allow

16

for any mechanism to shift or share the costs, so you

17

know it's not litigation versus arbitration, of course

18

we'll go with arbitration.

19

In those circumstances, this Court has always said that

20

we'll have --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's litigation or nothing.

Well, I mean maybe it is

22

litigation if you need a $300,000 report.

But why do

23

you need a $300,000 report?

24

And I just can't -- it seems to me that I have to engage

JUSTICE BREYER:

arbitration is not something that you can use to

obstacles.

And the part that's

It's just you brought a very expensive

action in arbitration.

So -- so the -- the question in my mind is,

well, is there a way that some of the beneficial aspects

of class action can be used in an arbitration that does

not formally have a class action?

They could write a treatise

on it, maybe.
MR. CLEMENT:

But -- but what I was going to

16

say is look, I mean, take a step back.

You know, one of

17

the great things about the effective vindication

18

doctrine is it gets the incentives rights.

19

companies incentives to draft clauses that will allow

20

for the maximum vindication of Federal rights.

It gives

21

And so there are lots of clauses out there

22

that would allow for even this claim because they have

cost shifting of expert costs or they don't have

confidentiality agreements or they'll waive the

class?

Are you asserting that there is some arbitration

6

MR. CLEMENT:

No, Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you have to make -- you

8

have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal

court, don't you?

10

14

MR. CLEMENT:

No, it's not part of the

inquiry because -JUSTICE SCALIA:

It isn't.

So that any

class that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required.
MR. CLEMENT:

No, it's just that if by virtue

15

of showing up in court and saying, I want to litigate my

16

claim, the lawyer has already made a judgment that I can

17

vindicate it in Federal court.

18

Maybe it's because of class action, maybe

19

it's just because of joinder, maybe it's because there's

20

no confidentiality rule in the Federal proceedings, so

21

it can bring a lot of these claims, maybe it's a

22

difference in collateral estoppel.

lawyer has already spoken that I can make this claim

JUSTICE SCALIA:

he wants in the arbitration is the ability to sue on behalf

question presented anyway?

question presented, look at the opinion below.

The questions that the Second

25

Federal substantive law of arbitrability to invalidate

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not

2

permit class arbitration of a Federal law claim.

3

Now, you're saying that -- that whether they

4

permit class arbitration is not going to be decided on

5

the basis of whether you could certify a class under

6

Rule 23, but just what?

7

And -- and -- and if it does depend on that,

8

what is the Court supposed to do?

Before it can -- it

9

can give you your claim, it has to -- it has to decide

10

whether this class would be certifiable, wouldn't it?

11

My goodness --

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14
15

No, it would not --- this is a very

complicated procedure.
MR. CLEMENT:

-- Your Honor.

You just have

16

to answer the question, is there a problem with the

17

arbitration, is there something with this specific

18

agreement that precludes this claim going forward.

19

it's a combination of no class arbitration, no way to

20

shift costs because they don't provide cost shifting,

21

and no way to share costs because of the

22

confidentiality.

23

Here

Whatever they put in the question presented,

24

they can't make the Second Circuit's holding that the

25

confidentiality provision blocks the sharing of
41

Alderson Reporting Company

2

information to go away.

They're stuck with that.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is -- tell me

3

how the no -- no sharing of information and

4

confidentiality, how does that work again?

5

if you're a trade association, get together and say, I

6

think we should have a study of Amex's whatever.

7

then you put together the study, and then one of your

8

members says -- you know, that's a good study, I'm going

9

to go -- go to arbitration.

You can't,

And

They can't do that?

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

much, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

the confidentiality provision creates a practical

13

problem is you're trying to get all the information,

14

you're trying to get a single expert report in order to

15

share the costs, and you're trying to do not just the

16

market survey, but do a damage calculation, have a

17

damage formula.

18

They -- they could do that
The critical point at which

Because when you have a market like this

19

where the allegations are they've distorted the market,

20

so we can't rely on the market price, we need to know

21

the sales volumes of all the individual stores.

22

confidentiality agreement protects that and doesn't

23

allow that to be shared.

24
25

Their

That's not that unusual.

This Court in Nielsen and Concepcion both
remarked that one of the features of arbitration is you

generally keep it confidential.

2

that the Second Circuit said because of that --

3

And that's something

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what if you

4

do -- I mean, what if you do it, is that just part of

5

your trade associations, they think this is -- you know,

6

they're not talking about particular arbitration or

7

anything.

8

once you see the report, you say, my gosh, I had no

9

idea, and then you file your claim for arbitration.

They just prepare a -- a report, and then

10

MR. CLEMENT:

With all due respect, Mr. --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me my

12

point is simply that there's no sharing, confidence, it

13

seems like an awfully amorphous provision that would be

14

very difficult to enforce.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, I don't think

16

it's that difficult, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

shifting is not difficult, and there are other ways to

18

solve this problem.

19

all of them.

20

Certainly, cost

But the Amex agreement forecloses

And the question for this Court is, do you

21

say, well, tough or do you say what you've said every

22

time you've confronted this problem, the effective

vindication doctrine provides the solution.

Mr. Stewart?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. MALCOLM L. STEWART,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At the beginning of the argument,

17

Justice Kagan asked whether a pure exculpatory clause, a

18

provision in a contract that simply said, we promise not

19

to seek relief under the arbitration -- under the

20

antitrust clause period would be enforceable, and

21

Mr. Kellogg replied that it would not.

22

And I think the unenforceability of such a

23

provision would not depend on any analysis of what was

24

likely to happen if the suit was brought in court; that

25

is, a pure exculpatory clause could be set aside and the
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiff could still lose for any number of reasons.

2

The plaintiff could be denied class certification and

3

decide it's uneconomical to proceed with an individual

4

suit.

5

He could lose on a threshold ground like the

6

statute of limitations or he could lose on the merits.

7

But the unenforceability of the pure exculpatory clause

8

wouldn't require the Court to make a comparison between

9

being kicked out of court on that basis and what would

10
11

likely happen if the suit were able to be brought.
And we would submit that the same mode of

12

analysis applies when the arbitration agreement can be

13

shown to have the same practical effect as an

14

exculpatory clause; that is, if it is the case that

15

given the amount of money at stake, the arbitration

16

procedure specified in the contract and the modes of

17

proof that would be necessary in arbitration, if it can

18

be shown persuasively by the plaintiff who bears the

19

burden that no reasonable plaintiff would find it

20

economically feasible to proceed, then the arbitration

21

agreement can't be enforced --

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would that be the case even

before Rule 23 was -- was adopted?

24

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it would be --

Even though you couldn't

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

vindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to

2

vindicate it in arbitration?

3
4
5

MR. STEWART:

The question would be whether

the arbitration agreement could be enforced.
And before Rule 23 was adopted, if there had

6

been a pure exculpatory clause, it would have been

7

unenforceable and --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
a pure exculpatory clause.

I'm not even talking about
I'm talking about the mere

10

fact that as a practical matter, it's impossible to

11

bring it in arbitration.

12

also impossible to bring it in Federal court.

13

In a context in which it is

And you would say, still, you must permit it

14

to be brought in arbitration, even though it can't be

15

brought in Federal court.

16

MR. STEWART:

In the same way that we would

17

say a pure exculpatory clause would be invalid and

18

unenforceable, even if it were clear from the

19

plaintiff's complaint that he was not entitled to relief

20

on the merits.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart,

22

isn't that also consistent with the way the Court

23

addressed the issue in Randolph?

24

said there was it might be that these arbitration fees

25

are prohibitive.

Because what the Court

And if those arbitration fees are
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

prohibitive, then this doctrine kicks in.
And it didn't look to say, well, let's

3

compare how these fees relate to whatever costs you

4

would wind up with in litigation.

5

arbitration fees are prohibitive, in such -- in such a

6

manner that it prevents you from vindicating your

7

Federal claim in arbitration, that's enough.

8
9
10

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what are the

arbitration fees?

12

Do they include lawyers' fees?

14
15
16

And I would

make two real world --

11

13

It just said, if the

It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees.

MR. STEWART:

No, the attorneys' fees would

be recoupable under the substantive law.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So I don't know,

what do you --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Expert costs.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what are you comparing

19

it to in court litigation?

20

MR. STEWART:

We are not really --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. STEWART:

A filing fee?

No, I think we are not

23

comparing it to anything.

That is, our -- our position

24

is in determining whether the arbitration agreement has

25

the same practical effect as an exculpatory clause, we
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

asked could any reasonable plaintiff proceed under the

2

terms and conditions that are set up?

3

to that is no, then the arbitration agreement is

4

unenforceable.

5

And if the answer

Now, I would make two real-world points, one

6

of which Mr. Clement has already alluded to.

The first

7

is the only cases that are going to wind up in court are

8

those in which the plaintiff at least believes that it

9

would be feasible to vindicate the claim in court, and

10

so they are likely to be those in which there is at least a

11

potential difference between the outcome in court and

12

the outcome in arbitration.

13

The other is, even if a plaintiff believes

14

wrongly that he can proceed in court through a class

15

action mechanism and class action -- class certification

16

is denied under Rule 23, presumably at that point the

17

plaintiff is going to give up and the outcome at the end

18

of the day is going to be the same as if the arbitration

19

agreement had been enforced.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is exactly -- I found

21

no authority for the proposition that what hinders --

22

plenty of authority, you can't make the person go to

23

arbitration if the fees involved are too high because

24

he's blocked.

25

But you're quite an advance over that.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official

1

are saying the thing that keeps him out is his own

2

theory of wrong, which will involve hiring a lot of

3

experts and others.

4

Now, once that's adopted, it seems to me in

5

practice we have reversed in many, many cases the

6

proposition that you can, in fact, require Federal

7

causes of action to be arbitrated because all you have

8

to do to get -- out of the arbitration is to allege a

9

theory of your case which is hard and complicated to

10

prove.

11

Now, you are back in court.
Now, that's a significant erosion, it seems

12

to me.

13

there, if we're just supposed to accept that, if in fact

14

you are trying to reverse in practice what was the

15

holding that you can arbitrate these Federal causes of

16

action.

17

So I want to know if you have any standard

What is going on here?
And an addendum to that is if you are going

18

to convince me, which you might, that, well, that's

19

okay, do it, do it, do it, is it a possible remedy to

20

monkey with the arbitration clause and provide for a

21

sharing of costs, say if you win, the loser will pay the

22

expert fees, which is of course a much more

23

pro-arbitration way than just throwing it out entirely?

24

MR. STEWART:

Well, let me start --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a long question, but

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do you see what I'm driving at?

2

MR. STEWART:

Let me start with your last

3

question and work backwards.

It is possible and it

4

sometimes has happened in the lower court cases that a

5

plaintiff will come into court and say, I can't proceed

6

through arbitration because the arbitral fees are too

7

high in relation to my likely recovery.

8

And the defendant at that point will say, we

9

offer to waive the fees or we offer to pay your share of

10

the arbitral fees, and a court will be persuaded that,

11

given that consensual modification of the contract, it

12

is feasible for the claims to be brought in arbitration

13

and the plaintiff is kicked out of court.

14

Now, this is consensual.

This is something

15

that the court has -- that the court has done at the

16

company's behest, and it would be different question of

17

whether the court could do that over the company's

18

objection.

19

is put in a severability clause in the contract that

20

would specify what results should obtain if one

21

provision of the contract were held to be invalid.

22

But another thing that the company could do

I guess another thing I would say in

23

response to your question is we do have one data point,

24

the First Circuit's decision in Kristian, which I

25

believe Mr. Clement referred to, in 2006, which
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

essentially held on facts similar to these that the

2

arbitration clause as written was not enforceable

3

because the cost of the expert fees in an antitrust case

4

would dwarf any potential recovery, and we haven't seen

5

the floodgates opened.

6

The last thing I would say is if this is the

7

concern, Petitioner's proposed rule really doesn't match

8

the argument in its favor.

9

just arguing for a rule that would cover cases in which

That is, Petitioner is not

10

the relevant costs are those of experts or similar

11

authorities.

12

Petitioner's rule would say even if the

13

contract provides for a non-recoupable $500 filing fee

14

and the amount of the claim at stake is $200, so it's

15

absolutely apparent on the face of the contract that the

16

claim can't be brought, the agreement is still

17

enforceable and the plaintiff is deprived of his day in

18

court.

19

The other thing I would say about

20

Petitioner's argument is the challenge to the Second

21

Circuit's decision has really changed drastically since

22

the cert petition was filed; that is, the Second Circuit

23

took it as essentially undisputed that the costs of the

24

expert report would render it economically infeasible to

25

proceed in arbitration, and it took the further step of
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying, therefore the arbitration agreement is

2

unenforceable.

3

Now, the cert petition challenged only the

4

"therefore" part of the Second Circuit's analysis.

5

There wasn't a suggestion that the Petitioner intended

6

to challenge the antecedent determination that these

7

claims couldn't feasibly have been brought in

8

individualized proceedings.

9

And I think as Paul -- Mr. Clement said, the

10

likely reason is that wouldn't look like a cert-worthy

11

issue.

12

like a wise use of this Court's resources.

13

That sort of fact-specific inquiry wouldn't seem

So having gotten cert granted on the

14

important legal question whether the inefficacy of

15

arbitration procedures is a basis for invalidating the

16

agreement, Petitioners are now spending a great deal of

17

time arguing that it would in fact have been feasible to

18

pursue these claims through individualized arbitration.

19
20
21

And one thing we would say in response, as
Mr. Clement said -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

They didn't get

22

cert granted on that question at all.

23

before, they got it granted on whether the mere fact

24

that the arbitration agreement did not permit class

25

arbitration renders it invalid.
52

Alderson Reporting Company

As I pointed out

Official

1

MR. STEWART:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

But they did get cert -That's what I thought the

question before us.

4

MR. STEWART:

They got cert granted on that

5

question, but neither the question as so framed or the

6

body of the cert petition suggests any challenge to the

7

Second Circuit's factual determination that these claims

8

could not feasibly have been brought in individualized

9

arbitration.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stewart, is it -- the

11

arbitration agreement is a one-on-one, right?

12

can't, or can they have -- they have the 12 similarly

13

situated people, not a class, join in the arbitration,

14

or is it one on one?

15

MR. STEWART:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

It is correct that it has to

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

before we had Rule 23, when you were bringing a suit in

21

22

together.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. KELLOGG:

8

Let me focus on what the court of appeals

9

held below.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

At 3a of our appendix, the court said.

10

"The only issue before us is the narrow question of

11

whether the class action waiver provision contained in

12

the contract between the parties should be enforced."

13

That is the question on which we sought certiorari.

14

That is the question that the Court granted.

15

It is Respondents who have now tried to

16

rewrite that question by talking about other possible

17

ways of vindicating their rights that they claim are

18

foreclosed, that they claim wrongly are foreclosed by

19

the contract at issue here.

20

This is not --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do we have a factual

22

record?

Suppose, I think, based in substantial part on

23

Justice Breyer's suggestion, that we could have an

24

arbitration that's effective and we could have a trade

25

association prepare a report, and we could do one
54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

arbitration and then see if it applies to others.

2

Suppose I think that.

3

Do I -- doesn't that bear on this question?

4

And if it does, I don't have a factual record to support

5

my assumptions.

6

MR. KELLOGG:

I don't think you need a

7

factual record because as Respondents acknowledge the

8

burden is on them to show that the arbitration-specific

9

costs would preclude them from pursuing their claim.

10

And they have not done that by putting in an

11

affidavit saying, well, in litigation we have to do --

12

get 5 million documents and spend $300,000 processing

13

them and get an expert report which could cost up to $1

14

million.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. KELLOGG:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

But suppose we answer --

That is not --- the question -- the

answer is yes, a class action waiver can be enforced.

19

MR. KELLOGG:

Correct.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what are the

21

circumstances here?

22

remand it for further consideration of what they are.

23
24
25

The record leaves us uncertain, we

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, the court could

certainly -JUSTICE BREYER:

Because that isn't the

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

issue they decided, whether it could be enforced.

2

decided whether you can -- whether the whole arbitration

3

agreement could be enforced.

4

MR. KELLOGG:

They

The holding of the court of

5

appeals is the arbitration agreement cannot be enforced

6

because it has a class action waiver.

7

reversible error.

8
9

That is clearly

I don't even hear --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was because -- it was

because Judge Pooler said, "I have been instructed by

10

the Supreme Court that I may not require class

11

arbitration."

12

decision that a court can't order class arbitration,

13

isn't that correct?

14

That's -- and she was bound by our

So that was not an option for her.

MR. KELLOGG:

But the Court also in

15

Concepcion said you can condition the enforceability of

16

an arbitration agreement on the availability of class

17

procedures, and that is what the Court below violated.

18

So the decision below has to be vacated.

19

I do not think you should remand for a

20

detailed factual showing on just how they are going to

21

vindicate their rights in arbitration because most of

22

those questions, what evidence is required, et cetera,

23

are for the arbitrator in the first instance.

That said, we made -- we did respond to
their showing below.

We did not put in a dueling

affidavit saying, no, in litigation, it only requires a

2

$200,000 report or a $25,000 report.

3

irrelevant because we're talking about

4

arbitration-specific costs.

5

that they can proceed with their claims.

6

We said, that's

And there's lots of ways

One is by sharing the costs of an expert,

7

and they specifically rejected that.

8

we could shift the costs of the experts to the other

9

side, that wouldn't be good enough because then all we'd

10

be doing is expending much money to get it back.

11
12

They said, even if

We need aggregated damages of the sort
available in class suit --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or you have to do without.

14

I -- you just said what -- I thought that the expert

15

talked about litigation costs, not about arbitration

16

costs.

17

So how is that handled?

18

MR. KELLOGG:

19

how I read the report.

20

arbitrator --

21

That is how I read -- that is
And certainly with an expert

JUSTICE BREYER:

You said you waived that

22

point, whatever -- however it is.

23

raised it.

24

arbitration costs.

25

You waived it.

Never

The Court of Appeals took it as if it were

MR. KELLOGG:

No, we raised -- we've argued

that all along.

27 of our -- the --

3

In fact, I can refer the Court to page

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Second Circuit never

4

said anything about, this is what it would cost in

5

court.

6

what it would cost to prove this kind of tying, right?

7

It didn't say one word distinguishing what

8

it would cost in litigation from what it would cost in

9

arbitration.

The court -- the Court of Appeals said, this is

10

It was simply what it was going to cost.
MR. KELLOGG:

We did, in fact.

But let me

11

answer Justice Breyer's question first, at page 27 of

12

our Court of Appeals --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I believe you.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'd like to hear the

15

answer, if nobody --

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. KELLOGG:

We specifically said, "The

18

declaration of merchant's expert is similarly

19

un-illuminating, as he too studiously avoided projecting

20

the costs for an individual arbitration of these

21

disputes."

22

So we did argue against that point.

This is

23

not an exculpatory clause.

The Court has made clear

24

that a class action waiver is not an exculpatory clause.

25

This Court has also made clear that you cannot assume
58

1

that the arbitral forum will be inadequate to vindicate

2

Federal substantive rights.

3

And they cannot now change the nature of the

4

question presented by arguing that well, there should

5

have been another provision to allow -- specifically

6

allow cost-sharing, or specifically allow cost-shifting.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Kellogg, it does

8

seem like both of the parties have changed what they're

9

saying a bit.

And -- you know, if this case as

10

presented to us was presented to us in the first

11

instance that the premise was that if you go into

12

arbitration, it would not provide an effective way to

13

vindicate the claim.

14

And, now, people are saying different things

15

about the confidentiality clause, and people may be

16

saying different things about the necessity of an

17

expert.

18

was presented to us was not quite right.

19

It suggests that the premise on which this case

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, I -- I don't believe

20

that's the case.

21

accepted the case, presumably, is that the decision

22

below which conditioned the enforceability of the

23

arbitration agreement on a -- on the availability of

24

class procedures, was wrong under Concepcion.

25

The premise on which the Court
