ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. MILKEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. MILKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If I may, I'd like to frame the merits very

11

quickly and then turn immediately to standing.

Although

12

the case before you arises in an important policy area,

13

it turns on ordinary principles of statutory

14

interpretation and administrative law.

15

decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute

16

plain errors of law reviewable under any standard.

17

EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority

18

over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even

19

if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare.

20

That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law.

EPA made a

21

As a fallback position, EPA declined to

22

consider if these substances are endangering public

23

health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made

24

more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in

25

section 1202 of the Clean Air Act.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Although EPA

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possesses a good deal of discretion in applying the

2

statutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling

3

on impermissible grounds as it did here.

4

We are not asking the Court to pass judgment

5

on the science of climate change or to order EPA to set

6

emission standards.

considerations.

We simply want EPA to visit the

11

fact, all of which are the kinds of harms the statute

12

was aimed at preventing.

13

affidavits establish that as a matter of physics, the

14

more greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, the more

15

temperatures are going to rise, ocean waters expand, and

16

the seas rise.

17

rise everywhere around the world.

18

Massachusetts will be hit particularly hard because

19

we're also subject to a land subsidence, but that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When?

I mean, when is the

predicted cataclysm?

5

MR. MILKEY:

Your Honor, it's not so much a

6

cataclysm as ongoing harm.

The harm does not suddenly

7

spring up in the year 2100, it plays out continuously

8

over time.

9

that occur in the future, there's nothing conjectural

And even to the extent you focus on harms

10

about that.

11

and they stay a long time, the laws of physics take

12

over.

13

Once these gases are emitted into the area,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there's a lot of

14

conjecture about whether -- I gather that there's

15

something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus

16

on how much of that is attributable to human activity.

17

And I gather that -- what is it?

18

percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are

19

attributable to automobiles in the United States?

20
21

MR. MILKEY:

Something like seven

It's actually about 6 percent,

Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. MILKEY:

6 percent?

Thank you.

But it's important to point out

24

as well, though, that in the ruling we challenge, EPA

25

has disavowed authority over all U.S. sources of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but that doesn't go to

the harm that you're claiming.

if you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of

carbon dioxide emissions, right?

MR. MILKEY:

But my

point was that they disclaimed authority over all

I understand, but that has

nothing to do with whether you have standing.

to do with the merits of the case.

the reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years,

And since those

Not in the first year.

No, no.

We agree, Your Honor.

I mean ultimately, when all

7

the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars

8

with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce

9

the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent

10

would be the figure.

11

MR. MILKEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But whatever position

13

holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power

14

plants, and has there been any application to EPA with

15

respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?

16

MR. MILKEY:

There has, Your Honor.

In

17

fact, EPA has turned down a rulemaking petition to

18

regulate them under the new source performance standard

19

section of the Clean Air Act, and that is currently on

20

appeal in the D.C. Circuit, but it is currently stayed

21

pending the outcome of this case, and it just -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you get the

23

benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your

24

standard?

25

refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse

In other words, if you've challenged EPA's

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

regulation to a particular model of car, can you say,

2

well, they're following the same approach to a coal

3

powered -- coal fueled power plant, and so we get to

4

establish a broader injury?

5

the specific legal challenge you're raising here?

6

MR. MILKEY:

Or, aren't you limited to

Your Honor, I think it's

7

actually more direct in the sense that in the decision

8

we challenge here, they said greenhouse gases are not

9

air pollutants under any regulatory provision of the

10

act.

So at least on -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Don't you have to

12

show injury from their decision here?

13

other people, or you presumably as well might be injured

14

by their decisions that you are not challenging here,

15

that doesn't help your standing here, does it?

16

MR. MILKEY:

The fact that

I believe it does, Your Honor,

17

because we cannot win that other case unless we win this

18

case here in terms of the authority question.

19

any event, it is important to point out that because of

20

the scale of the problem, relatively small percentage

21

deductions in global emissions can lead to real world

22

results.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in

But at the outset, you

24

made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement

25

that we need not decide about global warming in this
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case.

But don't we have to do that in order to decide

2

the standing argument, because there's no injury if

3

there's not global warming?

4

simply because there is a likelihood that the perceived

5

would show that there's an injury?

6

MR. MILKEY:

Or, can you show standing

Your Honor, especially in this

7

case where none of our affidavits were challenged, I

8

don't think the Court needs to go there ultimately on

9

the merits because we showed through our uncontested

10

affidavits that these harms will occur.

11

evidence put in to the contrary, and I would add that

12

the reports on which EPA itself relies conclude that

13

climate change is occurring in -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There was no

Those affidavits

15

talked about the fact that if the government starts to

16

regulate, the technology is going to change, if the

17

technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and

18

all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out

19

conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved

20

of.

21

MR. MILKEY:

Your Honor, although we believe

22

we have shown other governments will follow suit, we are

23

not in any sense relying on that.

24

our standing without relying on that.

25

because -

We can easily show

9

Alderson Reporting Company

And that's

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Same argument if the

automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?

3

MR. MILKEY:

It would be the same argument.

4

And I would add that EPA in other contexts has

5

determined on several occasions that a 1 percent

6

contribution is significant under the Clean Air Act.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that

8

consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the

9

argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to

10

challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter

11

simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's

12

claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?

13

MR. MILKEY:

Your Honor, it is different

14

because here there is particularized injury that we have

15

shown.

16

states losing 200 miles of coastline, both sovereign

17

territory and property we actually own, to rising seas.

18

The injury doesn't get any more particular than

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you look ahead, I don't

19

know how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but

20

let's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what

21

particularized harm does the record show that

22

Massachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of

23

suffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that

24

you want to produce through these regulations?

25

MR. MILKEY:

Well, Your Honor, if I can deal
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with the traceability part of that question first,

2

traceability is easy to show here because the extent of

3

our harm is caused by the overall amount of the gases in

4

the air.

5

U.S. sources, or the 6 percent of the cars, that's still

6

a sizeable portion of the problem, so we know that 6 or

7

20 percent is there.

8
9

And being focused on the 20 percent of all

In terms of the particular harms, similarly
we have shown -

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

6 percent is the total

11

emissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in

12

the United States, right?

13

15

MR. MILKEY:

To the global carbon dioxide

emission.
JUSTICE ALITO:

To the global.

And so, the

16

reduction that you could achieve under the best of

17

circumstances with these regulations would be a small

18

portion of that, would it not?

19

MR. MILKEY:

It would be, we have shown in

20

the record it would be about a two-and-a-half percent

21

over the time it takes to turn the fleet over.

22

important that given the nature of the harms, even small

23

reductions can be significant.

24

25

millions of dollars that Massachusetts parks agencies

But it's

For example, if we're

11
Alderson Reporting Company

are projected to lose, that reduction is itself

2

significant.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That assumes

4

everything else is going to remain constant, though,

5

right?

contribution of greenhouse gases from economic

7

development in China and other places that's going to

8

displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.

9

It assumes there isn't going to be a greater

MR. MILKEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

But reducing

10

domestic emissions will reduce our harm, the harm we

11

would otherwise face regardless of what -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not if your harm is

13

the alleged loss of coastline.

14

depends upon what happens across the globe with respect

15

to greenhouse emissions.

16

MR. MILKEY:

Not necessarily.

It

Your Honor, we would still lose

17

coastline but we would not lose as much because these

18

harms are cumulative, and while reducing U.S. emissions

19

will not eliminate all the harm we face, it can reduce

20

the harm that these emissions are causing.

21
22
23

So it will necessarily reduce our harm and
satisfy redressibility.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, do we know that

24

that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of

25

two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide -- well, two
12
Alderson Reporting Company

and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of

strongest case from this Court to support your standing

MR. MILKEY:

particularized than, for example, the harm this Court

22

found sufficient in Laidlaw, which was -

it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?

MR. MILKEY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

Here I think the fact that the States are showing harm

5

not only to them in a property sense, but in their

6

sovereign capacity -

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's your authority for

that?

I have the same question as the Chief Justice.

9

was looking at your brief for the strongest case.

10

Suppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of

11

coastline.

12

or do you have some special standing as a State, and if

13

so what is the case which would demonstrate that?

14

I

Would he have the same standing that you do

Well, Your Honor, first of all,

we agree that a large landowner would himself or herself

have -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

whether you have some special standing -

20

MR. MILKEY:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22
23

What of a small landowner?
No, no.

I'm asking

Yes -- as a State and, if so,

what's the authority for that?
MR. MILKEY:

Your Honor, first of all, I do

24

think we have special standing.

For example, here it's

25

uncontested that greenhouse gases are going to make
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

ozone problems worse, which makes it harder for us to

2

comply with our existing Clean Air Act responsibilities.

3

And the -- in the West Virginia case, which

4

is a D.C. Circuit case, the Court found that that itself

5

provided an independent source of standing.

is losing property because of this problem, then that

person would have standing, but we're nowhere near a de

21

the standing is straightforward.

22

We have shown we own property,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I'm not sure -- I think

23

our opinions have even said it, but certainly

24

commentators have often said it, that really the far

25

margin of our standing cases has been, you know, the
15
Alderson Reporting Company

famous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the

2

that added pollution interfered with the students' -

Mr. Milkey, does it make

a difference that you're not representing a group of law

20

students, but a number of States who are claiming that

they are disarmed from regulating and that the

22

regulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal

23

Government and the Federal Government isn't exercising

I thought you had a discrete claim based on the

dependent on the law Congress passed that gives that

authority to the EPA.

3

I thought that was -

MR. MILKEY:

that we are saying that provides us also an independent

5

source of our standing.

of that law because it has preempted your State action?

Is that the basis of standing you're alleging?

In short, Your Honor Do you know any case that

has ever held that?
MR. MILKEY:

Your Honor, I would cite you to

15

the amicus brief of the State of Arizona et al., which

16

cites several cases, albeit not in this Court, that

17

stand for that principle.

18

Your Honor, if I may turn to the merits

19

quickly, section 202(a)(1) provides EPA jurisdiction

20

over any air pollutant that motor vehicles emit.

21

not restricted to certain types of air pollutants or to

22

air pollutants that cause certain kinds of harm.

23

not only does the act define air pollutant with

comprehensive breadth, but we know these four substances

25

are air pollutants from other evidence.

Moving from your

command.

That is correct, Your Honor;

but they have said that they have put off making a

MR. MILKEY:

No, Your Honor.

EPA has a lot

of room to move based both on the endangerment standard

5

itself and on background principles of administrative

6

law.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And presumably the

8

principle that they want to deal with what they regard

9

as the more serious threats sooner.

They want to deal

10

with lead first and then they want to deal with other

11

stuff.

guess -- move into an abuse of discretion in not

13

exercising a judgment with respect to a particular

14

pollutant?

15

I mean, what is the -- when did they -- I

MR. MILKEY:

The answer to that, Your Honor,

16

is that when they do not rely on any of those grounds,

17

they do not rely on lack of information, they did not

18

rely on background principles of administrative law.

19

What though said here is -- and -- that they did not, in

20

fact, contest the seriousness of the problem.

21

in two back to back sentences on page A-82 of the third

that Congress left to EPA.

Rejecting mandatory motor vehicle

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you are right and

5

then it went back and the EPA then said, well, an

6

obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources,

7

we have the authority to say what comes first, Congress

8

-- we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has

9

authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though

10

we have the authority to do this, we think that we

11

should spend our resources on other things.

12

Suppose they said that?

You said they

13

didn't say it this time around, but how far will you get

14

if all that's going to happen is it goes back and then

15

EPA says our resources are constrained and we're not

16

going to spend the money?

17

MR. MILKEY:

Your Honor, while background

18

administrative law principles provide EPA at least some

19

room to move, we think it's important that EPA say that.

20

If they -- it's a very different opinion if they say, we

21

are not going to regular here because we just don't want

22

to spend the resources on this problem and we want to

Under the express words of the

that at least three of the four considerations are not

proper things for the agency to take into account:

17

different, whether we're running foreign policy

properly, whether cooperation with other countries are

relevant to this particular issue.

What's your response to that?

MR. GARRE:

that it depends on how many pages that the agency

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason it depended on

that is whether or not these other, improper

3

considerations might have influenced the ultimate

4

decision not to go ahead.

5

MR. GARRE:

I think it depends on the

6

reasons that the agency gave.

And one of the reasons

7

that the agency gave was the substantial scientific

8

uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate

9

change.

Petitioners acknowledge that that was an

10

appropriate consideration for the agency.

11

you think the other considerations were inappropriate,

12

and we certainly do not, but even if you think they are,

13

the agency gave an appropriate reason.

thing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is

that there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of

areas are more uncertain than the others.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just because there's

3

no standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't

4

mean the agency can't regulate that particular area,

5

right?

MR. GARRE:

That's exactly right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you are saying if

Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2

10

right in this statute under ambient air, and they say

11

anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're

12

saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do

13

that, because it's Article III we're talking about?

14

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, we're saying

15

two things.

16

to establish that he has Article III standing under this

17

Constitution.

18

Court, for example, Justice Kennedy in his concurring

19

opinion in Defenders of Wildlife, who did suggest that

perhaps if Congress specifically addresses an issue,

21

that could inform the standing analysis.

First, every plaintiff has the obligation

And secondly, there are members of this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

For example -

They can't

compromise the requirements of Article III.
MR. GARRE:

It cannot, Your Honor.

Congress

could make findings with respect to causation or other
40

issues that this Court would have to give deference to

2

and seriously consider, but you're right.

It would not

3

override the requirements of Article III.

And there may

4

be some global phenomenon that create more difficult

5

challenges to establish standing but -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

As I understand the

7

government's position, you're not merely questioning

8

standing but you also take the position you do not have

9

the authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do;

10

is that correct?

11

MR. GARRE:

That's true, Your Honor, moving

12

to the merits, that's true.

13

the agency engaged in the same type of analysis that

14

this Court laid out in the Brown and Williamson case.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And with respect to that,

May I ask you on that

16

question, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201,

17

there's reference to "shall regulate" if in the judgment

18

of the administrator there is a for real danger and so

19

forth.

20

judgment?

21

In your view, is there a duty to make a

MR. GARRE:

Your Honor, our view is that

22

agencies have inherent discretion to determine when to

23

make that judgment.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could they have a

discretion never to make the judgment?
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GARRE:

I think that gets to the

2

question of whether there is, what judicial review is

3

available.

4

some measure of judicial review.

5

point you got to the point where the agency either has

6

provided no reasons whatsoever, or there is no sound

7

basis for the agency not to take that step.

8

assuming that there is a role for the courts here, a

9

court could come in and say that that was inappropriate.

10

We have assumed in this case that there's

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So I think at some

Then

But as I read your brief,

11

you didn't really confront the question, s I understand

12

it, of whether or not there was a duty to make a

13

judgment at all.

14

position on that is.

15

And I'm interested in what your

MR. GARRE:

Well, again, I think it goes to

16

the question -- we think the statute does not put a

17

deadline on when the agency has to have, and that

18

therefore -

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

To me, just reading the

20

text of the statute is a little ambiguous.

21

entirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading

22

that statute, I got the impression that Congress thought

23

that the administrator had a duty to make a judgment

24

when there was enough evidence out there that people

25

were concerned about it and so forth, that there would
42
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be a duty there, but you think not?

2

MR. GARRE:

That's not the agency's

3

interpretation.

4

under the section no mandatory duty, the agency explains

5

why that's not its interpretation and we think that

6

that's a reasonable interpretation.

7

to constrain the exercise of discretion.

8

footnotes 18 and 19 of our brief of many examples where

9

Congress has laid out deadlines or other constraints on

10

the exercise of discretion, and those aren't present in

11

Section 203.

12

In fact in its decisional document

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Congress knows how
We point in

But you would agree that

13

if they did make a judgment, then you would have

14

authority to regulate?

15

MR. GARRE:

That's right.

And then I think

16

it's a point the D.C. Circuit made in the Ethyl

17

Corporation case at footnote 37, that precisely because

18

the statute imposes a duty to act once that endangerment

19

finding is made, the agency has discretion to determine

20

when to make the endangerment finding.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In Norton versus Utah

If EPA made

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you had a

Brown and Williamson argument that EPA was precluded.

12

MR. GARRE:

No, I was assuming -- in

13

answering Justice Stevens' questions, that we were down

14

in the exercise of discretion part.

15

Your Honor, the threshold position of the agency on this

16

is that it lacks the authority to -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you're right,

Can I ask about that?

I

18

found persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in

19

the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms

20

health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant

21

after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain.

22

there anything wrong with that response?

23

me -

24
25

MR. GARRE:

Is

It seems to

I think there is, Your Honor.

The way that the agency looked at this is to look at the
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question of whether Congress intended it to regulate

2

greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate

3

change, and it looked to the factors that this Court

4

laid out in Brown and Williamson.

5

whole is specific legislation addressing global climate

6

change, and it concluded that the agency had not

7

authorized it to embark on that regulatory -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The statute as a

You concede that it's an

air pollutant that affects health?

10

MR. GARRE:

No.

The agency -- what the

11

agency found, Your Honor, was that because global

12

climate change is not air pollution within the meaning

13

of the statute -- which is to say that Congress did not

14

authorize it to regulate it as air pollution.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then why isn't it air

16

pollution within the meaning of the statute, although

17

whatever it is that causes acid rain is?

18

MR. GARRE:

I think, Your Honor, that the

19

key to the agency was that Congress did not give it

20

regulatory authority over this.

21

question of whether or not greenhouse gas emissions

22

qualify -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think on the

But you can't give me any

24

text in this statute itself.

It isn't the phrase "air

25

pollution" or any other phrase?
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GARRE:

The agency pointed to the term

2

"air pollution agent" in the statute, and concluded that

3

because global climate change was not air pollution that

4

Congress intended to address -

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that gets us back to

acid rain.

7

MR. GARRE:

And with respect to acid rain,

8

it's a good example insofar as Congress has enacted a

9

whole separate title of the Clean Air Act to address

10

acid rain.

11

The other thing I want to mention on the

12

interpretive question is, in the Brown and Williamson

13

case, this Court assumed at the outset of its analysis

14

that nicotine would be within the general terms of the

15

definition of drug in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,

16

and that cigarettes would fall within the general term

17

of drug -

18
19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So that's the position

you're taking, that it is within the general term?
MR. GARRE:

I think it's largely the

21

position that the agency took, Your Honor, insofar as it

22

reasoned that, look, we've looked at everything.

23

conclude that Congress doesn't intend us to regulate

24

global climate change as air pollution.

25

therefore, we're not going to say that greenhouse gases

We

And so

are air pollution agents.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which is why there's a

3

significant difference between the agency saying that

4

for 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in

5

its opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the

6

agency's position was.

7

minted position, because the agency's position not too

8

long ago was that they did have the authority.

9

MR. GARRE:

And here where it's a newly

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it was

10

30 years before the agency reached the conclusion in

11

1998 that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant.

12

13

clear that it didn't think that the agency would

exercise its authority to regulate it.

That's a different

MR. GARRE:

And I think -- I mean, I grant

19

you that there are differences between Brown and

20

Williamson and this case, but the fundamental conclusion

21

that the agency reached is the same.

22

borrow the phrase from the Whitman case, Congress did

not intend to hide elephants in mouse holes.

mention carbon dioxide in the statute, which is in the

that Congress mentioned CO2.

went out of its way to say that it was giving

non-regulatory authority to the agency, and moreover,

11

that nothing in this section shall provide any basis for

the agency already had this far-reaching authority to

with your reference to this very -- these various pieces

of legislation that suggest that Congress has a

pollutants, and it has never interfered with it.

17

MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, again, I think

18

in looking at all the sources the agency looked to, the

conclusion is, that the agency responsibly and prudently

reached, is that Congress has not authorized it to

embark on this regulatory endeavor.
