CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 09-10876,

5

Bullcoming v. New Mexico.
Mr. Fisher.

6
7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. FISHER:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The text, purpose, and history of the

11
12

Confrontation Clause make it clear that the prosecution

13

cannot introduce one person's testimonial statements

14

through the in-court testimony of someone else.

15

having held in Melendez-Diaz that a lab analyst's

16

statements in a forensic lab report are testimonial,

17

this is an easy case.

Thus,

The State violated the Confrontation Clause

18
19

by introducing lab analyst Curtis Caylor's statements in

20

a forensic lab report without putting him on the stand.

21

The New Mexico Supreme Court resisted this analysis,

22

straightforward as it is, on the ground that

23

Mr. Bullcoming, as the defendant, had the opportunity to

24

cross-examine a substitute or a surrogate witness,

25

Mr. Razatos.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But a surrogate witness procedure violates

2

all four components of the right to confrontation.

3

quite obviously violates the defendant's right to have

4

the witness testify in his presence, in the presence of

5

the jury so the jury can observe it, and under oath, as

6

happened in this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

It

Mr. Fisher, when you say

8

"in the presence," do you -- do you mean it necessarily

9

must be in the courtroom, or would a video-conferencing

10

set-up be permissible so that the technician or the

11

analyst could testify from the lab, rather -- but it

12

would be screened in -- in the courthouse?
MR. FISHER:

13

Well, the default rule under

14

the Confrontation Clause is in presence, in the

15

courtroom.

16

in a child witness setting -- of course, very different

17

than this case -- that closed-circuit TV would be

18

permissible, and I believe, you know, in a future case,

19

if the State perhaps made some sort of showing that the

20

lab analyst couldn't come to court for some reason, and

21

certainly if the defendant stipulated, and maybe even if

22

the defendant didn't stipulate, a court could

23

accommodate -­

24
25

Now, in Maryland v. Craig, this Court held

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The defendant didn't give

his consent, so we don't -- that's not a concern, but
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

let's -- let's suppose defendant doesn't stipulate.

2

this adequate to meet the Confrontation Clause?
MR. FISHER:

3

Is

I don't think it would be

4

adequate, Justice Ginsburg, with at least some -- absent

5

at least some showing of unavailability of the witness

6

or -- making the witness unable to come to court.
Now -- now, there is an amicus brief in the

7
8

case, I believe, that suggests some flexibility that

9

trial judges might employ in -- in accommodating lab

10

analysts' schedules.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

What about police

12

witnesses?

What about not requiring the officer who -­

13

who took the confession or who witnessed the alleged

14

crime -- not requiring him to appear because he's busy?

Can't make it.

He's out on

So can we have him appear by television?
MR. FISHER:

18

Well, that's never been -­

That's never been the rule,

19

Justice Scalia, and I don't think there would be a need

20

21
22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why is a lab

technician different?
MR. FISHER:

I don't think -- I don't think

24

one is, and you don't have to reach that in this case,

25

because the State never attempted to make any showing
5

that Mr. Caylor was unavailable for any reason.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This -­

Mr. Fisher, what if

3

you had two people doing this procedure?

4

sitting in, you know, chairs right next to the other.

5

The one, you know, takes the blood samples from the

6

vials, puts them in another vial, and puts the aluminum

7

stuff on and crimps it.

8

vials and puts them in the machine and runs it.

9

have to have both of them testify?

10

MR. FISHER:

The other one then takes the

present statements from them both.

What the State

Alderson Reporting Company

Even though one

Official - Subject to Final Review

didn't do it?

Even though the question is going to be,

2

did you put the aluminum on and crimp it, and the answer

3

is going to be, no, Joe did it; he sits right next to

4

me?
MR. FISHER:

5

That's right.

The

6

Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right, Mr.

7

Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

right.

I'm sorry.

That's

Does -- do they both have to testify, then, or

not?
MR. FISHER:

11

They do not have to.

The

12

Confrontation Clause is a purely procedural right.

13

all depends on what -- whose statements the State wants

14

to introduce.

15

its case by having somebody testify, saying, I watched

16

the thing go into the machine and I watched this result

17

come out and I saw that it wasn't tampered with and it

18

was Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then that would be fine.

the result that I saw come out.

Here's what I watched.

Now, again, the only question is whose

statements the State wants to introduce.

3

Mr. Chief Justice and Justice Kennedy, if the State

wanted to introduce statements from both of the lab

analysts who worked together on the case, they would

By all means,

The State takes its

I mean, as to how much it has to bring

in, in order to persuade the jury?
MR. FISHER:

11

That's right.

That's the

12

decision the State makes in every case, whether it be

13

multiple police investigators, multiple eyewitnesses,

14

or -­

17

course.

18

with the admission of any admissible hearsay testimony

19

that the jury will be -- that you'll make the argument

to the jury that you should discount it if the person

21

isn't there.

That's a given, of

Of course, the State takes a chance with the -­

That's always true.
MR. FISHER:

I'm not sure I -- I disagree

23

with anything you said, but the rule of the

24

Confrontation Clause applies to a particular kind of

25

statements, testimonial statements.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

And our rule today

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and the one that resolves this case is, if the State

2

wants to introduce a witness's testimonial statements,

3

it needs to bring that witness to court.

4

Now, footnote 1 in Melendez-Diaz -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, I take it it's a

6

testimonial statement that this blood that was taken at

7

the hospital was the blood of the defendant.

8

testimonial statement?
MR. FISHER:

9
10

That's a

Yes, I believe it would be,

Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

And so I assume that in

12

this case, the nurse and the police officer were both

13

present.

14

MR. FISHER:

Yes, and, in fact -­

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I assume under your

16

position, you could not have a record showing that

17

the -- the nurse withdrew the sample at 10:08 p.m. on

18

such-and-such a date and that she followed the regular

19

procedure.

20

wanted to introduce just a certificate or just -- just

21

that record?

22

That would be insufficient if the State

MR. FISHER:

I think that's what footnote 1

23

in Melendez-Diaz says.

If the defendant wants to

24

challenge the chain of custody, then the State needs to

25

bring in the witnesses.

Now, I think it's an
10


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interesting fact in this case, and it shows why that

2

rule isn't so -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

3

Well, that's not -- I don't

4

think that's what Melendez-Diaz' footnote 1 says.

5

says that the State may be able to prove chain of

6

custody by testimony other than the actual individuals

7

who handled the sample, and then it has to take its

8

chances as to whether the trier of fact is going to

9

believe -- is going to believe that.
MR. FISHER:

10

It

Isn't that right?

I think that's right.

I think

11

what footnote 1 says is the defendant -- when the State

12

chooses whose testimony it wants to introduce, the

13

defendant has the right to insist that that be done

14

live.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It does -- it does not -­
Does not Melendez-Diaz also

17

say that if the defendant wants to challenge the -- the

18

chain of custody, the State can adopt rules that

19

requires the defendant to assert that challenge or his

20

intention to make that challenge, or his intention to

21

make that challenge, prior to the trial so that the

22

State will know whether it has to introduce any live

23

testimony?

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Of course, that's correct under

the notice and demand regimes that Melendez-Diaz
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

approved of.

And the Public -- the PDS brief in this

2

case showed that many States do use those regimes.

3

Justice Kennedy, I did want to -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Now,

But the chain -- the chain

5

of custody does involve a testimonial statement that

6

this is the blood, that I took it out at 10:05 p.m. on

7

Saturday evening.

8

the defendant's blood.

That's a testimonial statement.

MR. FISHER:

the .21 to Mr. Bullcoming by saying that was

14

Mr. Bullcoming's sample, then they'd need to bring

15

somebody into court if the defendant insisted upon it.
But the one thing I want to add is that the

17

Public Defender Service brief makes clear, and the facts

18

of this case make clear, it's going to be very rare that

19

a defendant wants to do that.

It happens in courtrooms all across the country.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but if you want to

unacceptable argument.

certain rights, and we have to presume there is a

3

defense attorney who's going to afford his client every

4

right the Constitution has.

5

supposed to worry because it won't happen very often is

6

(a) it seems to me, an unlikely hypothetical; and (b) it

7

seems to me, irrelevant to your argument.

8
9

MR. FISHER:

You're saying the defense has

So the fact that we're not

Well, Justice Kennedy, I will

gladly accept (b) if we want to say that consequences

10

are irrelevant, because I think that's what -- the Sixth

11

Amendment is what it is, but I think the only thing I

12

would add is that all I can say is, empirically, in the

13

States that have followed the rule we advocate today,

14

long before Crawford or Melendez-Diaz, it simply is a

15

manageable burden.

16

it is a thoroughly manageable -­

17

I'm not saying it's no burden.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

Mr. Fisher, I thought -- I

18

thought the Court put this worry behind us in Crawford.

19

Wasn't the same worry raised in Crawford?

20

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think it was raised

21

even more pointedly in Melendez-Diaz when it comes to

22

lab analysts.

23

set that aside.

24

I think in both places the Court, yes,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Said, yes, it may be

something of a risk, but the States have managed it in

But if that expert then read that data and testified

that this was of a certain amount or percentage of

Probably not.

The second is that it's not

11

introduced.

Then you have a Confrontation Clause

12

violation if the expert -- and this is the words many

13

lower courts have used -- is a mere conduit for

14

introducing the out-of-court testimonial statement.

15

So -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

16

Could we break this down in

17

-- in this way?

18

statements that the -- the State was attempting to -- to

19

prove.

20

was the sample that was taken from the defendant.

21

Second was that the standard procedures were followed in

22

this case, and the third was that the result was .21.

23

Would you agree with that?

24
25

I see three things that the -- three

The first was that the sample that was tested

MR. FISHER:

Those are the three things?

I think there's one other

thing, Justice Alito, which is that the sample had not

been tampered with -­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

MR. FISHER:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

-- or contaminated.
That the sample had not been

5

tampered with.

Now, as to the first three, in other

6

words, everything other than the results, could the

7

State prove those things without having -- simply by

8

introducing testimony regarding the way things were

9

generally done in the lab, and ask the jury to infer

10

that the general procedures were followed in this

11

particular case?

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

MR. FISHER:

I think that would be a

question of State law, Justice Alito.
JUSTICE ALITO:

It wouldn't be a

Confrontation -­
MR. FISHER:

It wouldn't be a Confrontation

Clause question.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, in this

case, as I read the record, it seems to me that's what

the prosecutor was attempting to do.

21

of the Joint Appendix.

23

we will get the sample in the mail, et cetera.

24
25

This is on page 50

The analyst is beginning to
So what we do is

The analyst is beginning to testify about
standard lab procedures, and then defense attorney says,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"Your Honor, I'm going to object to what's done in the

2

status quo."

3

done.

I take that to mean what is generally

"I don't object to what was done in this case."
So the defense attorney is preventing -- is

4
5

objecting to the prosecution's attempting to discharge

6

its responsibility with respect to those first three

7

propositions through testimony about standard

8

procedures, and is insisting that the analyst provide

9

the testimony that you say was a violation of the

10

Confrontation Clause; namely, testifying as to what was

11

done in this particular case.
MR. FISHER:

12

Justice Alito, I think if you

13

look earlier in the Joint Appendix, I believe it's at

14

page 40, where the State for the first time says we're

15

going to put Mr. Razatos on the stand instead of Mr.

16

Caylor, there's a -- there's an objection there as well

17

that says you can't then put the document into evidence

18

that Mr. Caylor wrote if he's not going to be on the

19

stand.

20

That's the critical objection here.
Now, you're right, there's nothing wrong

21

with Mr. Razatos having taken the stand in this case,

22

there's nothing wrong with him having described typical

23

procedures in the lab.

24

pointing was to the one that said -- again, as far as

25

the State law objection, saying he can't testify to

I think the objection you're

22

something he doesn't have personal knowledge about,

2

which is whether the procedures were followed in this

3

case.

4

stand and testify to -- to general procedures.

5

page 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix, he -- he simply

6

reads the report's results.

But Mr. -- Mr. Razatos could certainly take the
But at

And so you have two Confrontation Clause

7
8

violations, really.

You have the report being

9

introduced in the first instance, and then you have -- I

10

believe it's at 54 and 55 of the Joint Appendix.

11

have the prosecutor asking Mr. Razatos, what was the

12

result?

13

itself says at page 58, note 15 of its brief, there was

14

no independent analysis being applied there.

15

Razatos was doing was repeating and giving the jury the

16

conclusions that Mr. Caylor had reached.

17

He says the result was .21.

JUSTICE ALITO:

You

As the State

All Mr.

But if the -- if the machine

18

had expelled a piece of paper that said .21, that piece

19

of paper would not be a -- introduction of that piece of

20

paper, the contents of the piece of paper, would not be

21

a violation of the Confrontation Clause?

22

MR. FISHER:

If it said nothing more than

23

the .21 coming out of the machine, I think probably not.

24

Now, judge Michael in the First Circuit would disagree;

25

and so that's an issue that's not in this case, and I
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think you could debate whether that should -- even that

2

should be considered hearsay of the operator.
JUSTICE ALITO:

3
4

debate it?

5

to allow cross-examination.

6

cross-examine the machine?

The purpose of the Confrontation Clause is

MR. FISHER:

7

Well, how can -- how can you

How are you going to

Well -- well, the question that

8

would arise there would be whether the .21 should be

9

treated as Mr. Caylor's statement.

Let me -- if I give

10

you two hypotheticals, maybe it explains.

On the one

11

hand, I don't think anyone would claim that a time stamp

12

on a fax machine, for example, is a human statement.

13

It's a machine statement, and so therefore it can't be

14

testimonial.

15

affidavit on a word processor and hits print, you can't

16

say, well, that's the machine talking, not the human.

17

So the question arises in the lab context

On the other hand, if someone types out an

18

whether a .21 or anything else that comes out of the

19

machine has enough human influence that it ought to be

20

treated as the -- as the person's statement.

21

Now, you don't have to resolve that in this

22

case, and what's important to emphasize is that that

23

hypothetical of the .21, even though the State would

24

like it to be this case, is really miles away for the

25

reason you said, because the State proved a lot more
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

than .21 by Mr. Caylor's lab report, and that's why

2

these hypotheticals I think are important.
JUSTICE ALITO:

3

But all of those other

4

things could potentially be proven by indirect evidence,

5

by establishing standard procedures and asking the jury

6

to infer that the standard procedures were followed in

7

this case.

8

might not -­

9

They might -- they might believe that; they

MR. FISHER:

The State could -­

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

inference; they might not.

12

MR. FISHER:

They might make the

The State could make that

13

choice, but it would be a considerably weaker case,

14

Justice Alito, not just because they wouldn't have

15

anyone saying that the procedures were actually followed

16

in this case, but also in this case it would be a far

17

weaker case because they'd have somebody on the stand

18

who would now be subject to cross-examination as to why

19

he had been recently put on unpaid leave.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

But as to this case, didn't

21

the defendant actually testify that he was drunk at the

22

time of -- at the time when the blood was extracted?

23

took the stand and he testified that after the accident

24

he went off into the woods and he came upon people who

25

were drinking vodka and he drank, they drank -- what was
25
Alderson Reporting Company

He

it -- a gallon of vodka together, and then he went back

2

to the scene and his blood was tested?

3

MR. FISHER:

That was -­

Isn't that correct?

That was his defense, Justice

8

drunk.

9

DUI; he was convicted in New Mexico law of aggravated

Because you're right, he did admit he was
But remember, he was not convicted simply of

10

DUI.

And to have aggravated DUI you need to have up to

11

a .16 blood alcohol count.

12

the State could have proved over .16, even if Mr.

13

Bullcoming admitted that he had been drinking that day.

So the report is the only

14

So that's why it's important in this case.

15

That's why he wanted to challenge -- that's one reason

16

why he wanted to challenge the report.

17

Let me come back to the -- to the important

18

point, I think, though, that what the State wants to be

19

able to do -- I don't want to ascribe a bad motive, but

20

what the State's rule would allow States to do is to

21

insulate people from cross-examination, not just Mr.

22

Caylor in this case, but -- but -- but please pay

23

attention to, for example, the Dungo case that's cited

24

in our opening brief, from California.

25

where a coroner had been fired from his job, blacklisted
26
Alderson Reporting Company

That's a case

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

by law enforcement, and prohibited from testifying in

2

many counties because he falsified his reports, his

3

autopsy reports, by writing them with the police report

4

sitting right next to him.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the State can't -­

And -­
The State can't immunize

8

those people from testifying.

9

Caylor, couldn't you?

You could have subpoenaed

You could have asked for a

10

continuance and -- and a subpoena, and brought him in to

11

testify?

12

step, right?

It's just a question of who has to take the

MR. FISHER:

13

Well, we -- we could have, but

14

Melendez-Diaz makes clear that doesn't satisfy the

15

Confrontation Clause.

16

a garden variety DUI case there is only so much time and

17

resources at issue, and that's why the Confrontation

18

Clause I think is especially important in a case like

19

this, that the prosecution bring its witnesses into

20

court.

21

And when you deal especially with

And if I could just finish the Dungo story,

22

in the -- in the California Court of Appeal, when they

23

reviewed that case, they said the prosecutor's intent in

24

that case had been to shield Mr. -- I'm sorry, the -­

25

the actual analyst in that case from cross-examination.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And, in fact, the supervisor when he took the stand at

2

the preliminary hearing told -- told the court the

3

reason why they have me here is the prosecutors find it

4

too hard to have this person in court.

5

perfectly permissible, if -- if the State win this case

6

today and surrogate testimony were allowed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

So that would be

How do you answer the

8

practical situation that Caylor, who did this particular

9

run, does some dozens day in and day out, and he will

10

have no memory, in fact, of this particular test.

11

having him there -- he knows how the process operates;

12

he doesn't remember this particular one -- how does

13

having him there -- what could be elicited on

14

cross-examination of him that couldn't be from his

15

supervisor?
MR. FISHER:

16

So

Let me give you two answers,

17

Justice Ginsburg, but first let me say we don't know

18

whether somebody doesn't remember it until he's put on

19

the stand.

though analysts don't ordinary remember run-of-the-mill

Scalia.

And on the flip side, even if he doesn't

There's a line of cases from this

it's the holding of Owens most recently is that those

are meaningful things that the Confrontation Clause

requires.

MR. KING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

There are other distinguishing -­

17

distinguishing features that are significant between the

affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this case.

19

For one, the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz was prepared

20

pursuant to an statute in Massachusetts that called for

21

the preparation of an affidavit from the lab at some

22

point in time after the actual test was done, and it was

23

to be used specifically as an in-court statement to

replace the live in-court testimony of the affiant.

does that make?

defense would like to know the answer to that question.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And didn't -- and didn't

24

the prosecution intentionally set it up this way so that

25

this person would not have to testify, so that he could

not be cross-examined?

substitute to testify?
MR. KING:

3

Isn't that why they sent the

No, Your Honor.

In this case,

4

that's -- that's not the case.

I -- the -- this case

5

came about in a little bit of an unusual circumstance,

6

because both sides had been negotiating a plea agreement

7

and when the -- when the plea agreement was not

8

successful, the defendant asked for the trial to be

9

expedited and moved quickly to trial.

So the defendant

10

didn't do as much discovery, I think, as you would

11

normally do in a case like that, but -­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know what the facts

13

are, but boy, it smells bad to me.

14

even if that was not the case, the mere possibility that

15

it could have been the case shows why you should have to

16

bring this person in if you want to introduce his

17

testimony.

18

MR. KING:

It really does.

And

Your Honor, I think that the key

19

here is that if you would not look at the -- at any of

20

the qualities of the declarant in deciding whether the

21

statement is testimonial or not.

22

the Court makes the determination as to whether it is

23

testimonial or not, you wouldn't -- even if you would

24

like to ask those questions, you wouldn't have the

25

opportunity to ask those questions.

And so once -- once

In this case, factually, it might also be

2

that Mr. Caylor was on unpaid leave because he had run

3

out of his regular leave time, and he decided to do

4

that.

We -- it would all be speculation -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

I agree that whether it's

6

testimonial does not depend upon whether there's

7

skullduggery or not, but the possibility of

8

skullduggery, even in machine -- machine situations such

9

as this, is a good reason for saying this is

10

testimonial.
MR. KING:

11

Your Honor, I think that's why

12

it's -- it's important that this is a public records

13

case, because that is one of the assumptions that courts

14

have made for hundreds of years with regard to the fact

15

that there is -- there is a duty by the person who's

16

taking down the information to -- to observe in a

17

regular manner, to record in a regular manner, and so

18

that's important here.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

That was the principal

20

thrust of your brief, that this isn't testimonial at

21

all.

22

you recognize the certification is the same, but you're

23

trying to equate it to a business record, public record?

You have not said because it was unsworn, because

24

MR. KING:

Yes, Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You do have the hurdle

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that this record was created for a specific purpose.

2

was created to provide evidence for use in a criminal

3

prosecution.
MR. KING:

4

It

Your Honor, I don't believe that

5

that is the only purpose that this form 705 could be

6

used for.

7

it is a form that the lab uses in every circumstance.

8

And indeed, as I said, in New Mexico law, the defendant

9

can ask for a second test.

It is the common purpose for this form, but

They can have that done.

10

It's done at the State's expense.

11

at any laboratory that they want to.

12

They can have it done

But if they have the report done at the

13

State lab, and they're entitled to have that done, they

14

would utilize the same form.

Does the analyst

prosecution or the defendant?

20

MR. KING:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

I

21

-- I actually don't know the answer to that specifically

22

except that the form -- and if you look at it, it's in

23

the Joint Appendix -- does have some information in part

A that -- that indicates that there is a police officer

25

that -- that sent the test to the lab.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

Oh, so they would

know the difference, right?
MR. KING:

4

They -- I think that the same

information would be on the form whether the defendant

6

submitted it or whether the -- or whether the

7

prosecution submitted it, and -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

information.

Well, not the same

One would say the police submitted it and

10

the other one would say the defendant submitted it,

11

right?

12

MR. KING:

Your Honor -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So if the police submitted

14

it, the -- the person doing the -- the test would know

15

that the police submitted it, I assume.

16

MR. KING:

If you look at the form, Your

17

Honor, it would have the same information, but we're

18

not -- we're not here today arguing that the analyst

19

wouldn't know that the police submitted this form.

20

it is an arm's length request, and once again, the Court

21

addressed that in your most recent case, in Michigan v.

22

Bryant, I believe because the -- the question is whether

23

or not there was an interrogation.

24

questions is whether there was an interrogation.

25

I mean, if a -- if a witness, before

12

not been in response to an interrogation?

13

Your Honor, the analysis would be
That's the point, is that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It would be different

because interrogation doesn't make any difference.

17

is not the condition for the application of the -- of

18

the Confrontation Clause.

19

MR. KING:

That

Your Honor, we -- it appears that

20

it does make some difference with regard to Michigan v.

21

Bryant, and it's new to all of us.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it were an

23

interrogation, the factors mentioned in Michigan v.

24

Bryant would be relevant, presumably, but since this

25

wasn't an interrogation, I don't see how that has any -­
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

any relevance whatever.
MR. KING:

Well, the relevance, Your Honor,

3

I think, is since it's not an interrogation, then -­

4

then you have to look at, and I think the Court has set

5

this out, you have to look at the nature of the evidence

6

and to make a determination as to whether the evidence

7

that's being presented is merely a substitute for live,

8

in-court testimony.

9

And there, back to the difference between

10

the affidavit in Melendez-Diaz and the report in this

11

case is, in our report, even if Mr. Caylor had been at

12

the trial and on the stand, it would have been necessary

13

to have the report as well.

14

raised this point, is that six months after the

15

examination was done, to cross-examine the analyst and

16

ask him, do you remember what the result was six months

17

ago from this one test out of a hundred that he ran, he

18

will not remember without looking at the report.

19

report is the best evidence in this case to prove the

20

point that is being made here, and -­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think Justice Ginsburg

The

Well, he'd look at the

22

report and say, gee, I don't remember; you know, I do a

23

lot of these reports.

24

direct would say, well, how do you do them?

25

would say, I always do this, I always do that, I always

But then the prosecution in

And he

Did you do it in this case?

Well,

2

I don't specifically remember this case, but I always do

3

it.

4

It would be pretty persuasive.

5

remember.

And that's the testimony that would go to the jury.

MR. KING:

6

Not as good as if he did

That's correct, Your Honor, and

7

so that's why the analysis of whether this is

8

testimonial or not is such an important analysis,

9

because if the -- the reasoning that the Court has had

10

for all of the hearsay exceptions, for excited

11

utterances or, in this case, for a public record, would

12

look at whether or not that evidence was the best

13

evidence to support the truth-finding purpose of the

14

trial.

15

Your Honor.

16

That's our -- that's our analysis, at least,

And what we are arguing in this case is that

17

there is no difference between Mr. Caylor transferring

18

the .21 data from the machine to the piece of paper than

19

there would be if you took a photograph, for instance,

20

of the machine data and -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why did you give the

data to the analyst at trial?

If there wasn't a more

persuasive power in the lab certification, why didn't

you just have the new expert look at the printout from

25

the graph and say, this is what it says?

MR. KING:

Procedurally, in this case, Your

2

Honor, this -- the trial at the District Court level

3

occurred before the Court's opinion in Melendez-Diaz.

4

And so I think that at this point in time, that it would

5

be more normal behavior for the -- for the State to

6

present the raw data as well.

7

In this case, Mr. Razatos -­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

That's that as well.

Don't you introduce the lab report because it -- it

10

gives more credence to the reliability of the result?

Because he's certifying that he followed certain

procedures, that he did certain things, that the sample

wasn't tampered with?

MR. KING:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.

for that testimony, correct?

to that testimony to bolster the test?

MR. KING:

You're looking, at trial,

that we're talking about testimony here.

different from other cases where if you had a -- it was

necessary to submit the judgment of a felony, for

that the purpose test may not apply to these kinds of

cases where -- where there's not a police interrogation.

But if -- if that is the case and the

purpose test applies, then it -- it also appears to me

that the -- that the test now requires that -- that you

in New Mexico would be since -- since the court believed

would be cumulative evidence, and probably would be kept

out by -- by the rule in New Mexico in that case.

at this trial.

MR. KING:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, in -- in

4

your hypothetical, if -- if the State knew far enough

5

ahead of time that they -- they would not be able to

6

submit the -- the -- that analyst's results, they could

7

always -- because the blood sample continues to exist,

8

they could always retest that and -- and have another

9

witness who could do that.

Depending on how the Court

10

rules in this case, it might be that States will be

11

required to do that.

12

But at this point in time under -- under the

13

current jurisprudence, it -- it didn't appear to the

14

State that they needed to retest the sample, and I think

15

you have to worry a little bit about -- about how many

16

people you might indeed have to have come into court and

17

testify if -- if the State -- if the burden on the State

18

is that you have to -- you have to sample twice just in

19

case you're going to lose one of your analysts, I -- I

20

think that that does indeed put a great burden on the

21

State to do that.

22

And so -­

General, I -- I don't want

to eat up your -- your little remaining time, I think

MR. KING:

No, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. KING:

Why?

I think that you have to do the

4

analysis in each kind of statement that you're looking

5

at, Your Honor, to determine whether or not the

6

statement that's -- that's being made and that's being

7

proposed for trial is a substitute for live in-court

8

testimony.

9

you would be looking at a little bit different set of

10

And so, with regard to ballistics, you know,

facts.

11

But in this case the facts are that -- that

12

the gas chromatograph gave us a printout that said that

13

the -- that the level of alcohol in the blood is .21

14

grams per 100 milliliters, Mr. Caylor transferred that

15

to a form, and that's what we are putting in.
I -- I think that -- that it proves the

16
17

point that I'm talking about, in a ballistics analysis,

18

you would have to have some analysis and someone to

19

reach a conclusion.

20

Melendez-Diaz apart from this case, is -- is that there

21

was -- that there was some analysis by -- by -- by

22

the -- the declarant in that case.

23

ballistics cases I think, most often, you would find

24

that.

25

And it's that that sets

And in the

Now, if the -- if in the ballistics case you

just took a photograph of the bullet and wanted to bring

2

that into the court and say here's what the bullet looks

3

like, the jury then could make a determination whether

4

they think that that bullet appears to be the same as

5

the other.

That wouldn't be covered by the

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. KING:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Certainly not.

And -- and -­
But you -- you -- you think

10

the result would be a -- the same if we could develop a

11

machine that you put the bullet in and -- and -- and -­

12

that's been fired from this gun, and the murder bullet,

13

and the machine goes, blah, blah, blah, and it spits

14

out, you know, 99 percent, 99.9 percent match, that

15

would be okay?
MR. KING:

16
17

May I answer the question, Your

Honor?

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MR. KING:

Sure.

In -- in that case, if -- if the

20

machine were able to do all of that, the machine

21

essentially is giving you the best evidence, yes, I

22

believe that that would be the case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

2
3

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

Let me try to make

four quick points.
First, Justice Alito, I said the first

4
5

objection was at JA 40, it's actually 44-45 in the Joint

6

Appendix.

7

With regard to the State's argument about

8

whether this document is testimonial, I would simply

9

urge the Court to take a very close look at the lab

10

report itself.

11

Mr. Chief Justice, in response to your question,

12

arresting officer identification, and the officer

13

writes, check for blood alcohol concentration.

14

the order to the lab.

15

It's at JA 62.

At the top it says,

That's

If you look at the bottom in the

16

certification of analyst, he certifies that the

17

following is true and correct, signs his name, and

18

perhaps the most critical thing is at the very bottom,

19

the actual rules of the New Mexico evidence law and

20

criminal procedure law are referenced.

21

like Melendez-Diaz.

22

expressly prepared for substitute live testimony.

This is a document that is

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

that's the only difference?

25

So, it's exactly

MR. FISHER:

Not under oath, though,

Not under oath if a
58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certification is actually different than an oath, that

2

just makes this worse, as in Crawford this Court said

3

that it would be implausible that trial by affidavit

4

would be prohibited but trial by unsworn affidavit would

5

be okay.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

Do the rules of

7

criminal -- do the rules of criminal procedure in New

8

Mexico say it should be prima facie evidence?
MR. FISHER:

9

They say much the same thing.

10

There are -- there are several rules referenced at the

11

bottom that all make this automatically admissible,

12

notwithstanding the hearsay rule to prove the truth of

13

the matter asserted.
With respect to Justice Ginsburg's question

14
15

about retesting, you are exactly right.

16

many choices in the case -- in this case about how to

17

proceed.

18

witness, all it had to do was have him do a -- retest it

19

and write a new report and have him be the witness.

20

There is no reason it would have to introduce

Mr. Caylor's report then and come up against any State

law issue.

The State had

I mean, you have the right

59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to look at their evidence presumably so -- so far in

2

advance of trial, whatever, and if they had to get a

3

new -- new technician, that would have to put off the

4

trial -­
MR. FISHER:

5

And I think that -- I'm sorry.

6

I think that goes to my last point, which is, Justice

7

Breyer, you're talking about States that do this -- I'll

8

combine my answer to these two things.

9

would have been perfectly -- perfectly appropriate if

A continuance

10

that scenario had arisen, Mr. Chief Justice, and that's
