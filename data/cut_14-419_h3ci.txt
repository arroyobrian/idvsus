 Mr. Srebnick.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF HOWARD SREBNICK

7

10

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 MR. SREBNICK: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
 The Sixth Amendment has always recognized

11

the individual's right to spend his own money to obtain

12

the advice and assistance of counsel.  At the time of

13

the adoption of the Bill of Rights, that was the core

14

right, a time when the right to appointed counsel had

15

not yet been established by this Court.

16

 We submit that the right to representation

17

by private counsel must allow a defendant to use assets

18

which she rightfully owns, assets over which there is no

19

dispute that she has good title, so that she may be

20

represented by the lawyer that she prefers.

21
22
23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What do you do about

Monsanto?
 MR. SREBNICK: 

In Monsanto and in Caplin &

24

Drysdale, those were cases involving tainted funds, drug

25

money.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right.  So what is

2

the logic that says it doesn't violate the Sixth

3

Amendment if it's tainted funds, but it does if it's

4

untainted funds?

5

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Mr. Chief Justice, the  the

6

logic is that no one has a rightful claim to drug money.

7

No one can claim a valid property right in drug

8

proceeds.  Ms. Luis is wanting to use assets that are

9

not drug money.  They are her lawful assets.  They are

10
11
12
13

not connected to any crime at all.
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But, Mr. Srebnick, I mean,

compare two situations.
 One is the one that Monsanto talked about

14

where, yeah, a bank robber goes in and he has a pile of

15

money now.  And Monsanto says, you know, even though he

16

wants to use that money to pay for an attorney, too bad.

17

 Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of

18

money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses

19

that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other

20

expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for

21

the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer.

22
23
24
25

 Why should the two cases be treated any
differently for Sixth Amendment purposes?
 MR. SREBNICK: 

Because no amount of

socalled dissipation, as the government would suggest,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

5
1

negates petitioner's lawful interest in the property she

2

owns apart from any alleged criminal activity.

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but is 

4

doesn't it make sense the  the sort of substitution

5

rule?  I mean, if you've got $10 million in drug

6

activity  money and you had $5 million, and you spent

7

$10 million, you can't say, you know, oh, I spent the

8

drug money, you can't touch the $5 million.  It seems to

9

me that's what the statute is doing when it says

10

whatever it's a reasonable substitute or assets

11

substituted for.

12

 MR. SREBNICK: 

And so, Mr. Chief Justice, of

13

course, if there is a conviction, if the defendant is

14

found guilty, after the conviction when punishment is

15

determined, there may well be the opportunity for the

16

government to seek punishment that includes the

17

financial penalties associated with the crime.  But

18

before that time, pretrial, when the defendant is the

19

exclusive owner of the untainted assets, there is no

20

principle of law that deprives her of the right.

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but I  I thought

22

the Chief Justice's question was slightly different.  I

23

don't know if you were privileged to hear the exciting

24

argument yesterday on tainted assets.

25

 (Laughter.)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

1

 MR. SREBNICK: 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I was.
But, you know, there

3

are degree  there are degrees of taint.  Can you 

4

can you follow  can you follow the assets?  So just to

5

say "tainted" or "untainted," it's a  it's a more

6

difficult question than that.

7

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Well, in this case, it's a

8

simple answer, because here we have a stipulation, Joint

9

Appendix 161, that the assets that are the subject of

10

the dispute here today are assets that are undisputedly

11

untainted, not traceable to the crime.  They include,

12

for example, family jewelry, not traced to any criminal

13

activity.  They include real estate that was acquired

14

before the allegations of the conspiracy.

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me go back to

16

Justice  Justice Kagan's question and ask it in  in

17

a different way.

18

 So you  we have two brothers and  twin

19

brothers, and they rob a bank.  They get $10,000.  They

20

split it up, $5,000 each.  And on that very same day, it

21

happens to be their birthday, and their rich uncle comes

22

and gives each of them $5,000 as a birthday present.  So

23

they go out to party, and one of them  and they both

24

spend $5,000 partying.  One of them spends the money

25

from the bank robbery.  The other one spends the money

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

7
1

that was given to them by their rich uncle.  And your

2

position is that the one who spent the money from the

3

socalled "tainted assets," the money from the bank

4

robbery, is entitled to use the remaining $5,000 to hire

5

an attorney, but the other one is out of luck?

6

 MR. SREBNICK: 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What sense does that make?

8

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Because the property interest

9

Yes, because the 

a defendant has in an inheritance or in a gift, those

10

property rights are not negated simply because the

11

defendant has allegedly committed a crime, simply

12

because there's probable cause.

13
14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

this Court to say spend the bank robbery money first.

15

 (Laughter.)

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17
18

So the law  you want

That's  that's your

position?
 MR. SREBNICK: 

Well, the  the government

19

is concerned about what we would  have described as

20

the socalled wily criminal.  The defendant who spends

21

the money, the tainted assets, faces perhaps even more

22

punishment at the end of the day or at the end of the

23

conviction, either through money laundering charges or

24

otherwise.

25

 So the Court, keeping in mind that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

8
1

forfeiture has as its primary component punishment,

2

there are ways of disincentivizing these kinds of

3

financial transactions that, Justice Kennedy, you're

4

referring to.  But it doesn't affect the defendant's

5

property interest in assets that are wholly apart from

6

any criminal activity.

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How do  I  I

8

don't know how these things actually work.  I mean, the

9

defendant obviously has daily expenses, and  and that

10

the government's freeze order apparently goes beyond the

11

money she has.  What, does she get an allowance or  or

12

something?

13
14
15

 MR. SREBNICK: 

As of now she gets nothing,

Mr. Chief Justice.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so if her 

16

putting aside lawyers, if her daughter's tuition bill

17

comes due, she can't pay that?

18
19

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Under the current restraining

order, she can do nothing.

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

pay the rent or the mortgage?

22

 MR. SREBNICK: 

But she can surely

Under the current restraining

23

order, she can do nothing.  The statute, as it's being

24

construed by the district court, allows no exception.

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I have the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

9
1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it your position the

2

government could give payment for the tuition but not

3

for the counsel?

4

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Our position is that there's

5

a constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to

6

retain counsel.

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So the answer is you

8

can  the government can stop the tuition payment but

9

not the payment to counsel?

10

 MR. SREBNICK: 

I would think so, in those

11

kind of instances.  There may be other cases, I concede,

12

if it's lifeordeath matters, lifeordeath

13

expenditures, a different defendant might come before

14

the Court and say there's a strong compelling need for

15

that money for other reasons.  But if it's ordinary,

16

routine expenses, our claim today doesn't reach that.

17

Our claim reaches Sixth Amendment issues.

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you really don't have

19

a statutory argument.  You're making a Sixth Amendment

20

argument because if it were a statutory argument, it

21

would be you can  you can restrain  you can't

22

restrain untainted assets.

23

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Justice Sotomayor, the

24

statute, 18 U.S.C. 1345, which is different than the

25

drug forfeiture statute, 18 U.S.C. 1345, it's at the

blue brief at page 2 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I guess I'm  I

3

understand what you're going to say because I read your

4

brief.

5

 MR. SREBNICK: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Okay.
But the logic of your

7

argument would suggest that you can't freeze untainted

8

assets for anything, because you're saying the

9

government has no property right to it.  It's untainted.

10

It's your money; it's not their money until they secure

11

a judgment.  And so the logic of your position would be,

12

I think, they can't restrain untainted assets, period,

13

constitutionally or statutorily.

14
15
16

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Well, we do not go that far

in our 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I know you don't because

17

it's very nice that you limit it.  But once we announce

18

a rule, we have to carry it to its logical conclusion.

19

And if the rule is it's untainted assets and it belongs

20

to me, how do we then limit it?

21

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Well, I suppose that if

22

there's no Sixth Amendment right at stake, if there's no

23

constitutional right to use the asset today, I don't

24

know of any prohibition, provided that there's due

25

process, that would prevent the Court from restraining

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

11
1
2

assets proposed to be used for other purposes.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you said that this 

3

this is her property.  If it's tainted, you say she

4

doesn't own it, it's not her money.  But if it's

5

untainted, it is her money.  So I think

6

Justice Sotomayor has asked a fair question.

7

 Isn't the logic of your position that the

8

untainted assets can be used without restraint for

9

whatever she wants to use it for?

10

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Justice Ginsburg, from a

11

constitutional perspective, I don't think that that's

12

necessarily correct because the courts can give

13

injunctive power to restrain assets, even assets

14

currently belonging to the defendant.  Our objection is

15

when such an injunction interferes with the

16

constitutionally protected right to retain counsel of

17

choice.

18

 And so while the statute could

19

constitutionally allow, provided that there is adequate

20

hearings, et cetera, the restraint of even a defendant's

21

owned assets, lawfully owned assets, that principle

22

can't extend to assets  the subset of assets she needs

23

to use counsel of choice.

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What if  what if the

woman is a devout Muslim and she  she makes a  an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

12
1

annual trip to Mecca every year?  Wouldn't she have a

2

constitutional right to use the money for that?

3

 MR. SREBNICK: 

So certainly she would have a

4

constitutional right.  And whether she could then obtain

5

the assets free from the injunction immediately would

6

raise a separate First Amendment question.

7

 The Sixth Amendment, because the deprivation

8

will be permanent, meaning, we need those assets now

9

before the trial, and the immediacy of the need for

10
11

those assets 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, she has an immediate

12

need to go to Mecca.  I mean, if she doesn't get it now,

13

she's not going to be able to fulfill what she regards

14

as a religious obligation.  I don't know how you can

15

limit your  your principle to the Sixth Amendment.

16

 MR. SREBNICK: 

The Sixth Amendment is

17

important in the context of the adversarial proceeding

18

that will determine the ultimate ownership of those

19

assets at the end of the day.  And so unlike the First

20

Amendment, unlike any other amendment, the Sixth

21

Amendment is a guarantee that the defendant will be

22

represented at the proceeding where that property and

23

her liberty are at stake.  And with regard to the

24

travels to Mecca, those travels, while significant under

25

the First Amendment, don't bear on the ultimate outcome

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

13
1
2

of the criminal case.
 And so because the need for assets that we

3

are requesting limited to that amount needed to retain

4

counsel of choice, limited to the amount needed to mount

5

a legal defense to the very charge that threatens her

6

property rights and her liberty upon conviction, there

7

needs to be an accommodation so that she can use enough

8

assets, controlled by the Court, of course 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Srebnick, this goes

10

back, I think, to the Chief Justice's first question.

11

It seems that the distinction that you're making is one

12

that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto.  In

13

other words, the Court said the Sixth Amendment here is

14

the exact same thing as the First Amendment.  It even

15

used that example that Justice Scalia gave, or that

16

general example.

17

 And  and so it goes back to the

18

Chief Justice's question in  in the sense of there's a

19

very powerful intuition behind your argument, but it's a

20

powerful intuition that was explicitly rejected by us.

21

And  and this case doesn't seem to present any

22

different circumstances than that one.

23

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Justice Kagan, I  I think

24

the circumstances are quite different because of the

25

tainted property that was at issue in Monsanto.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

14
1

 First, we know it was drug money in

2

Monsanto.  It had been established by clear and

3

convincing evidence.  In our case, it's totally

4

untainted assets.

5

 Second, the Court recognized that a

6

defendant doesn't have a lawful property interest in

7

drug money.  No different than a bank robber does not

8

have a lawful interest in the bank loot.

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yeah, but your  your

10

earlier argument was you have a constitutional right to

11

establish that it isn't drug money.  That was your whole

12

answer to Justice Scalia.

13

 MR. SREBNICK: 

14
15
16
17

In this case there's no

dispute that the money is untainted.  And I'm not 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I'm talking about the rule

that you're proposing.
 MR. SREBNICK: 

The rule I proposed,

18

consistent with the Court's observation in Kaley, there

19

are two elements to establish forfeitability; one, that

20

there's a crime committed, and second, traceability from

21

the majority opinion in Kaley.

22

 Here we have undisputedly untainted assets,

23

not traceable to a crime.  In Monsanto, the assets were

24

drug money.  And a defendant doesn't have the right to

25

use drug money to represent  to be represented by the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

15
1
2
3
4

counsel of his choice.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I guess you're  I

think this may be Justice Sotomayor's point.
 Your argument, you're distinguishing tainted

5

and untainted assets, and I understand that.  I just

6

don't understand that if you can freeze the assets

7

despite the Sixth Amendment when they're tainted, I

8

don't understand why it's not the same rule when they're

9

untainted.

10

 You may have  may have statutory

11

arguments, you  but if you have arguments, it has

12

nothing to do with the constitutional right to counsel.

13

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

14

has everything to do with the Sixth Amendment because,

15

at its inception, the Sixth Amendment only encompassed

16

the right to spend one  one's own money to be

17

represented by counsel.  There was no right to the

18

appointment of counsel.

19

 So taking away the defendant's lawfully held

20

assets, whether it be their pension funds, whether it be

21

an inheritance, whether it be their lawfully earned

22

labors, to take that away at the inception of this

23

nation would have meant the defendant would have been

24

left with no counsel at all since the notion of an

25

appointed lawyer is really a notion of more recent

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

16
1

vintage, in the 20th century.

2

 So indeed, to take away the property rights,

3

pretrial, of a defendant, at the time when he or she is

4

under indictment, needs those assets to retain counsel,

5

any private counsel  so we're not talking in this case

6

about a particular 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, what if  what if

8

the prosecution brings a case for crime X and wins that

9

case, and it imposes a fine that takes away all of the

10

defendant's assets, and then the prosecution brings

11

another case for crime Y, would you be arguing that the

12

fine had to make an exception for the defense of

13

crime Y?

14

 MR. SREBNICK: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. SREBNICK: 

No, Justice Scalia.
What's the difference?
There's a judgment.  Upon

17

judgment, a defendant can lose his right to property

18

upon execution of that judgment.  So the government

19

could execute on that criminal judgment and take as much

20

of the defendant's assets needed to satisfy the fine.

21

 Our objection is to the government doing it

22

before conviction, before there's been any judgment.

23

Locking down somebody's assets at the very moment when

24

he or she needs those assets to exercise the right to

25

counsel.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

17
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The Sixth Amendment only 

2

only protects your money up until the point where

3

there's a judgment?

4

 MR. SREBNICK: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

6

 MR. SREBNICK: 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

10

But in  in this case,

there was a finding of probable cause.

7

9

Yes.

Yes.
So you want us to make a

distinction between probable cause and a judgment?
 MR. SREBNICK: 

Yes.  Every case, every

11

indictment brings with it a finding of probable cause.

12

It's  the two rights have to coexist.  The right to be

13

represented by counsel of choice under the Sixth

14

Amendment has to coexist with the indictment, because

15

under Patterson v. Illinois, the right under the Sixth

16

Amendment is triggered by the indictment.  It's

17

triggered by the finding of probable cause.

18

 To then say that probable cause destroys the

19

right to the Sixth Amendment is to then say that they

20

don't coexist.  But, of course, they do, because the

21

Sixth Amendment was established in 1791, and it's part

22

of our fabric.

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I might just be repeating

24

myself, but  but I thought that, again, that

25

distinction was the one specifically rejected in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

18
1

Monsanto.  I mean, Monsanto could have said Caplin &

2

Drysdale is different because it's postconviction.  But

3

Monsanto refused to say that.  Monsanto said the same

4

rule that applies postconviction ought to apply upon a

5

finding of probable cause.

6

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Yes, Justice Kagan, but

7

probable cause to believe the assets are tainted.

8

Probable cause to believe that the drug money is not the

9

defendant's to spend.  Not probable  there's no

10

probable cause here as to these assets that Ms. Luis

11

proposes to use to retain counsel of choice.

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The problem with this

13

argument is that as a matter of economics and  and

14

common sense, money is fungible.  To say if the  if

15

the socalled tainted money has been spent, and what's

16

left is the untainted money, it doesn't make a

17

difference which  you know, which pot has been spent

18

and which pot hasn't been spent.

19

 MR. SREBNICK: 

Respectfully, Justice Alito,

20

it makes a major difference.  Our property laws, while

21

money in some instances is fungible when they're

22

commingled, if there is segregated property, when

23

creditors try to levy against property that's not part

24

of a secured interest, the law treats it very

25

differently.

Well, yes, but then

4

 I mean, let's  suppose you have 

5

and none of that necessarily applies here.  Suppose you

6

have the situation where what's at stake is money that's

7

going to be used for restitution, all right?  So at the

8

beginning of the case, the question is whether the

9

defendant can spend that money to hire the attorney of

10

the defendant's choice, which is certainly a very

11

powerful interest, or whether that money, at the end of

12

the case if there is a conviction, is going to go to the

13

victims.

14
15
16

 So how do you  how do you try to
accommodate those two interests?
 MR. SREBNICK: 

Well, to provide a

17

restitution exception would just swallow the entire

18

Sixth Amendment out of the Constitution for the

19

following reason.  In most cases, a victim has sustained

20

an injury.  It might be property damage.  It might be

21

personal injury.  And if, for example, to use a

22

hypothetical, if someone were to steal the Mona Lisa, or

23

allegedly steal the Mona Lisa but the Mona Lisa isn't

24

found, there's no principle this Court has ever 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So your answer is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

20
1

defendant's right to hire counsel of choice takes

2

precedence over the rights of the victims, and you would

3

say that no matter how strong the proof is?

4

 MR. SREBNICK: 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

6
7

Yes.
Until there's  until there

is a verdict?
 MR. SREBNICK: 

As long as the assets that

8

the defendant proposes to use are her lawful assets,

9

untainted, not connected to the crime, not traceable to

10
11

any criminal activity, yes, because 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That seems to me not a

12

very  I don't know  not a very persuasive line.

13

You're relying on property law.  What you're saying is

14

the government can take away all your money if it's

15

tainted, if there is probable cause to believe that it's

16

tainted, right?  It can take away all of your money if

17

there is a judgment.  But it can't take away all of your

18

money if there's simply probable cause to believe that

19

you're going to owe this money.

20

 MR. SREBNICK: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.
Your crime.  That seems to

22

me a very  I don't know, not  not  an evanescent

23

line.  I  I don't know why the Sixth Amendment case

24

is  the property case is  is stronger in one

25

situation than the other, but I'm not sure that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

21
1
2

Sixth Amendment case is any stronger.
 MR. SREBNICK: 

What  what the statute is

3

purporting to do is give the government a prejudgment

4

attachment on the defendant's assets based on a

5

projected judgment.

6
7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
property law.

8

 MR. SREBNICK: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10
11

That's right.  It's

And the Sixth Amendment 
You're complaining about

property law, not the Sixth Amendment.
 MR. SREBNICK: 

Well, I'm complaining that

12

the Sixth Amendment, because at its root contemplated

13

the use of property to retain counsel, the two in some

14

degree are interrelated, of course, because without

15

money 220 years ago or so, you couldn't hire a lawyer,

16

and none would be appointed for you.

17

 So while the Court has accommodated the

18

indigent by providing them with appointed counsel, that

19

is not a license for the government to render people who

20

are not indigent, indigent.  It's not a license to

21

impoverish them by virtue of the accusation alone.  That

22

would simply write out the Sixth Amendment from the

23

Constitution.

24

 In every single case where there is a victim

25

who claims injury, every single one, the government has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

22
1

by definition probable cause because the indictment is

2

based on probable cause.  And it's not subject to

3

challenge under the Kaley opinion.  And so if we are

4

going to say that merely being accused in this country

5

because a grand jury has found probable cause is now

6

sufficient to lock down all of your assets, assets you

7

have owned for decades, perhaps, because at some future

8

time maybe a jury will convict and maybe a judge will

9

enter a judgment, and then maybe the court will then

10

have to enforce that judgment, really is to write out

11

the Sixth Amendment.

12

 And there are ways  if the point of a

13

criminal case is to inflict punishment on a defendant,

14

there are ways other than financial means to do so.  Of

15

course, incarceration is the number one form of

16

punishment.

17

 And while the needs of the victims are

18

certainly important, what we're asking here is to

19

accommodate both.  We're not asking that all the funds

20

be released, only so much as are necessary so that the

21

accused can be represented by private counsel.

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I know this is not part

23

of the question asked, but I know that it  it's

24

suggested in the fringes of the briefs.  How does the

25

district court ensure that she doesn't use every penny

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

23
1

for defense costs when the district court thinks that

2

that's not reasonable, for example?

3

 MR. SREBNICK: 

I don't think there's an

4

issue, particularly in this case with that issue,

5

because the court which now has control over the assets

6

would manage the disbursement of funds for counsel, and

7

the bar rules would apply.  Just as with a CJAappointed

8

lawyer, Criminal Justice Act appointed lawyer, goes to

9

the court, here are my hours.  Here's what I need for

10

investigation.  Here's what I need for support services

11

for discovery.  That would be managed by the district

12

court.

13
14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But you're not 

you're not looking for CJA rates, are you?

15

 MR. SREBNICK: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

17

 (Laughter.)

18

 MR. SREBNICK: 

No, we're not, Justice.
I didn't think so.

And  and so given the

19

ability of our district courts to manage those issues,

20

the only standard we would ask for, that they be

21

reasonable and bona fide, and the bar rules govern that.

22

 I should add that while we are having a 

23

an academic discussion here, it didn't seem to be such a

24

controversial proposition to the government when in

25

Caplin & Drysdale in their brief, they wrote the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

24
1

following:  "The Constitution requires that a court

2

afford a defendant a fair opportunity to secure counsel

3

of choice using whatever assets he has at his lawful

4

disposal."

5
6
7

 That's the brief of Caplin & Drysdale by the
Solicitor General at page 42.
 And so when the Solicitor General's office

8

argued this case in Caplin & Drysdale 25 years ago, they

9

came to the Court and said there was a difference

10

between tainted and untainted assets.  And some 26 years

11

later, those are being conflated as if there is no

12

difference between the two.

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, we have a new

14

statute.  853 made a difference between  and still

15

does  between tainted and untainted.

16
17
18
19
20

 MR. SREBNICK: 

That is very true,

Justice Sotomayor.  And to the 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This section came later,

and it says substitute property.
 MR. SREBNICK: 

That is true.  So there is

21

a  a statute, the statute that's at issue in this

22

case, different from 853.  853 in most circuits does not

23

authorize the pretrial restraint of untainted assets.

24

So all the concerns about victims, all the concerns that

25

emanate from the questions that have been asked today,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

25
1

Congress struck that balance and did not allow for the

2

restraint of substitute assets, at least in most

3

circuits as it has been interpreted.  The Solicitor

4

General has a different view of the statute as it

5

expressed in the Fourth Circuit.

6

 But in all events, though the victims are

7

certainly to be accommodated, so, too, the rights of the

8

criminal defendant who needs to be represented by the

9

counsel of choice.

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But Congress seemed to

11

have singled out these banking frauds and healthcare

12

frauds for special treatment, so they're not governed by

13

the general forfeiture statute, which makes the

14

distinction between tainted and untainted.  They seem to

15

want to come down very hard on these two crimes.  So why

16

would we interpret  was it 1345?  as doing nothing,

17

as being controlled essentially by 853?

18

 MR. SREBNICK: 

So 1345, although it doesn't

19

use the word "forfeiture," it doesn't say what happens

20

to these assets.  It simply locks them down, so to

21

speak, until something happens.  It doesn't even talk

22

about a criminal case, but it is in the context of

23

Title 18.  And the one court  court  Fang case talks

24

about, there needs to be some sort of criminal procedure

25

that follows the lockdown.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

26
1

 And Justice Ginsburg, while Congress may

2

have given in this instance the ability of the

3

government to restrain assets of equivalent value,

4

notwithstanding our statutory interpretation argument,

5

it still needs to accommodate the rights of the criminal

6

accused.

7
8
9

 If I may reserve the balance of my time for
rebuttal.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, counsel.

 Mr. Dreeben.

11

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

12
13
14
15

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
 I think that the appropriate starting point

16

for this case is the last sentence of Monsanto, not

17

because Monsanto specifically addressed substitute

18

property, but because it adopted a principle that I

19

believes resolves this case.  And the last sentence of

20

Monsanto says, "If the government may, posttrial, forbid

21

the use of forfeited assets to pay an attorney, then

22

surely no constitutional violation occurs when after

23

probable cause is adequately established, the government

24

obtains an order barring a defendant from frustrating

25

that end by dissipating his assets prior to trial."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

27
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that was said

2

in the context of the government's submission that

3

there's a difference between tainted and untainted,

4

right?  Your  your argument in Monsanto focused on the

5

tainted aspects of the proceeds.

6

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, it did.  And that's why I

7

say that the principle that the court articulated in

8

that sentence is what decides this case.

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why is that the principle?

10

The principle  they're talking about money that

11

doesn't belong to the defendant.

12

 MR. DREEBEN: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well 
It belongs to Smith or

14

Jones of the bank.  Now, let's try that principle in a

15

case where it's the defendant's money.  The principle is

16

that the government, without proving that he's guilty of

17

any crime beyond a reasonable doubt, can take all his

18

money.  Oh, because he might be fined.

19

 I've never heard of such a principle,

20

frankly.  I've just never heard of it.  Now, if there is

21

some case that says 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Sixth Amendment or not.

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So  now I can imagine 

24

 MR. DREEBEN: 

25

Justice Breyer, let me try to

explain 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

28
1
2
3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I can go from there and

find interests on both sides, da, da, da.
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Breyer, I think that

4

it's important to start with, actually, the principle

5

that Monsanto adopted, not because it resolved the

6

factual circumstances here, but because it's talking

7

about the point in time after the government wins a

8

judgment.  And the principle is that if the government

9

will have a right to forfeit that property at the end 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

11

 MR. DREEBEN: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13
14

Yes.
 if it can show probable 
I  I understood that.  I

just wanted to try it with the facts here.
 I mean, the first principle is if, in fact,

15

the defendant has somebody else's money that he's taken

16

unlawfully, and he has to give it up at the end of the

17

trial, we can make him give it up at the beginning to

18

make sure it's there.

19

 Now let's try it with the facts here. 

If a

20

defendant has some money, which maybe he will have to

21

pay in a fine, what we'll do is we'll take all his money

22

away before he's been convicted beyond a reasonable

23

doubt.  Okay.  That's the difference in the

24

propositions.

25

 And I'm saying it's pretty hard for me to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

29
1

think in a country which says that before he's

2

convicted, you have to release him on bail except in

3

unusual circumstances, that nonetheless, you can take

4

all his money away so he can't hire a lawyer.

5

 I know that's a little simpleminded, but

6

nonetheless, that seems fairly basic.  I don't know

7

where it comes from.

8
9

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So Justice Breyer, I think

that the  the embedded premise there is that people

10

will not suffer restraints on their liberty or property

11

before they have been convicted beyond a reasonable

12

doubt.

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's correct.  That is

14

the principle, and now we make a number of exceptions.

15

And one exception is if you think he's going to  I

16

mean, I can think of exceptions where we do keep people

17

in jail.  That is, of course, right.  And  and here,

18

what they're saying, I think, in essence is, let's try

19

and think of an exception for this one.  Pretty hard.

20

And anyway, if there is one, what he wants to use the

21

money for is to make sure he has a lawyer.  It's called

22

the Sixth Amendment.

23

 All right. 

Now, there we are.  That's where

24

I  at this moment in my mind, that's where the case

25

is.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

30
1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

All right.  So can I try to

2

break that down a little bit?  Because I do think that

3

the principle in Monsanto is critical.  The principle in

4

Monsanto is that if the government will be able to

5

forfeit the property at the end of the day, it has an

6

interest in ensuring that it is available and not

7

dissipated.  It's the monetary equivalent of flight.

8

It's asset flight.

9

 And this statute, Section 1345, was

10

specifically designed, as Justice Ginsburg observed, for

11

crimes in the banking and in the healthcare context in

12

which money flows into accounts, money is fungible, very

13

difficult to 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think  I think that's

15

a  what you say is, look, this is equivalent to the

16

case where we keep the guy in jail because he might run

17

away.  That's your point.  That's not a bad point.  So I

18

have on that on one side, and I have on the other side

19

that he'd like to have a lawyer which is a Sixth

20

Amendment right.

21

 So I have a suggestion that I want you to

22

focus on.  The suggestion is  let's read this statute

23

in light of what you've said, that there is an interest

24

on your side and there is a constitutional amendment on

25

the other side.  Why can't we read this statute to say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

31
1
2

they accommodate those interests in this way?
 If they're going to run away from  with

3

the property, then the court has the authority to enjoin

4

the alienation or disposition of property, say tainted,

5

then you can ask for a restraining order to prohibit the

6

prohibition, not just of the tainted property but also

7

of property of equivalent value.

8
9

 If I read that without knowing the
background, I would say a lot of cases come up where you

10

get TROs, where they're not precise because you don't

11

know exactly what property you're talking about.  So

12

what do you think about reading this statute to avoid

13

the constitutional question to say the TRO means TRO?

14

 And a TRO means where there's some property

15

out there and it may be tainted, mixed up with the

16

untainted, you can get a TRO on the whole thing.  You

17

have to have a speedy hearing.  He has to be

18

represented.  And your purpose of that is to separate

19

the two kinds of assets.  That seems to me to work for

20

the purpose, and it also avoids the constitutional

21

question.

22
23
24
25

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So two things on that.  I hope

I get a chance to say both of them.
 First, I don't think that it is a serious
constitutional question in light of Monsanto, so I don't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

32
1

really think that there's a serious avoidance concern

2

here.  Monsanto basically said that if the government

3

has shown adequately that it will be able to forfeit the

4

money at the conclusion of the case, the Sixth Amendment

5

doesn't override the government's interests.

6

 After all, Justice Breyer, this is basically

7

a zerosum game.  Either there will be money available

8

at the end of the case for the victims or the money will

9

have been spent on lawyers.  And Congress made a

10

judgment that the government can't come in in every case

11

and simply restrain assets upon a showing of nothing.

12

But it does have a statute in a very specific area that

13

allows it to 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you really 
But what is it that

16

confines your  your rationale to a specific area?  It

17

seems to me that if the government prevails in this

18

case, every State in the union, every locality could say

19

that in the event of assault and battery, malicious 

20

malicious mischief, drunk  an accident caused by drunk

21

driving, any crime involving a bodily injury, that the

22

government is entitled to restrain disposition of assets

23

that might be used for medical care, for pain and

24

suffering.  And this would, in effect, prevent the

25

private bar from  from practicing law unless it did so

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

33
1
2

on a contingent basis.
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Justice Kennedy, it's correct

3

that our principle is not limited to the types of crimes

4

that are in this case.  It is limited to the government

5

making an adequate showing that at the conclusion of the

6

case, it will have the right to the money.

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but you're talking

about probable cause.  But  but there's 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Understood.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The government can often

11

show probable cause, and that's usually the basis for

12

the indictment.

13

 MR. DREEBEN: 

That's correct.  And, I 

14

again, I think that Monsanto resolved this question by

15

saying that if the government can take title to the

16

property at the conclusion of the case, it has an

17

interest in ensuring that it is available, and the Sixth

18

Amendment doesn't override it.

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Mr. Dreeben 
It takes the  it 

21

it establishes that right in the same way as the issue

22

here, without counsel on the part of the defendant,

23

because you  I assume Kaley applies to tainted assets

24

as well as untainted.

25

 MR. DREEBEN: 

That's correct.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

34
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So add to the

2

context of what Justice Breyer was concerned about.  You

3

not only can do that, you can do that without giving the

4

defendant any type of hearing, right?

5

 MR. DREEBEN: 

No, I think the defendant is

6

often entitled to a hearing.  The question is what

7

issues the defendant may raise at the hearing.  Here,

8

for example, there was clearly an issue of whether the

9

defendant was, in fact, dissipating assets.  And that

10
11

would have been something that the defendant 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I thought  I

12

thought under Kaley, the defendant didn't have to be

13

provided a  a hearing with respect to the pretrial 

14

 MR. DREEBEN: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

16
17

With 
 seizure of

assets.
 MR. DREEBEN: 

With respect to whether

18

there's probable cause to believe that the defendant

19

committed an offense.  That's what Kaley said is

20

controlled.

21
22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Kaley was a question of

tracing, because it was 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

It  it was,

Justice Sotomayor.  And that 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you don't have any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

35
1

tracing problem here.  As soon as he commits a crime

2

that you say was worth $45 million, you can freeze

3

$45 million worth of assets, correct?

4

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Although there were far fewer

5

here because most of them had been dissipated.  And I

6

think that the reason why 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I respect that, and 

8

but  but you agreed that these particular funds were

9

untainted.  I'm told by your adversary 

10

 MR. DREEBEN: 

We  we stipulated  it's

11

technical, but we  we stipulated that there may be

12

some unquantified amount of untainted assets in the

13

assets being restrained.  We did not know, and did not

14

attempt to figure out, and that would be an issue for a

15

later day if the Court said that that mattered.

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Dreeben, I think, you

17

know, in essence your argument goes like this:  You have

18

Monsanto, you combine Monsanto with a  a simple

19

factual acknowledgment that money is fungible, and it

20

gets you to a judgment in this case.  You win, the

21

petitioner loses.  And  and, you know, that's a fair,

22

strong argument, if  if one is comfortable with

23

Monsanto.

24
25

 I mean, there is  so I think I would just
ask you, I mean, suppose the Court is just uncomfortable

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

36
1

with the path we started down the road on in Monsanto?

2

And you might be right that it just doesn't make sense

3

to draw a line here, but it leaves you with a situation

4

in which more and more and more we're depriving people

5

of the ability to hire counsel of choice in complicated

6

cases.  And so what should we do with that intuition

7

that Monsanto sent us down the wrong path?

8
9

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I  I would hope that

the Court sees that even if there are some uncomfortable

10

aspects of Monsanto, it actually rests on a sound legal

11

judgment.  And I  I realize I have said this, but I

12

will keep coming back to this because I think it is the

13

touchstone for Monsanto.

14

 Caplin & Drysdale was a postjudgment case.

15

And it said once these funds are forfeitable, the

16

defendant, if he pays his lawyer with them, is paying

17

the lawyer with somebody else's money, namely, the

18

government.

19

 Then the question is, can the government do

20

anything to prevent dissipation of the assets before it

21

obtains the judgment?  And the Court said not

22

automatically, not as a general rule it can always come

23

in and say this is what we want, this is what we get.

24

But with an appropriate hearing, the balance of interest

25

does permit the government to preserve the equities.

 Now, this has an effect on counsel of

2

choice.  It has no effect on the ability of the

3

defendant to be represented by counsel.

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Counsel, how  I

5

don't know how these things work.  Let's say you get an

6

order freezing the assets, and it's $10 million, and 

7

and the defendant comes into the court, whatever, and

8

says, look, my lawyer is going to cost $100,000, one

9

percent of the assets that are at issue here.  Then you

10

would argue, no, even though it's only a tiny fraction

11

of what we're seizing, the Sixth Amendment doesn't even

12

entitle him to one percent of the assets that might 

13

might end up being forfeitable?

14
15
16

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes.  I don't think there's an

exception in the Sixth Amendment.
 Now, this is a statute in which the

17

government proceeded through seeking a civil injunction

18

and restraining order, and the district court does have

19

discretion.  It's not a flat rule that forbids the

20

district court from releasing funds for counsel.

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How does it work?

22

Like the  you know, the daughter's tuition bill comes

23

due, you know, and it's whoever  you know, who knows

24

how much these days, $60,000.  And the defendant cannot

25

pay that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

38
1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Not as a matter of right.  But

2

this is a civil statute in which the judge can exercise

3

equitable discretion.  And if the defendant comes in and

4

says 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, why was it 

6

why would it be  if he can exercise equitable

7

discretion for the daughter's tuition, why  why not

8

when the Sixth Amendment is at stake?  And, you know,

9

counsel of choice, it turns on that, it would seem to me

10

that if there's going to be a case in which equitable

11

discretion will be exercised, it ought to be in that

12

situation.

13

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I don't think

14

automatically so.  Here the judge said one consideration

15

is, will the defendant have representation in the 1345

16

proceeding itself?  The defendant did.  Mr. Srebnick

17

represented the defendant in that proceeding.  So the

18

court said, I don't need to worry about that.

19

 Then the court turned to the question of

20

whether the defendant needed counsel in the criminal

21

case and said, the defendant will be afforded counsel in

22

the criminal case, by appointment if necessary.

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you get back  you had

24

two responses to my reading of the statute.  I heard the

25

first, and I didn't hear the second.

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. DREEBEN: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

So this 
By the way, let me  let

me remind you

 MR. DREEBEN:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I remember exactly what 
But I want to say it,

6

because maybe you can focus on this.  We're in before

7

the judge on a TRO.  Our object of the TRO is to

8

separate the assets that are not this man's from the

9

assets that are this man's.  So we do that separation.

10

 Now we say $10,000 is not his, it's the

11

bank's.  $15,000 or $10,000 over here is totally his;

12

he's never been convicted of the crime.

 What's the government's interest? 

can't he take this other, once we've had the TRO

 MR. DREEBEN:

And why

 to separate it?
 I think I need to stop you

here because it's not a TRO.  The statute does not

 MR. DREEBEN:

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's correct.
 and my suggestion is we

23

read those words "restraining order" as "temporary

24

restraining order," which (3)(b), it seems to me,

25

clearly permits, but we can get into that argument.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

40
1

I'll worry about that later.

2

 MR. DREEBEN: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4

Well, I think that the 
I want to know what your

second response was to that.

5

 MR. DREEBEN: 

My second response is that

6

this a statute that contains two basic provisions.  I

7

think petitioner describes it accurately.

8
9
10

 Section (a) describes the things the
government can seek under the statute; Subsection (B)
describes the procedure that's used.

11

 Subsection (A) first allows the government

12

to get an injunction against fraud in (A)(1).  In (A)(2)

13

it allows it to restrain assets as the ultimate object

14

of the suit, not as a temporary interim measure.

15

 Temporary interim measures are described in

16

Subsection (B) where it specifically allows the Court to

17

impose various restraints until the Court has concluded

18

the proceeding.  So it addresses temporary relief in

19

(B).

20

 Subsection (A)(2) describes the things that

21

the government can seek as the ultimate object of the

22

case.  Injunction against the person who has the funds,

23

or a restraining order against any person to restrain

24

the funds that are derived from illegal activity, or

25

funds of equivalent value.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

41
1

 And just to make one final point on that,

2

the reason that makes sense in a banking context and in

3

a healthcare context is dollars are fungible, as

4

Justice Alito said earlier.  They will flow into an

5

account; they will flow out into other accounts.  It's

6

difficult to trace them.

7

 So Congress obviated the need to do that by

8

saying you can restrain the defendant, but we're not

9

going to rely only on restraining the defendant.  You

10

can also restrain the banks where the funds are.  And

11

you can restrain them not only in the amounts that

12

represent the tainted funds, but represent the monetary

13

equivalent of them.

14

 So in a sense 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

16
17

I don't  go ahead and

finish.
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I think, in a sense,

18

this statute negates the premise that there is a clean

19

line between tainted funds and untainted funds.  The

20

money is fungible once it's received by the defendant.

21

 There is Medicare fraud if the government

22

establishes probable cause, and its financial interest

23

is ensuring that it can have a judgment to make whole

24

the Medicare trust fund or other victims at the

25

conclusion of the case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

42
1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I'm  I'm troubled by this

2

statute.  I  I can't understand the difference between

3

(a) and (B).  I don't think  the issue was not raised

4

in the cert petition, and I don't know whether it can be

5

brought in with the Doctrine of Constitutional

6

Avoidance, because it really has nothing to do with the

7

Sixth Amendment.  This would apply regardless of whether

8

there's any Sixth Amendment issue in the case.

9

 But, having said that  Mr. Srebnick can

10

address those in rebuttal if he wishes to, but having

11

said that, if (B) does not refer to a temporary form of

12

relief, then  which I understand to be your

13

argument  then I don't understand what (a)

14

contributes.

15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So (a)(2) has two different

16

sections, and it describes what the government can seek

17

as the ultimate relief in the case.

18

 This started out as an antifraud injunction

19

statute.  Somebody is going around with the boiler room

20

operation or a Ponzi scheme; it takes a while to get the

21

evidence to indict.  The government can come in and seek

22

an injunction to prevent further fraud.

23

 Then Congress added (a)(2) on the theory

24

that there's something else the government needs to do,

25

ensure that money is available at the conclusion of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

43
1

whatever parallel criminal case or civil fraud case the

2

government brings.

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So what they can do is

4

this?  If we read this literally under (B), that

5

Mr. Smith is indicted for a banking law violation, he

6

has $100,000 of other people's money.  The government

7

can say that the order  the restraining order of the

8

Court prohibits his wife, any other client, the milk

9

man, anyone in the world, from taking, not the $100,000

10

that belongs to the bank, but any other $100,000 that he

11

got for any other purpose, I guess including his

12

retirement fund, including no matter what.

13

 I mean, that is  goes  it seems to me

14

that's what it says  any other person from taking

15

property of equivalent value, and he hasn't been

16

convicted of anything.

17

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, but it's  it's

18

referring, again, to a person who has  there is

19

probable cause to believe has obtained money as a result

20

of a criminal violation, and then it provides a

21

mechanism for restraining it.  It's not aimed at

22

restraining people who have nothing to do with the case,

23

unless they're holding the defendant's money.

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, this is  this is

innocent money, the defendant's, not the money he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

44
1

obtained as a result of the violation.  The money he

2

didn't obtain, that's what this case is about.

3

 MR. DREEBEN: 

The innocent money versus

4

tainted money all depends on a theory that they are

5

economically pure.  Now, the  the only argument that

6

Mr. Srebnick made to distinguish them, and I realize

7

there may be members of the Court who think this is not

8

a very good argument, and maybe the question is whether

9

Monsanto is at root problematic, but at least insofar as

10

that argument goes, it's based on a reading of the

11

relationbacked doctrine that's contrary to this Court's

12

cases.

13

 Monsanto itself made this very clear. 

It

14

said that the government can restrain money that will

15

become the government's property at the conclusion of

16

the case.

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Dreeben, you're

18

taking Monsanto out of context, because 853, by its

19

nature, was limited to tainted funds.  This is the first

20

statute if  that I know of that permits the government

21

to come in and take untainted funds.  The incidence of

22

the tainted funds concept was, you can't spend another

23

person's money.  You stole this money somehow, and you

24

can't spend that money because it belongs to someone

25

else.  It really doesn't belong to you.  But it's not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

45
1

until a judgment  and this is what your adversary is

2

trying to say  that the money that's untainted, the

3

money that  or the property that he bought before this

4

crime, this untainted property becomes yours.  It's not

5

until that moment, the judgment, that the property is

6

forfeitable.

7

 MR. DREEBEN: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10
11
12

That's true.
You can't forfeit it

beforehand.  The issue is 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

That's true for all  that's

true or all money, tainted and untainted.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, but  but still

13

the question becomes, is there a substantive difference,

14

and I think Justice Breyer is expressing  the problem

15

with this, as Justice Kagan said, this intuitive sense,

16

which is where do we draw this line?

17

 MR. DREEBEN: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

So 
Does the right to

counsel have any meaning anymore?

20

 MR. DREEBEN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think it does.
Frankly, I expect within

22

three to five years, if we rule in your favor, 853 will

23

be changed to have this same language.

24
25

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So 853, Justice Sotomayor,

does permit forfeiture of substitute property.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

46
1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, but not pretrial.
Not  not pretrial.  This

3

statute is different because it has a different function

4

and a different purpose.  But the basic concept of

5

forfeiture is punishing the defendant by taking money

6

through forfeiture that's equivalent to the tainted

7

property if the tainted property is gone.  That's the

8

policy behind it.  Now 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10

judgment.

11

 MR. DREEBEN: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13
14

But that's true of every

It is true 
Every judgment gives you

a right to substitute property of some sort.
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, but  but the point is

15

that the tainted property and the substitute property

16

are similarly situated at the end of the forfeiture

17

case.  The government has a property right in each of

18

them, but the  I don't think the property right is

19

really the essence of what's going on here.

20

 The fact that Section 853 permits pretrial

21

restraint of tainted property, but it doesn't reference

22

the subsection that deals with substitute property, is a

23

feature of that statute, but I think that has nothing to

24

do with the underlying point, which is that if the

25

government is going to be able to collect on its

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

47
1

forfeiture judgment, sometimes it will need to restrain

2

property.  Monsanto recognizes that, and I don't think

3

that saying that the defendant has a interest in paying

4

for counsel trumps the government's interest in being

5

made whole at the conclusion of the case.

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Dreeben 
When did the  when did

8

the  when was the first statute that allowed the

9

government to restrain the expenditure of tainted funds?

10
11

Does that go back a long time or 
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, the  the whole history

12

of in personam forfeiture was dormant until 1970, and

13

then Congress passed a statute that permitted this kind

14

of activity.  It improved the statute in 1984 to remedy

15

defects in the pretrial restraint of assets.

16

 So it was relatively recently developed,

17

targeting basically drug conspiracies and organized

18

criminal activity.

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And  and the first time

20

that Congress ever applied it to nontainted property

21

was what year?

22

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, the substitute assets

23

provision was added to the  the basic forfeiture

24

statute, and it was there at least by 1984.  I think

25

that it may have been earlier as well.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

48
1

 This provision is different, as Justice

2

Sotomayor pointed out, from the basic forfeiture statute

3

in permitting pretrial restraint of any assets, but I

4

think that it reflects the same basic underlying idea.

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And that 
And  but just  just to

7

be clear, so that I understood your earlier answer, the

8

consequence, the necessary consequence of your position

9

is that any State in the union can provide for

10

forfeiture or a freeze  a freeze of assets pending

11

trial in any assault and battery case, spousal abuse

12

case, criminal negligence, date rape cases in order to

13

make the victim whole, to pay for medical costs, to pay

14

for pain and suffering, and can freeze those assets even

15

if the consequences of that is that in most of those

16

cases most people cannot afford counsel.

17
18
19
20
21

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So if  if at the conclusion

of the case 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That's the consequence of

your argument?
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, I think that if there is

22

a  yes, if there is a monetary assessment that will

23

become provable at the conclusion of the case and the

24

government can show a need to preserve the assets so

25

that they're available.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

49
1

 I mean, think about the cases that you're

2

talking about, Justice Kennedy.  They are cases in which

3

victims have been harmed.  Serious medical costs may be

4

at issue.  If the funds are spent on an attorney, they

5

will not be available for compensation.

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, and they're

7

all cases in which the defendant has not been found

8

guilty.  And  and in all those cases, I mean, all you

9

have to do, all the governments have to do, all the

10

State governments have to do, is provide for a fine and

11

argue, then, well, unless we  if we don't freeze the

12

assets, there won't be money left to pay a fine.  So

13

this could apply  I guess this is the point.  This

14

could apply to every crime on the books.

15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So I  I do think the Court

16

could draw distinctions among the types of fines and the

17

purposes of the fines that are at issue.  So it's not 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Have you seen  have you

19

seen the judgments in the fraud on the market cases?  I

20

mean, it isn't too tough in cases involving fraud on the

21

market to find judgments of tens or hundreds of millions

22

of dollars, I mean, judgments in fines after

23

convictions, and that's what, I think, the question is.

24
25

 The principle of constitutional law that
you're advocating would, in fact, permit the freezing of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

50
1

what might be paid afterwards in a fine which could be a

2

huge amount before the person is convicted.  Am I right?

3

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So  well, I  I do think

4

that I was trying to say to the Chief Justice that there

5

could be distinctions that are drawn among various

6

monetary exactions.  I think the strongest case is when

7

victim compensation is at issue.  All the money in

8

the  the context of a Medicare fraud case like this,

9

although it's not required by statute, it will be

10

returned to the Medicare trust fund.  This is a fraud

11

against the people.  $45 million is obtained, we allege,

12

by fraud.  Most of

19

It goes to the

Yes.
Does that go to the

victims in case?
 MR. DREEBEN: 

Well, the Medicare trust fund,

23

which represents basically the fiscal interests of the

24

people of the United States is the victim.

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

I'm sorry?

Official  Subject to Final Review

51
1

 MR. DREEBEN: 

The Medicare trust fund, from

2

which the funds came that we say are obtained by fraud,

3

is the victim.  So the funds will be returned to the

4

victim.  That's the purpose of trying to freeze the

5

funds in a health care case, so that they can be

6

returned.

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Dreeben, you're

8

saying that your  your view, your interpretation, your

9

reading of the statute is the only tenable one, that if

10

one took the view that Justice Breyer's interpretation,

11

that restraining order means a temporary restraining

12

order, or it was another interpretation put forth in the

13

Americans for Forfeiture Reform brief, because if  if

14

a judge were to take the position that all of  all

15

three are plausible readings of the statute, but we'll

16

pick the one that allows the defendant to have counsel.

17

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So Justice Ginsburg, we don't

18

think that any of the alternative readings are

19

plausible.  For the reasons that I explained to Justice

20

Breyer, this statute doesn't limit the restraining order

21

to temporary relief, nor would it make any logical sense

22

to do that because the purpose of this statute was to

23

preserve funds so that they would be available at the

24

conclusion of the case.

25

 I also think that the amicus argument is not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

52
1

a tenable one because it simply reads "or equivalent

2

value" out of the statute and without any reference to

3

the context of the statute, which is to try to make the

4

government be able to be made whole at the conclusion of

5

a case if, in fact, it obtains a judgment given the very

6

difficult process of segregating out money in banking

7

and financialtype crimes.

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

Mr. Dreeben, if I could go

back to Justice Alito's questions about your

10

interpretation of the statute, I think what Justice

11

Alito was suggesting was that (a)(2)(A) would be

12

completely subsumed by (a)(2)(B) on your interpretation,

13

and I don't think that you got around to answering that

14

question.

15

 MR. DREEBEN: 

So I  I think that that 

16

that is true.  I think this Court understands, from

17

arguments last week, that superfluity is no stranger to

18

congressional statutes.  They do have a different focus,

19

though, and I think it was quite reasonable for Congress

20

to make clear what that focus is.  2(A) is aimed at the

21

person who's doing the dissipating themselves, the

22

person who obtained the property by fraud, and (B)

23

expands that out.

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but in  in just saying

that, you're essentially saying, yes, (B) expands it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

53
1

out, meaning it covers everything that (A) covers and

2

some more.

3

 MR. DREEBEN: 

Yes, but the  it's not that

4

this is a statute that anyone's reading gives off

5

provisions of fact because the (b) section, 1345(b)

6

permits restraining orders or prohibitions during the

7

course of the case as are needed to protect the

8

United States against the substantial injury.  So that

9

provision would subsume the  the reading that my

10
11
12

friend gives.
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you think that there's

any 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Go ahead.

Do you think that there's

15

any way to read this statute such that it applies to

16

people who wish to retain counsel as opposed to make

17

other expenditures?

18

 MR. DREEBEN: 

19
20

No, I don't think there's any

reading of the statute that exempts counsel.
 It does give discretion to the district

21

court to entertain arguments.  Those arguments were made

22

here and rejected.

7

untainted assets.  And that was a line  while the

8

defense bar had its druthers, was a line that was

9

accepted by the Court.  The government proposes now to

10

move that line and essentially make the line disappear

11

altogether.

12

 Justice Alito 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I don't want to use up your

14

rebuttal time, but I do want to ask you two quick

15

questions about the statute.

16

 First is: 

Did you raise anything about this

17

in your cert petition?  And the second is:  Is there a

18

way to limit this to the Sixth Amendment context?

19

 MR. SREBNICK: 

The answer to the first

20

question is no.  In our cert petition, since we were

21

constrained in the Eleventh Circuit by the

22

interpretation that had been given back in 1999, we

23

focused on the constitutional issue in order to suggest

24

to the Court that the doctrine of constitutional

25

avoidance should be triggered because there's a Sixth

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

55
1
2

Amendment problem.
 The Eleventh Circuit has concluded that the

3

statute is ambiguous.

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You didn't say anything

5

about constitutional avoidance in your cert position,

6

did you?

7

 MR. SREBNICK: 

That is correct.  We argued

8

that the Constitution would be violated, and because

9

this Court, in its discretion and indeed in the Rumsfeld

10

vs. FAIR case, looks at a statute even if the

11

interpretation is offered at the merit stage by an

12

amicus, the Court has considered those competing

13

interpretations in order to avoid the constitutional

14

issue.

15

 Justice Scalia, in response to your question

16

about property, it sure sounded to anyone who heard the

17

argument and read the opinions in Monsanto and Caplin &

18

Drysdale that it was much about property.  The

19

government, by invoking the taint theory, which does

20

date back to the founding of our nation, taints a

21

particular subject, and that is the tainted asset.

22

That's why it's called the taint theory.  It's

23

counterintuitive to suggest that untainted assets should

24

be treated as tainted assets.

25

 And because, as I used the word earlier,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

56
1

there must be a coexistence between the taint theory and

2

the right to counsel of choice, Monsanto drew the line,

3

Caplin & Drysdale drew the line and said if the

4

government can establish that the asset is tainted, it

5

can be frozen.

6

 Nothing about Monsanto, nothing about Caplin

7

& Drysdale, suggested that assets over which the

8

government has no present property interest, no

9

relationbacked theory, no taint theory to speak of, can

10

then take Aunt Sally's money or a client's pension funds

11

needed to  for representation to use those assets to

12

retain counsel.  Nothing in this Court's precedent in

13

those cases suggests that.

14

 And naturally, as a member of the defense

15

bar, we would welcome a revisiting of Monsanto and

16

Caplin & Drysdale because the parade of horribles is

17

here today.  The government says quite candidly there is

18

no line.  If the fine is $1 million, the defendant has

19

to pony up, ante up $1 million up front in order to

20

exercise his right to counsel.  The right to counsel of

21

choice will have a price tag.  And it is whatever the

22

government says the maximum fine is.  Whatever the

23

maximum restitution is, that will be the price that the

24

defendant must pay in advance.  It's an advance fee that

25

the defendant must pay according to the government in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

57
1

order to be able to exercise his Sixth Amendment rights.

2

We ask the Court to reject such an interpretation.
