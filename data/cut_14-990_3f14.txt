 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 14990, Shapiro v. McManus.
 Mr. Kimberly.
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
 Section 2284(a) states in plain terms that a

11

district court of three judges shall be convened when an

12

action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the

13

apportionment of congressional districts.

14

Section 2284(b) lays out the procedure for calling a

15

threejudge court when the circumstances identified in

16

2284 are satisfied.

17

 It  it reads, quote, "Upon the filing of a

18

request for three judges, the judge to whom the request

19

is presented shall, unless he determines that three

20

judges are not required, immediately notify the chief

21

judge of the circuit, who shall designate two other

22

judges."

23

 Now, although that language did not appear

24

in the statute until the 1976 amendments, it was no more

25

than a congressional recognition and codification of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

4
1

what was then by settled  what was by then settled

2

practice, that a complaint covered by 2284(a) would

3

have, initially, to be referred to a single judge, that

4

the litigants then would have to file a request for a

5

threejudge district court, and in turn that the single

6

judge would have to determine whether three judges were,

7

in fact, required.

8

 Now, at the time that Congress enacted that

9

longstanding practice in the 1976 amendments to the

10

Act, this Court's precedents had made clear that one

11

basis upon which three judges are, quote, "not required"

12

is when the claim is constitutionally insubstantial.

13

 Congress is presumed to have been aware

14

of  of this Court's precedents so holding, and in the

15

absence of a contrary indication  and here there is

16

none  to have intended that interpretation of the

17

words "not required" to be incorporated into the

18

statute.

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if it's perfectly clear

20

that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment?  Let's say

21

the State legislature goes back to its pre Reynolds v.

22

Sims method of constituting the State legislature.  Does

23

that have to be referred to a threejudge court?

24
25

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

If it is  if the claim is

obviously foreclosed by this Court's precedents, then

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

5
1

no, it doesn't.  The  the upshot of this Court's

2

insubstantiality doctrine is that when a claim is so

3

obviously foreclosed it doesn't present a bona fide

4

controversy within the meaning of Article III and,

5

therefore, isn't the kind of case that has to be

6

referred to a threejudge court.

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, what 
How do you square that 
Go ahead.

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

11

 How do you square that with the statutory

12
13

Okay.

language?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, we think that's

14

embodied in the words "not required."  In  in the two

15

and three years before Congress inserted the key

16

language in Section 2284(b), this Court had said in

17

Goosby that three  that a threejudge district court

18

is, quote, "not required" when the claim is

19

insubstantial.

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Maybe Goosby was wrong.

You don't think Goosby was wrong?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  Goosby represents

23

what had been, by then, nearly 50 years of practice

24

beginning with this Court's decision in Poresky.

25

 For what it's worth, I will say I  I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

6
1

if Goosby is wrong, we still end up winning because 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 (Laughter.)

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5
6

Oh, I know that.  Yes.

Well  I'm sorry.

Well  I'm sorry, why don't you 
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  I  I would just

7

say, I think the path of least resistance here in

8

reversing the Fourth Circuit is not to overturn that

9

precedent.  But we certainly would be happy if the Court

10
11

were inclined to do that.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What do you do if

12

your argument in  in a case that might go before a

13

threejudge court is that the Court's precedents should

14

be overruled?  It's clearly foreclosed by the Court's

15

precedents, but maybe there's a very good argument that

16

the  those precedents are  haven't withstood the

17

test of time or whatever.

18

 What happens then?

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

22

 I think 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

24
25

This Court's precedents?
Yes, yes.

This Court's precedents.

I understand the Chief

Justice.
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

So I think in that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

7
1

circumstance, at least according to the Goosby rule, is

2

that the case would proper  properly be dismissed

3

for  for lack of jurisdiction as not stating 

4
5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

By the  by the  by the

singlejudge court?

6

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

7

 And  and if  if, then, this Court 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

9

By the singlejudge court.

I have  I have some

problems with that.  Suppose the  the case has been on

10

the books from this Court for 15, 20 years, has all

11

sorts of academic commentary; certain circuits have

12

questioned whether the reasoning is still valid.

13
14
15

 A singlejudge court can dismiss in that
case?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  I think according

16

to the substantiality rule, yes.  Again, if the Court

17

were inclined to 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And I'm surprised  you

think they do need to take that position?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

No.  And again, I don't think

21

we do.  And if the Court were inclined to narrow the

22

rules that it didn't apply in that circumstance, again I

23

think we'd still win.

24
25

 I don't think this case necessarily presents
that question.  And, you know, I think all  all the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

8
1

Court has to recognize for the purposes of this case is

2

that the insubstantiality rule is not one and the same

3

as the 12(b)(6) standard.

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I take it Goosby is

5

not parallel to Rule 11.  Rule 11 is a class of cases

6

which are more frivolous even than what Goosby would

7

have 

8
9

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

No.  I think Goosby is even

more frivolous than Rule 11.  What the Goosby 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

11

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Oh, really?
 standard provides is that

12

the claim must be obviously frivolous.  And what the

13

Court said in Goosby is  obviously is doing work in 

14

in that formulation.  It can't just be that a judge

15

ultimately concludes that the claim is frivolous.  It's

16

got to be that there couldn't possibly be any debate

17

about whether it is, in fact, foreclosed by this Court.

18
19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

thought of that as part of the jurisdictional question?

20

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

22

That's correct.
In other words, it's an

application of Bell v. Hood 

23

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

Am I right that Goosby

That's correct.
 which suggests that if

something is so obviously frivolous, then the Court has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

9
1
2

no jurisdiction on it at all?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

That is not a bona fide case

3

and controversy within the meaning of Article III.

4

That's exactly right.

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But it's a very

6

difficult line you're drawing, and  and I understand

7

Bell v. Hood.  But you're saying he can't do it.  He

8

can't determine that the threejudge court is not

9

required just because the plaintiffs are wrong, but he

10

can make that determination if they are really wrong.

11

 And  and your brief in the analysis and

12

all this, it  it is always  it's  it's like a

13

thesaurus.  It's just a collection of adjectives that

14

all mean "frivolous," "insubstantial," you know.  And

15

I'm not sure it gives a great deal of guidance to  to

16

a court.

17
18

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  I think I'd say

two things about that.

19

 The first  I mean, that  that catalog of

20

adjectives appears in Goosby.  This is a rule that has

21

been on the books since Poresky in the 1920s.  It  it

22

isn't, in our view, a rule that has been causing a whole

23

lot of trouble since 1976 amendments.  But again, if 

24

if the Court is dissatisfied with the ruling, we're

25

inclined to hold that it is not a basis for finding

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

10
1

three judges not required.  We still  I think it still

2

would require a reversal of the Fourth Circuit's rule

3

and of the district court's judgment in this case.

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you call it 

5

I guess my concern  you call it a rule, but it's

6

really not much of a rule.  It's just kind of a  I

7

don't know, a sense that something is  is really bad,

8

as I guess I said earlier, as opposed to just bad.  And

9

I think that's an awfully fuzzy line to  to draw, but

10

fuzzy in  in when you're talking about jurisdiction

11

where you like to have very precise and clear rules.

12

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I  I agree entirely, and

13

I  and I guess what I  what I would say on top of

14

that is that if  if the Court is concerned to avoid

15

fuzzy and difficult rules, that certainly is a reason

16

not to adopt Respondents' position.

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Could the Respondents

18

argue that, in the light of Iqbal and Twombly, Goosby

19

should be reconsidered, and the Federal court should

20

have some  district court, single judge should have

21

some more authority?  Or does that work the other way,

22

do you think?

23

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I  I think it works the

24

other way.  I would be surprised to see Respondents make

25

that argument, because again we're dealing here with a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

11
1

statute, with statutory language that says when a

2

complaint is filed challenging the constitutionality of

3

congressional districts, that a threejudge court shall

4

be convened.

5

 And then in (b), using the word "required,"

6

it  essentially Respondents' view is that the words

7

"shall appearing" in 2284(a), actually means "may," and

8

that the rule "required appearing" in 2284(b) actually

9

means "permitted," and that a single district judge, in

10

their view, can elect whether or not to convene a

11

threejudge court if he or she would, in his or her

12

discretion, prefer to keep the case for him or herself.

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Does it depend  does

14

your argument depend on categorization of what is

15

frivolous in the Goosby language as being

16

jurisdictional?

17

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I think if the Court were to

18

continue that line of cases here and to hold that that

19

is a basis for declining the convening of a threejudge

20

court, yes.  It depends on it being a jurisdictional

21

question.

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So what happens under the

23

current statute that calls for a threejudge court on

24

request of a party?

25

 Suppose nobody requests the threejudge

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

12
1

court.  Would  could the single judge proceed with the

2

case?

3

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, our  our view, in

4

light of this Court's precedence, is no, that it isn't

5

waivable and it's  it's a jurisdictional statute

6

that  that the  the judge would be without  that a

7

single judge would be without power to consider the

8

merits in the case covered by the statute.

9

 But I should say that that also isn't

10

necessarily a question that's presented here because,

11

even if it's just a claimsprocessing rule, it's still a

12

mandatory claimsprocessing rule.  And nothing in what

13

the Respondents had said indicates that when a request

14

is filed, the district judge would be empowered

15

nevertheless to disregard the request and  and

16

nevertheless keep the case for himself.

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You  you  you don't

18

think  and let's assume that  that Goosby is

19

jurisdictional.

20
21

 Does that mean that we must let the single
judge determine it?

22

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I 
Why is it that the single

24

judge must determine the jurisdictional question?  Why

25

can't that be left to the threejudge court just as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

13
1
2

everything else is?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

To be clear, I don't think a

3

single judge does have to decide the jurisdictional

4

question.  I think  again, the key point is that the

5

merits have to go to a threejudge district court.  I

6

don't think the Court has to say anything more about the

7

statute than that in this case because, on the face of

8

it, what the district court here did was enter judgment

9

under Rule 12(b)(6).

10
11
12
13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Perhaps the jurisdiction

has to go to that court as well.
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I  I think that's right,

yes.  Perhaps, yes.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Does  does the waiver

15

argument, the argument that this can be waived by the

16

consent of all parties, does that rest on decisions of

17

this Court?

18

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Not so far as I'm aware.  I

19

mean, nothing in this Court's precedents indicate that

20

the statute is jurisdictional.  And in fact  excuse

21

me, that it's waivable.  And in fact, the Court's

22

decision in Idlewild, and before that in Stratton, say

23

precisely the opposite.  They say that it's a

24

jurisdictional statute and, moreover, when the  the

25

conditions for convening a threejudge court are met,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

14
1

that a single judge loses jurisdiction over the merits

2

of the case, either to grant or to deny relief.

3

Idlewild says that very 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

6
7

In my  what 
Has the waiver rule been

adopted by some of the circuits?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Not  in fact, no.  It 

8

it's been rejected by every court that's considered it,

9

the Second and D.C. circuits.

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, why do you 
But there was a  there

12

was a change in '76, and that's when they put in "upon

13

the filing of a request."  And that language suggests

14

that it isn't a jurisdictional question, because if a

15

party has to request it, it normally follows if a party

16

doesn't request it, it's waived.

17

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  I  I wouldn't

18

disagree that that is one possible way to read the

19

statute.  I  I think it's inconsistent with what this

20

Court's precedents said beforehand.  And our view again

21

is that really that language is best understood as

22

Congress's codification of what was by then wellsettled

23

practice, that when any complaint is filed in a district

24

court, it necessarily first goes to a singledistrict

25

judge.  That singledistrict judge then has to make a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

15
1

determination whether three judges are required, and

2

that's typically done in response to a request.

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

In reality, on the ground,

4

what percentage of cases is there a request for a

5

threejudge court?

6
7

 MR. KIMBERLY: 
and 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

10

Oh, all of them.  And 

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Litigants want this?
Ah 
Are there any litigants that

11

say to themselves, I'd rather have a onejudge court,

12

thanks?

13

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Not so far as I'm aware.  I

14

think in  in most cases  now, I  I think under the

15

Respondents' reading of the statute is a oneway ratchet

16

permitting only dismissals, but I  I gather not

17

grants, although it's not clear where, in the statute,

18

the 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It  wasn't it a

20

practice in the old days that if you didn't want the

21

threejudge court, you simply didn't ask for injunctive

22

relief?  You filed a complaint for declaratory relief

23

and then you didn't  you could get your one judge?

24
25

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

That may be so.  To be clear,

though  so first of all, that would just mean that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

16
1

the  the preconditions for invoking the statutory 

2

the jurisdictional nature of the statute weren't

3

satisfied, and that certainly is something that

4

litigants could choose.

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know why it's

6

contrary to a jurisdictional status that it has to be

7

requested.  I mean, can't a request be one of the

8

conditions to confer jurisdiction just as a plaintiff is

9

one of the conditions to satisfy Article III and thereby

10

confer jurisdiction?

11

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

That's exactly right.  And

12

our example is, for instance, filing a notice of appeal

13

in the court of appeals.  The Court doesn't have

14

jurisdiction without a request for the 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Let me get back to

16

the question Justice Kagan asked.  It was certainly the

17

case when the law was enacted that the threejudge court

18

was viewed as an antiplaintiff provision.

19

 The idea was that single judges were too

20

quickly issuing injunctions, you know, blocking the

21

state enactments, and they thought that would be likely

22

if you had three judges.  I'm not sure if that's still

23

true today, but it certainly was when the law was

24

passed.

25

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

It was true in 1910 when the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

17
1

first version of this statute was enacted.  It was not

2

true by 1976 when the  when the amendments at issue

3

here were enacted.

4

 That much is made clear by the legislative

5

history of the Voting Rights Act, which is one of those

6

other statutes that provides  statutes that provides

7

for threejudgecourt review beyond 2284.

8

 The legislative history in that  in that,

9

with respect to that statute, was clear, that indeed,

10

threejudge district courts were more likely to grant

11

relief to plaintiffs than were single judges, which is

12

in part what explained why Congress, in that Act,

13

provided for threejudgecourt review.

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And plaintiffs liked it

15

because you could skip over the court of appeals and go

16

right to this Court, and on appeal rather than

17

certiorari.

18

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

That's right.  And so I think

19

in that respect, Respondents reading the statute is also

20

quite inconsistent with the wellunderstood purposes of

21

the statute.  Among them, key among them, to ensure that

22

merits judgments and cases covered by the Act, which

23

after the 1976 amendments are quite narrow and cover

24

only particularly politically sensitive and important

25

cases, receive as quick a final decision before this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

18
1
2

Court as possible.
 On Respondent's reading of the statute, a

3

single judge can keep the merits for him or herself and

4

interpose the court of appeals in the process.

5

 What's more, their reading of the statute

6

also creates really difficult jurisdictional problems on

7

appellate review.

8

 If  if a singlejudge district court can

9

grant a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) and it goes

10

before the court of appeals and the court of appeals

11

reverses, the upshot is that, well, three judges were in

12

fact required after all.

13

 The case then has to get referred to a

14

threejudge district court.  But it's not clear, then,

15

whether the threejudge district court would be bound by

16

law of the case on the 12(b)(6) question by the decision

17

of the court of appeals.

18

 If  if it is bound, that's 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

Sure it is.  Come on.
Well 
Really think that's

questionable?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I actually don't think it's

24

questionable.  I think it's quite inconsistent with what

25

the statute says in (b)(3), though, and it's an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

19
1

indication why Respondent's reading of the statute can't

2

be the right one, because what it means is the 12(b)(6)

3

question then goes to the court of appeals precisely in

4

the circumstances when Congress has meant  Congress

5

meant only the singlejudge district courts decide that.

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

How do you think the  the

7

Goosby Rule applies to political gerrymandering claims

8

in general?  This Court has never seen one that it

9

thought was justiciable.

10

 Do you think there are any that  but

11

assuming that the possibility that there might be one is

12

enough to take the case to the threejudge court?  And

13

if that's so, are there any that would not go to a

14

threejudge court?

15

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I  I think there are some

16

that wouldn't go.  A political gerrymandering claim that

17

was predicated exclusively on a purported rights

18

proportional representation in Congress would be wholly

19

foreclosed by Bandemer itself.

20

 But the fact 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But so long as it favors

22

who  the party that controlled the legislature when

23

the plan was drawn up, which is almost always the case,

24

couldn't a political gerrymandering claim be made that

25

that's why it was done?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

20
1

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I  I think that's right,

2

and I think that's why we see most of these claims

3

rightly being sent to threejudge district courts, just

4

as Congress intended.

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We might get to this

6

question, but at some point somebody is going to have to

7

say whether you do have a substantial claim.

8
9
10

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

That's right.  And our view,

against the backdrop of this Court's precedence, is
that's a sufficiently easy question that 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

12

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Is it?
Well, I think so 
Because?
There is no  no decision of

15

this Court  binding decision of this Court holding

16

that our claim is wholly foreclosed.

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

18

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 (Laughter.)

21

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Vieth?
No.  I think Vieth 
Because?

Well, Vieth  Vieth has  I

22

think the threshold question is what is the controlling

23

opinion in Vieth.  There's a plurality opinion.  The

24

courts  the lower courts have all generally agreed

25

that it's Justice Kennedy's concurrence in Vieth that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

21
1

controls.  And it's Justice Kennedy's concurrence in

2

Vieth that provides the basis for the complaint in this

3

case.

4

 It would be quite strange to say that a

5

claim that is embodied in the controlling opinion of

6

this Court from less than a decade ago is wholly

7

foreclosed by this Court's precedence.  That's why we

8

think it's a sufficiently easy question for this Court

9

to remand with instruction simply to convene a

10

threejudge court, but if the Court were not inclined to

11

go that far, we're perfectly comfortable briefing that

12

question before the single judge.

13
14
15

 If there are no further questions, I'll
reserve 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I didn't understand.  If

16

you're not going to go that far, you want to brief what

17

question before the district?

18

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I think  I think the

19

single judge below Judge Breyer would have to address

20

the question whether three judges are required under

21

proper standards.  In this case he said three judges are

22

not required because I dismiss under Rule (12)(6).  I 

23

I don't think it necessarily follows 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So you'd want to brief it

under Goosby or something?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

22
1
2
3

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Yeah, that's right, under the

proper insubstantiality standard.
 Now, as I say, I think that issue has been

4

briefed before this Court, and it's a sufficiently easy

5

question to answer 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Oh, I see.
 that it's something this

8

Court can reach.  But if it's not so inclined, then 

9

then we'll do so before the single judge.

10

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Sullivan.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SULLIVAN

14
15
16
17

Thank you, counsel.

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
 In 1976, Congress considerably narrowed the

18

circumstances that would call for the procedural device

19

of a threejudge court.  And as part of that pairing

20

down of the threejudge statute, Congress, for the first

21

time, authorized a singledistrict judge to, quote,

22

"determine that three judges are not required."

23

 For three reasons, this Court should affirm

24

that that authorization permits the single district

25

judge to dismiss a complaint that, on its face, fails to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

23
1

satisfy Rule 8 and Rule 12(b)(6) as required in all

2

civil actions.

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

May I go back to

4

something you just said?  Because I thought that the

5

word "required" was in the statute.  It wasn't

6

introduced in '76; it was there before.

7

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9
10

Well 
Required to be heard by a

threejudge court.
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

But it wasn't for an

11

authorization for a single judge.  In the prior statute,

12

upon the filing of the request for injunctive relief,

13

the threejudge court was required to be convened, and

14

so the express language of the statute did not have a

15

provision for the single judge to make that call.

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

On what basis are  it

17

sounds to me that you're giving a meaning to not

18

required that was different to the meaning we gave to it

19

pre1976.  Am I correct?

20

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

I  I don't think that's

21

necessarily the case.  I think not required meant that

22

it didn't have a set meaning as plaintiffs 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I  he took out the

24

adjectives, descriptors from our case law:

25

"Insubstantial," "wholly insubstantial," "frivolous,"

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

24
1

"obviously or essentially frivolous."  I mean 

2

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4
5

But that 
 that's very different

than a 12(b)(3) motion.
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Yes, Justice Sotomayor,

6

that  those words appear, but in the prior case law

7

before 1976, this Court had, in two important cases,

8

permitted a district judge to adjudicate the entire case

9

notwithstanding the presence of a substantial claim

10

raised by the plaintiff.  And those cases are Bailey and

11

the Hagans v Lavine case cited by Petitioners.

12

 There, Hagans v. Lavine, there was no

13

question there was a substantial equal protection claim.

14

The district judge perceived that there's this

15

preemption claim, and I think I can get rid of the case

16

by ruling on the preemption claim, which is exactly what

17

the district judge did.

18

 And this Court affirmed that that was the

19

correct procedure; that there was no reason to trouble

20

the threejudge court if there was a statutory claim

21

that could be resolved and rendered unnecessary to

22

address the equal protection clause.

23

 So the idea that there was this set

24

understanding that any time there's a substantial claim

25

it's off limits to a single district judge is simply not

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

25
1

borne out by this Court's pre1976 precedent.  So

2

there's more at work in that precedent.

3

 Indeed, for those who will consult

4

legislative history, the Senate Report 94204 has a

5

heading under uncertainties in the prior law, and the

6

first item is A, whether or not a threejudge court

7

should be convened was the first of the several

8

uncertainties that the Senate noted in its report.

9

 So the idea that Petitioners want to say

10

that by saying "not required" in the statute, Congress

11

intended to adopt a certain subset of this Court's prior

12

jurisprudence is not borne out by 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, they  they want to

14

raise about as important a question as you can imagine.

15

They want to say, reading Vieth, that the State

16

legislators are forbidden to draw district boundaries

17

the way that has been done here.  I take it that's their

18

basic claim.  And if they are right, that would affect

19

congressional districts and legislative districts

20

throughout the nation.

21

 So what reason could Congress have had for

22

saying, although we want threejudge courts to decide

23

these kind of cases generally, where the singlemost

24

important issue that could possibly be raised  I

25

exaggerate only slightly  is raised, that kind of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

26
1
2

issue is for a single judge?
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Well, Congress, if it had

3

looked back at this Court's case law, would have seen

4

that this Court regularly denied threejudge courts even

5

where there was an important issue such as when the

6

preemption was the issue.  Preemption cases 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you want to give me a

list of those cases with  I'm going to continue it.
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Yes.  Swift  Swift and

Company 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Answer Justice Breyer.
So the  the Court's

13

concern, it was always a narrow interpretation of the

14

statute for very important reasons.  And that is to

15

minimize the dislocation of the lower Federal courts'

16

functioning and structure, which always happens when you

17

have to bring in two extra judges.  And secondly, to

18

control this Court's mandatory appellate docket.

19

 So those are always at work when the Court

20

was reading the statute.  And Congress knew this.  And

21

on page 5, the Senate report acknowledges this narrow

22

reading without disavowing it or instructing this Court

23

to do otherwise.

24
25

 So the statute always was read not in the
most embracing terms, as it said in Swift & Company v.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

27
1

Wickham at page 126, not in the most embracing terms,

2

but in restrictive  in a restrictive way because of

3

the important concerns of judicial administration that

4

were at stake, but also to best serve the historical

5

purpose, which is to protect States from the improvident

6

injunction by a single judge.

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, haven't they

8

strayed from that  or Congress has, because Congress

9

said you also get a threejudge court if you're

10

attacking a Federal statute, right?  It started out with

11

the concern about enjoining State statutes.  But if you

12

were trying to enjoin a Federal statute, you could also

13

get a threejudge court, right?  And there was no

14

Stateprotective interest involved in that.

15

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

That was probably to protect

16

an analogous Federal interest in having its  its laws

17

not improvidently enjoined.  That statute is no longer

18

there, as you know.  But that obviously wouldn't have

19

had the same State sovereignty concerns, but the 

20

there was impetus for that adoption from the Federal

21

Government because they saw the benefits that the States

22

reached from having the procedure adopted.

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I make sure I understand

24

what you're saying, because what you're saying now is

25

different from what I had thought that your briefs were

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

28
1

saying?  I had thought in your briefs that you were

2

relying on changes in the law that  that Congress made

3

in  I think it's 1976; is that right?

4

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.
But now you're suggesting

6

that you're not relying on that, that you're saying that

7

before that, we  we viewed as acceptable a  a

8

onejudge court dismissing a case.  Is that now what

9

you're saying, historic practice favors you as opposed

10
11

to the  the 1976 amendments favor you?
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

I think the important thing

12

is the amendments that we pointed out in our brief

13

are  were significant changes in  in the structure

14

and meaning of the statute.  But I was responding to

15

Petitioners' argument that this Court can simply look at

16

the words "not required" and know immediately what they

17

mean from reading the prior case law.  And I don't think

18

that will be an effective process for this Court if it

19

gives full 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's a winner for you 

21

it's a winner for you if those prior cases say what you

22

say they say.

23

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

24

hope you'll remember that.

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I hope so, Your Honor.  And I

Well, it should have been

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

29
1

in your brief.  I mean, you should have made that point

2

in your brief.

3

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Well, you know, I'm trying to

4

provide value now in addition to what we had in the

5

brief.

6

 (Laughter.)

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

For my edification, what

8

are the cases  I know Bailey is one.  What are the

9

other ones you're relying on?

10

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Well, in Swift v. Wickham is

11

the best exposition of what this narrow construction or

12

restrictive construction is about.  The words clearly

13

said in the prior statute, "On grounds of

14

unconstitutionality."

15

 And this Court read that phrase not to

16

include a very important clause of the Constitution, the

17

supremacy clause, because it was important to keep it

18

narrow and not to open the floodgates to every

19

preemption challenge that would come down, even though

20

those challenges are very important and more devastating

21

to the State than a constitutional claim could be.

22

That's an example.

23

 In Gonzalez, this Court read the phrase in

24

28 U.S. 1253, which is the direct appeal provision 

25

"orders granting or denying an injunction," this Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

30
1

read to not include any denial of an injunction that

2

would have been a sound basis for not convening a

3

threejudge court in the first place.

4

 And the Court phrased it that broadly to

5

include whatever basis there might be to not convene a

6

threejudge court.  That means you don't get the direct

7

appeal, which is a very important part of this whole

8

statutory scheme.

9

 It became more important with the rise of

10

the reapportionment cases, which, by the way, the reason

11

you don't see any old reapportionment cases in the case

12

law is they would have been foreclosed by this Court's

13

precedent until Baker v. Carr.

14

 But with the rise of those, the part of the

15

structure  not the threejudge so much, but it was the

16

direct appeal that became more important to the States

17

to protect them, as  as was spoken to by the assistant

18

U.S. attorney general Robert Dickson who testified.  And

19

we quote his testimony at page 30, talking about, but

20

for that direct appeal and the ability to get an

21

immediate stay from this Court, entire elections would

22

have had to be conducted under plans that were adopted

23

by district courts contrary to what the legislature had

24

provided and very important to have access to this Court

25

to get that stay and not to have the entire election

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

31
1
2

disrupted by that order.
 The idea that Petitioner insists on that the

3

insubstantial rule is not a meritsbased test is just

4

obviously can't be true, because you have got to know

5

what the merits are before you know it's insubstantial.

6

I know this Court's precedent has treated it as a

7

jurisdictional matter.  But I would submit that it  it

8

really doesn't meet the set of tests that Justice

9

Ginsburg laid out for the court in Arbaugh of what's

10
11

jurisdictional and what's not.
 And the idea that there's a clear division

12

between insubstantially and failure to state a claim is

13

not borne out.  And in one of the cases cited by the

14

Petitioner in their brief at page 23, Kalson v.

15

Paterson, the 2008 Second Circuit case illustrates that,

16

because there a singledistrict judge is deemed able to

17

decide it because it's insubstantial, even though the

18

court acknowledges that the theory is not foreclosed by

19

precedent.

20

 It just comes around to saying, yes, it is

21

insubstantial.  And it rules, it affirms the grant of a

22

motion on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), which in the

23

Second Circuit, as in most other circuits, is analyzed

24

exactly like a Rule 12(b)(6) failure to state a claim

25

motion.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

32
1

 The claim there was that the State should

2

have used voting age population, which, interesting

3

enough, is the issue that this Court has noted probable

4

jurisdiction on in Evenwell.  And there a threejudge

5

court in Evenwell dismissed under 12(b)(6).

6

 So you have a court in the Second Circuit

7

saying that's insubstantial.  Whether or not they were

8

right or they analyzed it right under Goosby, they

9

reached that conclusion.  And they  they did it on an

10

analysis that it's hard for me to distinguish from a

11

12(b)(6) analysis.  And then the threejudge court in

12

Evenwell, which this Court will be visiting, did the

13

whole matter under a 12(b)(6) analysis, which is maybe a

14

little more detailed than the Second Circuit in

15

insubstantially analysis, but really hard to tell the

16

difference.  How did you reach that conclusion?

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Sullivan, I  I  I

18

guess I'm  I'm not so inclined to think that.  We

19

always have had this very narrow category of cases which

20

we say we're dismissing on jurisdictional grounds that

21

sound kind of meritsy.  But  but we've cabined that.

22

You know, we've basically said that's only when it's

23

completely ridiculous.  And so there's no case at all.

24

It's just a laughing stock of a case, given our

25

precedents.  And that's a very different kind of inquiry

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

33
1
2

than the typical 12(b)(6) inquiry.
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Well, it's easy when it's the

3

little green men and the extraterrestrials, but that's

4

not the cases that have arisen and been addressed by

5

this Court.  Goosby v. Osser, the court of appeals in

6

that case ruled that it was insubstantial, the claim

7

there that prisoners had to have access to absentee

8

ballots, because this Court had a prior case, McDonald,

9

which had said the prison system there and the election

10

system was  it was fine not to allow the prisoners to

11

have absentee ballots.

12

 And when it came to this Court, Justice

13

Brennan for the Court said, you've misread our

14

president; McDonald doesn't foreclose this case.  So it

15

involved extraterrestrials and no little green men.  But

16

a panel 

17
18
19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know what you mean

by "extraterrestrials."  What are these 
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Some of the case law refers

to 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Aliens?  No?
Aliens  aliens.  Some of

23

the case law seems to  to categorize only the  the

24

only cases that would come under Bell v. Hood, some

25

judges will say are the ones so outlandish that involves

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

34
1

something that on its face you could say that could

2

never be true.

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  And that  that's

what you mean by "extraterrestrial"?

5

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Bailey is  I mean, Bailey

Yes.
Outlandish.  Okay.
Outlandish.

10

was the mirrorimage case.  I mean, it was a case where

11

some AfricanAmerican plaintiffs were saying they have a

12

constitutional right to travel without discrimination in

13

interstate commerce, as I read it.  And they convened a

14

threejudge court because they wanted to set aside

15

Mississippi law to the contrary, in 1961.  And the court

16

said, but it's absolutely clear that a statute that

17

requires segregation is unconstitutional.  So this

18

shouldn't have even been heard by a threejudge court

19

because there has to be some kind of an issue.  And the

20

words it uses are it doesn't require a threejudge court

21

when the claim that a statute is unconstitutional is

22

wholly insubstantial.

23

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

But there's 
He's speaking nonexistent.

And they said it's nonexistent because it's clear what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

35
1

the Federal law was.  I mean, that was the nature.

2

 So  so I don't see how that helps you.

3

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Well, I don't know if it

4

helps, but I think it doesn't help Petitioners the idea

5

that that's a significant expansion, if not a complete

6

departure from Bell v. Hood, which addressed when a

7

complaint could be dismissed for lack of subject matter

8

jurisdiction because it's insubstantial.  There the

9

claim is granted, relief is granted in 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's true, but I mean,

11

they put down a standard as to whether or not a

12

threejudge court is necessary.  And they say a

13

threejudge court is not necessary when the reason for

14

giving the threejudge court  you know, if it's  if

15

it's insubstantial.  In that case you have to have a

16

threejudge court, I guess, when there's some

17

constitutional issue.  They said there is no

18

constitutional issue, not because it was frivolous or

19

from Mars, but for the opposite reason:  The law was

20

clear.

21

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

24
25

The law was clear, and 
Yes.
 the singledistrict judge

should have been allowed to address that in argument 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So here his 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

36
1

I guess you're going to think certainly, he's not

2

clearly right, and the question is, is he clearly wrong.

3

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

But I would submit that,

4

under this  the Court's prevailing rule, the Court 

5

the Court adopts the Federal rules, and all  all

6

district judges are bound for them.

7

 If a district judge is entitled to grant

8

relief, as under the Bailey case, it seems reasonable to

9

allow that judge to determine that a complaint on its

10

face is legally sufficient, as the court would in any

11

other case.

12

 These  these rules are binding, unless you

13

can find in the statute a reason that compels the

14

district judge not to comply with the civil  the rules

15

of civil procedure, then the district judge is in his or

16

her rights?

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you say "required in the

statute" means "states a claim"?
 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Well, I think that it

20

could  it incorporates that understanding as much as

21

it would incorporate the insubstantiality, because both

22

are presumptions that courts rely on.  A case is not

23

going to proceed, pass a motion to dismiss, certainly

24

not under Iqbal and Twombly, unless it satisfies Rule 8.

25

That's just a basic understanding of every district

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

37
1

court in the land.  And it seems strange that, if  if

2

the cases are that important and they're going to

3

require two extra judges and a direct appeal to this

4

Court, that a legally insufficient complaint that

5

otherwise could not get past the threshold of the

6

courthouse is going to get a direct appeal to this

7

Court.

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So let  let's assume you

have a district judge who says it fails to state a

10

claim.  And  what does the plaintiff do?  Where does

11

the appeal go?

12

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

13

in every other case.

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

To the court of appeals, as

So it goes all the way up,

15

and if  if he loses in the court of appeals, he tries

16

to come up here, right?  And we finally decide it did

17

state a claim.  Then what happens?  It goes back down

18

and you begin all over again with a threejudge court,

19

right?

20

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

Wow.  Wow, that's  I

mean, that's my comment.

23

 (Laughter.)

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Yes, Your Honor.

It's extraterrestrial, as

he said.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

 (Laughter.)

2

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

But  but I  I understand

3

your reaction, but I think that comes  when you have a

4

departure from the norm, as the threejudge statute

5

creates, you're going to have some situations that may

6

be a little bit stickier than otherwise that you have

7

had in a normal functioning of the content.  But that's

8

happened.

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I mean, the other

10

alternative is it's a threejudge district court, and

11

then we have to take it on the merits.  I mean, that's a

12

serious problem because there are a lot of cases that

13

come up in threejudge district courts that would be the

14

kind of case  I speak for myself, anyway  that we

15

might deny cert in, to let the issue percolate.  And now

16

with the threejudge district court, no, we have to

17

decide it on the merits.

18

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

Well, you had seven more

19

direct appeals from Maryland, as we cite in our  in

20

our brief, that  the cases we've had in recent years

21

that were dismissed by a single judge, they would have

22

all come here.  And we're one State times 50  400 more

23

direct appeals, perhaps?  I don't know how frequently

24

these cases are filed in other States.

25

 But that was a concern that  that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

39
1

always lurking in all the cases prior that this Court

2

decided before 1976 and was acknowledged in the report

3

that there is this concern to control this Court's

4

mandatory docket, which Congress cares deeply about,

5

because they took away the direct appeal of

6

constitutional claims that would come up from the

7

courts.

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

Congress.  Trust me.

10

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

We care even more than

I hope you care deeply and 

11

and deeply enough to  to affirm this reasonable

12

interpretation.  And I think it will serve the interest

13

of  of this Court and also all the other litigants as

14

well.

15
16

 And if  unless there are further
questions, we submit.

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 Mr. Kimberly, you have 11 minutes left.

19
20

Thank you, counsel.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL B. KIMBERLY
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

21

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

22

 First, a comment about Swift v. Wickham.

Just a few quick points.

23

This is a case that we addressed on page 5 in footnote 1

24

in our reply brief.

25

 The holding in that case was simply that a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

40
1

preemption claim is not a constitutional claim within

2

the meaning of the statute.  There's nothing

3

inconsistent about that holding with our position before

4

this Court.

5

 Second, with respect to the 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Explain why that's so.  Why

7

is  why is that so clear that  that it's frivolous,

8

you know?

9

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  I don't  that's

10

not the holding in the case.  I'm sorry.  I just 

11

the  the  in order to have a threejudge court, you

12

have to bring a constitutional claim, and the Court's

13

holding in that case was that a preemption claim,

14

although it involves a question under the supremacy

15

clause, is ultimately really a statutory claim.  And so

16

it just isn't of the sort that Congress meant to  to

17

go before a threejudge court, as a matter of

18

interpretation of the statute.

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And it doesn't matter

whether that's frivolous or not?
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

That's right.  Yes.  It 

22

it's a completely different holding.  It has nothing

23

whatever to do with the question whether a substantial

24

claim has to go before the threejudge court.

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Does it happen often that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

41
1

a single judge will say there are three issues here; one

2

would definitely involve a threejudge court, but the

3

previous are ones that I can reach, and so I will reach

4

those first.

5

 Does that happen very often?

6

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Not so far we're aware of.

7

We  we are aware that it has happened.  It doesn't

8

seem to be a frequent occurrence.

9

 The Third Circuit in Page indicated that

10

when that happens, because the statute applies to the

11

action, that the entire action must go.

12

 Now, if I could say something briefly about

13

purpose.  My friend on the other side of the podium

14

suggested that the sole purpose here for the statute was

15

to protect States from improvident grants of

16

injunctions.  If that were the case, you would expect,

17

in Section 2253, to see  which is the  the provision

18

that provides for appellate review over judgments of

19

threejudge district courts  you'd expect to see

20

mandatory and direct review before this Court only from

21

final judgments of courts granting injunctions.  But in

22

fact, what 2253 says in express terms is that there's a

23

right of immediate appeal before this Court from both

24

grants and denials of relief in cases heard by the two

25

district courts.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

42
1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

To  to  to say

2

otherwise, we  we would have to say that you get 

3

you get no appeal in one category of case.  I  I 

4

I  you know, I'm  I'm not sure it  it would comply

5

with due process to  to have a judgment from which

6

there is no appeal.

7

 MR. SULLIVAN: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

Well, I think 
And that's what you're

saying, that  that Congress would have provided for no

10

appeal whatever if you  if you  if  if  if the

11

State wins.  No appeal for the plaintiffs.

12

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  I  I think

13

Respondents' position is if relief can be denied, it may

14

be granted.  That  an order of that sort may be

15

entered by a single district judge and you'd get 1291

16

review before a court of appeals.

17

 Our  our  our point is only that, if the

18

statutory purpose were only to protect States from

19

grants of injunctions, you would see  and that single

20

judges in turn could decide everything else, you would

21

not see in 1253, which provides for immediate appeal to

22

this Court from judgments of threedistrict court 

23

threejudge district courts, the right of appeal from a

24

denial of relief.

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I  as far  as far as I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

43
1

understand it, his strongest argument on the other side

2

would roughly go  he didn't put it this way  like

3

this:

4

 On your side is the fact, well, why wouldn't

5

a threejudge court decide a very important question of

6

law in this area?

7

 On the other side of it is that, well, you

8

just have left, in threejudge courts primarily, almost

9

exclusively, reapportionment issues, which are specially

10
11

political.
 And to put these all, you know, they are

12

very  because of the opinions you point out in Vieth,

13

there's a huge variation of all kinds of different legal

14

claims that might be made.  And if there is a set of

15

cases where this Court should be careful as to when and

16

how and which it enters in which order, i.e.,

17

discretion, if we accept your view, that set of cases

18

where we should be particularly careful as to how we

19

proceed will be the set of cases where we have no choice

20

and we have to take immediately whatever variations on

21

the theme of disproportionate gerrymandering, da da da,

22

whatever order they happen to arise and whenever they

23

happen to arise, because we have no choice.

24
25

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

So I have two responses to

that.  The first is it's reflected in the congressional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

44
1

record and the testimony before Congress that, indeed,

2

Congress was quite concerned with the political

3

sensitivity of these cases.

4

 The way that Congress decided to deal with

5

that political sensitivity was to ensure that, in the

6

first instance, these cases are decided by a panel of

7

three judges, as  as Judge Henry Friendly, in his

8

testimony before the 92nd Congress, indicated there.

9

 The concern was to ensure that adherents of

10

more than one political party were deciding these cases

11

because, not only to ensure greater deliberation and

12

accuracy and decision making, but also because it might

13

be unseemly to allow a single judge to decide such a

14

politicallysensitive case where it might appear 

15

whether or not it actually is true  where it might

16

appear to the public that his or her own political

17

ideologies and predilections 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So now you have 

19

now you have cases quite often, particularly in the most

20

sensitive ones, decided by a vote of two to one.  So I

21

don't know how that  how that particular answer is

22

very responsive to the concern that Justice Breyer has

23

pointed out, which  which is one I share.

24
25

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, so that leads to me to

the second half of my response, and that is that in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

45
1

majority of these cases that make it before this Court

2

on mandatory review, the Court generally enters a

3

summary affirmance and doesn't note probable

4

jurisdiction and take full briefing.

5

 When the Court affirms on the basis 

6

affirms on the  without taking full argument and

7

briefing, there's a limited presidential effect to those

8

decisions.  It is not binding the same way that a full

9

decision  that they're binding in the same way as a

10

decision following full briefing 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, to go back to your 
Just to follow up:

13

In  in recent years, is it true that in

14

reapportionment cases, the majority of the way we've

15

handled direct appeals has been summarily?

16
17
18
19
20

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

With all due respect, I think

you'd probably be in a better position to answer that.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  I'm just

talking statistically.
 MR. KIMBERLY: 

I mean, certainly the Court

21

has been taking a large number of these cases recently.

22

It's been two or three each term.  I 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

When you say

24

"taking" them, I mean, they're being presented to us.

25

We have no choice, but taking 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

46
1

 (Laughter.)

2

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Right.  And I'm sorry.  What

3

I mean is noting probable jurisdiction and taking full

4

briefing and arguments in two or three cases each term.

5

 But that, at least as I understand how the

6

Court operates, is  is a question of  of discretion,

7

whether it notes probable jurisdiction and takes that

8

additional step.

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

On the issue of political

10

sensitivity, if it goes to a single judge, you will have

11

a decision by a judge who has presumably been selected

12

by the spin of the wheel, or by  at random, and then

13

you'll have an appeal to a court of appeals panel that

14

is presumably chosen at random.  Whereas if it goes to a

15

threejudge court, there will be a decision, and it may

16

involve some very sensitive findings of fact by a panel

17

that is handpicked by the chief judge, who is in a

18

position to appoint himself or herself to the

19

threejudge court and select a third district judge who

20

the chief judge believes is likely to agree with or

21

defer to the chief judge.

22

 So I don't see how that  how that creates

23

an insulation against the appearance of political

24

favoritism.

25

 MR. KIMBERLY: 

Well, I  it may be so that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

47
1

in those cases, if  if a litigant or a member of the

2

public dug down behind how the panel is appointed, that

3

there might be a basis for raising a concern.  But it's

4

certainly reflected in the congressional record that it

5

was Congress's judgment that the best protection against

6

that concern  and  and indeed, this goes back to the

7

original version of the Act back in 1910, that

8

Congress's concern was that the public could rest more

9

easy when decisions of such political importance and

10

sensitivity are decided by three judges rather than one.

11

 If there are no further questions.

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13
