ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McCOLGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
FBI agents delayed presenting Mr. Corley to

12

a Federal magistrate judge in order to obtain his two

13

confessions.

14

depends on an issue of statutory interpretation:

15

interpretation of 3501(c), together with the

16

McNabb-Mallory rule and the right of prompt presentment.

17

The admissibility of these two confessions
The

Now, there's two critical issues I would

18

like to address.

19

written by Congress leaves the McNabb-Mallory rule in

20

place outside the six-hour time limitation.

21

second is that the Government's interpretation, under

22

which 3501(c) is merely a voluntariness safe harbor, is

23

unfaithful to the text and the structure of the statute.

24
25

The first is that 3501(c) as it's

And the

Turning to the first point, subsection (c)
modifies McNabb-Mallory, but does not eliminate it.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exact text of the statute here is crucial.

2

Court's convenience, on page 7 of the yellow brief the

3

operative language of the text of the statute is set

4

out.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And for the

Before we -- before we

6

get to the statute, McNabb-Mallory are exercises of this

7

Court's supervisory authority over the lower courts?

8

MR. McCOLGIN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And they were both

10

pre-Miranda decisions, when now the defendant is told of

11

his right to remain silent.

12

1301 -- 3501, this Court could say, well, McNabb-Mallory

13

are no longer viable cases in light of Miranda.

14

MR. McCOLGIN:

Whatever Congress put in

This Court could, but for

15

several prudential reasons this Court should not,

16

overturn McNabb and Mallory and should not find them to

17

be no longer valid considerations.

18

no longer valid precedents.

19
20

First of all, the Solicitor General's Office
has not asked that McNabb and Mallory be overturned.

21

Second of all, the parties have not briefed

22

that issue.

23

interpretation issue.

24
25

First of all -- or

It has been briefed instead as a statutory

Thirdly, Congress through 3501(c) structured
the statute on the existing precedent of McNabb and
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Mallory, and at this point for the Court to pull McNabb

2

and Mallory out from underneath that structure would

3

cause that structure to basically collapse.

4

the six-hour time limitation, depends on the existence

5

of McNabb-Mallory outside that six-hour time period.

6

It depends,

Congress can revisit this issue at any time.

7

Their hands are not tied.

Congress could choose to

8

change 3501(c) so that it no longer provides for McNabb-

9

Mallory outside the six-hour time period.

But that's a

10

decision for Congress and this Court, I would suggest

11

respectfully, should respect the prerogatives and the

12

policy choice that Congress has already made.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you arguing that the

14

language in subsection (c) codifies the McNabb-Mallory

15

rule?

16

MR. McCOLGIN:

I am arguing that the exact

17

language, whether it is "codification" or "leaves

18

intact," doesn't matter.

19

What it does is -

JUSTICE ALITO:

There is a very big

20

difference, isn't there, between saying we are codifying

21

this rule, we're making it a statutory requirement, and

22

saying, assuming that this supervisory rule that was

23

adopted by the Supreme Court remains in place, we are

24

creating an exception to it?

25

does subsection (c) do?

Which of those two things

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. McCOLGIN:

Your Honor, it does the

2

latter.

3

the language of the statute uses the phrase "time

4

limitation" in the proviso.

5

more than we're just not just touching McNabb-Mallory

6

for the time being.

7

on McNabb-Mallory to create the time limitation, because

8

without McNabb-Mallory there is no limitation.

It leaves McNabb-Mallory in place.

However,

Well, it would be

say that Congress has built a statute around a

25

supervisory rule, but taken away the authority of this
6

1

Court to reexamine the supervisory rule.

2

MR. McCOLGIN:

I am not actually saying that

3

Congress has taken away the authority of the Court.

4

am saying as a prudential manner, since Congress can

5

address this on its own and since it structured the

6

statute on the foundation of McNabb-Mallory, it would be

7

best for this Court to leave up to Congress that policy

8

choice.

9

I

Congress chose in 1968 to leave of

10

McNabb-Mallory protection against presentment delay in

11

place after six hours.

12

the appropriate compromise, because what it did was it

13

cut out the first six hours during which there had been

14

the most problems with the application of

15

McNabb-Mallory.

16

effectively lowers the social cost of this rule of this

17

rule of inadmissibility while maintaining the deterrent

18

effect of McNabb-Mallory outside the six hours.

21

It was a compromise, and it was

The six-hour time limitation

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you were trying to

get to page 7 of your yellow brief?
MR. McCOLGIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

On page 7 I

22

set out the operative language of the statute.

23

the statute actually provides is that a confession shall

24

not be inadmissible solely because of delay if such

25

confession is found by the trial judge to have been made
7

Alderson Reporting Company

And what

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

voluntarily and made within six hours of arrest.

2

the phrase "inadmissible solely because of delay" is

3

clearly a reference to the McNabb-Mallory rule because

4

that is exactly what McNabb-Mallory does.

5

the confession inadmissible solely because of delay if

6

the delay in presentment was unreasonable.

7

Now,

It renders

So what the statute is providing on its face

8

is that a confession shall not be subject to the

9

McNabb-Mallory rule if it is voluntarily given and made

10

within six hours.

11

McNabb-Mallory is in effect outside of the six hours.

12

The six-hour provision means that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or it may just mean

13

that the confessions beyond six hours may be excluded

14

solely because of delay.

15

says, look, I don't want to hear about all this other

16

stuff, it's just too long, he can't do that beyond the

17

six hours, but he can within the six hours.

18

MR. McCOLGIN:

In other words, if the judge

Within the six hours he

19

cannot exclude solely because of delay, even a voluntary

20

statement.

21

inadmissible solely because of delay.

22

saying is that McNabb-Mallory does not apply within the

23

six hours.

24
25

That is the McNabb-Mallory principle,
So what it's

Now the government's interpretation is that
this is simply a voluntariness safe harbor, and what
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they do is they read the word "inadmissible" as being

2

synonymous with the word "involuntary."

3

the statute shows that those two terms are not

4

synonymous, because the text of the statute says that in

5

order for a confession to be admissible it must be

6

voluntary and made within six hours.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the text of

Well, they have that textual

8

problem, but you have at least an equally big textual

9

problem, because you want to read the first sentence of

10

subsection (a) completely out of the statute based on

11

some supposition about what Congress was intending to

12

do.

13

text.

14

subsection (c) textual analysis if you're going to

15

disregard the text of subsection (a).

16

MR. McCOLGIN:

17

disregard the text of subsection (a).

18

apply the principle that a general provision, if it

19

conflicts with a specific provision, the specific

20

controls over the general.

21

(a) is a general statement that voluntary statements are

22

admissible.

23

does, as making admissible every voluntary statement,

24

then that would make subsection (c) completely

25

superfluous.

So really, if you live by the text you die by the

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if you read subsection

2

(c) the way you do, it makes subsection (a) mean

3

something quite different from what it says literally.

4

MR. McCOLGIN:

No, it simply establishes an

5

exception in the area of delay.

This is the way

6

statutes work.

When there is a conflict between a

versus 2254, it was held that 2254 as a specific

provision controls over 1983.

13

principle of statutory interpretation.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So

In 1983

So this is an accepted

What you're -- you are not

15

arguing that there is a specific provision that controls

16

a general provision.

17

negative inference from an arguably more specific

18

provision reads new language into the text of a specific

19

provision.

20

You are arguing that an arguable

That's what you are arguing, isn't it?
MR. McCOLGIN:

With respect, no, Your Honor.

21

We are not making the negative inference argument that

22

the government suggests we are making in the first part

23

of their brief.

24

that subsection (c) was constructed on the existing

25

precedent of McNabb and Mallory, which already

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

established a rule of inadmissibility.

Subsection (c)

2

then just carves out the first six hours from that.

3

it's not creating a rule of inadmissibility by negative

4

inference.

5

inadmissibility already exists in the case law and the

6

purpose of this statute was to simply carve out from the

7

first six hours the McNabb-Mallory rule.

8

The government -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

Rather it's just recognizing that a rule of

Why can't you argue that

10

what happens when you are not within the safe harbor is

11

simply that the time period cannot alone govern, all

12

right, but it can still be part of the list of things

13

that can be taken into account in determining

14

voluntariness under (b).

15

two provisions?

16

Why doesn't that reconcile the

MR. McCOLGIN:

That, again, is the

17

government's interpretation.

But it requires a

18

rewriting.

19

"involuntary" to interpret all of subsection(c) as a

20

voluntariness safe harbor.

But Congress used the word

21

inadmissible deliberately.

That's a reference to the

22

McNabb-Mallory rule.

23

confessions voluntary or involuntary based on delay.

24

rendered them inadmissible.

25

crucial.

It requires reading "inadmissible" as

McNabb-Mallory did not render

So that language is

harbor.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But admissibility is

3

defined in 3501 itself.

4

admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given; and

5

(b) says what factors will be taken into account in

6

determining whether it's voluntarily given.

7

(A) says that it shall be

MR. McCOLGIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And (c)

8

makes clear that, at least for purposes of subsection

9

(c), voluntariness is not enough for admissibility,

10

because it says on its face that in order -

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I agree with that.

It is

not alone enough.

13

MR. McCOLGIN:

So the two terms -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So if you are outside of

15

that safe harbor you cannot rely upon the time alone.

16

But why can't you rely on the time plus the other

17

factors?

18

MR. McCOLGIN:

Your Honor, because the

19

effect is again to allow for a confession to be

20

inadmissible solely based on delay if it's outside of

21

the six hours.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not being admissible

23

solely on the basis -- I'm sorry.

Delay is not the only

24

factor being considered in making the inadmissibility

25

call.

Delay is one of the things; whereas, within the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

safe harbor delay can't be taken into account at all.
MR. McCOLGIN:

Well, what the Congress said

3

was that delay alone cannot be a basis for

4

inadmissibility within six hours.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. McCOLGIN:

Right.
That leaves in place

7

McNabb-Mallory, under which delay alone is a basis for

8

inadmissibility.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

It -- it leaves it in

10

effect only if you ignore (a) and (b). (A) says that

11

it's admissible if it's voluntary -

12

MR. McCOLGIN:

But that -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- and (b) says it's

14

voluntary if you take into account the five factors, one

15

of which is the period of time before arraignment.

16

MR. McCOLGIN:

Your Honor, that depends.

17

The premise of that depends on the argument that

18

"inadmissibility" is synonymous with "involuntariness"

19

for purposes of subsection (c), and "admissibility" is

20

synonymous with "voluntariness," but they are not

21

synonymous as used in subsection (c).

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they are synonymous as

used in (a).
MR. McCOLGIN:

Well, subsection -- as used

in subsection 13
Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

(A) says that if it's -

it's admissible if it's voluntary.

3

MR. McCOLGIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

However, as

4

used in subsection (c), that should control, because the

5

word "inadmissibility" is being used in that very same

6

sentence.

7

voluntariness is not enough for admissibility, it's

8

clear that those two terms are not synonymous.

9

Since the very same sentence makes clear that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, is it your position

10

that the McNabb-Mallory rule serves purposes other than

11

to ensure the voluntariness of the statement?

12

MR. McCOLGIN:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why do we want to

4

avoid delay in presentment?

5

And I assume there are reasons that -- to contact family

6

and so forth -- other than voluntariness.

7

MR. McCOLGIN:

What reason do we give?

Well, voluntariness is

8

certainly a part of it.

But it's in addition, because

9

there's rights that attach at presentment that allow a

10

defendant to make a much more informed decision as to

11

whether -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What do those rights have

13

to do with a confession that is conceded, for our

14

analytic purposes, to be voluntary?

15

MR. McCOLGIN:

Because the confession itself

16

was obtained through exploitation of the delay.

coercive pressures that develop during a period of

What

other remedy, other than suppression of the confession

defendants to enforce the interest in prompt

14

MR. McCOLGIN:

There is no other remedy

available.

16

this case would send to law enforcement is that delay

17

for the purpose of interrogation is permissible and that

the right of prompt presentment is unenforceable.

Without McNabb-Mallory, this becomes an empty right.

There is no other remedy.

where the delay is purposeful, as we have in this case

In fact, the message that an affirmance in

MR. McCOLGIN:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
Your argument is you don't

MR. McCOLGIN:

You need

It's not that we don't trust

It's that delay for the purpose of interrogation

should not be pushed to that limit; that delay for the

purpose of interrogation should not be permitted.

The

10

delay, particularly where it's for that express purpose,

11

even if the defendant cannot show that it rose to the

12

level of involuntariness, still it's exploitation of

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's the purpose of the

requirement of prompt presentment?
MR. McCOLGIN:

The purpose of the right of

prompt presentment is several-fold.
First of all, it's because there are

22

inherent coercive characteristics that develop during a

23

period of custody, and a person, once arrested, should

be presented to a neutral magistrate so that the neutral

magistrate can both assign counsel, give an opportunity

7

do with the problem that the proviso only makes a delay

8

longer than six hours nondestructive of the

9

admissibility of the confession if the delay beyond six

10

hours "is found by the trial judge to be reasonable

11

considering the means of transportation and the distance

12

to be traveled to the nearest available magistrate judge

13

or other officer."

14

I can think of a lot of reasons why you

15

can't do it within six hours other than the means of

16

transportation and the distance to be traveled.

17
18
19

MR. McCOLGIN:

We have to remember, Your

Honor JUSTICE SCALIA:

You see, if you take the

20

government's position that it really doesn't matter, it

21

gets thrown back into (b), and you can take all those

22

factors into account, and the ultimate question is

23

whether the confession was reasonable.

24
25

But if you take your position, the defendant
automatically walks, or at least his confession is
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

automatically thrown out, and the only exception made is

2

if the means of transportation and the distance to be

3

traveled made six hours impracticable.

4

MR. McCOLGIN:

No, Your Honor, that's not

5

our position.

Our position is that the first question

6

is did the confession fall within that six-hour time

7

period?

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. McCOLGIN:

Right.
Or longer, depending on

10

transportation, means of transportation.

11

determination of whether it falls within the exclusion

12

period, only means of transportation or distance is

13

considered, but once the confession is outside that

14

period, then McNabb-Mallory applies and the confession

15

may still be admissible if the delay was necessary.

16

for those purposes, once we are determining whether

17

McNabb-Mallory requires inadmissibility, the court can

18

consider, for example, emergency hospital treatment or

19

unavailability of the magistrate.

20

factors can and do get considered once we get into the

21

determination of whether McNabb-Mallory requires

22

exclusion.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For that

So all of those

Well, that certainly is a

very back-door way of doing it, isn't it?
MR. McCOLGIN:

And

Not at all, Your Honor,
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because once we look at the structure of the statute

2

what it's doing is carving out the first six hours from

3

McNabb-Mallory.

4

in that carve-out period is limited to transportation

5

and distance, but once we are outside of it, we just

6

apply McNabb-Mallory, and that's McNabb-Mallory as it

7

has developed in the case law, which includes all of

8

these other considerations.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So the determination of whether we are

But why -- why was it

10

appropriate to have a special rule for transportation?

In other words, everything that is covered by the

transportation proviso would, on your theory would on

14

McNabb-Mallory anyway.

15

six-hour rule and leave any exceptions, transportation,

16

unavailability of magistrate, medical emergency,

17

whatever, to -- to the leeway that McNabb-Mallory

18

allows?

19

So why did they simply have a

MR. McCOLGIN:

Because the first question,

20

again, is just whether to exclude the confession

21

altogether from the McNabb-Mallory determination.

22

for those purposes, they -- some Senators from larger

23

States where there's greater distances to travel wanted

24

to make sure that there was an exception for

25

transportation and distance.

provisos.

It's as simple as that in your view?

However, Congress in -- in

I would suggest that Congress struck an
appropriate balance at that time, keeping McNabb-Mallory

in place for the more extreme types of delay, but

11

eliminating it from the shorter periods of delay.

12

in doing so, Congress struck an appropriate balance, and

13

I would suggest that this Court should respect the

balance that Congress has struck.

Thank

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Dreeben.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

It's important in this case to go back and

9

look at the original Rule of Exclusion that this Court

10

developed in the McNabb case in 1943 and then reiterated

11

in the Mallory case in 1957.

12

considered a pre-Miranda regime in which there was no

13

constitutional law that required that a suspect be

14

advised of his rights.

15

Both of those cases

Under Rule 5 of the Federal Rules of

16

Criminal Procedure and under statutes that preceded it

17

that were in effect at the time of McNabb, the only way

18

to ensure that a suspect was informed of his rights to

19

silence and counsel was to bring him before a

20

magistrate, and the magistrate would advise him of those

21

rights.

22

a judicial rule of evidence, an exclusionary rule under

23

the Court's supervisory power not as an effectuation of

24

something that Congress specifically intended but of its

25

own force as a way to backstop the Rule 5 requirement.

5

get to those, Mr. Dreeben:

6

Mallory Rule, what was available as a sanction for

7

violations of the rule of prompt presentment?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Stevens, I am not sure

that there is any evidentiary sanction.

10
11

Other than the McNabb-

No, not -- apart from an

12

MR. DREEBEN:

None has risen in the case law

14

safeguard of the enforcement of Rule 5 is the obligation

15

that is placed on the government and on government

16

agents to comply with rules of criminal procedure that

17

are valid.

18

I think the primary

So at the time that

an extra rule was necessary to give the government an

incentive to comply with prompt-presentment

22

requirements.

23

The very same factors are still at work

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't think that they

are, Justice Stevens, because the -- the critical thing

Alderson Reporting Company

that the Court was doing in Mallory and McNabb was

2

trying to come up with a way to ensure that suspects

3

were advised of their rights to protect against abuses

4

in the interrogation process.

5

constitutional solution to that lay years in the future.

6

It came in the form of Miranda.

not talking about a constitutional problem but a rule

considerable?

If you -- if you exceed the time limit,

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, certainly, Justice -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that enough of a

7

disincentive?

8

of the factors to be taken into account in deciding

9

whether the confession was voluntary.

10

If you delay too long, that delay is one

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, excessive delay can be a

11

12

account in determining -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

saying is that Rule 5(a), which just says bring

theoretically before a magistrate without unreasonable

delay, that that has no teeth; that that is effectively

unenforceable.

2

additional actor this Court, which struck that

3

supervisory powered balance in a pre-Miranda era, would

4

do well to consider whether the factors that motivated

still be evaluated the same way today.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think that as an

But isn't your -- I'm

sorry.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Rule 5 is about

10

unnecessary delay, and here we have a case, if I

11

remember the facts right, where the officer said, yes,

12

the reason we didn't bring him before a magistrate

13

sooner is because we wanted to get a confession from

14

him.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, what

16

happened in this case is that the suspect was given his

17

Miranda rights and waived them and agreed to give a

18

confession.

19

court which all have concluded that a waiver of Miranda

20

rights waives the right to prompt presentment.

21

question of whether there was in fact unnecessary delay

22

that would constitute a violation of Rule 5 has not been

23

litigated in this case.

24
25

There are three circuits and the D.C. local

of the argument.

So the

I must be losing the thread

It seems to me that McNabb and Mallory
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only provide punishment for excessive delay where there

2

has been a confession.

Isn't that right?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so long as the length

5

of the -- the delay can still be considered as one of

6

the elements in determining that the confession -- that

7

the confession is involuntary, there is still a degree

8

of incentive based upon only the confession.

9

it may not be as high a degree -- that it is

Now, it -

have to consider that any confession they may get within

15

It is certainly challengeable

It is still true they have

interrogate.

MR. DREEBEN:

-JUSTICE STEVENS:

If they don't get the

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

So if

Well, Justice Stevens, to the

extent that it is correct that a waiver of Miranda
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rights waives the prompt presentment right and prevents

2

an objection based on whatever survives of

3

McNabb-Mallory, the officers are doing nothing wrong if

4

they obtain a valid Miranda waiver; and this was just

5

not a factor that the Court had on the horizon when it

6

decided McNabb and Mallory.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't there a -- a new

8

factor now that the Court has decided Miranda?

9

you've argued that we should regard this in the

And

10

post-Miranda light, but I think there is at least one

11

way of doing that that cuts against the government's

12

argument and I would like your response to that.

13

That is that in the post-Miranda world in

14

practical terms, if a -- if a court in considering a

15

suppression motion finds that the Miranda warnings were

16

given and that after they were given this individual

17

said, okay, I'll talk, that is in practical terms the

18

end of the issue.

19

independent voluntariness concern is pretty much theory,

20

not practice.

The notion that there is a -- an

Given what I think is the, kind of the

22

real-world effect of Miranda -- say the magic words, get

23

the defendant to say, I'll talk, that's it -- doesn't it

24

make sense to have a further safeguard in something like

25

the six-hour rule understood as preserving
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

McNabb-Mallory after the six hours?

2

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Souter, I think

3

that is purely a question of policy of whether there

4

should be such a strong exclusionary rule that mandates

5

the barring from admission into evidence of a purely

6

voluntary confession where there's no dispute about its

7

voluntariness because the officers delayed beyond six

8

hours.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I agree with you; it

10

is an issue of policy.

11

argument for considering this as a post-Miranda case was

12

in effect a -- a policy context in which you wanted us

13

to decide this.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

But I thought your whole

It's a policy context that I

15

think Congress has decided in two different enactments,

16

and I think that if this Court were to reach it as a

matter of policy, it should revisit the balance that it

reached in McNabb-Mallory because of the changed legal

context.

Section 3501 on its face says

that in section (a) voluntary confessions are

admissible.

5

voluntariness, a court will consider a variety of

6

factors under the totality of the circumstances,

including prearraignment delay.

it attacks more directly the McNabb-Mallory rule.

have allowed less than six hours of delay to serve as a

basis for suppressing evidence.

it does not say that evidence is suppressed.

22

leaves that determination to other sources of law.

23

And to that extent it overrules

Outside of six hours,
It simply

In the government's view, the primary source

24

of law that controls the answer to that question is

25

subsection (a), which says that voluntary confessions

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

are admissible, and I believe that, as Justice -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If that is the answer, why

3

do we need (c) -- I mean, why did Congress need (c) at

4

all?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Congress never needed (c); (c)

6

in the government's view was always superfluous, even at

7

the time when it directly said delays shall never be the

8

grounds for suppressing a confession.

9

a provision in (a) that said voluntary confessions are

There was already

10

admissible and it was well understood that

11

McNabb-Mallory -- and this Court was very explicit on

12

the point -- excluded totally voluntary confessions.

13

So if this Court has nothing before it but

14

the text of the statute, subsection (a) makes voluntary

15

confessions admissible, and the only way that Petitioner

16

can get around that is to say that section 3501(c)

17

carved something out of subsection (a).

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if it doesn't, Mr.

19

Dreeben, what do the words "time limitation" mean in the

20

proviso?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

That's the limitation on a -

22

the period during which a court cannot rely exclusively

23

on delay within the meaning of the statute.

24

-- it carves out six hours from McNabb-Mallory plus

25

reasonable transportation delays, and it leaves the

3

Now, one source of law -- and this is where

But

5

McNabb-Mallory is not a constitutional rule of decision.

6

This Court has been clear, most recently in the

7

Sanchez-Llamas decision, that it is a rule of

8

supervisory power created by this Court.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are really asking the

10

Court to overrule McNabb-Mallory, because you say

11

Congress provided six hours, no McNabb-Mallory, but

12

after six hours the test is voluntariness -- only

voluntariness.

14

government's view of McNabb-Mallory.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

So there's nothing left under the

modification, Justice Ginsburg, is that I think Congress

19

a rule of law that takes precedence over a decision of

20

this Court that rests on its supervisory power.

21

It obviously cannot

Petitioner does not contend that

McNabb-Mallory was an interpretation of Rule 5 of the

predecessor statute that existed before Rule 5 and

This Court was explicit that the

address the issue of remedy.

3

And it's notable I think that in the

5

rule of exclusion was explicitly provided.

6

would have said:

And -- and when you have an exclusionary

rule, you enforce not only what you are talking about,

10

you also enforce all these other things that happen when

you bring a person before a magistrate and don't keep

him for 70 hours or something.

13

So why should we interpret (a) as setting

those other things aside and requiring us to overturn

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, McNabb and Mallory are

not constitutional decisions of this Court.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. DREEBEN:

No, of course not.

They were attempts to

20

effectuate a particular policy choice.

21

choice was one that Congress was free to revisit, and I

22

submit it did revisit in two different provisions, one

23

in 3501(a) and the other in Federal Rule of Evidence

24

402.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That policy

Did it say anything in the

legislative history, which interests me, that the

purpose of (a) is to overturn Mallory and McNabb?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Breyer, and I will

4

concede to you the legislative history on the point that

5

section (a) was considered to overrule Miranda and

6

subsection (c) was addressed to McNabb-Mallory.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Dreeben, Justice Breyer

8

suggested that there are rules of evidence other than

9

those based on the Constitution or McNabb-Mallory that

10

might result in the exclusion of a confession.

Maybe

11

there are such rules, but I'm trying to think of them.

12

I can't think of what they might be.

13

hearsay.

14

Is it common for a confession to be excluded under Rule

15

403?

Certainly it's not

Is it ever going to be ruled to be irrelevant?

Are there rules that would -

16

MR. DREEBEN:

I think in theory Rule 403 is

17

such a rule. Rule 16, which requires discovery

18

obligations, contains its own authorization for an

19

exclusionary rule.

20

those rules is that they are explicitly provided by

Congress.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I wasn't focusing on the

2

word "confession."

I was focusing on the words in (e),

3

which were "any self-incriminating statement."

4

that's why I asked you if you interpreted that to

5

include anything that the individual said after, say,

6

29 hours that might turn out to be adverse to that

7

defendant's interests.

And your answer to that was yes.

8

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
And I think you are right.

I think we agree on that.
So, if the defendant said, if you look under

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason I brought that

22

up is not to be technical.

The reason I brought it up

23

is to point out that there are many, many words that a

24

person could utter in confinement under 30 hours, which

25

in a variety of ways could stab him in the back without
39
Alderson Reporting Company

it having anything to do with Miranda, without it having

2

anything to do with coerced confession.

3

And similarly, there are many reasons for

4

bringing him forward that have nothing to do with

5

either.

6

could support retaining McNabb-Mallory, a matter about

7

which Congress said nothing.

8
9

And therefore, I wonder if all those reasons

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it would be quite

extraordinary for the Court to decide to revive its

10

supervisory power decisions in McNabb and Mallory.

11

clearly were aimed at the problem of incommunicado

12

detention with a suspect who did not know his Miranda

rights.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They

Mr. Dreeben, I tend to

15

think that what we should be focusing on is the language

16

of 3501.

17

understand about your argument is the following:

18

six -- the six-hour safe harbor applies only when the

19

confession is made voluntarily, right?

20

Can I bring you back to that?

What I do not
The

I would think that the proviso likewise

21

assumes voluntariness.

That is, the time limitation

contained in this subsection, it's a time limitation

23

applicable to voluntary confessions.

time limitation shall not apply in any case in which the

2

I think you have already voluntariness

3

assumed in the proviso, but you want us to go back and

4

re --

5

think that's -- that's a fair way to read it.

reconsider voluntariness under (a).

6

MR. DREEBEN:

I just don't

I think the statute, as we

7

read it, contains some overlap in voluntariness

8

requirement, and we interpret the voluntariness

9

reference in subsection (c) to really mean otherwise

10

voluntary; in other words, not to be deemed involuntary

11

solely on the basis of delay, but otherwise voluntary.

12
13

And in that sense section 3501(c) does
contain -

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:
way, too.

Well, I am reading it that

Otherwise voluntary is in the safe harbor.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Right.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then when you have a

18

proviso, which refers to the time limitation contained

19

in this subsection, it's a time limitation upon

20

voluntary confessions.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

It's a -- it's a limitation on

22

the time during which a judge may not rely on delay

23

alone to find a confession inadmissible.

24

subsection (c) does.

25

the confession to be inadmissible solely because of

That's all

It says, judge, you may not find

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

delay if it's within six hours plus reasonable

2

transportation delays.

3

And our interpretation of that language is

4

that the inadmissibility as you mentioned,

5

Justice Scalia, refers back to subsection (a), which

6

speaks about confessions that are admissible if they are

7

voluntarily given.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why didn't the statute

say, instead of saying inadmissible, shall not be found

10

involuntary solely by reasons of delay.

11

seems to me that your argument twain the two.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Because it

It is, and I think the reason

13

that it was written that way, Justice Souter, is it was

14

a direct attempt to make clear that McNabb-Mallory shall

15

not operate in the six-hour period after arrests and

16

before presentment.

17

It was an attempt to displace McNabb-Mallory

18

explicitly.

Originally it was to displace it

19

altogether.

As it ended up being written, it displaced

20

it for six hours.

21

the rest of the statute to determine what happens to

22

confessions that are taken outside of six hours.

23

would recognize that this makes subsection (c) in

24

certain respects unnecessary to achieve the result that

25

voluntariness controls.

And our submission is that you read

But the most that Petitioner argues and he

2

made it very clear today, the most that he argues is

3

that section 3501(c) leaves McNabb-Mallory to live

4

another day for confessions outside of six hours.

5

if that is true, then the government's position is that

problem of confessions in section 3501 and it dealt with

McNabb-Mallory in section 3501(c).

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We submit that the

But it is superfluous and

MR. DREEBEN:

It came many years before,

Justice Stevens.

In 1968 when Congress reacted to this

14

Court's Miranda decision and to McNabb-Mallory, it

15

passed section 3501.

16

that says the policy of the federal courts is that we

17

are not going to have evidence rules made any more by

18

case-by-case decision by the Supreme Court.

19

going to have them promulgated in a code of Federal

20

rules, and if the Court wants to change them, it can do

21

that through the revisory committee process, and it

22

would be open to Congress at any point, which has

superior ability to gather facts and to survey the

We could never acknowledge

something like that?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I think the Court did that

7

and quite properly did it, Justice Stevens, because rule

8

502 of the Federal Rules of Evidence -- 501 or 502 says

9

that principles of privilege shall be developed in light

10

of reason and experience, and so it was a specific grant

11

to this Court of the authority to do that.

12

But beyond that Congress did not intend that

13

the Court use supervisory powers to exclude relevant

14

evidence.

15

and bar want to get together and conclude as they did

16

not conclude in 1943 -- this is the point I was trying

17

to make to Justice Breyer -- in 1943 after this Court's

18

decision in McNabb, there was explicit consideration of

19

an exclusionary rule provision in rule 5; it engendered

20

enormous controversy; it was rejected; it was taken out

21

of the rule and it was never promulgated.

There is a rulemaking process; if the bench

22

So McNabb-Mallory exists not by virtue of

23

the rulemaking process but by virtue of a supervisory

24

decision of this Court more than half a century ago in

25

an entirely different legal climate, in a climate where
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the costs of excluding a reliable, probative confession

2

were not balanced against the benefits, if any, to be

3

achieved by enforcing of a prompt present requirement

4

through exclusion.

5

Since that time this Court's Miranda

6

jurisprudence has made it far more inappropriate for the

7

Court to conclude that the enforcement of a rule-based

8

mechanism which serves as a prophylactic to protect

9

voluntariness should now result in exclusion of a

10

confession when rule 501 says voluntary confessions come

11

in and section -- and rule 402 says that relevant

evidence comes in unless excluded by four sources -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any indication

15

of the rules advisory committee, any of their notes,

16

that 402 was meant to overturn McNabb-Mallory?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I -- Justice Ginsburg, the

18

rules advisory committee notes I think reflect an

19

expectation that McNabb-Mallory was the law.

20

submission is that the text of 402 is simply

21

inconsistent with that, because it is quite explicit in

22

limiting the sources of rules that can bar the admission

23

of admissible evidence; and the phrase that is in 402,

24

which is on page 29 of our brief, is "rules prescribed

25

by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority."

Now the advisory committee drafters may have

thought that that subsumed rule 5, but I think that is a

Not at all, because it was

25

based, because it was it was based on the existing
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statutes at the time of McNabb which were seen as

2

precluding presentment delay.

3

enactment of -- of rule 5, it was seen as based on that

4

as well.

5

And then after the

After -- in 1968 Mallory was also seen as

6

being incorporated into 3501(c) which is clear from the

7

citation in the advisory note to both Mallory and

8

3501(c).

9

leaving in place McNabb-Mallory, because McNabb-Mallory

was viewed as being pursuant to statutory authority -

11

pursuant to statutory authority because it was enforcing

statutory rights.

13

So rule 402 clearly does not in any way
overturn McNabb-Mallory.
I would like to address very quickly the

16

Miranda issue and note that you know, certainly,

17

although Miranda came into effect after McNabb-Mallory,

18

Miranda itself in rule 32 notes that the existence of

19

the Miranda warnings should not be seen as a basis for

20

disregarding the rights under McNabb and Mallory and the

21

importance of that exclusionary rule.

22

recognized that it was still important to have a

23

protection against presentment delay, and I think the

24

facts of this case illustrate that very well.

25

So Miranda itself

We have in this case a flagrant and
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deliberate violation of the right of prompt presentment,

2

where the agents admitted freely that they delayed the

3

presentment in order to obtain the confession.

4

again, if the Third Circuit were to be affirmed in this

5

case, it would be telling law enforcement around the

6

country that that sort of flagrant conduct is

7

permissible.

8
9

If -

Well, but that -

that sort of flagrant conduct would not be an issue if

10

it had been done within six hours, right?

That's correct.
The purpose of the

14

law enforcement officers, if it's voluntary, is

15

irrelevant under six hours.

16

MR. McCOLGIN:

As long as it is under six

17

hours, that's correct, there is no problem; and that's

18

because within six hours there is no delay.

Well, doesn't it

22

seem odd that the focus on flagrant conduct at 6:01 as

23

24

25

MR. McCOLGIN:

There has to be line-drawing

in this sort of case, so when you get close to the line,

2

you may have results that are dramatically different.

3

4

confession was 26 and a half hours after the arrest; and

5

6

deliberate delay for the purpose of obtaining the

confessions.

long as it is an expressed waiver of a right to prompt
