CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 09-338,

5

Renico v. Lett.

6
7

Mr. McGormley.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL D. McGORMLEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McGORMLEY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Because this is a habeas case arising from a

11
12

murder conviction obtained in the Michigan courts, the

13

threshold question under AEDPA is whether there is any

14

clearly established Supreme Court precedent that the

15

Michigan Supreme Court objectively, unreasonably applied

16

in rejecting Mr. Lett's claims that the trial court had

17

abused its discretion in -- in discharging the jury due

18

to deadlock.

19

The Sixth Circuit second-guessed on habeas,

20

ignored deference under AEDPA, as well as the broad

21

discretion, due the trial court determination.

22

there was a note suggesting acrimonious deliberations

23

received early on in the second day of deliberations,

24

followed by a second note suggesting a deadlock after

25

approximately 10 hours of trial testimony and 4 hours of

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Here

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deliberations.

2

The trial court at that time engaged the

3

foreperson in a colloquy, a two-part colloquy, in which

4

the foreperson not only confirmed the content of the

5

first note, but also confirmed the existence of a

6

deadlock.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

8

of the first note was a query of the court.

9

query was:

The content
And that

"What happens if we can't reach a verdict?"

10

Isn't that substantially different?

11

suggest that the jury is trying to figure out what are

12

the consequences of its actions and whether reaching a

13

consensus is possible?
MR. McGORMLEY:

14

Doesn't that

Well, Justice Sotomayor, the

15

first note was the note regarding our raised voices

16

disturbing other proceedings.

17

regards -­

18
19
20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The second note

Excuse me.

How long

before that last note was that?
MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, the Michigan Supreme

21

Court refers to that as early on in the second day of

22

deliberations.

23

and 15 more minutes of deliberations, because after the

24

second note -­

25

And then there is approximately 3 hours

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did anybody hear the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

voices?

2
3

MR. McGORMLEY:

The record doesn't disclose,

doesn't disclose that.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what

5

facts found by the lower courts or the trial courts show

6

that the Court acted, quote, and this is from our

7

earlier Perez case, the very first in this area,

8

"deliberately, responsibly, and not precipitously" in

9

declaring a mistrial.

10

What in the facts you have

recited -­

11

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. McGORMLEY:

-- show that activity?

Justice Sotomayor, the first

14

point I would make is that, of course, this is on habeas

15

review, and so the -- the Michigan Supreme Court made

16

factual findings here that would be due deference.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is the factual

18

finding that you think we have to give deference to?

19

know the facts you've recited.

20

any of the facts with respect to what occurred during

21

the activity.

22

give deference to?

23

I

There don't appear to be

So what factual finding do we have to

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, the factual finding by

24

the Michigan Supreme Court that -- that there appeared

25

to be acrimonious deliberations.

That's a factual

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

finding due deference under (e)(1).

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I'm not sure how

3

that finding supports the finding, or a finding, that

4

the Court was acting deliberately, responsibly, and not

5

precipitously.

6

MR. McGORMLEY:

Going back to this Court's

7

opinion in Perez, considering sound judgment,

8

discretion, considering all the circumstances, here we

9

have to look at the totality of the circumstances in

10

that it was a relatively short trial, that we have a

11

note that could be reasonably interpreted as acrimonious

12

deliberations, the second note that could be reasonably

13

construed as a deadlock.
And then the trial court did not declare a

14
15

mistrial at that point.

16

the jury out and engages in a colloquy.

17

colloquy, the trial court accepts the foreperson's

18

answer at her word.

20

"No."

21

22

that much weight on that statement by the foreperson.

23

Rather, the trial court brings

And that is:

And in that

"Are you going to be

And in fact, it's the Sixth Circuit who

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You can't place

Because the foreperson at

24

first hesitated.

When the court asked the question,

25

"Are you going to reach a unanimous verdict or not,"

then there's no response.

4

And only at that second point does the

MR. McGORMLEY:

I don't necessarily believe

it was a reluctant no.

do we?

10

And then the court says, "Yes

She might have been

I mean, we don't know what caused the pause,

MR. McGORMLEY:

That's correct,

Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

And that's another factor

12

in this.

13

because the trial court judge was there on the spot, saw

14

the jury, worked with the jury, that that's something

15

that deserves a special measure of respect?

16

We have the transcript.

MR. McGORMLEY:

Are you urging that,

Absolutely,

17

Justice Ginsburg.

18

broad discretion and special respect due the trial court

19

determination, after the trial court is the one viewing

20

the jury in real time.

21

this -- this risk of coercion was recognized also by

22

this Court in Arizona v. Washington.

23
24
25

And this Court has qualified that as

So absolutely.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And in fact,

May I ask you another

question about what happened?
After the foreperson said:

7
Alderson Reporting Company

No, Judge, we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are not going to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge

2

says:

3

is dismissed.

4

that we have is:

5

could set a new trial date.

6

-- was the defense attorney?

All right, I hereby declare a mistrial; the jury
And then the next entry in the transcript
Well, Mr. Gordon snuck away before we
Now, Mr. Gordon was defense

7

MR. McGORMLEY:

Correct, Your Honor.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

So when did he leave?

9
10

know when he left?

Do we

He was present when the judge said

that she was going to declare a mistrial?
MR. McGORMLEY:

11
12

that minute or so gap.

13

snuck out.

Correct.

I don't know when Mr. Gordon

19

I understand about deference, the
Just tell me a little bit about how this

Would it be good practice, in your view -­

20

and that may not control your case, but would it be good

21

practice for the -- a judge to have had exactly this

22

colloquy and then say:

23

talk with counsel.

24

this response, I am prepared to declare a mistrial.

25

you have any comment?

The jurors are dismissed while I

And you say:

Counsel, in light of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

Is that good practice?

2

MR. McGORMLEY:

It may be good practice, but

3

the question becomes whether it's constitutionally

4

required.

5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

if it's good practice as a general practice.

7
8

I'm asking -- I'm asking

MR. McGORMLEY:

I would say -- well, in this

Court -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because -- because that

will bear, ultimately, on a constitutional issue.

understand deference.

12

are in favor of what the State Supreme Court found.

13

just -- I want you to tell me how it works out there in

14

the real world?

I understand that all intendments

MR. McGORMLEY:

15

I

I'm

Well, I believe that

16

discussion with counsel is a factor in -- in the

17

consideration.

18

has never held that it's a requirement.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't dispute that.

But this Court

What if, in fact, there

20

isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not

21

declare a mistrial?

22

a mistrial?
MR. McGORMLEY:

23
24
25

Can the judge go ahead and declare

Absolutely.

And here -- and

here's why.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not a very big fact.

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, it's important in the

2

coercion context, because certainly the trial court has

3

an independent obligation to ensure a just judgment.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That independent

5

obligation is not reinforced by getting counsel's views

6

just as a matter of good practice?

7

MR. McGORMLEY:

It may be.

It may be

8

reinforced in certain circumstances, but again, we are

9

looking at the totality of the circumstances when we

10

have a note indicating acrimony, a note indicating

11

deadlock, and then the colloquy in which there's an

12

unequivocal -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, certainly it's good

14

practice.

15

necessity for a mistrial, then there isn't going to be a

16

double jeopardy issue in the case, isn't that right?

17

If both counsel agree that there is manifest

MR. McGORMLEY:

Correct.

Under Dennis, if

18

the defendant consents, then there is no double

19

jeopardy.

20
21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was there an objection here

by counsel for the defendant?
MR. McGORMLEY:

No.

No, there wasn't.

23

you know, the colloquy is relatively short.

24

believe the defendant's counsel could have objected.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But,

But no, I

Well, there was a ruling

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

by the court:

I hereby declare a mistrial.

2

you could have an objection, but it would be very -- the

3

jury was present when the judge said:

4

the mistrial.

I hereby declare

5

MR. McGORMLEY:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

awkward for the counsel at that is point.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

I suppose

Correct.
So it would be rather

There was no -- there was

no pause, you agree, between the foreperson's report and

10

the court then said immediately afterward:

11

dismissed.

So there was no interval for an objection?
MR. McGORMLEY:

12

The jury is

Well, it -- it would be

13

difficult for counsel to object at that point, but I

14

still think counsel could have made a record immediately

15

at that point.
JUSTICE ALITO:

16

Why would it have been

17

difficult?

18

say, may we have a sidebar, and say, Your Honor, I don't

19

think that there should be a mistrial, I think you

20

should ask the jury to deliberate further?

21

Why would it be difficult for counsel to

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, that is possible and

22

that as seen in the Webb case as well, where the trial

23

court -- this is a circuit court -­

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What do you make of the

fact that in subsequent proceedings the prosecutor

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

acknowledged that the judge made a mistake?

2

MR. McGORMLEY:

In Michigan confessions of

3

error are controlled by court rule as a procedural

4

matter, and the appellate courts have the ability to

5

accept statements that could be qualified as a

6

confession of error or not.

7

Court addressed this case on the merits, the underlying

8

double jeopardy merits.

9

not address potential waiver or consent issues by the

10

defendant.

In much the same way, it did

So we have a merits opinion here.
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Here the Michigan Supreme

There are thousands and

12

thousands of mistrials every year and hung juries are

13

not all that unusual.

14

16

little -- I think you can argue it both ways that the

So in this case we have testimony
And we have jury

And he doesn't consult with the lawyer, all

20

right.

Now, in these thousands and thousands of cases

21

that must be there over the decades, you probably looked

22

through a few or at least talked to your fellow bar

23

members.

24

that a mistrial was declared despite facts that are on

25

your side?

How many have you found where you would say

In other words, there are going to be

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

millions of cases, not millions but thousands; many of

2

them will support the defense.

3

But I haven't seen any here that say they support you.

4

So how many do?

5

that this is not an extreme case that counts as an abuse

6

of the judge's discretion?

7

will prove to me this is not, this is closer to the

8

norm?

9

Maybe many support you.

And what do you want me to read to see

How many did you find which

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, the difficult part in

10

answering Your Honor's question is that this Court has

11

indicated that there is no mechanical formula or test.
JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Correct.

That's why I am

13

asking the question.

What they've said is, is it an

14

abuse of discretion?

And they've also said the judge

15

has to be careful.

16

discretion scale and this is pretty far over on the

17

abuse of discretion side.

18

But what cases will show to me that it's on your side,

19

not quite an abuse of discretion?

20

extreme case in history?

21
22

Okay, so we have like an abuse of

I think anyone would admit.

MR. McGORMLEY:

Or is this the most

I don't believe it is, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

23

I know you don't believe

24

it.

All I want you to do is to give me some evidence,

25

like refer me to some other cases or explain to me how

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you have come to that conclusion, not on the facts of

2

this case, but looking on the scale.
MR. McGORMLEY:

3
4

I reach that conclusion by

looking at this Court's other language, for instance -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't want you to look at

6

this Court.

We don't have a case where we said what was

7

an abuse of discretion.

8

I've already said this twice, but I am judging from your

9

answer you found no case supporting it.

I want you to tell me -- and

You have found

10

no case in the history of the United States that was

11

more extreme than this -­

12

MR. McGORMLEY:

I have not -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- where they said it

14

wasn't an abuse of discretion.

15

from your answer.
MR. McGORMLEY:

16

That's what I'm judging

I have not found a case on

17

these facts with a note indicating acrimonious

18

deliberations, that is correct.

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is no note

3

What about lunch?

4

What if we can't agree?

And at 12:27, the same time, they said:

Then he brought them out and he says to the

us don't believe that.

So that's why

I ask the question.
MR. McGORMLEY:

But the reference there

about don't say what you're going to say is likely a

14

reference to don't give the breakdown of your verdict.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. McGormley, is it your

16

burden to answer that question?

17

to you to show that this case is within the mainstream

18

or is it up to the other side to show rather

19

conclusively that it is not in the mainstream?

20

thought that's what AEDPA required.

21

MR. McGORMLEY:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Given AEDPA, is it up

I

It is Petitioner's burden.
It is Petitioner's burden

23

to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to

24

show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no

25

discharge of the jury.

And I'm not aware that they have

15
Alderson Reporting Company

carried that burden.

But we will ask when they come up.

It is their burden, however.

10

I haven't found a case on

these facts, but that's consistent -­

8
9

You haven't found a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Have you found any case

where a judge has declared a mistrial without conferring
with counsel, where the declaration was upheld?
MR. McGORMLEY:

11

Actually, there's one out of

12

the Sixth Circuit, Klein v. Leis, from this very

13

circuit, in which the individual -- it was not a

14

deadlocked jury case, but the individual had some sort

15

of stun or control belt on the defendant and he lifted

16

it up, and the trial court -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well you can't read from

18

that one, because in that one it was -- the mistrial was

19

held, not because of a jury deadlock, but because of

20

improper prejudicial actions during the trial.

21

MR. McGORMLEY:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23
24
25

But that's -­
Those are different

questions.
MR. McGORMLEY:
necessity determination.

But it's still a manifest
In fact, this Court has

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

indicated that on the spectrum of reasons a deadlocked

2

jury warrants the least amount of appellate scrutiny.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3
4

Could you -- yes, but

that doesn't mean none.

5

What -- other than we have cases where

6

judges have declared mistrials because they are going on

7

vacation.

8
9

Those are easy, okay?
But somewhere the word "abuse of discretion"

means that someone has discretion, but is improperly

10

exercising it.

What facts would it take for you to

11

believe that that would have been the case?

12

have to take out of this case to say, ah, that was -­

13

that would have been an abuse of discretion?

14

point?

15

would be enough, right?

What do you

What

If he got the note and declared a mistrial, that
Or would it?

MR. McGORMLEY:

16

Well, to best answer Your

17

Honor's question, I would point out again that in

18

Arizona this Court mentioned that examples being of

19

abuse of discretion or actions that cannot be condoned

20

are when the trial court acts irrationally,

21

irresponsibly, or for pretextual reasons.

22

yellow brief we cited several cases where I would say

23

the Court was correct to find an abuse of discretion -­

24

the Starling case in which the jury is giving a contrary

25

indication.

And in our

The jury in the Starling case indicated

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, we are making progress and in fact can we have 15

2

more minutes; and the judge pulse them out and declares

3

a mistrial.

4

Your Honor's example then with the Gordy

5

case would be the imminent travel plans and docket

6

considerations.

7

We also have where the court acts sua

8

sponte, and that's where -- the Webb case, where the

9

trial court -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't that this one,

11

meaning the jury doesn't say, we are deadlocked,

12

hopelessly deadlocked, we cannot reach a verdict.

13

asks:

14

hasn't conferred with the jury to determine whether or

15

not as a group they believe they are hopelessly

16

deadlocked.

What happens if we don't?

17

It

And the foreperson

Why isn't this precipitous action?
MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, again, as I -- as I

18

mentioned, it's a reasonable view of the first note that

19

it is indicative of acrimony.

20

the second note that it was indicative of a deadlock.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a reasonable view of

But again, that's --that's

22

not your burden.

We are operating here under a statute

23

which says:

24

application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in

25

custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a

"In a proceeding instituted by an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

shall be presumed to be correct.

3

have the burden of rebutting the presumption of

4

correctness by clear and convincing evidence."

5

The applicant shall

Now, what is the factual

6

determination that has been made here?

7

the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked.

8

MR. McGORMLEY:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

That is correct.
And that has to be rebutted

by clear and convincing evidence, correct?

11

MR. McGORMLEY:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

I assume it's

That's correct.
Why didn't you answer that

to those questions.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

But what is the status of

15

the -- the Allen charge in Michigan?

16

a position on whether that's a good thing, a permissible

17

thing for a trial court to do?
MR. McGORMLEY:

18

Has Michigan taken

Well, a -- Michigan has

19

adopted the ABA standard.

20

3.12.

21

dynamite charge because it's not asking the minority to

22

give credence to the majority's opinion.

So there is a

23

deadlocked jury instruction in Michigan.

It's not the

24

traditional Allen dynamite charge.

25

Michigan has the Instruction

It's not what we would call the traditional Allen

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, that was not -- that

was not done here.

But again, I think it's reasonable,

4

understanding that this is a dual -- dual-layered

5

deference case, being a habeas case as well as the trial

determination, that when you have -- have the notes -- I

felt that giving an Allen charge when there's acrimony

10

may be telling those minority jurors that it doesn't

opinion.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you as a matter

of Michigan practice, could the trial judge have

interrogated the other jurors beyond the foreman and

asked them what they thought about whether there was a

deadlock?

Well, what other

circumstance is relevant?

18

their voices during deliberation, certainly that -- that

19

doesn't cut any ice either way, does it?

20

MR. McGORMLEY:

The fact that they raised

Well -- oh, I believe it

21

does, because this Court has indicated in Arizona

22

that -- that acrimony is a concern.

23

countervailing concern to balancing the interest of the

24

defendant having his case decided by a single tribunal

25

and fair and just judgments, as well as society having

21
Alderson Reporting Company

It's a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one fair opportunity to vindicate its laws.

2

it's very much an appropriate consideration.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

So I think

Mr. McGormley, what

4

evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not

5

deadlocked?

6

MR. McGORMLEY:

None.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is presumably what

8

the other side has to prove by clear and convincing

9

evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the

10

State court.
MR. McGORMLEY:

11

Correct.

That's why it's

imperative to view this case in the habeas box that it

14

objectively unreasonably apply this Court's precedent.

16

And the fact that we may look at these notes and go one

17

way or the other means that the State wins.

18

should prevail, because it's a reasonable interpretation

19

of those notes.

20

that that really indicates deadlock and the Michigan

21

Supreme Court is looking at it and it's a reasonable

22

determination, then deference should apply and the State

23

should prevail.

should add the firearms count, or the other way around.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In which case they would

18

be much closer than -- than your comment about acrimony

19

might indicate.

20

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, it gets back to the

21

fundamental principle that the trial court should be

22

able to take -- now, this is on the second, but the

23

initial layer of deference -- that the trial court

24

should be able to take the foreperson at her word when

25

she says that the jury is deadlocked, the jury is

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deadlocked, especially -- especially in light of

2

these -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

You can't say, can you,

4

that every time the jury records that it can't reach a

5

verdict or it hasn't reached a unanimous verdict, that

6

that's a legal deadlock requiring a mistrial, can you?

7

MR. McGORMLEY:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

I do not assert that.
So obviously the word

"deadlock," and as I read the judge's questions, he

10

defined it merely as a disagreement as to the verdict.

11

And later he uses "hopelessly deadlocked," but changes

12

the question when he asks the foreperson to respond.

13

Isn't there a difference between hopelessly,

14

i.e., no further deliberations is likely to reach a

15

verdict, as opposed to you can't ever reach a verdict?
MR. McGORMLEY:

16

Well, I guess I don't quite

17

see the difference, because if the jury is in -- I -- I

18

think hopelessly deadlocked is probably a higher

19

standard than -- than genuinely deadlocked.

20

said just before she got the response.

No, judge.

2

MR. McGORMLEY:

It's a bifurcated question,

3

correct.

4

confirming the nature of their note, and then, even with

5

the interruption, there are -- twice the court

6

approaches this inability to reach a unanimous verdict.

7

I mean, the -- the first one was regarding

So again, here, what is paramount is that

8

it's the Michigan Supreme Court did not objectively

9

unreasonably apply this Court's clearly established

10

precedent.

There -- there is no case that flatly

11

controls this case, other than the Braun-Perez standard.

12

In fact, the Sixth Circuit here created its own

13

three-part test, as we've indicated in our brief, when

14

they said that there are three considerations that

15

determine.

16

So when you take that three-part test, which

17

is not this Court's holdings and test on habeas, as well

18

as the second-guessing of those predicate factual

19

determinations being, well, the jury probably didn't

20

have enough time to even review the witnesses, juries

21

often report themselves deadlocked, we can't give as

22

much weight to this foreperson's statement, it's

23

contrary to these dual layers of deference.

24
25

And if there are no further questions, may I
reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARLA R. McCOWAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MS. McCOWAN:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Habeas relief was properly granted.

I would

8

like to first answer Justice Ginsburg's somewhat easy

9

question for me.

Judge Brown was sworn into service on

10

January 1st of 1991.

At the time of this trial she had

11

been on the bench approximately 6-1/2 years.

12

disputing her experience as a trial judge.

We are not

13

I do disagree with my friend's contention

14

that the Sixth Circuit articulated any specific test.

15

What the Sixth Circuit did was set forth some

16

considerations or some guidelines, including the first

17

of which, that the court heard the -- heard the opinions

18

of the parties.

19

Kennedy, toward the idea that the judge is exercising

20

sound discretion.

21

And that does go a long way, Justice

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what would

22

be gained from that?

23

let's say one says yes and the other says no.

24

to grant a mistrial, you shouldn't.

25

I -- the parties, one says -­

MS. McCOWAN:

You ought

Well, at the very least, it

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidences that the trial judge at least considered that

2

there were -- that there competing interests and -- and

3

debated whether to -- to dismiss the jury, which is an

4

extraordinarily drastic remedy.

5

And instead, our position is that there

6

really is no down side to talking with counsel.

7

would be able to have the benefit of the parties'

8

arguments.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You

Do people usually -­

10

in your experience is there usually a clear breakdown

11

between prosecution and defense on a question like this?

12

My perhaps uninformed view is presumably the defense, if

13

they have got a deadlocked jury, they want that to

14

continue, because all they need is, you` know, one

15

holdout.

16

MS. McCOWAN:

My -- my experience -- there

17

is a range of things that are going on.

I'm sorry, I

18

can't -- I -- I think it just -- it just depends on a

19

variety of the circumstances.

20

case law generally presumes that the defendant does want

21

the first jury to deliberate to verdict.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But yes, I think that the

Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are

23

-- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the

24

only question for us is whether it was an abuse of

25

discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

here.

2

That would certainly be the case if this is

3

coming up through the Federal system and we had a

4

Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but

5

it is not.

6

Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to

7

reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with

8

State justice.

9

where there has been a factual finding by the State

It -- it is coming up from a State court and

And that statute says specifically that

10

court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal

11

courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing

12

evidence.

13
14
15

Now, what clear and convincing evidence is
there here that there was not a deadlocked jury?
MS. McCOWAN:

Well, first, I am not sure

16

that I understand -- I -- I disagree with the -- with

17

the premise that -- that there was a factual finding by

18

the trial court that the jury was in fact deadlocked.

19

The judge acquired or extracted the "no" answer and then

20

immediately declared a mistrial.

21
22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The ruling that -­

Well, what was the basis

for that declaration of mistrial?
MS. McCOWAN:

facts it would be that -- that -- her estimation that

the jury was deadlocked.

the reason for the -­

8
9

And instead, what we are focused here

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Michigan Supreme

Court's determination is simply a determination of the

10

same fact:

There was a manifest necessity because the

11

jury was deadlocked.

12

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, my -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, that factfinding is

14

implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did,

15

but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision.

16

MS. McCOWAN:

My understanding of manifest

17

necessity is that that was a legal determination by the

18

Michigan Supreme Court, that there was -- according to

19

this Court's precedent, there was manifest necessity.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If the jury is

would not constitute manifest necessity?

3

MS. McCOWAN:

4

Generally, yes -- yes, I

But in -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

The Michigan Supreme Court

5

cited four factors in support of its decision:

the

6

length of the deliberations in relation to the

7

complexity of the case, the heated discussions among the

8

jurors, the fact most importantly that the foreperson

9

said that the jury would not be able to reach a

10

unanimous verdict, and the fact that there was no

11

objection by defense counsel.
Is there any decision in this Court that

12
13

says that under -- that in a case in which those four

14

factors are present, that the trial judge may not grant

15

a mistrial?

16
17
18

MS. McCOWAN:

No, there are no specific

requirements.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And is there -- could you

19

give us a long list of -- of lower court cases holding

20

that in a case where those four factors are present, a

21

trial judge may not grant a mistrial?

22

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, no.

But the law does

23

still require that the judge exercise sound discretion

24

in -- in making a determination that there -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

The question is when those

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

four factors are present, why are they not sufficient to

2

establish that the judge was exercising sound

3

discretion?

4

perhaps a huge body of lower court case law, saying

5

that, no, even when those four factors are present you

6

may not grant a mistrial, how do you justify the

7

conclusion that you are asking us to draw?

8

Unless there is a decision of this Court or

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, I -- I under -- I think

I understand the question.

I do -- I do recognize that

there are no specific requirements, and that in the

11

absence of that, that there is nothing specific that the

MS. McCOWAN:

3

Well, I -- I -- I did

undertake tremendous research, as did my staff, and I

did not find -- I mean, a short answer is I did not find

6

anything that looks even remotely as bad as this.

Now -­

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
me then what did you find?

Oh, that's good.

Now, tell

When you say "remotely as

10

bad," then you perhaps found some where contention was

11

rejected, or where contention -- what did you find?

12

What did you find by way of cases where they said on

13

facts as bad as this, or not quite as bad as this, there

14

was no manifest necessity?
MS. McCOWAN:

15

Well, I guess the short answer

16

is that --- that there was nothing exactly on point.

17

mean, there were -- there were cases where the judge

18

acted abruptly and hastily and then there were cases

19

where the judge did consider the -- the options of the

20

parties.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the -- so the

proposition that what happened here is an abuse of

right?

25

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, I don't think that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

has to be established at -- at a granular level.

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, I -- I do believe that

this case looks something like -- Jorn, which is a

11

plurality opinion from this Court, where the trial judge

12

acted without warning, acted sua sponte, no warnings to

13

the parties whatsoever, and immediately declared a

14

mistrial; was acting irrationality, irresponsibly -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the fact that

16

it's a plurality opinion means that it was not clearly

17

established by the decisions of this Court.

18

MS. McCOWAN:

But in Arizona v. Washington

19

this Court quoted Jorn for the proposition that when the

20

trial judge acts irrationally and irresponsibly and

21

precipitously, that their action -- that their ruling

22

will not be upheld; and instead, sound discretion

23

requires that the trial judge act carefully and

24

deliberately.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But our -- but our cases

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have required much -- much more than that, much more

2

than referring to a generalized standard that our

3

opinions have set forth.

4

that the application of that standard in our opinions

5

comports with the provision of the statute that requires

6

you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that

7

was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application

8

of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by

9

the Supreme Court of the United States.

10

They have required proving

Now, our cases don't show that you can

11

simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of

12

discretion standard, that was clearly established by the

13

Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I

14

have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion.

15

don't think so.

16

that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover

17

your situation.

18

I

I think our cases show you have to show

And you don't have any cases like that.

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, I do understand -- well,

19

I guess the best answer that I have for that is that,

20

why there are no cases, is maybe because -- I mean, I

21

don't know, but what I -- what I came up with or

22

theorized is that I think that for the most part trial

23

courts understand that this is a tremendous obligation

24

that they must exercise sound discretion.

25

most part for 186 years this has pretty much worked.

That's

not what the statute says.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your -- your

12

position was that everybody agrees on what the law is:

13

If there is a deadlock, a new trial is appropriate.

14

there is no question about that statement of the law.

15

It's the fact question, was this a deadlock, and up

16

until now we have been talking about this, including

17

Justice Scalia, under the fact problem of AEDPA; that

18

is, have you shown by clear and convincing evidence.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, is it quite correct

20

to say the legal issue is whether there's a deadlock?

21

Isn't the legal issue whether there was a manifest

22

necessity to take the action?

23

MS. McCOWAN:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

So

Isn't that the test?

Precisely, Your Honor.
And the argument is that

there was not a manifest necessity shown, even though

36
Alderson Reporting Company

there was disagreement about whether there was a

2

deadlock, because all deadlocks are not exactly alike.

did come down to the factual determination of deadlock,

because if there is deadlock then there is manifest

necessity.

16

MS. McCOWAN:

I'm sorry.

I though that,

that the trial judge exercised -- that there was

5

manifest necessity in the absence of the trial judge

6

exercising sound discretion.

7

I believe that the case ultimately

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

With the layers -­

8

with the two layers of deference worked into your

9

formulation.

It's not simply whether the trial court

10

erred in the determination that there was a deadlock

11

that constitutes manifest necessity; it's whether or not

12

there was an abuse of -- of discretion for the trial

13

judge to so determine that we review under an additional

14

abuse of discretion standard.

15

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, my understanding of 2254

16

is that it does take into consideration the contours of

17

the underlying constitutional violation, and it still is

18

our position that if the -- if the trial judge was not

19

exercising sound discretion, that it -- that it can't be

20

objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court

21

to have found that, that that is necessarily

22

contemplated by 2254.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't our law

24

clearly establish the fact that the prosecution bears

25

the burden of showing there's manifest necessity, and if

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is an absence of evidence supporting that burden,

2

hasn't been -- hasn't been -- why isn't that the answer

3

to the case?

4

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, that certainly sounds

5

fair.

I don't want to quibble, but I think that the -­

6

my understanding of the law is that when -- when there

7

is an objection by the defense, then the burden is on

8

the prosecution.

9

to object.

10

In this case, there was no opportunity

So I'm not sure that -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why is that -- why is

11

that so?

If Mr. Gordon thought that this jury was

12

11-to-1 for acquittal, do you think he would have been

13

reluctant to ask for a sidebar and object to the

14

granting of a mistrial?
MS. McCOWAN:

15

I think, yes, practically -­

16

practically speaking, I think he probably would have

17

been reluctant to jump up and -- I mean, this is a

18

Friday afternoon and the judge has essentially released

19

them for the day.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

What does he have to lose

21

at that point?

She has made the ruling and that's that

22

there is going to be a mistrial.

23

point can say:

24

would like you to give the Michigan version of the Allen

Nothing stopped the lawyer from doing that.

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, I think just as a

2

practical matter, having the jury hear that the defense

3

does not want the jury to leave, the potential for

4

prejudice would be tremendous.

5

matter, I think that the parties would have been

6

reluctant to do that.

7

And as a practical

And I think -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you really saying that?

8

You're saying that a lawyer in your office defending a

9

client who thinks that the jury is leaning, is 11-to-1

10

for acquittal, and the judge says, well, we're going to

11

have a mistrial and the acquittal is going out the

12

window, the lawyer is going to be reluctant to say:

13

Judge, may we have a sidebar, and then go to the sidebar

14

and object to the granting of a mistrial?

15

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, I -- I'm not sure how we

16

-- we would know on these facts that the jury was 11-to­

17

1 for acquittal.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'm not suggesting

19

that they were or they weren't.

20

what defense counsel would do in that situation.

21

they are more timid in Michigan than the ones I'm

22

familiar with.

23

hesitant to raise an objection if they thought it was

24

going to prejudice the client.

25

I'm just asking about
Maybe

I would think that they would not be

MS. McCOWAN:

I certainly would hope so as

40
Alderson Reporting Company

well.

2

so fast and without warning and truly without any

3

opportunity to object.

4

think that the lack of objection really doesn't do

5

anything to fortify the conclusion that there was

6

manifest necessity in these facts.

explanation is there for a note saying "Are we being too

loud," other than that there was some degree of acrimony

13

on the jury?
MS. McCOWAN:

14

Michigan Supreme Court even made a specific finding that

the jury had become -- had completely devolved at that

point and they were no longer -- I think that -­

No, you don't

dispute the fact that a note came out saying, Are we

Not at all.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what would

23

that indicate other than that there was some degree of

acrimony?

25

MS. McCOWAN:

I think it just also indicates

they maybe they just don't want anybody to hear them and

they want to make sure that they are not being

their deliberations and freedom to, you know, engage

5

in a -- in a free debate, as loud as they want to be.

6

I don't think that there is -- I mean, I

7

suppose what I'm trying to say, however inartfully, is

8

that I don't think we can do anything other than just

9

take that note at face value.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's it.

It did

Well, maybe that's right

14

and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that

15

it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be.

16

say:

17

we are bound to accept the factual determination of the

18

State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing

evidence that that's wrong.

20

I'm not sure -- I mean, maybe

I am just not understanding the Michigan Supreme Court

opinion, but I don't know that they actually made a

And I -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, there is no

case in our jurisprudence with identical or nearly

10

identical facts, so this is not under the "contrary to"

11

prong of 24 -- of 2254(d)(1).
So it has to be under the "unreasonable

12
13

application."

Particularly for me, what Supreme Court

14

precedent do you think was unreasonably applied, and

15

explain how and why?
MS. McCOWAN:

16

I think Arizona v. Washington

17

clearly establishes the law that the trial judge must

18

exercise sound discretion in finding a manifest

19

necessity.

20

objectively unreasonable for the Michigan Supreme Court

21

to have found that there was manifest necessity in the

22

absence of any discretion being exercised whatsoever by

23

the trial judge.

24
25

And in this case, on these facts, it was

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in that case, one of

the specific factors was that he consulted with -- the

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge consulted with counsel before making the ruling?

2
3

MS. McCOWAN:

In this case, that he -- that

the trial judge failed?

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

MS. McCOWAN:

In -- in Arizona.

Oh, right.

In -- right,

6

exactly.

7

found is that -- that the judge did exercise discretion;

8

that was -- that was evidenced by the judge giving the

9

parties an opportunity to weigh in on it.

10

In Arizona v. Washington, what this Court had

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a little shaky as

11

precedent for -- that -- that was a case that said:

12

trial judge did right and no double jeopardy for a new

13

trial.

14

Well, this case didn't involve that.

15

isn't passing on anything other than the trial judge in

16

that case didn't violate defendant's right.

17

The

But in passing, to get there, the Court said:

MS. McCOWAN:

But the Court

But I thought that this Court

18

did say that in any mistrial declaration, the trial

19

judge is obligated to still exercise sound discretion,

20

and a review in court must satisfy itself that, in

21

accordance with Perez, that the judge did in fact

22

exercise sound discretion in finding that there was

23

manifest necessity.

24
25

And I think that this case looks different
from Washington and may be similar to what was going on

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in Jorn, where the judge acted without warning, without

2

any opportunity for the parties to weigh in on the

3

matter, and simply declared a mistrial, which this Court

4

found to be irrational, irresponsible, and precipitous.

5

And we -­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

So are you suggesting that

7

whenever the trial judge abuses his or her discretion in

8

granting a mistrial, there can be relief under AEDPA?

9

It is clearly established that whenever there is an

10

abuse of discretion, relief can be granted under AEDPA.

11

It is an unreasonable application of our precedent?
MS. McCOWAN:

12

I'm sorry.

Just to clarify.

13

You are saying if the trial judge abused -- in fact

14

abuses his discretion?

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

MS. McCOWAN:

Right.
Yes.

I think that if the

17

Michigan -- on these facts, for the Michigan Supreme

18

Court to have found that there -- that there was

19

manifest necessity in the absence of the judge

20

exercising any discretion whatsoever, that that was in

21

fact, an unreasonable application of this Court's

22

precedent.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the standard of review

24

for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme

25

Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court

2

of appeals despite AEDPA?

3

whether there has been an abuse of discretion.

4

has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment?

5

MS. McCOWAN:

We simply look and see

No, I'm sorry.

If there

To clarify, it

6

still has to be whether -- we are looking at the

7

Michigan Supreme Court's decision here.

8

habeas, you are looking at the last reasoned State

9

court's opinion.

10

We are in -- on

And if the State supreme court -- the last

11

reasoned court opinion says -- makes an objectively

12

unreasonable determination, under this Court's clearly

13

established precedent then relief will be warranted.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

But it's objectively

15

unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse

16

of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?

17

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, if the trial judge does

18

not exercise any discretion whatsoever and acts

19

irrationally, irresponsibly, and precipitously, I

20

believe that relief would be warranted, even under

21

habeas review.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

So it's not just abuse of

23

discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something

24

else?

25

Plus what?
MS. McCOWAN:

Well, it's -- it's whether the

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Michigan -- whether the -- the decision under review,

2

whether it was an objectively unreasonable determination

3

of this Court's precedent.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you -- you do

5

agree that there could be situations where a Federal

6

court on direct review would find abuse of discretion,

7

and yet a court on habeas under AEDPA would say that

8

that has to stand?

9

MS. McCOWAN:

Yes.

And I want to clarify.

10

I think my understanding is that it's not just whether

11

this Court disagrees.

12

objectively unreasonable determination.

13

just simply whether -- whether this Court or any habeas

14

court reviewing it would come to a different conclusion.

15

It still has to be objectively unreasonable.

16

It does still has to be an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's not

So there are a

17

category of cases where a Federal court could look at it

18

and say, that's an abuse of discretion, but that same

19

court reviewing it under habeas would say you are not

20

entitled to relief under AEDPA?

21

MS. McCOWAN:

I think that that is right.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But "objectively

23

unreasonable" is already built into the criterion of

24

abuse of discretion.

25

what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the

You don't abuse your discretion if

1

ballpark.

It seems to me you are doubling up here.

2

I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works.
MS. McCOWAN:

3

Well, our argument is that the

4

trial court was not in the ballpark here.

5

court in this case did not exercise any discretion

6

whatsoever, let alone sound discretion.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The trial

How can you say

8

that?

I mean, you may think the discretion was abused,

9

but it's not like he just suddenly announced there was

10

going to be a mistrial.

11

looked at the note, he asked the question, he's -- are

12

you hopelessly deadlocked?

13

reach a unanimous verdict?

14

He exercised discretion.

He

Are you going to be able to

And he was able to rely on the fact that

15

they had previously sent out a note saying, are we being

16

too loud, and the fact he knew, 4-1/2 hours on a case in

17

which there were 10 hours of testimony.

18

I mean, I understand your argument that he

19

abused his discretion, but I don't understand the

20

argument that he didn't exercise discretion at all.

21

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, my -- my argument is

22

that the judge was not exercising sound discretion

23

because she was not responsibly gathering the facts.

24

She reached the conclusion that the jury was genuinely

25

deadlocked before she even asked a single question.

48
Alderson Reporting Company

She

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, she asked the

foreperson a question.

4

MS. McCOWAN:

couple lines, she received the note saying:

can't agree.

7

that, that that is your situation at this time.

And she said:

What if we

I have to conclude from

So she had already reached the conclusion

9

that they were deadlocked before even asking a single

question.

could the court be concerned that the person was about

to say, and again with deference to the court, "The

majority -- majority of us don't believe that" -- that

the defendant is guilty, that the defendant is innocent.

18

Wasn't the judge quite correct to stop her right there?

MS. McCOWAN:

Well, it may be correct to

20

stop her right there, but there is other ways to figure

21

out exactly what the foreperson was trying to explain.

And if she was trying to say, well, the majority of us

think we can keep going, then it was -- it was incumbent

The

186 years ago when it was

14

something like "sound, careful, exercise patience" -- or

15

whatever, "the sound, careful exercise of discretion."

16

They said there was.

17

that reasonable?

18

"Hey, we have only been deliberating half an hour and

19

the game starts in five minutes, I've got to get

20

there -- dismissed," that would be unreasonable.

And the question for us is, was

Okay?

I guess if the judge had said,

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Objectively unreasonable.

23

So come as close as you can to that, where they held

24

reasonable, and what case is it?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. McGormley, you have

stressed throughout that it's not -- not the question

that Justice Breyer put, but there are two -- you have

emphasized the two screens.

have the trial court ruling and the Michigan Supreme

Court ruling.

Federal system.

This comes to us after we

this is not a very easy -­

Correct, Justice Ginsburg,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

May I ask you, do you

12

think the most relevant precedent from this Court -­

13

would you agree that the most relevant precedent from

14

this Court is Arizona v. Washington?

15

MR. McGORMLEY:

I would not.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MR. McGORMLEY:

And I -­

Why not?
The reason why, Justice

18

Stevens, is because Arizona was not even a deadlocked

19

jury case.

20

what an abuse of discretion would be.

And there is language that helps flesh out

What do you think the most

(Laughter. )

3

MR. McGORMLEY:

My best answer, Justice

4

Breyer, is that the best cases I have are -- are

5

those -- are those two, because this -- this Court has

6

never overruled a manifest necessity determination due

7

to a deadlocked jury.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you suggesting that

you need a precedent overruling a lower court decision

10

before we could declare that something was

11

unreasonable -- that our precedent was unreasonably

12

applied?

13

MR. McGORMLEY:

No, my point is that -- is

in the 186 years since Perez it's never happened.

does not happen.

And that is consistent with the broad

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that could also be

18

consistent with the fact that Perez was clear enough

that judges have to act slowly and --and with thought,

and that lower courts are catching those when they are

saying.

I mean, I don't know how it cuts, is what I'm

MR. McGORMLEY:

Well, I -- I think it is

25

this has never happened before.
