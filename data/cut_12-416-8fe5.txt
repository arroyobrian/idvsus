ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

As a general matter, a payment from one

12

business to another in exchange for the recipient's

13

agreement not to compete is an paradigmatic antitrust

14

trust violation.

15

such a payment should be treated as lawful when it is

16

encompassed within the settlement of a patent

17

infringement suit.

18

The question presented here is whether

The answer to that question is no.

Reverse payments to settle Hatch-Waxman

19

suits are objectionable for the same reasons that

20

payments not to compete are generally objectionable.

21

They subvert the competitive process by giving generic

22

manufacturers an incentive to accept a share of their

23

rival's monopoly profits as a substitute for actual

24

competition in the --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why are payments not

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to compete different from, let's say, dividing a market?

2

I mean, suppose there's a lawsuit, somebody challenging

3

the validity of the patent and the patentee agrees to

4

allow the person challenging the patent to have

5

exclusive -- exclusive rights to sell in a particular

6

area.

7

Does that violate the antitrust laws?

8

MR. STEWART:

9

I mean, there are really two

differences between that -- that scenario and the one

10

presented here.

11

is expressly authorized by the Patent Act, in Section

12

261 of Title 35, but -- but the second thing is --

13
14

The first is that an exclusive license

JUSTICE SCALIA:
impress me.

What else?

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. STEWART:

That -- that doesn't

What's your second point?

The second thing is that an

17

exclusive license doesn't give the -- the infringement

18

defendant anything that it couldn't hope to achieve by

19

prevailing in the lawsuit.

20

any right to compete that it wouldn't get by prevailing

21

in the lawsuit.

22
23

That is, if the -- at least

If the infringement defendant won, it would
be able to sell wherever it wanted to.

24

Now, there may be some --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In order to make money.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

mean, that's -- that's what it wants is money.

2

MR. STEWART:

But the point of --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So instead of giving them a

4

license to compete -- you know, we'll short-circuit the

5

whole thing, here's the money.

6

MR. STEWART:

Go away.

But the point here is that the

7

money is being given as a substitute for earning profits

8

in a competitive marketplace.

9

Hatch-Waxman settlement context, by definition, we have

That is, in -- in the

10

a disagreement by parties as to the relative merits of

11

the infringement and -- and/or validity questions as

12

to the patent infringement suit.

13

The brand name is saying its patent is valid

14

and infringed.

15

patent is invalid or that its own conduct won't be

16

infringing or both.

17

able to enter the market immediately.

18

wins, it will be able to keep the generic off until the

19

patent expires.

20

The generic is saying either that the

And if the generic wins, it will be
If the brand name

And so in that circumstance, a logical

21

subject of compromise would be to agree upon an entry

22

date in between those two end points, just as the

23

parties to a damages action would be expected to settle

24

the case by the defendant agreeing to pay a portion of

25

the money it would have to pay if it lost.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

That's an

Official

1

actual subject of compromise and we don't have a problem

2

with that.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Stewart, do you have a

4

case in which the patentee, acting within the scope of

5

the patent, has nonetheless been held liable under the

6

antitrust laws --

7

MR. STEWART:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Yes.
-- for something that it's

done acting within the scope of the patent?
MR. STEWART:

10

Yes, if you adopt Respondent's

11

conception of what it means to act within the scope of

12

the patent.

13

say that the restrictions at issue here are within the

14

scope of the patent, what they mean is that the goods

15

that are being restricted are arguably encompassed by

16

the patent and the restriction doesn't extend past the

17

date when the patent expires.

18

And let me explain.

That's all they mean.

When Respondents

And if that were the

19

exclusive test, the defendants in Masonite, in New

20

Wrinkle, in Line Material, they would all have been off

21

the hook because all of those cases involved

22

restrictions on trade in patented goods during the

23

period that the patent was in effect, and yet, the Court

24

found antitrust liability in each of these.

25

Now, the way that Respondent tries to
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

explain Masonite, for example, Masonite involved a

2

resale price maintenance agreement in which the

3

patentholder sold goods and then attempted to control

4

the price at which they would be resold, and the Court

5

said that under the rule of patent exhaustion, the 


6

patentholder didn't have the right to do that and 


7

therefore the patent laws provided no shield and the 


8

agreement was held to be a violation of the antitrust 


9

laws. 

Now, Respondents say, well, that's

10
11

consistent with their theory because the restriction

12

imposed went beyond the scope of the patent because the

13

right to control resale is not one of the rights that

14

the Patent Act confers.
But if that's the test for whether a

15
16

restriction is within the scope of the patent, then we

17

would say that it's not met here because there's nothing

18

in the Patent Act that says you can pay your competitor

19

not to engage in conduct that you believe to be

20

infringing.

21

And really that's the thrust of their

22

position, that if you have -- if a patentholder has a

23

non-sham allegation that a particular mode of

24

competition would be an infringement of its patent, the

25

patentholder can pay the competitor not to engage in
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that competition.

2

Again, we are not talking about conduct in

3

which there has been any judicial determination that

4

infringement has occurred.

5

cases in which the patent holder has a non-sham

6

allegation that infringement would occur.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We are just talking about

Mr. Stewart, does this

8

represent a change in the government's position?

I got

9

the idea from the briefs that at the time of this

10

Schering-Plough case, that was also before the Eleventh

11

Circuit, that the government was not taking that

12

position it is now taking.

13

MR. STEWART:

Well, the FTC has consistently

14

taken this position.

The Department of Justice, up

15

until 2009, we didn't endorse the scope of the patent

16

test.

17

specifically said that the scope-of-the-patent test

18

was -- didn't provide for enough scrutiny of these

19

settlements.

Indeed, in our invitation brief in Joblove we

But what we advocated -- what the Department

20
21

of Justice advocated, instead was a test that would

22

focus on the strength and scope of the patent.

23

the likelihood that the brand name would off --

24

ultimately have prevailed if the suit had been litigated

25

to judgment.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

That is,

Official

1

And in 2009, for the first time in an amicus

2

brief filed in the Second Circuit, we took essentially

3

the position that we're taking here, that is that

4

agreements of this sort should be treated as

5

presumptively unlawful with the presumption able to be

6

rebutted in various ways.

7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the validity or the strength of the infringement case?

9
10

And one way is to assess

MR. STEWART:

We would say that that's not a

way, that --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's -- that's my

12

concern, is your test is the same for a very weak patent

13

as a very strong patent.

14

sense.

15

MR. STEWART:

That doesn't make a lot of

Well, the test is whether

16

there has been a payment that would tend to skew the

17

parties' choice of an entry date, that would tend to

18

provide an incentive for the parties to -- for the

19

generic to agree to an entry date later than the one

20

that it would otherwise insist on.

21

Now, it probably is the case that our test

22

would have greater practical import in cases where the

23

parties perceive the patent to be --

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why wouldn't that

determination itself reflect the strength or weakness of
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the patent so that the market forces take that into

2

account?

3

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think in the kind of

4

settlement that we would regard as legitimate, where the

5

parties simply agree to a compromise date of generic

6

entry, then the parties would certainly take into

7

account their own assessment of what would likely happen

8

at the end of the suit.

9

And so if the parties believe that the brand

10

name was likely to prevail, then if the brand name

11

agreed to early generic entry at all, it would

12

presumably be for a fairly small amount of time.

13

Conversely, if the parties collectively

14

believe that the generic -- that the brand name had a

15

weak case and the generic was likely to prevail, then

16

they would negotiate for an earlier date.

17

problem with the reverse payment is that it gives the

18

generic an incentive to accept something other than

19

competition as a means of earning money.

20

I mean, to take another --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

And the

This -- this was not a

problem, I gather, until the Hatch-Waxman amendments?
MR. STEWART:

These suits -- these types of

24

payments appear to be essentially unknown in other

25

lawsuits and in other patent infringement cases.
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, and so -- and so do

2

suits against this kind of payment.

And I have -- I

3

have the feeling that what happened is that Hatch-Waxman

4

made a mistake.

5

produce this kind of -- this kind of payment.

It did not foresee that it would

6

And in order to rectify the mistake, the FTC

7

comes in and brings in a new interpretation of antitrust

8

law that did not exist before, just to make up for the

9

mistake that Hatch-Waxman made, even though Congress has

10

tried to cover its tracks in later amendments, right,

11

which -- which deter these, these -- these payments.

12
13

MR. STEWART:

Congress has tried to reduce

the incentives for these payments to be made.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean --

So why should we overturn

15

understood antitrust laws just to -- just to patch up a

16

mistake that Hatch-Waxman made?

17

MR. STEWART:

Well, a couple things I would

18

say.

First, I don't think we're -- we're not asking you

19

to overturn established antitrust laws.

20

analogy, for example, if Watson instead of developing a

21

generic equivalent to AndroGel, had developed an

22

entirely new drug that it believed would be better than

23

AndroGel for the same conditions and if Solvay had paid

24

Watson not to seek FDA approval and not to seek -- to

25

market the drug, I think everyone would agree that that
11

Alderson Reporting Company

To take another

Official

1

was a per se antitrust violation, even though Watson's

2

ultimate ability to market the new drug would depend on

3

FDA approval that might or might not be granted.

4

And so when we say it's unlawful to buy off

5

uncertain competition, it's unlawful to buy off

6

competition, even when the competition might have been

7

prevented by other means, we are just enforcing standard

8

antitrust principles.

9

To focus on the distinction between

10

Hatch-Waxman and other patent litigation, Professor

11

Hovenkamp's conclusion is that the reason that you don't

12

see payments like this in the normal patent infringement

13

suit is that in the typical market if a patent holder

14

were known to have paid a large sum of money to a

15

competitor who had been making a challenge to the

16

patent, if other competitors knew that that had

17

happened, then they would perceive that to be a sign

18

that the patent was weak and that they would leap in.

19

But he says Hatch-Waxman makes it more

20

difficult for that to be done because Hatch-Waxman gives

21

unique incentives to the first paragraph 4 filer.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

18-month rule primarily?

24

MR. STEWART:

25

Is that the 18 -- the

It's a 180-day period of

exclusivity.
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

I mean 180 days,

yes.

3

MR. STEWART:

Yes, and the way it works is

4

that the exclusivity period is not good in and of itself

5

for consumers.

6

generic is on the market and the others are not yet

7

allowed to compete, you have essentially duopoly

8

conditions, the price of the -- the drug drops but only

9

by a little bit.

That is, during the period when one

Congress granted the 180-day exclusivity

10
11

period because it wanted generics to have ample

12

incentives to challenge patents that were perceived to

13

be weak.

14

And if the first filer is able to essentially

15

to be bought off, is able to set settle for something

16

other than early entry into the marketplace, then other

17

potential competitors face barriers to entry that

18

they -- similarly situated competitors wouldn't face in

19

other industries.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that just seems --

21

that's rather thin, I think.

22

have the ability to assess that and the significance of

23

it, empirically.

24

this is common in antitrust?

25

I don't know how -- I don't

The thing I wonder, therefore, you said

I'm -- I'm not up to everything in the
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

field, but I know there's an existence of something

2

called a per se rule, let's price fix it.

3

I know there's a rule of reason, and I know

4

there's a sort of vague area that sometimes in some

5

cases that Justice Souter mentioned in California

6

Dental, there is something slightly in between, which as

7

I saw those cases, they're very much like price fixing

8

or -- or agreements not to enter.

9

And what they seem to say is, Judge, pay

10

attention to the department when it says that these are

11

very often can be anticompetitive, and ask the defendant

12

why he's doing it.

13

I mean, is that what you want us to say?

It

14

didn't seem as if in your briefs as if you were.

15

you were asking us to produce some kind of structure ­-

16

I don't mean to be pejorative, but it's rigid -- a whole

17

set of complex per se burden of proof rules that I have

18

never seen in other antitrust cases, I -- my question is,

19

when I say I've never seen anything like this before in

20

terms of procedure, I want you to refer me to a case that

21

will show, oh, no, I'm out of date.

22

MR. STEWART:

Either

Well, the -- the Court has

23

recognized such a thing as the quick look approach, but

24

I think even though the case didn't use the term "quick

25

look," I don't believe it did, NCAA v. Regents of

I'll need to look back and see

Well, if there are few or

12

none, then I would say, why isn't the government

13

satisfied with an opinion of this Court that says, yes,

14

there can be serious anticompetitive effects.

15

sometimes there are business justifications, so Judge,

16

keep that in mind.

17

ask him what his justification is, and see if there's a

18

less restrictive alternative.

19

Yes,

Ask him why he has this agreement,

In other words, it's up to the district

20

court, as in many complex cases, to structure their case

21

with advice from the attorneys.

22
23

MR. STEWART:

I think that would leave

courts without guidance as to --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. STEWART:

-- without guidance as to what
15


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

factors would be appropriate --


2

JUSTICE BREYER:

The same thing is 


3

appropriate as is appropriate in any antitrust case. 


4

Are there anticompetitive effects? 


5

I have 32 briefs here that explain very

6

clearly what you said in a sentence.

7

they're simply dividing the monopoly profit.

8

understand that -- you know, I can take that in and so

9

can every judge in the country.

10
11

It may be that
I

And what's complicated

about that.
And then I have some very nice dark green

12

briefs that clearly say, four instances, maybe five,

13

where there would be offsetting justifications.

14

they can get that, too.

15

MR. STEWART:

I think

Well, certainly our proposed

16

approach accounts for that.

17

really two different forms of rebuttal.

18

approach says, this is on its face an agreement not to

19

compete, the generic has agreed to stay out of the

20

market for a defined period of time, and the payment

21

gives rise to an inference that the agree -- that the

22

delay that the generic has agreed to is longer than the

23

period that would otherwise reflect its best assessment

24

of its likelihood of -- of success in the lawsuit.

25

It provides -- it provides
First our

But then we say, there are basically two
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different types of ways in which the presumption could

2

be rebutted.

3

payment was not in consideration for delay, that there

4

was some other commensurate value transferred, and the

5

payment -- and that arrangement would have been entered

6

into even without the larger settlement.

7

First, the parties can show that the

And then second, we're at least accepting

8

the possibility that brand names and generics could come

9

in and say, even though our payment was for delay, even

10

though we can't identify anything else that the payment

11

could have been consideration for, it's still, quote,

12

"competitive" under --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And they mention at least

14

two others.

15

person's already in the market thinks that the next year

16

or two or three years is worth $100 million a year, and

17

the person who's suing thinks it's worth 30 million a

18

year.

19

give him the 30 million and keep the 70.

20

that, I don't see why that's anticompetitive if that's

21

what's going on.

22

The first one they mention is because the

And so he says, hey, I have a great idea, I'll
And -- and

And the second instance they bring up is

23

that it's very hard to break into a market.

24

new generic to come in, he's thinking, giving me two

25

years isn't worth much because I'll spend a lot of
17

Alderson Reporting Company

So for the

Official

1

money, it's very hard for me to do it.

2

defendant -- the defendant who wants this patent kept

3

intact says, I will not only let -- I'll let you in a

4

year earlier and I'll give you enough money so that you

5

can start up a distribution system.

6

procompetitive, the first, neutral.

7

But the

The second seems

The problem of deciding whether other

8

matters are or are not really payments for something

9

else, a true nightmare when you start talking about five

10

drugs and different distribution systems and the matter

11

of whether you're paying for litigation costs, a matter

12

of great debate for the judge.

13

arguments that they make.

14

MR. STEWART:

Okay, that's the

Go ahead.
Let me say a couple of things

15

about the administrative nightmare.

The first is that

16

to the extent that these inquiries are difficult,

17

they're difficult only by -- because the brand names and

18

the generics have made them difficult by tacking on

19

additional transactions to their settlement proposal.

20

And to take an analogy, there are government

21

ethics rules that say that -- what are called prohibited

22

sources.

23

department can't give me gifts as a government employee.

24

Now, obviously, it would be absurd to have a rule that

25

said a prohibited source couldn't give me a Rolex watch,

Basically, people who have business before the

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but could sell me a Rolex watch for a dollar.

2

the ethics rules treat as a gift an exchange for value

3

in which fair market value is not paid.

4

And so

And everybody understands that once you go

5

down that route, occasionally, you will have hard cases

6

in which people could legitimately agree, was this a

7

legitimate arm's length exchange or was it a concealed

8

gift?

9

mean that we get rid of a gift ban altogether.

But the prospect of those difficult cases doesn't

And certainly, Federal employees couldn't

10
11

bring the -- the ethics office to its knees by engaging

12

in such a proliferation of these side deals that the

13

ethics office decided it's not worth it.

14

The second thing is that Respondent's

15

approach would apply even when there are no hard

16

questions.

17

agreement provides for delayed generic entry until the

18

date the patent expires, and even if the only other term

19

of the agreement is the brand name pays the generic a

20

lot of money, that that would be a legitimate agreement

21

because the restriction would apply to arguably patented

22

drugs and it wouldn't extend beyond the date of patent

23

expiration.

24
25

Respondents would say that even if the

I guess the -- the other thing I would say
about the way in which these payments can facilitate
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

settlement really shows their anticompetitive potential.

2

That is, suppose that the parties were negotiating for a

3

compromise date of entry, but they couldn't agree.

4

The -- the brand name said beginning of 2017 is the

5

earliest we'll let you in and the generic said beginning

6

of 2015 is the latest date that we would accept.

7

Now, the Respondents use the term "bridge

8

the gap," but there's obviously no way that a payment

9

from the brand name to the generic could enable the

10

parties to agree on an entry date between 2015 and 2017.

11

The brand name is never going to say, well,

12

I would insist on holding out until 2017, but if I'm

13

going to pay you a whole lot of money, then I'll let you

14

in earlier and accept a -- a diminution of your profits.

15

The brand name is going to say, if I pay you money, I'm

16

going to insist on deferring entry even later than the

17

2017 date that would otherwise be my preferred

18

compromise.

19

So the natural effect of these payments is

20

not to facilitate a -- a bridging the gap in the sense

21

of a picking of a point between the dates that the

22

parties would otherwise insist on.

23

very likely to cause the parties to agree to an entry

24

date that's even later than the one the brand name would

25

otherwise find acceptable.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY I. WEINBERGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10

MR. WEINBERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

I'd like to first respond to a question that

12

was asked of my friend by Justice Scalia a few minutes

13

ago.

14

Court has ever found a restraint outside the scope of

15

the patent to be unlawful, and the answer to that

16

question is no.

17

He was asked if there are any cases in which the

That -- all of the cases that have found

18

violations of the antitrust laws based on a patent-based

19

restraint do so because the object of the agreement, the

20

restraint that's being achieved in the agreement, is

21

beyond the scope that could be legitimately achieved

22

with a patent.

23

For example, it's an attempt to control

24

downstream the resale prices of -- of products that you

25

cannot do simply by exercising your patent.
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Or it's an

Official

1

attempt to control the sale of unpatented products that

2

go beyond what a patent can protect.

3

Every -- every case in which --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't this that?

5

Meaning there is no presumption of infringement.

6

There's no presumption that the item that someone else

7

is going to sell necessarily infringes.

8

MR. WEINBERGER:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's correct.
And so what you're

10

arguing is that in fact a settlement of an infringement

11

action is now creating that presumption.

12

MR. WEINBERGER:

No, Justice Sotomayor, I'm

13

not arguing that.

But -- but I do want to say that I

14

think our patent system depends upon the notion that you

15

don't evaluate from the anti -- the perspective of the

16

antitrust laws a patent restraint based upon whether you

17

could have proved in a litigation that that patent --

18

that the patent was infringed.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know, but I

20

don't know why we would be required to accept that there

21

has or would be infringement by the product that has

22

voluntarily decided not to pursue its rights.

23

MR. WEINBERGER:

I think you're

24

not -- you're not accepting infringement.

25

doing is recognizing there's a reasonable basis to
26

Alderson Reporting Company

What you're

Official

1

assert the patent, a bona fide, reasonable dispute, and

2

the parties have the ability to settle the dispute.

3

Just as if the party -- if someone was

4

entering into a license agreement with -- with someone

5

who had a product that they claimed did not infringe the

6

patent, they sat down, negotiated a license and resolved

7

it --

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there, you know

that they're not sharing the profits.

10

MR. WEINBERGER:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning there you know

12

that a -- a product's been licensed and the -- that's

13

normal.

14

money to sell that product.

15

MR. WEINBERGER:

16

The infringer is now paying the other side

But, Justice Sotomayor,

many other --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A reverse payment

18

suggests something different, that they're sharing

19

profits.

20

I don't know what else you can conclude.

21

MR. WEINBERGER:

Many license -- I don't

22

think that's correct, and that's because many license

23

disputes are, in fact, resolved by the -- the alleged

24

infringer exiting the market for a period of time, or

25

agreeing to stay off until a certain time.
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And then the license --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

But not many for reverse

payments.

4

MR. WEINBERGER:

Yes, they are because --

5

because, for example, it could be a license agreement

6

where the infringer agrees to stay off the market for X

7

number of years, and when it comes on it pays a certain

8

royalty.

9

Now, anybody could argue that that royalty,

10

if it were higher, could result in an earlier entry.

11

There's always an argument to be made with any delayed

12

entry situation that monopoly profits are shared.

13

That's just -- just inherent in the nature of it.

14

And if you take the FTC's argument to its

15

full force, it would mean that any situation where

16

anyone is agreeing to a delayed entry, and there's any

17

other value that's being exchanged in that situation,

18

that in effect in economic terms is a payment for

19

delayed entry.

20

There's no difference.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

But there, it's

21

not -- their point is not it's per se unlawful.

22

they want is they want to cut some kind of line between

Now, suppose I don't want the kitchen sink,

4

but I have a hard time saying what the per se rule is.

5

So what's your idea?

6

MR. WEINBERGER:

I -- I've obviously given a

7

lot of thought to whether there is any kind of an

8

intermediary test that works and I don't believe there

9

is.

Let me explain why.
First, you can't really measure whether

10
11

there were any anticompetitive effects from such a

12

settlement agreement without determining what would have

13

happened if the case hadn't settled and it would have

14

been litigated.

15

litigation, then there would be no anticompetitive

16

effects.

17

And if the patentee had won the

That's what the Second Circuit and the

18

Federal Circuit concluded in applying the rule of reason

19

test, and saying the first condition of such a test has

20

not been met because there's no demonstration of

21

anticompetitive effects.

22

And the cases -- both of those cases are

23

very good illustrations of what I'm talking about.

24

Those were the Tamoxifen and Cipro cases, where the

25

parties agreed to so-called reverse payment settlements
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that FTC would say are basically per se lawful.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would it -- would it help

3

if you were -- were thinking about rules and caps, to

4

consider not what the branded company would have --

5

would have made, but what the generic company would have

6

lost?

And -- and use the latter as the limit?

7
8

MR. WEINBERGER:

Well, you really don't know

unless you can assume when they could have entered --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

make an extrapolation, yes.

11

MR. WEINBERGER:

Well, you -- you have to

Well, because it all

12

depends on what would have happened in the patent

13

litigation.

14

there's any anticompetitive effect.

So that you can't really tell whether

I should also say with respect to the

15
16

generic losing, there's really no risk for the generic

17

here, which is one of the reasons you see these

18

settlements, that in this industry --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if the generic wins,

20

though, its -- everybody's profits are lower.

21

can gear it to just what the -- what the generic would

22

have made.

23

MR. WEINBERGER:

And you

They're -- they're lower

24

than they would be under some other situation, but --

25

but the patent gave the patent holder the legal right to
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

exclude.

2

reason to believe that it couldn't reasonably assert

3

that patent, it's entitled to monopoly profits for the

4

whole duration of the patent.

5

And so unless there's a reason, there's some

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Weinberger, can I just

6

understand what you're saying, and maybe do it through a

7

hypothetical.

8

MR. WEINBERGER:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Certainly.
Suppose you had a -- a

10

lawsuit and the generic sends the brand name

11

manufacturer an e-mail and the e-mail says, we have this

12

lawsuit, I think I have about a 50 percent chance of

13

winning.

14

If I win, I take your -- your monopoly

15

profits down from 100 million to $10 million.

16

it be a good thing if you just gave me 25 million?

17

Alright?

18

says -- you know, that seems like a pretty good idea, so

19

I'll give you 25 million.

20
21
22
23

Wouldn't

And then the brand name sends an e-mail back,

Now, as I understand it, your argument is, I
mean, that's just fine.

That's hunky dory.

MR. WEINBERGER:

Well, what I'm saying is

that in -- in any given situation --

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is that fine?

25

MR. WEINBERGER:

I -- I think that if the --

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if it's a single situation and the evidence is that

2

there's a reasonable basis to assert that patent and in

3

truth, the patent had what you say is a 50/50 chance

4

of prevailing, then I think that there could be a

5

settlement like that, if it's in good faith.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Even though -- but what does

7

that mean in good faith?

8

is that they're splitting monopoly profits and the

9

person who's going to be injured are all the consumers

10

It's clear what's going on here

out there.

11

MR. WEINBERGER:

Any -- any situation in

12

which there's any -- in any patent dispute in which

13

there's a tradeoff, like the examples I mentioned

14

before, time for value, could -- that argument could be

15

made.

16

And, in fact, if that was true, if it was

17

true that the natural inference and the motivations of

18

people were simply to divide these profits with no

19

other consideration, then what you'd expect to see is

20

that every single patent dispute, would, especially in

21

Hatch-Waxman, would result in a settlement that just

22

pays the generic until the end of the patent because

23

after all, the market would be --

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Weinberger, I

think if we give you the rule that you're suggesting we
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

give you, that is going to be the outcome because this

2

is going to be the incentive of both the generic and the

3

brand name manufacturer in every single case is to split

4

monopoly profits in this way to the detriment of all

5

consumers.

6

MR. WEINBERGER:

Let me address that, Your

7

Honor.

I don't think that's realistic at all because --

8

and let's take this industry specifically, that the

9

ability to challenge a patent in this industry is lower

10

than any industry that I can think of, and that's

11

because a generic is given the right to certify against

12

the patent and then basically challenge the patent

13

without having actually developed the product, gotten a

14

marketing force, gotten a factory, putting the product

15

on sale and taking the risk that everyone else who

16

challenges a patent has to take.

17

All they have to do is -- is file an ANDA,

18

which is roughly 300,000 to $1 million for these size

19

drugs, that's not a lot, and certify it.

20

own studies have shown that it takes a very small chance

21

of winning, something like 4 percent for a drug over

22

$130 billion to justify a generic suing a brand name

23

company.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because it does skew the

dynamics a lot.

7

MR. WEINBERGER:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Is that in all cases or 


Yes.
You know, the Second

Circuit recognized, even though it accepted your scope

10

of the patent, that there was a troubling dynamic in

11

what you're arguing, which is that the less sound the

12

patent, the more you're going to hurt consumers because

13

those are the cases where the payoff, the sharing of

14

profits is the greatest inducement for the patent holder.

15

MR. WEINBERGER:

The Second Circuit

16

recognized that, but then they said further -- on

17

further reflection, on further consideration of this, we

18

are not troubled by it.

19

And one of the reasons they were not troubled,

20

it's what I was trying to answer Justice Kagan about, is

21

because the reality of the situation is with so many

22

potential challengers to the patent, all they have to do

23

is file an ANDA, there are 200 generic companies in this

24

industry, that if you try to adopt that strategy of

25

paying the profits of a generic, there's going to be a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Suppose --


Well, I don't think that

5

something that Justice Scalia suggested, that there's a

6

kind of glitch in Hatch-Waxman.

7

the 180 days goes to the first filer.

8
9

And the glitch is that

And once the 180-day first filer is bought
off, nobody else has the incentive to do this.
MR. WEINBERGER:

10

That's clearly not correct

11

either by logic or by reference to actual experience.

12

It's true that the first filer is given a greater

13

incentive, but these products can last for 20 or

14

MR. WEINBERGER:

Well, I think the first

2

problem with it is that it's -- it's very unpredictable.

3

It's really hard to figure out how that all gets sorted

4

out, and the parties who are sitting down to do a

5

settlement need, I feel, much clearer guidance --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You can't -- you can't

7

possibly figure it out, can you, without assessing the

8

strength of the patent?

9

MR. WEINBERGER:

That's right. 


10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that crucial to -- to 


11

the conclusion?

12
13

MR. WEINBERGER:

I -- I believe that the 


only thing that brought --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And to say you can consider 


15

every other factor other than the strength of the patent

16

is -- is to leave -- leave out the -- the elephant in

17

the room.

18

MR. WEINBERGER:

I agree with that,

19

Justice Scalia.

I don't think that an alternative

20

test -- the only alternative test that could be

21

fashioned that would -- that would make sense is one

22

based on strength of the patent.

23

But there are so many reasons that that is

24

an undesirable result that I -- I don't think it's the

25

way this Court should go.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For whom?

And -- and --

2

you know, the government is basically saying, we really

3

don't want reverse payments, period.

4

settle this the way they should settle it, which is on

5

the strength of the patent.

6

simply by either paying a royalty for use or settling as

7

most cases do, on an early entry alone, so there's no

8

sharing of -- of -- of profits.

9

that?

We want people to

And that means settling it

What's so bad about

10

I mean, it doesn't deprive either side of

11

the ability to finish the litigation if they want to.

12

MR. WEINBERGER:

Let's say -- I wouldn't

13

concede that most cases settle like that.

14

let's accept that and take the case of a -- of a strong

15

patent or a patent with a long term.

16

it has -- you evaluate the strength of the patent and

17

you conclude that it has 10 or 15 good years remaining.

But let's --

Let's say

Now, you have a generic who is -- or many

19

generics who have sued with no risk or minimal risk in

21

would I drop this lawsuit to get an entry date in 2025

or 2028?

So that's what these agreements are about.

They're saying, well, what other -- remember, this is

3

not just a cash payment.

4

There are all --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, in the normal

5

course, if the patent's really strong, if you get a year

6

or two earlier entry, that has an inherent value, and

7

that's what you'll pay for is what the government is

8

saying.

9

will make, which is at what point is earlier entry worth

10

That will be the determination the two parties

it --

MR. KATZ:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, first of all --- for the very strong

patent holder.
MR. WEINBERGER:

But first of all, parties

15

often don't agree on the merits.

overconfident.

17

So it's sometimes very hard to come to a consensus where

18

entry date is the only bargaining chip available.

20

They both think they are going to win.

most settlements and say that is the vast majority.

exception, not the rule.

actually very steady.

12

see any huge blips depending on what a particular court

13

is ruling.

14

They are roughly between 25 and

If the FTC's kind of

15

the-sky-is-going-to-fall approach is right, that

16

everybody's going to run out and do this, you would have

17

thought that after the first Eleventh Circuit ruling,

18

after the Federal Circuit ruling, after the Second

19

Circuit ruling, after second Eleventh Circuit ruling,

20

that there would be huge increases in this, but we

21

haven't seen that.

22

Some of the numbers increased last year, but

23

as a percentage of the total settlements they are very

24

steady.

25

They are pretty much the same.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

consideration that seems to be driving the government?

1

clear that I don't think that could happen because if a

2

brand name company adopted that as a strategy to protect

its patent, it would -- it would be held up.

5

easily challenge these patents without actually having a

6

manufactured product, without putting it on sale, et

It would

So I think that the antitrust rule should
not be fashioned to deal with a case on the extreme,

10

which hasn't been shown to happen, which logically from

11

an economic point of view is highly unlikely to happen.

12

And if for some reason that starts happening

13

empirically, then Congress -- and it is a loophole in

14

Hatch-Waxman that is causing that, and there is really

15

no evidence that that extreme example has happened --

16

then Congress can deal with it, just as it dealt with

17

the exclusivity provision.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the government

19

was telling us that that's this case, that the -- what

20

the generic is being offered in the way of sharing the

21

monopoly profits is more than it could ever make if it

22

wanted to and sold its drug.

23

MR. WEINBERGER:

Well, I don't see any

24

examples of that cited in their brief.

25

it's a hypothetical theory, but there is no data.
43

Alderson Reporting Company

It's a theory,
And

Official

1

we have had years of experience with this case.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but it's not

3

hypothetical that if the generic wins everybody -- the

4

brand companies' profits are going to go way, way down

5

right away and generic profits are not going to be that

6

great.

7

MR. WEINBERGER:

Of course.

8

true in many -- many patent litigations.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that's

Well, but so then the

10

question still holds.

11

to what the brand company will make, it's just a much

12

higher figure, and a greater danger of unreasonable

13

restraint.

14

If you -- if you key your payment

MR. WEINBERGER:

There is that hypothetical

15

risk.

16

it's not -- with the number of challenges you have here,

17

which is basically unlimited, that if you put a sign

18

around your neck that says, paying off all generic

19

companies their profits, whoever wants to challenge my

20

patent come do it, there is going to be a long line of

21

people, of companies doing it.

22

What I'm -- I am trying to make the point that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay, I will grant you

23

that point that the 180 days is not that big a

24

difference, and that there are many generics out there.

25

But isn't that true in every industry?

Alderson Reporting Company

You said at the

They have nothing at

If they lose, they haven't lost any damages.
So there is an enormous difference

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I see that as an

19

argument that there is an economic reality in

20

Hatch-Waxman that would require us not to apply any rule

21

we choose or accept here to other situations, only here.

22

That's the argument that you're creating for me, that

23

there's a different economic reality here that requires

24

a different rule.

25

MR. WEINBERGER:

Justice Sotomayor, I think

45

the economic reality cuts the other way.

2

in favor of making a rule that makes these more

3

difficult.

4

It doesn't cut

What I'm saying is that -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, but it does because

5

in Hatch-Waxman Congress decided that there was a

6

benefit for generics entering without suffering a

7

potential loss to enter the market more quickly.

8
9

MR. WEINBERGER:

Justice Sotomayor, I don't

think the legislation -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

And any settlement in

11

these cases deprives consumers of the potential of

12

having the benefit of an earlier entry.

13

MR. WEINBERGER:

I don't believe there is

14

anything in Hatch-Waxman that supports the idea that the

15

purpose was to provide for generic entry prior to patent

16

expiration.

encourage challenges because --

18

What the structure is designed to do is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly, and what you

19

are doing with permitting settlements of this kind is

20

not permitting the process to go to conclusion.

21

MR. WEINBERGER:

I don't think there is

22

anything in Hatch-Waxman that suggests, in any way, that

23

settlements or -- should be discouraged or that cases

24

should be mandated to proceed to judgment or that all

25

have to be litigated.

So why does that hurt you?
MR. WEINBERGER:

Well, I actually think that

19

you raise a point that the generic -- in some of the

20

amicus briefs, some of the generic parties have talked

21

about, which is that their ability to challenge these

22

cases depends on their not having to litigate every one

23

of them to conclusion.

24

patent cases settle.

25

settle.

And that's not bad because most
Most -- most of these disputes

And if our system was one in which every case
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

had to be litigated fully to judgment, it -- we would be

2

unable to cope with that.

3

So -- so what I think the statute mandates

4

or contemplates is that generics should be able to

5

challenge, and should have strong incentive to

6

challenge, but that doesn't mean that they should be

7

required to litigate to conclusion.

8

is made more difficult, so that different perceptions or

9

different business objectives can't be bridged with some

And if settlement

10

kind of a business settlement, that is going to mean

11

that fewer generics are going to challenge these patents

12

and that is contrary to the purpose of the Hatch-Waxman

13

Act.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think it's correct that

15

to develop a new drug sometimes you need not just

16

scientists and attorneys, you need investment bankers.

17

And you then need marketers because the cost of these

18

drugs can be hundreds of millions.

much average drugs cost, and that figure is over a

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. WEINBERGER:

9

I'm sorry.
But I was just going to say

that the -- of course, any given drug development cost

10

doesn't even begin to tell the picture because for every

11

drug that succeeds, there are at least 10 that fail, and

12

all the costs that are involved in the drugs that fail

13

have to be covered with the one drug that succeeds.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I just make sure I

15

understand the way the 180-day period worked?

16

filer gets it, if I buy off -- if I'm a brand name

manufacturer and I buy off the first filer with one of

18

these reverse payments, you're suggesting that that's

not going to do me much good because they're all going

in line to -- to challenge this if my competitor is

going to get the exclusive period?

9

It's that my

So why in the world am I standing

MR. WEINBERGER:

This was the exact problem

10

that Congress addressed in 2003, when it amended

11

Hatch-Waxman and changed the exclusivity requirements.

12

So the way the law now reads is that subsequent

13

generics, subsequent filers can trigger that 180-day

14

exclusivity by continuing to litigate.

15

filer settles and these other folks are in line and

16

they're litigating, they can force that period to start

17

running and then they can come in right after.

18

not correct that you can tie up the first filer in

19

settlement and prevent everybody else from entering.

20

So if the first

So it is

And even before that amendment, the Eleventh

21

Circuit, Federal circuit in the Second, applying the

22

scope of the patent rule recognized that if the

23

agreement creates a bottleneck to other filers that goes

24

beyond what the statutory exclusivity provides, where

25

they agree not to give up their exclusivity or agree to
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

retain it, then that's beyond the scope of the patent.

2

Because you can't achieve that kind of a restraint

3

simply -- with a patent, you -- you're using the

4

agreement to expand upon your patent rights to block

5

other filers.

6

So I think that problem's been addressed by

7

Congress.

8

perfect and they want to make it even easier for

9

subsequent filers to come in, then I submit that

10

Congress can do that.

11

And if somebody feels that solution's not

The change that was made,

14

Justice Ginsburg, is that -- there were a number of

15

changes, but the one that's relevant here is that if

16

a -- if a subsequent filer -- strike that.

17

You can trigger the exclusivity beginning to

18

run by getting the judgment.

So in the past, if a first

19

filer settled and they just didn't do anything -- may I

20

finish the --

21

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART 

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. STEWART:

Thank you.

12

Mr. Weinberger argued that in order to

13

determine whether a settlement of this sort has

14

anticompetitive effects, we would have to know how the

15

lawsuit would have turned out, but it's perhaps the most

16

fundamental principle of antitrust law that particular

17

conduct can be legal or illegal, depending on the

18

deliberative process that led up to it.

19

And to put that in concrete terms, if a

20

business charges a particular price for a particular

21

product because it's made the assessment that this will

22

maximize profits in a competitive environment, that

23

decision is almost immune from antitrust scrutiny.

24

if the business charges the same price for the same

25

product in the same market because it's agreed with its
52

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

1

competitor that it will charge that price, that's a per

2

se antitrust violation.

3

So it's not at all anomalous to say that

4

this type of agreement can be deemed anticompetitive,

5

even though the same result, namely, exclusion of the 


6

generic from the market might have been able to be 


7

obtained by other means. 


8
9

The second thing is, Mr. Weinberger said 

there are instances in which second and successive 


10

filers will attempt to challenge the brand name even

11

after the first filer has been bought off.

12

we -- we disagree that it's as easy as he would say it

13

is, but we'll concede it happens occasionally.

14

fact that particular anticompetitive conduct doesn't

15

always work doesn't make it lawful.

16

I think

But the

It could often happen that two firms were

17

thinking about entering into a price-fixing agreement,

18

for instance, but thought to themselves, if we do that,

19

there's a third competitor in the market who will be

20

able to undersell us, and this would make our agreement

21

unprofitable.

22

firms try to proceed with a price-fixing conspiracy, but

23

they're thwarted because of the unexpected competition

24

from a third firm.

25

And it might happen sometimes that two

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, I thought Mr.

Official

1

Weinberger's point was that this is always going to

2

happen because it's very easy -- as he said, you put a

3

sign on your neck saying, generics line up to get your

4

payment.

5

another firm out there in the abstract that -- that

6

might want to enter into a similar market sharing

7

arrangement.

8
9

That seems quite different than saying there's

This is a very different system.
MR. STEWART:

I mean, first, there certainly

is no evidence suggesting that it has happened often,

10

although there is evidence that it has happened.

11

the brand name perceived on a systemic basis that the

12

likely result of paying off one competitor was that

13

another competitor would step in and couldn't be bought

14

off would litigate the suit to judgment, there would be

15

no incentive to make the reverse payment in the first

16

place.

17

But if

That is, in making the reverse payment, what

18

the -- the brand name is attempting to purchase is

19

protection from the possibility that it will have its

20

patent invalidated, and it will suffer a large

21

competitive advantage.

22

particular instance there is somebody else who's going

23

to expose it to -- me to that risk, the -- the payment

24

wouldn't be expected to be made.

25

If a brand name thinks in a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So at least --

And what's your
54


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understanding of why there would not be a long line in

2

some cases or in many cases?

3

MR. STEWART:

I think for the reasons

4

that -- that your question suggested, that there is the

5

180-day exclusivity period and leaving aside the cases

6

in which that is waived, subsequent manufacturers would

7

realize not only that they wouldn't get that period of

8

heightened profits themselves, but they would have to

9

wait in line for others, and they might focus their

attention on other patents that were perceived to be

11

weak as to which they could hope to -- to get the

12

180-day exclusivity contract.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And is there anything to

14

show what I think Justice Kennedy asked -- you know, how

15

much of one's profits comes from the 180-day period as

16

opposed to what happens after that?

17

MR. STEWART:

I know it is the great

18

majority, I don't have a percentage figure.

And the

19

reason, as I indicated earlier, was that during the

20

180-day exclusivity period, you have only two

21

competitors.

22

understanding is that the generics would usually charge

23

around 80 to 85 percent of the brand name's price during

24

that period.

25

price would drop to a fraction of that.

Basically, a biopoly arrangement.

And my

And after there is full competition, the

The next thing I would say is that our

2

system encourages settlement, but not to the nth degree.

3

And so for instance, if you had two -- two firms

4

fighting over a million dollars and each firm decided

5

internally, 600,000 is the least I will accept.

6

stuck to their guns, the case couldn't be settled.

If they

7

Now, if the public could be made to kick in

8

an additional 200,000, then each of the firms could get

9

its 600,000 and walk away content.

But we don't pursue

10

the policy in favor of settlement to that degree.

11

that's essentially what's happening here.

12

way these payments facilitate settlement is by inducing

13

the generics to agree to a later entry date by

14

increasing the total pool of profits that are available

15

to the two firms combined and thereby maximizing the

16

likelihood that each firm will find its own share of the

17

profit satisfactory.

18

But

The -- the

And the last thing I would say is I think

19

everyone who comes to this issue recognized that there

20

is a conundrum.

21

settlement to the expected outcome of litigation.

22

everyone also recognizes that it just isn't feasible to

23

try the patent suit.

Our natural instinct is to compare the

whether the competitive process has been preserved.
