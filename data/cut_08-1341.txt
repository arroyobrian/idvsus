ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The court of appeals erred in holding that

11

reversal of Respondent's conviction was appropriate on

12

plain error review if there was any possibility, no

13

matter how unlikely, that the jury's verdict was based

14

entirely on conduct predating the enactment of the

15

statute.

16

Under Rule 52(b), a defendant asserting a

17

forfeited claim of error may prevail only by showing at

18

a minimum a reasonable possibility that the error

19

actually affected the outcome of the case.

20

particular, the fourth prong of the Olano plain error

21

test requires a defendant to show a serious effect on

22

the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial

23

proceedings.

24

fact-intensive inquiry, and the defendant cannot satisfy

25

it if there is no reasonable possibility that the error

In

That test calls for a case-specific,

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

affected the outcome.

2

The decision of the court of appeals is

3

inconsistent with this Court's cases applying prong four

4

of the plain error test, Johnson, Cotton, and most

5

recently Puckett from just last term.

6

established that the prong four inquiry is case-specific

7

and fact-intensive and that a per se rule at prong four

8

is inappropriate.

9

appeals adopted here, applying a per se rule that if

Puckett

And that's exactly what the court of

10

there’s any possibility of prejudice, reversal is

11

required.

12

In addition, Johnson and Cotton made clear

13

that when the error is one that affects an issue on

14

which the evidence is overwhelming or essentially

15

uncontroverted, the defendant has not shown a serious

16

effect on the fairness, integrity, or public reputation

17

of judicial proceedings, and, indeed, reversal in that

18

context on the basis of a forfeited error that didn't

19

affect the outcome would undermine public confidence in

20

the judicial system.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there errors that

22

are -- that are so basic that they would call for an

23

automatic new trial?

24

a -- such an error.

25

You say this -- this is not such

MR. MILLER:

This Court has reserved the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question of whether, for example, a structural error

2

would automatically satisfy the "affects substantial

3

rights" component of the -- of prong three of the Olano

4

test.

5
6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you mean by

“structural”?
MR. MILLER:

Well, the sort of error that,

8

if properly preserved, would result in automatic

9

reversal without an assessment of harmlessness.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but if you can be

11

concrete, other than a reasonable doubt charge, what

12

else would be structural?

13

MR. MILLER:

Well, I mean in Johnson, for

14

example, the Court had not yet decided Neder, and so in

15

Johnson it was unclear whether the omission of one

16

element, the failure to instruct the jury on one element

17

of the offense, was a structural error.

18

the Court said, even assuming that that's a structural

19

error and even assuming that, therefore, the defendant has

20

satisfied prong three, showing an effect on the

21

substantial rights, nonetheless the court of appeals has

22

to apply prong four and has to evaluate on the basis of

23

the record and the facts in that particular case whether

24

there was an effect on the fairness, integrity, and

25

public reputation of judicial proceedings.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

And in Johnson,

Official

1

And in that case, the Court said that there

2

wasn't, because the evidence on the point that was the

3

subject of the instructional error was overwhelming, and

4

essentially uncontroverted.

5

sort of analysis, the sort of case-specific assessment

6

of the facts the court of appeals should have undertaken

7

in this case.

8
9

And that's, in our view, the

The effect of the decision below is
essentially to carve out a special rule of plain error

10

review that’s applicable only to a particular kind of

11

error; namely --

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I ask you this?

Prong

13

three of -- of Olano looks to prejudice, right?

14

then it's your position that prong four also looks to

15

prejudice?

16

is more searching than the other, perhaps?

17
18
19

And

Where you have two prejudice inquiries, one

How do they fit together in that relation -in that regard?
MR. MILLER:

Well, that's -- that's right.

20

We think that prong three in the case of a

21

constitutional error requires at least a reasonable

22

possibility of prejudice, and prong four I think demands

23

at least that much and, in some cases, may demand more.

24
25

One example of a case where a defendant
could satisfy prong three but not prong four would be,
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for example, a Melendez-Diaz kind of error.

2

a drug possession case where the only evidence that the

3

substance the defendant possessed was cocaine was a

4

laboratory certificate admitted without confrontation,

5

that would be a plain error under Melendez-Diaz, and

6

that would -- the defendant would be able to show an

7

effect on his substantial rights, because if that was

8

the only piece of evidence, he would have been entitled

9

to a directed verdict without it.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MR. MILLER:

If you had

Nonetheless --

Under three.

Under prong three.

But looking

12

at prong four, the Court would say -- I mean, if, for

13

example, the defendant had had an opportunity to subpoena

14

the chemist, if he hadn't controverted the accuracy of the

15

report, there would be no basis for concluding on those

16

facts that there was a serious effect on the fairness or

17

integrity or reputation of the proceedings.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You answered Justice Alito

19

by saying there are cases in which your inquiry is more

20

searching, more demanding, under four.

21

the other way around.

22

under three, you find that it hasn't affected the

23

outcome, then I don't know where you'd go under four.

24
25

MR. MILLER:

It might also be

I mean, if you satisfy -- if,

If, under three, the defendant

fails, then you don't need to apply prong four, because
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

prong four -- prong four is essentially an

2

implementation of the discretion conferred by the word --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

-- "may" in Rule 52(b).

In

5

order for the court to have any authority to correct

6

a plain error, it must be one that affects substantial

7

rights.

8
9
10

So -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

There -- there is an

overlap.
MR. MILLER:

There is some overlap in the

11

inquiries, but we think that, you know, as the Court

12

made clear in Puckett, rule four requires a

13

fact-intensive, case-specific inquiry.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So under -- under three, the

15

court could conclude that the defendant has shown that

16

it isn't clear beyond a reasonable doubt, for a

17

constitutional error, that the error didn't affect the

18

outcome, so the defendant would clear prong three, but

19

in prong four, a defendant might still lose if it's

20

fairly clear, but not beyond a reasonable doubt that --

21

is that -- that how it would work?

22

MR. MILLER:

Or if, you know, as in the --

23

my Melendez-Diaz example, or if the nature of the evidence

24

in the case shows that, you know, apart from the effect

25

on the defendant's rights of that particular error, that
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

error, in the context of the case, doesn't undermine

2

public confidence in the outcome.

3

What the court of appeals did here was to

4

create a special rule applicable only to those errors

5

involving the failure to instruct the jury that they may

6

not convict solely on pre-enactment evidence.

7

didn't give any reason why those errors should be

8

treated differently from other kinds of errors.

9

Instead, it was simply applying a line of circuit

10

The court

precedent that went back to cases predating Olano.

11

And there is no reason for creating a

12

special rule in that context.

13

emphatically rejected the proposition that there are

14

errors that are not subject to Rule 52(b) analysis.

15

the Court said that even errors implicating fundamental

16

constitutional rights like the Sixth Amendment -- Sixth

17

Amendment right to trial by jury in Johnson or the Fifth

18

Amendment right to a grand jury in Cotton are also

19

subject to the application --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To the contrary, Johnson

And

You don't want us to do it,

21

right?

You want us to remand it so that they can do it,

22

right?

Is that --

23

MR. MILLER:

This Court's usual practice

24

when there's an issue that wasn't passed upon below is

25

to leave it to be considered on remand.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

We think that’s

Official

1

particularly appropriate because of the fact- and

2

record-intensive nature of the argument in this case.

3

So, if the Court does reach that issue, we

4

would urge the Court to adopt the analysis of the

5

concurring judges below, who said that, with respect to

6

the forced labor conviction, Respondent's conduct in the

7

pre-enactment and post-enactment periods were

8

essentially identical, such that there is no basis in

9

the record on which a rational jury could have concluded

10

that he violated the statute in the pre-enactment

11

period --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The point may be

13

tangential, but if both counsel were aware of the date

14

problem, that 2001 was the enactment of the statute, and

15

the jury was later properly instructed, do you think

16

that the government would find it important to introduce

17

the evidence of the pre-enactment conduct, just to set

18

forth scheme, plan, design, purpose, to tell the jury

19

the story?

20

MR. MILLER:

Indeed, it would.

In order to

21

establish a violation of the forced-labor statute, the

22

government had to show that Respondent had obtained

23

labor services by threats of serious harm or by a

24

scheme, pattern, or plan intended to cause the victim to

25

believe that she would suffer serious harm.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And so, in this case, there was essentially a

2

uniform course of conduct of the Respondent obtaining

3

labor services, making threats of harm, and, indeed,

4

brutally carrying out those threats.

5

pre-enactment threats and pre-enactment acts carrying

6

out the threats would certainly be relevant to show that

7

the post-enactment threats were indeed genuine threats

8

and that the victim could take them seriously as

9

threats, and that they did indeed induce her to provide

10

And so the

the labor or services.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the argument

12

that was made that in the pre-enactment period the

13

Web site was created, and that's when the -- that was the

14

really hard labor, as compared to just keeping it up to

15

date?

16

MR. MILLER:

Well, there -- I mean, the

17

statute refers to "labor or services."

18

Web site is a kind of labor or service, and maintaining a

19

Web site is also a kind of labor or service.

20

there's -- as the concurring judges in the court of

21

appeals noted, there’s no basis on which the jury could

22

have concluded that one satisfies the statute but the

23

other does not.

24

comfortably within the ordinary meaning --

25

And creating a

They're both -- they both fall

Mr. Miller, can I ask you

as construed in Olano, which has developed the four

3

factors.

4

We are construing Rule 52(b) here, not --

In your view, does the character of the

5

violation, in this case an ex post facto violation, does

6

that ever make a difference?

7

that one kind of constitutional violation is a little

8

bit more serious than another, or are they all fungible?

9

MR. MILLER:

Could a court ever think

I think in Johnson the Court

10

quite clearly said that even very serious constitutional

11

errors are subject to the same analysis under

12

Rule 52(b).

13

And certainly there's -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -- well, but the same

14

constitutional analysis includes step four, which is

15

whether it undermines confidence in the result.

16

don't you think that some constitutional violations more

17

undermine confidence than others?

18

MR. MILLER:

Absolutely.

And

And the test that

19

would be applied would be the same, but the result of

20

that test might be different.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

For example, if the -Would it not also be

22

possible that some constitutional violations undermine

23

confidence a little more than others?

24
25

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

I mean, if the error were,

for example, a biased judge -- I mean, that would be one
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that would almost invariably undermine confidence in

2

the integrity of the proceedings.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then why is the Second

4

Circuit so wrong to say:

5

violations are perhaps a little more serious than some

6

others.

7

MR. MILLER:

We think ex post facto

Well, because the error, the

8

essential error in this case, was the failure to give

9

the jury an instruction telling them that they could not

10

convict on the basis of pre-enactment conduct.

And that

11

is essentially analogous to the error that you had in

12

Johnson, where there was a failure to give the jury an

13

instruction telling them that they had to find

14

materiality.

And there --

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

instructions fungible, then?

17

omission in a jury instruction relating to the Ex Post

18

Facto Clause.

19

20

any lesser weight in the analysis?

I'm -- here we have an

Are all omissions in jury

22

error like this, there isn't any reason to attach extra

weight --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose if the

instruction told the jury in a criminal case that you
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can find the defendant guilty if you think it more

2

likely than not that he committed the crime, that might

3

be different, don't you think?

4
5

MR. MILLER:
different.

6

Yes.

That very well might be

That's right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you agree that this is

7

ex post facto, as opposed to a general due process

8

violation?

9

MR. MILLER:

No.

I mean -- that's right.

10

The Ex Post Facto Clause regulates the content of the

11

laws that Congress can pass, and there would be an ex

12

post facto issue in the case if Congress had tried to

13

make section 1589 retroactive, but it didn't.

14

everyone agrees that section 1589 applies only

15

prospectively.

And

16

So the constitutional violation, if there is

17

one, comes from the possibility that the defendant could

18

have been convicted on the basis of Congress -- of

19

conduct that did not violate the statute.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21
22

Well, you -- you agree

that there is a violation?
MR. MILLER:

There is a violation in the

23

failure to instruct.

And we think it's the

24

Due Process Clause that is the source of the requirement

25

that the defendant not be convicted on the basis of the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

conduct that doesn't violate a statute.

Well, Your Honor, I

it very clear, we’re only applying this test to ex post

facto, and I think in this instance you are right, the

magnitude of the error prompted them to say that if

conduct, it's possible that the jury could convict based

on that -- the evidence relating to that 1 day, isn't

say that was an ex post facto violation through the

Fourteenth Amendment.

MR. FAHRINGER:

I think this comment is

relevant to what you just said.

Our forefathers in --

7

in imposing an Ex Post Facto Clause -- it's one of the

8

few that they imposed on the States as well as the

sense that the States have an Ex Post Facto Clause as

does the Federal Government.

But we feel, under all those circumstances

here, what -- all roads lead back to one very, very

critical fact, and that is the enormity of the error

15

here at being a -- a constitutional error, and we

certainly think a structural error, structural error in
