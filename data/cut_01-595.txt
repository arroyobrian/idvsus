ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:


11

The Ninth Circuit has created a new


12

constitutional rule for guilty pleas that is neither


13

required by the Constitution nor warranted by this Court's


14

previous decisions.

15

complicate and expose to collateral attack confessions of


16

guilt which -- which account for approximately 95 percent


17

of all convictions in the Federal system and to stifle the


18

market for plea bargains, which this Court has described


19

as an essential component of the administration of


20

justice.


21

Its inevitable effect would be to


The Ninth Circuit held that an accused cannot


22

enter a valid guilty plea unless he is first given all


23

evidence in the prosecutor's possession which would have a


24

reasonable probability of discouraging him from pleading


25

guilty.

1

The Ninth Circuit's rule, new rule, is not a


2

logical extension of the Brady -- Brady v. Maryland, which


3

is premised on concern over the constitutional fairness of


4

criminal trials.

5

only when necessary to ensure a fair trial.

6

Brady itself, the Court was explicit to point out that it


7

-- that decision was premised on the avoidance of an


8

unfair trial to the accused.

9

have expanded upon or interpreted or explained Brady, have


10

been even more specific with respect to the limitations on


11

the scope of Brady.


Brady and its progeny require disclosure

In fact, in


The subsequent cases, which


12

In U.S. v. Agurs, the Court said the prosecutor


13

will not have violated his constitutional duty unless his


14

omission is of sufficient significance to result in the


15

denial of a fair trial. 


16

Something similar was said in U.S. v. Bagley. 


17

Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as


18

the primary means by which truth is uncovered.

19

not deprive a defendant of a fair trial, there is no


20

constitutional violation. 


21

QUESTION:

If it did


Can we get to your main argument


22

about Brady, that is, Brady in all its aspects is a trial


23

right, not a pretrial right, in view of the plea agreement


24

in this case, which represents that you have already


25

turned over the prime Brady material and the only question

21

And so my question is, isn't that, at


MR. OLSON:

You do have the


The answer to that, Justice


22

Ginsburg, is that both in the Sanchez decision and in this


23

case, the Ruiz decision, the Ninth Circuit went further


24

and made it clear that it was applying the rule that it


25

applied in this case to all exculpatory material which, if

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

known to the defendant, might cause the defendant not to

plead guilty.

4

further in the direction of the defendant, which often


5

happens.

6

reason or another, to give exculpatory information of some


7

sort to a defendant.

8

than that and made it clear that the rule that it was


9

enunciating applied to all exculpatory material, including


10

impeachment material, and that is the rule that's going to


11

be applicable in the Ninth Circuit.


Now, the undertaking that was made in the


Prosecutors frequently will decide, for one


But the Ninth Circuit went further


12

So, even if this Court determined to limit its


13

decision to the -- the narrower scope, as articulated in


14

the second paragraph of that proposed agreement, we'd be


15

back here next year because it's quite clear what the


16

Ninth Circuit intends to do with its rule.

22

MR. OLSON:

No, it was not, Mr. Chief Justice. 


23

This was a -- simply a -- a draft agreement which was, in


24

fact, prepared in response -- as a result of and in


25

response to the earlier Sanchez decision, which -- which

This was an effort by


I was -- I was going to ask why --


4

why is that second paragraph there?

5

occurred to me to --


6

MR. OLSON:

It wouldn't have


It's -- it's not in the record,


7

Justice Scalia, but it's my understanding that it's


8

something that is -- is developed particularly to deal


9

with the Sanchez case which the Ninth Circuit had already


10

decided, and the presumption that the Ninth -- the Ninth


11

Circuit's Sanchez decision went so far and not as far as


12

the -- that that covered the impeachment material, but not


13

other exculpatory material in the reverse.


14

So, however inartful this is, it was not in


15

response, Mr. Chief Justice, to a court order or any other


16

legal requirement, nor does it purport to articulate what

the law is.

14

it would ever be a justification to depart, that a

I mean, I can't


So, how -- how do we get to your issue and what


20

do I do about those two things which seem tremendous


21

blocks? 


22

MR. OLSON:

The Ninth Circuit -- let me answer


23

the jurisdictional point first.

The Ninth Circuit


24

perceived that it had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C.


25

3742(a)(1).

QUESTION:

Yes, in violation of law.

So, I


I'd say, what law? 


MR. OLSON:

And -- and that the Ninth Circuit


7

perceived that the district court felt that it was barred


8

by law from departing --


9
10
11

QUESTION:

There isn't much I can find in this


record that says that. 

MR. OLSON:

And -- and that the Ninth Circuit


12

felt that because this was a constitutional right that the


13

defendant was -- had that was being withheld from the


14

defendant because of the -- of the circumstances of this


15

case, that the -- the district court erroneously presumed


16

that it was prevented from going in a -- in a direction


17

that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go. 


18

And I think that then ties in with your second


19

-- your second question with respect to the sentencing


20

guidelines and section 5K2.

21

Ninth Circuit felt -- and it's not very clear, but -- and


22

-- and the Government is not objecting to the -- the way


23

the Ninth Circuit exercised jurisdiction at this point and


24

is not opposing the court's decision with respect to


25

jurisdiction at this point. 


The -- the court felt -- the


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The Ninth Circuit felt that under section 5K2 of


2

the sentencing guidelines, this would be a -- mitigate --


3

the -- the entry into the so-called fast track program was


4

a mitigating circumstance of a kind or a degree not


5

adequately taken into account by the guidelines in

formulating the guidelines.

the main issue.

14

jurisdictional blocks to me. 


15

MR. OLSON:

We'll get to


But these look like tremendous


It -- it -- I think the answer to


16

that latter point with respect to the individual


17

consideration is covered by the fact that this particular


18

program, under the circumstances of this district, are --


19

they may be -- it may be frequently occurring, but it's


20

individualistic in the sense that entering into this


21

program alleviates a substantial amount of work and -- and


22

provides a substantial benefit to the prosecutor in that


23

district without which the prosecutor may not be able to


24

enforce the law on all of the responsibilities of the law.


25

This is one of the most busy districts of the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

United States because of the tremendous number of


2

narcotics crimes coming in across the border, multiplied


3

in a sense by the number of immigration violations that


4

take place.

5

circumstance in that district.


6

So that this was an individualized


Now, one could quibble about the appropriateness


7

of that, but that's how the Ninth Circuit perceived it. 


8

It perceived that it had jurisdiction on that basis, and


9

we're not objecting to it. 


10

It seems clear that not only, therefore, that


11

not -- that this right is not required by or implicit


12

within Brady, but that the language of the Court's


13

decisions interpreting Brady make it clear that Brady is


14

not supposed to go that far, that it only has to do with


15

the rights at -- at trial. 


16

Furthermore, the solution that the Ninth Circuit


17

proposed with respect to this is both overly broad and


18

underly inclusive.

19

it was and as the respondent contends it should be, with


20

the potential of innocent persons pleading guilty, the


21

test itself, which is set out in the court's -- the -- the


22

Ninth Circuit's opinion on page -- I think it's 15a of the


23

appendix to the petition for certiorari.

24

through the page, the court says, the evidence is material


25

under the test announced in this case if there is a


If the Court was concerned, as it said

reasonable probability that but for the failure to


2

disclose the Brady material, the defendant would have


3

refused to plead and would have gone to trial.


4

In other words, the test is not couched in terms


5

of the potential innocence of the defendant or the risk


6

that a defendant was -- was innocent.

7

terms of the tactical decision a defendant might make with


8

respect to whether or not to go trial.

Precisely.

from -- from what Brady was about. 

MR. OLSON:

The standard -- the standards for

That's not a

1

-- this Court's decisions with respect to the right to


2

counsel, the right to trial, the right to intelligent


3

information with respect to that.


4

Rule 11, which is a -- which is a joint product


5

of the courts and the -- and the legislature, sets out


6

elaborate procedures pursuant to which a Federal judge


7

will inquire with respect to the basis for the plea,


8

explain the rights that the defendant has violated, and


9

specifically requires the Federal court to find that


10

there's a factual basis for the plea.


11

Now, so that what I was saying was that is the


12

remedy, the so-called remedy, that the Ninth Circuit has


13

come up -- is -- is under-inclusive to the extent that if


14

it's concerned about -- it's over-inclusive to the extent


15

that it's concerned about innocent people pleading guilty


16

because it doesn't go to the -- the factual innocent.

17

goes to the tactical decisions, the rolling of the dice,


18

with respect to what are the chances of winning or losing


19

in court. 


20

QUESTION:

It


Is this true, Mr. Solicitor General,


21

that the rolling of the dice concept can apply to an


22

24

who were going to identify him.

25

there, but there was somebody there who looks a lot like

3

and based on their own denial -- he doesn't have an alibi


4

-- and if he gets convicted, he has a very long sentence. 


5

6

sentence.

7

about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are. 


8
9

And so they've got a choice of either taking the


I don't suppose there's anything unethical


MR. OLSON:

Well, no, there's nothing unethical


about the lawyer trying to figure out what the odds are. 


10

In fact, rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal


11

Procedure give fairly elaborate rights of discovery to the


12

defendant's counsel.

13

judge will inquire with respect to whether there's a


14

factual basis for the plea agreement.


15

And at that plea agreement, the


In fact, the judge in this case specifically


16

addressed that question to the defendant, asked the


17

defendant is it, indeed, true -- asked the defendant and


18

then the counsel interceded and said, yes, she was


19

bringing in her car 60 -- 60 pounds of marijuana.

20

then the judge turned to the defendant and said, is that


21

true?

2

this, the plea bargain will go down the drain.

3

guess he shouldn't tell him what -- I don't know exactly


4

what the lawyer is supposed to do there. 


5

MR. OLSON:

Now, I


Well, I don't -- I'm not sure


6

either.

It would all depend upon the circumstance.

There


7

is -- there is a possibility that this Court's recognized


8

in the Alford decision a possibility of making a plea


9

which is -- which is not incompatible with a defendant's


10

assertion of innocence.

11

the defendant is the one who will know more than anyone,


12

the prosecutor or anyone else, whether the defendant is


13

guilty. 


14

QUESTION:

But I think that in most cases


Right, but I'm assuming a case in


15

which the defendant knows he's not guilty, and


16

nevertheless, there's a risk that, because the odds are so


17

heavy if you get convicted, you go away for 20 years.

18

you have a 16-month plea bargain, you may want to not take


19

the chance. 


20

MR. OLSON:

If


Well, I understand that, Justice


21

Stevens.

That may happen in a particular case.

This


22

Court said in Bagley that Brady's primary purpose is not


23

to -- Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary


24

system as the primary means by which truth is -- as the


25

primary means by which truth is uncovered.

And I think

Alderson Reporting Company

said that a defendant may have to make some hard choices.

MR. OLSON:

18

QUESTION:

The Court said that explicitly.

Well, if we're talking about


19

balancing and basic fairness, I guess their argument would


20

be with 57,000 cases going -- that's 85 percent or 90


21

percent of all people plead guilty.

22

drug crimes.

2

guilty irrespective of the facts.

3

balances.

4

it makes it somewhat more fair in that mine run situation


5

to understand what are the chances of being convicted if I


6

do go to trial. 


As you were saying, it balances the system and


7

MR. OLSON:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

And therefore, it


Well --

That would be the argument, I think,


the other way in terms of fundamental fairness. 

MR. OLSON:

And I would answer that in two ways. 


11

In the first place, I think the Chief Justice answered it


12

by referring to the Brady v. United States case.


13

QUESTION:

So, you'd have to say that you're


14

right, that that isn't what Brady said.

But in taking --


15

taking into account the reality of the criminal justice


16

system, where 85 percent of the people plead guilty, and


17

the prosecutor is armed with this tremendous don't plead


18

guilty or else sentencing system, that this creates a kind


19

of basic balance that -- in terms of fairness -- I'm


20

trying to get the argument out. 


21

MR. OLSON:

I understand, Justice Breyer, I


22

understand what you're saying.

And there's a certain --


23

there's a certain logic to it.

But if that is -- if that


24

was the case, then the Ninth Circuit's rule is under-


25

inclusive because if the defendant really wants to know

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what the best chances are, rather than the exculpatory


2

material or the impeachment material, what he is going to


3

want to know is the inculpatory material.

4

the point about the other -- other prosecutions that are


5

being held over the defendant's head.

7

greater offense that they're about to charge me with,


8

because I'm going to take my chances now and plead to this

lesser included offense.

And you made


He's going to want


So, if the Ninth Circuit wanted to accomplish


11

what you're talking about as the thrust of your question,


12

it would have gone -- and I suspect that it will --


13

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you wouldn't want it to


14

go further, would -- would you, General Olson?

15

would not want us to adopt a rule that encourages -- that


16

enables innocent people to more intelligently plead guilty


17

when they're innocent? 


18

MR. OLSON:

19

QUESTION:

No.

You -- you


I'm not --


I mean, it seems to me we should do


20

everything to discourage people who are innocent from


21

pleading guilty. 


22

MR. OLSON:

23

QUESTION:

I -- I --

What kind of a legal system is this


24

where we're going to design our rules to encourage guilty


25

people to plead -- or innocent people to plead guilty?

1

It's crazy. 


2

MR. OLSON:

This Court -- this Court has said


3

that it's perfectly appropriate in the adversarial system


4

for the prosecutor to find legitimate ways to encourage


5

guilty defendants to plead guilty. 


6

Now, we -- you're absolutely right.

7

QUESTION:

It's --


We're worrying here about innocent


8

people, and we're trying to encourage them to plead guilty


9

so that -- if they know everything about what the


10

Government has.

I mean, there's something wrong with a


11

legal system that -- that --

MR. OLSON:

QUESTION:

14

MR. OLSON:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. OLSON:

But there's --

-- is even contemplating such --

-- Justice Scalia --

-- such action, it seems to me. 

-- nothing in this case that


17

involves that issue at all.

We have a guilty defendant


18

who has acknowledged under oath -- I think it was under


19

oath.

20

this person was guilty.

21

possibility of drafting a rule -- or the Ninth Circuit


22

drafted a rule for a hypothetical situation not involving


23

the case before it, which was over-inclusive because it


24

includes the vast number of people that are indeed guilty,


25

and under-inclusive because it doesn't provide a remedy --


Usually it is, in the Federal court systems -- that

So, you are faced with the


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the best remedy which we would definitely not encourage,


2

but I would suggest would be the next step, possibly from


3

the same circuit, with respect to giving additional


4

information.


5

And it would be inconsistent not only with that,


6

but it would be inconsistent with what this Court has said


7

over and over again with respect to the value of competent


8

counsel, the fact that certain chances have to be taken,


9

that a defendant is not entitled to set aside a plea


10

because he may have misconstrued the weight or balance of


11

the prosecution's case, or there may have been mistakes of


12

law.

13

fact, it was a misconstruction of whether or not the


14

defendant would -- could be -- could be put to death if


15

the defendant went to trial.

16

recognized that there are those balances in the system. 


17

But what the -- what we urge upon the Court is


In one -- in -- in Brady v. the United States, in


So, this Court has


18

that there are so many protections, including the


19

discovery right, the fairly exhaustive --


20

QUESTION:

The discovery right would cover --


21

you did say there were some things that a defendant


22

perhaps would not know, and one of them you mentioned in


23

your -- in your brief is if you rob a bank and you don't


24

know whether it's FDIC insured.

25

How would that -- how would that come out pretrial?


That kind of information. 


21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. OLSON:

That would -- that would come out


2

through rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal


3

Procedure, which is set out in the appendix, I think 3a to


4

5a, of our brief on the merits.

5

pretrial considerable discovery rights to find out those


6

sorts of things, and if the defendant is not sure and,


7

after consultation with his counsel, wishes to go to


8

trial, there's -- the Brady rights do kick in at an


9

appropriate time to allow the defendant to prepare for


10
11

The defendant is given


trial. 

What I'm saying is that -- that the combination


12

of the constitutional rights to trial and -- and


13

confrontation, the constitutional rights to counsel, the


14

-- the statutory rights to discovery, the statutory


15

obligations on a judge to make sure there's a factual


16

basis for the guilty plea, the obligations -- and we have


17

to assume under -- as this Court suggested in the


18

Mezzanatto case, a -- a good faith behavior by our public


19

officials that a prosecutor is not going to withhold


20

evidence in -- on -- where it knows that the -- this is an


21

innocent defendant.

22

especially in the context, as this Court has said over and


23

over again, that the best person to know whether there's a


24

factual basis for a plea of guilty is the defendant


25

himself or herself. 


Those are ample assurances,


22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I will say one more thing that is -- that seems


2

to me important with respect to the -- this -- the posture


3

in which this case comes.

4

that there is a constitutional right -- and we think that


5

neither this Court's decisions nor the Constitution would


6

lead the Court to that conclusion -- the constitutional


7

right could be waived.

8

defendant cannot, even if the defendant wanted to, plead


9

guilty.

10
11

If this Court were to determine


The Ninth Circuit said that a


Knowing that the defendant was guilty, the


defendant could not waive the right. 

Now, that has several implications.

It -- it


12

creates problems for the criminal justice system.

The


13

Brady -- the Brady right that the Ninth Circuit would


14

engraft on the system here would force prosecutors to


15

develop cases and use resources at the defendant's


16

initiative, on the defendant's time table.

17

turns Brady -- the right, from a fair trial right into a


18

fair trial preparation right.


It creates --


19

With respect to certain types of cases, it would


20

compromise conspiracy cases, racketeering cases, organized


21

crime drug cases, white collar cases where there may be


22

substantial warehouses full of documents.

23

many prosecutors won't be preparing their case for


24

determining what witnesses they're going to use until


25

they're ready to go to trial.

In other words,


Once they -- if they had to

23

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

disclose this information on the defendant's time table,


2

which the defendant -- if this rule were adopted by this


3

Court, the first thing a defendant would do is offer --


4

say, "I'm thinking about pleading guilty.

5

everything in your files." 


6

Give me


Now, a prosecutor in complicated cases is not going


7

to want to do that and -- and will refuse to engage in


8

that process or will -- once -- once it does so, there's


9

no more incentive for the -- for the prosecutor to enter


10

into the plea bargaining process.

11

damaging to the benefits of the defendants over and over


12

again that's received the benefits of the plea bargaining


13

system, which this Court has sanctioned and encouraged. 


14

QUESTION:

I don't want to cut into your -- your


15

reserve time.

16

case, what happens?

17

of relief?

18

Just one question.

MR. OLSON:

Or has she served the full time


anyway?

MR. OLSON:

-- she -- I don't -- I don't know

whether she's served the entire -- the sentence that was

That was at the very


So there is still some -- something


at stake here?


7

MR. OLSON:

Yes, I believe so, Justice Kennedy,

but I'm not sure, 100 percent sure, factually I know the


9

answer to that.

If I may reserve the balance of my time.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

please the Court:

The Due Process Clause requires the disclosure

of materials --


19

QUESTION:

20

moot?

21

period? 


Before you get going, is the case


Is there something left on the 3-year probation


22

MR. HUBACHEK:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. HUBACHEK:

25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


Yes, there is, Justice O'Connor.


Thank you. 

Now, the -- the disclosure of


material exculpatory information is essential to ensure

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the accuracy of criminal convictions.

2

there's a societal and individual interest in the accuracy


3

of such convictions that's paramount. 


4

And Ake indicates


The system that we have now, as has been


5

discussed already this morning funnels cases into plea


6

negotiations, and the -- the Court has said that's not a


7

bad thing, but it -- still, it funnels everybody, the


8

guilty and the innocent, into the same sort of result. 


9

Innocent people are provided the same substantial and


10

legitimate incentives to plead guilty as guilty people


11

are.


12

And if I could return to Justice --


13

QUESTION:

No.

I -- I object to that.

I -- I


14

don't think our system ever encourages or, indeed, even


15

permits an innocent person to plead guilty.

16

require the judge to -- to interrogate the person pleading


17

guilty to make sure that, indeed, the person is guilty. 


18

There is nothing in our system that encourages or even


19

allows an innocent person to -- to plead guilty.

20

would be horrified if -- if there were something like


21

that.


22

MR. HUBACHEK:

Our rules


And I


Well, Justice Scalia, the -- the


23

system does not -- first of all, I guess the first


24

protection would be a rule 11 type factual basis.

25

not required in every case.

That's


In fact, the Fifth Circuit

26

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cases that the Solicitor General relies upon, both of


2

those were nolo or Alford type pleas.

3

factual basis provided at all in those cases.

4

who don't know whether they're innocent or guilty -- they


5

don't have to provide a factual basis that's -- that's


6

incorrect or false.


7

QUESTION:

8

How many individuals don't know


MR. HUBACHEK:

Your Honor, there are some. 


I've --


11
12

Individuals


whether they're innocent or guilty?


9
10

So, there was no


QUESTION:
it -- it is rare.

13

I'm sure there may be rare cases, but

Is it not? 


MR. HUBACHEK:

I'm sure that it's not


14

tremendously common, but the important thing is -- is that


15

individuals who are innocent do receive the same


16

incentives to plead guilty.

17

from various State courts at pages 10 to 11 of the brief


18

where individuals pled guilty where substantial material


19

exculpatory evidence existed, several cases like Justice


20

Stevens' hypothetical involving identification testimony


21

where an individual was charged with an offense and was


22

told that there had been an identification made by what


23

appeared to be an otherwise unimpeachable witness --


24
25

QUESTION:
down to?

And I've cited some cases


So -- so that's what your case comes


You want us to facilitate the pleading of guilty

27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

by innocent people.

2

that will make -- will make that a more intelligent


3

decision so that we can put in jail a lot of people who


4

plead guilty even though they're innocent because it's a


5

good deal for them.


6
7

MR. HUBACHEK:
all.

No, Your Honor, not -- not at


I --


8
9

You -- you want us to set up a system


QUESTION:

I thought that's what you're saying. 


I don't know what other -- for the guilty person, you're


10

not worried about it.

You're -- you're asserting the


11

rights of the innocent.


12

MR. HUBACHEK:

Right.

13

who needs to receive this --


14

QUESTION:

It's the innocent person


Who needs to be able to plead guilty


15

so he'll -- he'll serve a sentence that he doesn't


16

deserve.


17

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, Your Honor, the fact that


18

that happens exists already.

19

is to provide material exculpatory information to


20

individuals who are not guilty which will, when they are


21

able to --


22

QUESTION:

The rule that I'm asking for


But your client is guilty, and I


23

don't understand why what we're talking about is some


24

hypothetical.

25

and the argument is, if the case is going to go to trial,


You have to establish your client's right


28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you're entitled, before the trial starts, to get this


2

stuff, but you're not entitled to get it in the beginning


3

of the case.

4

asserting that right on behalf of your guilty client.


5

And you are representing a guilty client and


MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the --


6

the posture of the case, as has been discussed, is that


7

there -- this is a sentencing issue where there's a


8

request for a departure based upon the -- this fast track


9

program.

Ms. Ruiz didn't participate in the fast track


10

program because she objected to the term of the plea


11

agreement which required her to surrender her rights under


12

the -- the Brady decision. 


13
14

QUESTION:

But she -- she pled guilty


nonetheless.

She said she's guilty. 


15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HUBACHEK:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HUBACHEK:

Yes, she did. 


And she didn't enter an Alford plea.

No, Justice Souter, she did not. 


19

But the -- the way that the case was presented to the


20

Ninth Circuit was that she had a constitutional right to


21

this information, if it existed.

22

situations where the -- the marijuana, for instance, in


23

this case is concealed.

24

who's merely a courier would ever have actual access to


25

it.

I mean, there are


It's unlikely that an individual


There is a recent spate of cases in Dallas where the

1

drugs that were seized turned out not to be drugs.


2

QUESTION:

That's all true, but this is --


3

you're asking for a really major change in the system.

4

mean, what the Government says -- and maybe it would be a


5

better system, but the Government says, once we go down


6

this path, here's what's going to happen.

7

right to me.


8
9

I


And they sound


The prosecutors, who are very busy -- very busy

-- and have a little time with the witnesses and they go


10

in and start talking about a plea, will now not be able to


11

do that.

12

all the evidence together, get the impeachment stuff, give


13

it to the defendant, and 80 percent of them or maybe only


14

30 percent will say, the hell with this.

15

trial.

16

They'll have to look into their witnesses, get


I'm not going to do it.

We'll go to


We'll go to trial.


And under the present system, particularly in


17

drug offenses, what that means for many, many, many


18

people, guilty and innocent -- let's say guilty -- they're


19

going to go away for very long times.

20

we're transforming this system into something like a


21

European system where you can't take guilty pleas, and


22

it'd be somewhere in the middle.

23

And, anyway, the Constitution doesn't requirement --


24

require it and it would work out the worse, they say, for


25

a lot of defendants. 


And therefore,


That's a major change.

MR. HUBACHEK:

QUESTION:

The pleas are proceeding


The same way?

The same way, Your Honor.

The --


But let's -- let's go back perhaps to


15

Justice Ginsburg's question, that you say you're here on

your own client admitted that she was -- had 50 or 60


18

pounds of marijuana.

Surely, you've got to argue for a

would, indeed, benefit both non-innocent and innocent


23

individuals.

24

constitutional protection.


25

But that's the case with every

31

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

say we don't accept guilty pleas from innocent people? 


2

That's our policy.

MR. HUBACHEK:

any judge or any prosecutor wants to accept guilty pleas

from innocent people.

who's innocent.

And indeed may not do so.

That's the


You -- you won't accept a guilty plea from someone


MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, the protections that are in


10

place don't fully account for innocence.

11

example, even in a rule 11 decision -- in a rule 11 plea,


12

if you ask someone, did you sell the drugs or did you, you


13

know, shoot the person, that doesn't say anything about


14

whether or not there's entrapment.

15

anything at all about whether or not there's self-defense. 


16

If a defendant pleads guilty in ignorance of that kind of


17

information, then in fact an innocent person could plead


18

guilty.

basis provided at all.

And again --


Wait a minute.

I don't understand. 


21

The person doesn't understand that there's a -- this

Is -- is that the hypothetical you're positing,

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

know there's a right of self-defense?

MR. HUBACHEK:

The -- the concern here, Justice


3

Scalia, is not evidence that the lawyer has access to and


4

simply misadvises the client.

5

to take the risk in many situations.

6

about is evidence that would support such a defense, an


7

entrapment defense, or a self-defense defense that's not


8

available to counsel but is in the possession of -- of the


9

prosecution.


10

QUESTION:

I understand that you have

What I'm talking


Well, it would certainly be in


11

possession of the defendant.

12

impossible for him not to know whether he was acting in


13

self-defense.

14

giving him, this innocent person, this information is to


15

enable him to make an intelligent judgment to plead guilty


16

even though he's innocent.

17

don't think we're supposed to encourage that.


18

I mean, it -- it's


The -- the only possible reason for -- for


And I don't think we're -- I


I mean, we would have contradictory policies. 


19

Other provisions of our laws make it very clear that we


20

are not to accept guilty pleas from innocent people, and


21

you want to adopt a system that will enable innocent


22

people more intelligently to plead guilty.


23

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, perhaps -- what I'm saying


24

is -- is that if information that supports the self-


25

defense theory that is not in the possession of the

33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

defense but is in the possession of the prosecution, if


2

that evidence is turned over, that will make it more


3

likely that the innocent person will go to trial --


4

QUESTION:

Okay.

Let's --


5

QUESTION:

Is there -- is there any precedent


6

outside the Ninth Circuit that says Brady is an immediate


7

turnover right and not a preparation for trial right?


8

MR. HUBACHEK:

Yes, there is.

The Second


9

Circuit has adopted this rule since 1988, and again, while


10

the Solicitor General has come forward and indicated there


11

are numerous potential down sides to this type of


12

constitutional rule, the bottom line is -- is it --


13
14

QUESTION:

The Second Circuit has for impeaching


material as well?


15

MR. HUBACHEK:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor. 


Let me go back to a variant of


17

Justice Scalia's question.

It seems to me that your


18

strongest argument is the argument that does focus on the


19

-- the supposedly innocent defendant.

20

argument that I think is strongest with respect to that


21

category is the argument that those who enter Alford pleas


22

obviously are not doing so because they want to plead


23

guilty, despite their protest of innocence, they're doing


24

it because they think they face such terrible odds that,


25

in fact, it's better for them to collapse at the beginning


And -- and the

1

and get it over with.

2

with exculpatory, including impeachment evidence, they are


3

less likely to do just what Justice Scalia says we, after


4

all, as a system don't want them to do.


5

And if these people are presented


My question is, do you have any indication that


6

there is such a rash of unintelligent Alford pleas going


7

on that we should modify the entire system to respond to


8

this risk of Alford pleas that, in fact, would not be


9

entered if the disclosure that you ask for were given?


10

MR. HUBACHEK:

I don't have an -- an empirical


11

study that shows how many such guilty pleas are entered. 


12

I've cited on pages 10 to 11 of the respondent's brief a


13

number of cases in which there are potentially innocent


14

people who have pled guilty, individuals who didn't know,


15

for instance, that a witness saw the tire blow out on the


16

car before the car crossed over the median, indicating


17

that that person -- that the tire blowout, not the


18

person's driving was responsible for the accident.


19

Another case, the Gibson case, where the


20

prosecutor was actually told by the main identification


21

witness that she was changing her story, and that wasn't


22

turned over to the defense. 


23

In the Lee case, a situation where the


24

individual was charged with an offense and told that there


25

was an identification, and it turns out that the -- the

35
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

witness misidentified him and that then the -- the witness


2

was later shown, before a preliminary hearing, a picture


3

of the defendant.

4

this risk exists. 


5

So, there are cases out there in which


And if I could, I think that the -- one of the


6

problems I guess in getting across the point is that I


7

think the Solicitor General has misstated the import of


8

the Ninth Circuit's test.

9

solely a -- you know, we want to give you all the cards so


The Ninth Circuit's test is not


10

you can make a better strategic choice.

11

is derived from the Court's decision in Hill v. Lockhart,


12

and Hill v. Lockhart's test says would the defendant have


13

gone to trial if, in fact, he had received the proper


14

advice.

15

The -- the test


But then it says that --

QUESTION:

Well, but even -- even if you're


16

going to imply -- if -- if that's going to be your


17

standard, it seems to me that the Solicitor General has


18

got a point when he says if the Ninth Circuit test is


19

going to be applied and applied with your gloss, it can't


20

stop where it is now.

21

further step and, in effect, require disclosure of all the


22

inculpatory evidence.

23

MR. HUBACHEK:

It's going to have to go the


What's your response to that?

My response to that is -- is that


24

we're asking for a right based on Brady, and Brady doesn't


25

provide for --

QUESTION:

Oh, but Brady -- I mean, Brady


2

ultimately comes down to a judgment about materiality, and


3

-- and materiality in the sense of -- of the kind of


4

evidence that disturbs confidence in the verdict is a


5

judgment that can only be made in the context of the


6

entire evidence of the case.

7

are made after the fact.

8

very fact if we're -- if Brady is going, ultimately, to be

our standard here, doesn't imply just what the Solicitor

General argued.


11

Before we can tell that there has been a


12

violation of the rule that you propose, a court would have


13

to know -- and indeed, before that, a defendant presumably


14

would have to know -- the -- the entire evidentiary world


15

of that case.

16

more than impeachment evidence or even exculpatory


17

evidence.

evidence is.

essentially a global disclosure rule.


21

And that means you've got to know a lot


You've got to know what the inculpatory

So, it seems to me that what you're arguing


MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, I'd respectfully disagree. 


22

I think that the Hill v. Lockhart test, when specifically


23

the Hill case was discussing when defense counsel fails to


24

-- to find material exculpatory evidence, that the Ninth


25

Circuit test would apply at that point, but that that test

37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

will ultimately devolve into what effect this evidence

would have at trial.

MR. HUBACHEK:

That's correct, Your Honor. 


So, we're not talking about any

MR. HUBACHEK:

No.

Hill talked about ineffective assistance of counsel in the


10

context of the failure to locate material exculpatory


11

evidence, essentially the same facts that -- that could


12

conceivably result in the withdrawal of the guilty plea.


13

QUESTION:

Yes, but the relationship between a


14

defendant's attorney and the prosecutor on the other side


15

are by no means the same.


16

MR. HUBACHEK:

I agree.

And Brady certainly

doesn't suggest that they're the same.

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I assume there is, as the

Solicitor General suggests, some pretrial discovery right


14

that a defense counsel has.


15

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, there's some pretrial


16

discovery right, but it's not extensive and oftentimes it


17

doesn't cover the types of information that has led to


18

potential miscarriages of justice, as I set out in the


19

brief.

QUESTION:

And in fact, the -- the relevant


21

discovery rule actually prohibits, as I read it, discovery

of some material that you say this rule would cover.

Justice Stevens,

Which is -- which is a troubling

concept because one of the things we're sort of trying to

do here is balance the system-wide benefit of an -- a fast

where there's a risk of injustice that -- that concerns

11

rather elaborate rules as to just what rights you do have


12

before you plead guilty, and you're, in effect, saying


13

well, we should go beyond those as a matter of judicial


14

craftsmanship.


15

MR. HUBACHEK:

Well, the rule that we're


16

proposing would not supplant all of those rules.

17

a narrow range --


18

QUESTION:

This is


It would add to them, and that's it. 


19

There's -- there's a limited right of discovery under the


20

Federal rules, and you are urging an expansion of that


21

right essentially.


22

MR. HUBACHEK:

It -- it would expand it.

That's


23

correct.

However, it would expand it in only a narrow


24

fashion because the information that we would -- that the


25

defense would be entitled to would be limited by the

40

notion of materiality.

Bagley was whether or not a more broad rule should be


3

adopted, but ultimately the -- the Court settled on the

materiality standard. 


5

QUESTION:

Much of the debate in Agurs and


What we're doing is -- is you're


6

asking us to open up the plea bargaining process and


7

piecemeal to bring in a constitutional rule that would


8

affect one aspect of it.

9

accept that, at least without knowing more about what are


Now, it's -- it's hard for me to


10

the proposals around in the bar and elsewhere as to how


11

that process should be regularized.

12

suggestions, rules change suggestions, statutory


13

suggestions?

14

in, in a sense, out of -- from somewhere suddenly affect

this -- the whole process?

reading something? 


17

Are there rules


Where does this constitutional rule coming


MR. HUBACHEK:

Can I get a grasp of that by


I -- I can't direct you, Justice


18

Breyer, to any particular rule change proposals that are


19

out there.


20

Our argument is based upon the notion that


21

everyone agrees that the defendant is entitled to -- to


22

material exculpatory evidence at trial under the Fifth


23

Amendment and also that the -- that the Sixth Amendment


24

requires defense counsel to find material exculpatory


25

evidence to use at trial. 

41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, the -- the Sixth Amendment also requires


2

counsel to locate material exculpatory evidence before the


3

decision to make a plea is -- is made.

4

that is is so that it will be a plea that's worthy of


5

confidence.

6

Brady is -- is essentially the same as under Strickland. 


7

We want a -- a proceeding that's reliable.


8
9

And the reason


And that's -- ultimately the standard under


Under the current state of the law, if defense

counsel fails to find a piece of material exculpatory


10

evidence, that guilty plea is then, therefore, going to be


11

unreliable.

12

exculpatory evidence is unavailable to counsel, but in the


13

possession of the prosecution, that conviction is


14

considered to be reliable even if the defendant doesn't


15

get the benefit of it.


16

But if the same piece of -- of material


So, what we're proposing is -- is that there is


17

a complementary action of -- of both the Fifth and Sixth


18

Amendment rights pre plea and during the trial and that if


19

there is going to be an overlap in the Fifth and Sixth


20

Amendment rights it's got to be at -- where the interest


21

that those rights protect is at its highest, and that is,


22

protecting the innocent from pleading guilty.

Under the fast track program, does


the defendant have to waive rule 16 rights?

MR. HUBACHEK:

2

the -- what happens is -- is that there is a pre-

indictment offer that's made and the pre-indictment offer

case like Ms. Ruiz's, the reports of the initial

response was -- is that was acceptance and offer.

and the interpretation of that is -- is the district

Well, the Solicitor General

hasn't been framing the questions related solely to the

Mr. Hubachek.

Did you argue in the Ninth Circuit

MR. HUBACHEK:

With respect to the -- the --


2

with respect to the Fifth and Sixth Amendment claim that


3

we've made, the Second Circuit has also found a different


4

theory under which the -- the Court could find a Brady


5

violation, and they've indicated that the failure to turn


6

over Brady information is essentially otherwise


7

impermissible conduct under the Brady v. United States


8

case.

9

States, and I think that the Ninth Circuit's analogy to


So, Mr. Chief Justice brought up Brady v. United


10

Hill v. Lockhart and the Miller v. Angliker impermissible


11

conduct approach has both addressed the concern that


12

United States v. Brady would preclude. 


13

QUESTION:

But -- but, you know, to say we'll


14

just call it impermissible conduct because we want to get


15

it done isn't very satisfactory.

16

why it's impermissible.


17

MR. HUBACHEK:

Right.

I mean, you have to say


And our -- our point is


18

-- is that it's impermissible because the Fifth and Sixth


19

Amendments together protect the innocent from conviction. 


20

When the Fifth Amendment right to receive the information


21

-- excuse me.

22

counsel find this information attaches, then the Fifth


23

Amendment right to have the Government turn it over should


24

also attach because the same source of unreliability would


25

be present if, in fact, the defendant were to make the


When the Sixth Amendment right to have


47
Alderson Reporting Company

1

decision to plead guilty without receiving material


2

exculpatory information. 


3

QUESTION:

But in order to make that argument,


4

as I understand it, you have to make an unreliability


5

argument divorced from a materiality argument.

6

agree?


7
8

MR. HUBACHEK:

No.

Do you


No, I don't because there is


a materiality requirement in Hill v. Lockhart. 


9

QUESTION:

How do we judge that materiality at


10

-- I mean, in Hill and Lockhart, when -- when you're


11

dealing with counsel, you can at least say, well, if -- if


12

they had been aware -- regardless of how the case would


13

have turned out, there's a way in which it makes sense to


14

say that if they had been aware of this kind of evidence,


15

they would have said we're going to trial.

16

roll the dice.


17

We're going to


When you're dealing with -- with essentially a


18

-- a Brady rule, you're not dealing with a will they roll


19

the dice or will they not kind of question; you're dealing


20

ultimately with the question of what was its effect on the


21

-- the soundness of the verdict, the soundness of a


22

result.

23

know everything that would be in the case.

24

that's easy in a Brady situation because you're looking


25

back.

And the only way you can make that judgment is to

In a sense


Here you can't look back.

Alderson Reporting Company

So, it seems to me that you've either got to

come up with an entirely new materiality or prejudice


3

standard, and the -- and the effectiveness of counsel


4

cases don't seem to me quite on point there.

5

got to dispense with a materiality standard entirely and


6

say anything that would have had any tendency to exculpate


7

or to impeach in a way favorable to the defendant, if


8

denied, supports in effect a -- a claim for relief, which


9

is a nonmateriality standard. 


10

MR. HUBACHEK:

Or you've


Well, Justice Souter, on page 16


11

of our brief, we have a block quote from Hill v. Lockhart,


12

and I really think that the test that was discussed in


13

Hill v. Lockhart covers the -- the concerns that Your


14

Honor is mentioning today.

15

Lockhart concludes by saying that in -- in the case of


16

counsel failing to discover material exculpatory


17

information, which is essentially the same type of problem


18

that we're talking about here, it says that ultimately the


19

assessment will depend in large part on a prediction


20

whether the evidence likely would have changed the outcome


21

of a trial. 


22

And ultimately Hill v.


Now, I certainly agree that it will be a more


23

difficult assessment to make without there actually having


24

been a trial, but we're asking that Your Honors adopt a

circumstances that are by definition very different.

17

easier application post trial, but it's still the same

test that -- that's -- that we're being asked to apply in

intelligently, we've got to know what the trial would have


2

included, won't we?

3

that the disclosure has got to go to, in effect, the


4

inculpatory evidence, or it means at the minimum, number


5

two, that the State has an opportunity to come in and say,


6

we'll tell you what the inculpatory evidence would have


7

been.

8

this context, it's not material.


9

And that either means, number one,


This is what we would have put in, and judged in


One way or the other, either -- either the


10

necessary implication of your test or the -- the


11

implication that the State would have a right to respond


12

to it, it seems implies that in order to apply your rule


13

before trial, a -- a court, reviewing one of your claims,


14

would have to make a judgment about the -- the


15

significance of the evidence in the context of -- of an


16

entire trial, a whole evidentiary record that can be --


17

that can -- can be anticipated.

But a prosecutor in making the


Except in Hill it's easier because we


22

know that trial decisions are -- are often made without


23

knowing what the result would be.

go ahead and have a shot at defending the case, and that's


25

a different -- that's a different standard from Brady

MR. HUBACHEK:

QUESTION:

4

General Olson, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON


6

Hill is a plea case.


Thank you, Mr. Hubachek.


ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


7

MR. OLSON:

8

What the respondent is proposing and what the


9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.


Ninth Circuit adopted is an unworkable and undesirable


10

rule to solve a nonexistent problem.

11

by the facts of this case.

12

pages in the respondent's brief cite some cases in which


13

theoretically it might be that some driver who crossed the


14

line earlier might create a problem, but that is not this


15

case.

16

evidence in the record that would show that there's a


17

significant problem here.

18

And it's illustrated


The footnote or the -- the


And there's no empirical evidence or any other


QUESTION:

The --


Mr. Olson, would you address again


19

the jurisdictional problem here?

20

the district court judge had discretion about what


21

sentence to impose and could have -- and did exercise that


22

discretion, do we have to be concerned about --


23

MR. OLSON:

I mean, if -- if in fact


I think that is not an easy


24

situation, but I think that the Ninth Circuit believed


25

that however inartfully the district court expressed it or

52
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

incompletely the district court expressed it, that the --


2

that the district court was saying it didn't feel that it


3

had the capacity or the ability under the law to depart,


4

that it didn't have the discretion to do so.

5

the Ninth Circuit decided.

6

Ninth Circuit --


7

QUESTION:

could mean that, I suppose.

9

but it could --


11

MR. OLSON:

We argued otherwise to the


I guess this is not a proper case


8

10

That's what


I wouldn't put it that way,


It could mean that.

That's how the


Ninth Circuit -- Circuit perceived it.


12

QUESTION:

I'd even attempt not to say anything


13

about it, so long as I was not certain that there was no


14

jurisdiction. 


15

MR. OLSON:

We -- we believe that we -- after


16

looking at it carefully, we've decided that the Ninth


17

Circuit probably was right under the circumstances,


18

although you could argue it the other way, and that this


19

-- this is an issue that is presented clearly with respect


20

to the -- the legal standard that's been adopted to the --


21

by the Ninth Circuit and which is in play today. 


22

The -- the respondent says, well, pleas are


23

proceeding apace in California notwithstanding -- or in


24

the Ninth Circuit, notwithstanding the decision in this


25

case.

There is no evidence in the record to suggest that

53
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this hasn't created a problem, and in fact, I'm informed


2

that there are cases that have not been brought and cases


3

that have been dismissed because of a concern about


4

complying with the rule in this case, because once that's


5

done, those cases are -- are potentially over with.

6

the fact is there's no evidence either way. 


7

But


Justice Breyer, you raised some questions about


8

whether we would be constitutionalizing a rule which would


9

change Jencks and change the discovery rules.

There --


10

there -- on page 26 of the Government's brief, we talked


11

about the fact that there have been efforts to change and


12

accelerate the discovery requirements and that those have


13

been soundly rejected for the very reasons we've been


14

talking about here.

15

because there's very much concern over the safety of


16

witnesses when those statements are produced earlier in


17

the case.

18

quite consciously that those statements don't have to be


19

produced until the witness is actually called in trial for


20

that reason.


21

And the Jencks standard is what it is


And that's -- Congress has made that decision


Let me finish by saying that with respect to


22

Hill v. Lockhart, that's a case involving a requirement


23

that a defendant have, under the Sixth Amendment,


24

competent counsel within the range of -- of competence


25

expected for counsel in criminal cases.

That's a Sixth


54

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.

2

not a -- a constitutional right to effective assistance of


3

the prosecution in deciding whether to plead guilty or


4

not.


5

It is


What we have in this case is a rule which is not


6

required, which -- which would cause considerable


7

problems.

8

which is important to the administration of criminal


9

justice in this country, and affect the finality of guilty


10

pleas, which is an important consideration as well.


11
12

It would undermine the plea bargaining system,


CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, General


Olson.


13

The case is submitted.

(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the


15

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
