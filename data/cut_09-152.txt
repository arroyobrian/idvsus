CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

Wyeth.

Mr. Frederick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

This case involves a vaccine designed in the

12

1940s that was administered to Hannah Bruesewitz in

13

1992, some 30 years after scientists discovered a safer

14

way to design the pertussis component of the DTP

15

vaccine.

16

could not pursue a design defect claim under State law

17

invoking the preemption principle in claiming that the

18

Vaccine Act of 1986 preempted the Bruesewitz's State

19

claim.

20

The Third Circuit held that the Bruesewitzes

That holding is in error for three reasons.
First, the court overlooked the numerous

21

provisions of the Act protecting manufacturers from

22

liability, but it did not expressly preempt design

23

defect claims.

24
25

Second, the court misconstrued the word
"unavoidable" in section 22(b)(1)'s Federal law defense.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

And third, the court adopted a policy that
exposes children to unnecessary safety risks.

3

With respect to the first reason, in the

4

1986 Act Congress created a program, the vaccine

5

program, that was funded by surcharges on the vaccines

6

that users used, and out of that fund designed a program

7

to pay compensation to persons who were injured by

8

vaccine-related acts.

9

Congress also provided a mechanism for

10

exhaustion through the vaccine court program before a

11

person claiming injury could pursue a State law cause of

12

action.

13

law that was designed to govern such actions, Congress

14

established certain defenses, but all of those defenses

15

apply on a case-by-case basis.

16

provisions that preclude a State law claim.

17

Circuit misunderstood that basic principle.

18

In creating Federal law defenses to the State

There are no absolute
The Third

The defenses that the Vaccine Act created

19

for manufacturers includes such things as a regulatory

20

compliance defense for failure to warrant claims, a

21

22

national level, the imposition of comment k -

trying to make?

What is -- I'm

What's the point that you are

That because there are a whole bunch of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

provisions designed to help manufacturers, that this one

2

can't possibly also be designed to help manufacturers?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

My point is that when one

4

looks at the specific language of 22(b)(1) against the

5

backdrop of these other provisions, it's clear what

6

Congress was intending was to enact a national defense,

7

but not to displace State law completely.

8

question presented is whether, on a case-by-case basis,

9

the design defect claims that had been brought by the

And the

10

Bruesewitzes are displaced as a matter of law.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

12

the argument would go the other way:

13

set up a compensation scheme, that was a good sign that

14

they didn't want to allow State law claims.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

That because they

And if one looks,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, at sections 21, 22, and 23 of the

17

Act, what 21 provides is that the Claimant can elect not

18

to accept the vaccine court judgment.

19

provides the standards of responsibility, and section 23

20

provides the mechanisms for trial of the State law

21

claim.

22

vaccine table and what happens in the vaccine court

23

shall not be admissible in the State law claim.

24
25

Section 22

And 23(e) provides that the evidence of the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Section 22(b)(1) refers to

side effects that were unavoidable even though the

vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by

proper directions and warnings.

3

If the term "unavoidable" was intended to

carry its ordinary meaning, what need was there for the

5

rest of that language:

directions and warnings"?

8

or didn't have the proper directions and warnings, then

the side effects are avoidable.

"Even though the vaccine was

So that language is

10

surplus, isn't it, if "unavoidable" really means

unavoidable?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

What Congress was intending

13

to do, Justice Alito, was, with the word "unavoidable,"

14

to use a word that had a settled meaning in the common

15

law.

19

And that settled meaning referred to the design of

That grew directly from comment k, the

And in comment k, which tracked the

20

structure of the restatement provision itself, the

21

general rule for the restatement was strict liability

22

for dangerous products, quote, "although the drug is

23

properly manufactured or properly warned against."

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't it true that at

the time, there was a distinct minority view that you
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

could not recover for design defects for vaccines?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

There certainly was a

3

debate.

The majority view, however, was to adopt

4

comment k as a defense to strict liability claims on a

5

case-by-case basis.

6

I think, illustrate that, even the cases that the other

7

side cites.

9

shift in favor in the case-by-case application of

12

approach.

13

Justice Alito.

14

And in the 1987 report, Congress made very

That is set forth at page 50 of our brief,

So when one looks at both the words that

15

Congress used in 22(b)(1), the debates that occurred,

16

and the committee reports that explained what Congress

17

is intending here, we believe the intent is unmistakably

18

clear to adopt comment k as a defense to -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you haven't really

20

answered Justice Alito's question as to why the later

21

language is not surplus.

22

technical meaning you say that it -- that it bears, that

23

later language is surplus.

24

MR. FREDERICK:

25

If indeed it bears the

were intending to get at, which was:

strict liability unless or provided that the product is

proviso that was intended to ensure that the focus be

kept on the unavoidable, unsafe aspects of the design of

If, based on

This was a

Now, the other side's view takes other words

11

of 22(b)(1) and renders them surplusage.

looking now at page 19A of our reply brief, where we set

13

forth the statutory language, if you want to follow

along here.

the word "if" following the date of October 1, 1988 -- I

17

And I am

What the other side's view is that after

Under their view, all of the words that

18

follow the word "if" and through "even though" becomes

19

surplusage, because under their reading the manufacturer

20

is relieved of all liability if, quote, "the vaccine was

21

properly prepared and was accompanied by proper

22

directions and warnings," and renders the entire concept

23

of unavoidability surplusage.

24

these -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So our view is that what

Justice Scalia, looking at (b)(1) on page 19A following

4

the date October 1, 1988.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Right.
Under their view, after the

7

word "if," the phrase "the injury or death resulted from

8

side effects that were unavoidable even though" is

9

surplusage, because in their view of the statute

10

Congress created a complete exoneration from liability

11

if the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied

12

by proper warnings.

13

unavoidability completely out of the statute.

14

They took the concept of

And the word "unavoidable" had a settled

meaning.

16

that meaning in light of the 20-year history of

17

Restatement section 402A.

18

There were numerous cases that had construed

So -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I take it that the

19

government is urging that "unavoidable" means

20

unavoidable in the vaccine that has gained FDA approval.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Ginsburg, that

22

position is incorrect.

And there is empirical evidence

23

indicating that the manufacturers, Lederle's Mr.

24

Johnson, testified that the problem with the '86 version

25

of the statute was that it allowed for design defects to

And he urged there to be a regulatory

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you are asking us

4

to interpret this statute in light of his testimony at a

5

hearing?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

What I'm saying is that

7

Congress had choices, and one of the choices was to

8

adopt a regulatory compliance defense for design defect

9

claims, and it chose not to do that.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me the

11

language supports the reading Justice Ginsburg has just

suggested, or the government has just suggested, with

the use of the word "the."

properly prepared.

16

question is whether it was unavoidable if you could have

But this says

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Frederick, I have this

problem with -- with your interpretation.

6

mean unavoidable with respect to the vaccine that has

7

been approved.

8
9

As -- as has

If it doesn't mean that, if it simply means
unavoidable with some other vaccine, you could always

10

avoid them if you have a vaccine that is significantly

11

less effective.

comparing it with?

I mean, what other vaccine are you

Justice Scalia, let me try

to clear this up in this way.

give a presumption of design correctness for all time

based on the FDA's approval of that vaccine.

All of these vaccines are

And the question is whether you

This

I understand that, but the

20

plaintiff comes in and says, Look, you could have

21

eliminated this, this, and this, and these side effects

22

would not occur.

23

effective in 75% of the cases, but nonetheless, it was

24

avoidable.

25

Of course the vaccine would only be

MR. FREDERICK:

And that's why the concept

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

of unavoidability as a defense always rested on the

2

current State of scientific knowledge.

3

Lederle signed -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In the 1960s,

Well, that doesn't answer

5

my question.

I acknowledge it rests on current

6

scientific knowledge, but current scientific knowledge

7

would enable you to design a drug that does not have

8

these side effects even though it's significantly less

9

effective, and there is no criterion as to how much less

10

effective it has to be to qualify and so forth, whereas

11

the government's interpretation of the word ties it to

12

a -- to a particular vaccine.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Scalia, the way

14

these cases were construed, and we have cited them in

15

our reply brief, the standard was whether or not it was

16

as safe as a feasible alternative but was -- sorry, as

17

efficacious but safer as a feasible alternative.

how the courts -- the State court -

That's

It has to be efficacious.

Sure.

I will concede that

point.

originally been -

7

MR. FREDERICK:

8

There are two theories by which there was a

design defect claim.

No.

Let me clarify.

One concerned a product by Eli

10

Lilly called Tri-Solgen.

11

that was developed and sold in the 1960s.

demonstrated to have far less serious effects for

problems.

3

That acellular technique was eventually approved by the

4

FDA in the mid-1990s and is now common in all of the

5

three-part VDAP vaccines that are currently on the

market.

Our point is that the scientists literally

In a question of fact in a

approach than if they didn't have the law at all,

24

comment k.

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Kennedy, that was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

the whole design of the vaccine program, because if you

2

channelled most claims into something that the

3

manufacturers didn't have to defend against or pay the

4

judgments of, the thought was that the vast, vast

5

majority of people would never go to State court.

6

it would only be in those rare circumstances like the

7

problem we have here where the vaccine court awards

8

nothing that the Bruesewitzes even had to go to State

9

court.

10

And

Had they filed their claim a month earlier

11

when residual seizure disorder was still on the vaccine

12

table, we wouldn't be here.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Why was it taken off?

There was a debate in the

15

scientific community.

16

believed that residual seizure disorder was medically

17

proved to be a causative factor from the pertussis

18

component of the DTP.

19

folks in the Secretary of Health and Human Services as

20

to whether or not that was sufficient to justify legal

21

cause.

22

The Institute of Medicine

There was a disagreement of -- by

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so didn't the special

23

master find what -- in the compensation proceeding that

24

causation had not been proved?

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

And it was a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

proceeding, Justice Ginsburg, that had allowed for no

2

discovery against the drug manufacturer.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you -- you say that

4

in court you could prove causation, since you had

5

discovery, although you couldn't prove it before the

6

special master because discovery was very limited?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

That's our submission.

And

8

that was the design that Congress intended.

That's why

9

what happens in the vaccine court under section 23(e),

10

as a matter of law, is inadmissible in a subsequent

11

State court action.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And can you -- maybe this

13

is a good point, but I would like to know what your

14

response is.

15

friendly way.

16

I'm not asking you in either a hostile nor

The -- assume for the moment that the

18

I think it's ambiguous.

19

response, on that assumption that this brief on the

20

other side from the American Academy of Pediatrics and

21

21 other physician and public health organizations -

22

what the pediatricians here say is that, if you win,

23

we're turning this over to judges and juries instead of

24

the FDA and other specialized agencies, that the result

25

could well be driving certain vaccines from the market,

that's their claim.

4

is that wasn't Congress's purpose.

5

was the contrary.

6

Congress's purpose

So leaving the language out of it, I would

7

like you to respond to what I would call that

8

purpose-related, fact-related argument by these

9

particular people.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

If I may, let me make two

11

points, Justice Breyer, the legal point and the policy

12

point.

13

The legal point is:

This Court's cases make

14

clear that there is a clear statement principle.

15

Congress is presumed to have displaced State law, it

16

must act with a clear statement.

17

the Eleventh Amendment context as well as the preemption

context.

should win -

moment.

That's a

But I will put that aside for the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

MR. FREDERICK:

Here, 22(a) answers that

2

question as a matter of law, because it says the State

3

law provides the general rule.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Right.

I've got -

Now, that's the legal point.

6

The policy point is that by channelling the vast

7

majority -- and the SG's brief says 99 percent of the

8

people who go through vaccine court accept the judgment

9

of the vaccine court.

10

And on the First Circuit, the Schaefer

11

decision -- which you wrote, Justice Breyer -- said that

12

even in the instances in which people lose in the

13

vaccine court, they may regard the hurdles and obstacles

14

of the State court process to be so great that they

15

don't bother to try.

16

of cases in State court.

It's difficult to win these kinds

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Explain why.

Because proving causation

19

and proving the availability, based on science, of an

20

alternative design is not something that is a relatively

21

easy thing to do.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's -- that's why I

23

asked the question.

Frankly, if I see the Academy of

24

Pediatrics telling me one thing, and I in an earlier

25

case wrote the other thing, I do tend to think I could
Alderson Reporting Company

have been wrong.

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's -- that's why I

4

am asking you:

Is that the best you can find on the

5

other side, namely something I once wrote in a case?

6

are there other -- are there other things?

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

Or

It happened in the moment to

come to mind, Justice Breyer.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. FREDERICK:

The point that I want to

12

make is that the threat of liability is only a realistic

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would depend, I

6

suppose, on what they thought the judgments were going

7

to be in the 1 percent of the time.

8

MR. FREDERICK:

And -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't take too

10

many $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the

11

other side of your calculus.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

And that's why, going back

13

to the wording of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice, in

14

section 23, where Congress said for someone who had

15

elected not to accept the judgment in 21, you get to go

16

to State court and try to prove your claim.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Anyone could go to the

18

State -- I mean, somebody who won in the vaccine court

19

could go to court on the argument that the amount was

20

insufficient, the amount of compensation.

21
22
23

There is -- there is no foreclosure of
anyone to come to court; is that right?
MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

But you

24

have to fight through the defenses that Congress erected

25

in 22(b)(1), (b)(2), and (c), which are quite difficult

defenses.
JUSTICE ALITO:

What would happen if a drug

3

manufacturer sought FDA approval of an alternative

4

vaccine and the injury occurred during the period while

5

that was under consideration by the FDA?

6

that's just too bad?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

That's -

A harder case, but not one

8

that couldn't be proved under State law.

The negligence

9

inquiry would look into whether or not a reasonable

10

manufacturer would have tried earlier and more

11

aggressively to obtain FDA approval.

12

Here, we think we can meet that standard,

13

because we had a drug that was on the market, the split

14

cells Tri-Solgen, that was proved to be safer and just

15

as efficacious, and it had been on the market until

16

Wyeth took it off, after Wyeth concluded that when it

17

purchased the rights from Eli Lilly it couldn't

18

manufacture the vaccine Tri-Solgen in a way that it

19

would get it the profit stream that it wanted.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the -- when it was -

21

when Tri-Solgen was owned by Lilly and you said that it

22

was approved and marketed, was that one available for

23

all five inoculations?

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That was used for all through the series for children's
Alderson Reporting Company

vaccination for DTP.

2

And the problem here with the other side's

3

approach, fundamentally, is that not only does it render

4

part of 22(b)(1) surplusage, and not only does it ignore

5

the many benefits that manufacturers got, but at the end

6

of the day it allows for an exoneration from liability,

7

even for manufacturers who know there is a safer design

8

available.

9

And that fundamentally is something Congress

10

never would have imagined, that manufacturers would

11

invoke an immunity from suit, even when they knew -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does the secretary -- does

13

the secretary have the authority to -- to withdraw

MR. FREDERICK:

There

is -

18
19

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You are assuming that the

manufacturer knows something that the secretary doesn't?

20

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Our submission,

21

Justice Kennedy, is that for many vaccines there is no

22

safer alternative, and there could be no design defect

23

claim.

24

safer alternative, the burden under State law is for the

25

manufacturer to act reasonably in pursuing the safer

But for those instances in which there is a

It's not -- there is no provision in the FDA

Is there any provision

in the regulations that require a manufacturer to

withdraw a drug earlier than when the FDA tells them to?

MR. FREDERICK:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So this immunity would

11

come along until they go to the FDA and say, Well, we've

12

gotten enough incidents to prove -

That's correct.

something else is being tested or about to be approved,

But -- but you assume that

14

there is no clause or burden to the manufacturers who

defend these suits to assess settlement offers.

all know that.

22

that's after an exhaustive process through which they

23

have gone through the vaccine program and the person is

dissatisfied with the remedy that's provided.

Congress didn't make that statement.

That would have been the simplest

They

were asked to amend the statute to make that statement,

and they didn't.

that there is no design defect liability, then say that:

12

No civil liability unless inadequately -- improperly

Justice Ginsburg, let's go

back to the text and put -- read the two clauses

together.

were preempted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH,

12

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

14
15
16

MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think the Court finds itself actually

17

three-quarters of the way through the argument without

18

actually hearing about the most important federal agency

19

that is involved with this, which is arguably not the

20

Food and Drug Administration but the Centers for Disease

21

Control and Prevention.

22

And so with respect to the question about

23

what is it that is governing whether the -- whether

24

the -- the - a given vaccine is subject to the Act and

25

what are the incentives and who is actually making the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

decision and who is trying to determine if there's

2

something better that's out there that we should be

3

pursuing -- that is the mission of the Centers for

4

Disease Control and Prevention.

5

That is why Congress took the original

6

table -- the vaccines that are on the original table in

7

this statute were taken from CDC's recommendations that

8

reflect CDC's expert scientific judgment, based on the

9

input from the medical and scientific community, of what

10

vaccines do we have that are the ones we should use to

11

protect the public health?

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do they get the information

13

from the manufacturers?

And -- I mean, would they find

14

out if in fact there had been a change -

15

MR. HORWICH:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

-- and it was now -- there

is a safer alternative?

18
19

Well -

MR. HORWICH:

Well, let me -- let me give -

kind of -- let me answer that in -- in two ways.

20

The -- the first is that the -- the nature

21

of vaccine research is not something that manufacturers

22

do in a cloistered laboratory somewhere.

23

actually very unlikely to imagine that a manufacturer

24

somehow comes uniquely into possession of this

25

knowledge.
Alderson Reporting Company

So it's

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

I mean in fact, the Federal Government

2

spends billions of dollars doing vaccine research that

3

government scientists themselves perform.

4

government sets the agenda for what are our targets for

5

development.

6

acellular pertussis vaccine was something driven by the

7

Federal Government.

The

The -- the research agenda to pursue the

we -- we don't want manufacturers and our scientists

10

pursuing the -- the Tri-Solgen approach and trying to

11

improve that.

12

well.

13

development of an acellular vaccine, and so that's the

14

research path that -- to go on.

15

We don't understand that vaccine very

We know the ultimate target needs to be the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose then that in -

16

suppose I look into this, which I will do, the CDC and

17

what they do.

18

completely right, that this is a government agency that

19

is top of this and the chances of something going wrong

20

are very small and they will figure it all out, together

21

with the manufacturers.

And suppose I become convinced you are

Suppose I conclude that.

22

What do I do about this word unavoidable?

23

MR. HORWICH:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Well I think -
Now I can't say that the

word unavoidable -- it's pretty hard to say that that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

word unavoidable means avoidable; and I am in fact -

2

like to look to the purposes of this statute, that if

3

something says "day" I can't say it means "night."

4

so -- so what --what is it about this word that allows

5

us to say that it's avoidable?

6

MR. HORWICH:

And

Well, I think the answer to

7

that actually came in a question that Justice Ginsburg

8

posed to Mr. Frederick, which is that unavoidable is

9

being used in the sense of okay; what are the vaccines

10

that FDA has approved that CDC has recommended for

11

routine administration to children, and that are the -

12

and that are the ones that the Federal Government has

13

determined are appropriate therefore to protect the

14

public health?

15

affairs that we are in, was this injury -

16

And given that that is the state of

JUSTICE BREYER:

To show that -- remember

17

they only want to say, because of special circumstances

18

this is an avoidable -- this is an avoidable injury.

19

think I am right on that.

20

And -- and so the best place to look in your

21

opinion, for me to look, to show that this word

22

unavoidable includes that avoidable claim, is where?

23

I

MR. HORWICH:

I think the way to understand

24

it is -- is to see that as the -- as the committee

25

report -- as the '86 committee report says, that what
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

Congress is trying to convey in using the word

2

unavoidable is it is -- it is respecting the principle

3

of comment k, which is the principle that socially

4

beneficial products that nonetheless have these adverse

5

effects ought to be on the market and we ought not to

6

allow tort law to push them off the market, which is

7

exactly what -

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me -- going back

to the point you just started with -

10

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- which was is this -

12

is the Control -- Disease Center, is it making a

13

judgment before it approves a drug for licensing, that

14

it's the most efficacious drug on market?

15

MR. HORWICH:

CDC does not issue a license.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. HORWICH:

No -

But the way the statute works

18

is that the statute only covers, in its present form,

19

the way -- I'm referring now to the present version of

20

the provision in the statute that explains how vaccines

21

become subject to the Act, because not all vaccines are.

22

The provision is in 14(e) of the Act, which I believe

23

may not be reproduced in any of the papers, but it

24

basically says that two things have to happen.

25

that before the vaccine becomes subject to either the
Alderson Reporting Company

One is

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

compensation program or the preemption provision -- is

2

that CDC has to recommend it for routine administration.

3

And that is a judgment that CDC makes with the advice of

4

the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where do I look at that?

6

At what documents do I look at to make a judgment that

7

in fact, CDC is doing what I ask, that it is looking at

8

the question of whether this is the most efficacious

9

drug with the least adverse effects?

10

Is that a judgment

it's making?

11

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
We know the FDA is not.

13

Are you representing to us right now that CDC makes that

14

judgment?

15

MR. HORWICH:

CDC makes that judgment and

16

announces it in a reasoned, published announcement in

17

its official journal which is the Morbidity and

18

Mortality Weekly Report.

19

And so for every drug -- or excuse me, for

20

every vaccine that it recommends for routine

21

administration, it publishes a notice in its journal

22

explaining, this is -- these are the products that we

23

are recommending for routine use, this is the -- the

24

studies, this is the development of them, this is our

25

basis for this determination.

And so --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

50
1
2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That would include

comparisons to other drugs on the market?

3

MR. HORWICH:

Well, it -- there often won't

4

be other drugs actually on the market to compare it to,

5

but there will be -- there will be a vast body of

6

scientific literature that again is not exclusively

7

within the manufacturers' control, because it has been

8

produced by the Federal Government, by other countries'

9

public health agencies, by academic scientists, that CDC

10

will reference or its advisory committee will have

11

incorporated in its recommendation.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it doesn't make a

13

determination that the one that they are listing in

14

17

They must improve the vaccine -

9

MR. HORWICH:

10
11

Yes, certainly.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- or we wouldn't

have this case.

12
13

That's never the

MR. HORWICH:

Certainly they do.

And I

mean, the Federal Government -

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When they publish

15

that information in their weekly report, do they compare

16

it both with respect to losses or mortality and with

17

respect to efficiency, with -- to the other vaccines on

18

the market.

19

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

Let me give you an

20

excellent example of that which is probably familiar to

21

the Court, that there are two types polio vaccines.

22

There is the Sabin vaccine, with is associated with

23

certain very rare but serious side effects but which is

24

extremely efficacious at protecting a population, and

25

then there is the Salk vaccine, which is not associated
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

with those same side effects, but is not as effective at

2

protecting the population.

3

Now CDC made a determination and this was a

4

determination in effect from the 1960s through the

5

1990s, that the Sabin vaccine -- the one that is, quote,

6

unquote, "less safe," was the appropriate one for use

7

because it better served the public health.

8

polio -- now this is a dynamic process that CDC is

9

continually engaged in, and so as polio approached

Now as

10

global eradication and you are not as concerned about

11

actual control of disease running in the community, CDC

12

transitioned its recommendation to the Salk vaccine.

13

So I -- I think that answers the question

14

that the CDC is making determinations in this regard in

15

a comparative way; and I think it would be extraordinary

16

then to have juries -- to have -- to imagine that

17

Congress set up a system in which juries would

18

effectively be second-guessing decisions like that,

19

because CDC has made -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It has not only

21

given that information; it has also said in its weekly

22

report that this is the one we want you to make.

JUSTICE BREYER:

exact words, but you are saying whatever word they use,

4

what they have is an ongoing process to say this is the

5

best vaccine available; is that right?

6

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

And part of the on going

7

process, as we described in our brief, is a unique

8

system of monitoring and following up when there are

adverse events.

the manufacturers are -- are -- are relatively less

19

Salk vaccine, would the -- would that injured person

20

have a claim for design defect if the person could -

21

could produce experts who said the CDC was wrong, that

22

they should never have made this recommendation?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

May I ask you this question
Under your

It's not that the CDC would

24

be wrong, Justice Alito.

There is a difference between

25

strict liability and a no-fault arrangement and where
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

56
1

negligence would be asserted that a reasonable

2

manufacturer would have come forward with information

3

about a safer design.

4

So what Congress explicitly rejected and

5

they voted this down in the Energy and Commerce

6

Committee was a regulatory compliance defense solely on

7

the basis that the FDA had approved at the time -

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this may be -- this

9

may be what Congress wanted and may be the better

10

policy, but your answer to my question is that -

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- that would permit a lay

13

jury relying on experts produced in court, the CDC got

14

this wrong, the Salk vaccine was really the better one.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, yes, that would be a

16

viable design defect claim.

And let me give you an

17

example right out of the Joint Appendix in this case.

18

In 1965 Lederle's researchers determine that Lily, the

19

Tri-Solgen, had a "superior product," that's at page 245

20

of the Joint Appendix.

21

later the internal scientists at Lederle wrote a memo to

22

the head of Lederle and said we recommend that we

23

approach Lily for its pertussis vaccine process and/or

24

continue to bid on foreign contracts for this product

25

line with the intent of increasing volume.

That was in 1967.

Alderson Reporting Company

Eight years

Official - Subject to Final Review

57
1

They had made the determination they were

2

not capable internally of doing a safer design and they

3

knew that for eight years and they nonetheless kept the

4

wholesale pertussis in its market and the documents in

5

this case indicate they did it for economic reasons.

6

And the whole idea behind having design defect claims is

7

to put manufacturers to the duty of putting out safest

8

possible products in light of what the science holds.

9

The CDC -- there are no regulations that the

10

Government cites in its brief or today saying that the

11

CDC does the kind of comparative analysis for safety

12

that is provided under State law design defect claims.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Their argument is that the

14

CDC will do it better than juries.

15

him say.

16

MR. FREDERICK:

That's what I heard

And, Justice Breyer, there

17

are now six DTaP vaccines on the market that CDC doesn't

18

distinguish between them, but if it comes to pass that

19

the science would indicate that one of them was woefully

20

not as safe, and here, their argument is that the

21

vaccine industry is going to go out of business.

22

vaccine that's at issue in this case was taken off the

23

market in 1998.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought

Mr. Horwich told me that the CDC does compare new
Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

58
1

vaccines to the ones that are out in the market?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

He cited no law.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You think he was

4

incorrect in that assertion.

5

these weekly reports and they are either going to say

6

this is better than the one that's out there or they are

7

not.

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

We can go back and look at

Yes.

And if you compare

that to what Congress wrote in the statute, our

10

submission is that Congress's words in section 22 take

11

precedence.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm just trying to

13

find out what your position is on that.

14

it to existing vaccines or not?

15
16
17
18

MR. FREDERICK:

We found no law that gives

the CDC the authority.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FREDERICK:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23
24
25

I'm not asking about

law, I'm asking matter of fact.

19

21

Do they compare

Whether, I'm not.
You open up the

weekly report.
MR. FREDERICK:

I'm sorry,

Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you open up the

weekly report and it says this new vaccine is better
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

vaccine than the one that is out there or not?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

I'm not aware that the CDC

3

does the kind of granular comparisons that would go to

4

the level of safety that is at issue in this kind of

5

case.

6

about trying to eliminate some of the most horrifying

7

and horrible incidents of injury to vaccines that we

8

compel children to take.

9

And that's what's important here.

We are talking

And the whole idea behind Congress's scheme

10

was to balance having vaccine supply available with

11

providing a generous form of compensation to those

12

persons who would be injured.

13
14
15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:02 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
