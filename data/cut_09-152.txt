CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

argument this afternoon in Case 09-152, Bruesewitz v.

Wyeth.

Mr. Frederick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

This case involves a vaccine designed in the

12

1940s that was administered to Hannah Bruesewitz in

13

1992, some 30 years after scientists discovered a safer

14

way to design the pertussis component of the DTP

15

vaccine.

16

could not pursue a design defect claim under State law

17

invoking the preemption principle in claiming that the

18

Vaccine Act of 1986 preempted the Bruesewitz's State

19

claim.

20

The Third Circuit held that the Bruesewitzes

That holding is in error for three reasons.
First, the court overlooked the numerous

21

provisions of the Act protecting manufacturers from

22

liability, but it did not expressly preempt design

23

defect claims.

24
25

Second, the court misconstrued the word
"unavoidable" in section 22(b)(1)'s Federal law defense.

And third, the court adopted a policy that
exposes children to unnecessary safety risks.

3

With respect to the first reason, in the

4

1986 Act Congress created a program, the vaccine

5

program, that was funded by surcharges on the vaccines

6

that users used, and out of that fund designed a program

7

to pay compensation to persons who were injured by

8

vaccine-related acts.

9

Congress also provided a mechanism for

10

exhaustion through the vaccine court program before a

11

person claiming injury could pursue a State law cause of

12

action.

13

law that was designed to govern such actions, Congress

14

established certain defenses, but all of those defenses

15

apply on a case-by-case basis.

16

provisions that preclude a State law claim.

17

Circuit misunderstood that basic principle.

In creating Federal law defenses to the State

There are no absolute

provisions designed to help manufacturers, that this one

can't possibly also be designed to help manufacturers?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

My point is that when one

4

looks at the specific language of 22(b)(1) against the

5

backdrop of these other provisions, it's clear what

6

Congress was intending was to enact a national defense,

7

but not to displace State law completely.

question presented is whether, on a case-by-case basis,

the design defect claims that had been brought by the

Bruesewitzes are displaced as a matter of law.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

the argument would go the other way:

14

they didn't want to allow State law claims.

That because they

And if one looks,

Act, what 21 provides is that the Claimant can elect not

provides the mechanisms for trial of the State law

the whole design of the vaccine program, because if you

2

channelled most claims into something that the

3

manufacturers didn't have to defend against or pay the

judgments of, the thought was that the vast, vast

5

majority of people would never go to State court.

it would only be in those rare circumstances like the

nothing that the Bruesewitzes even had to go to State

There was a debate in the

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

And it was a

proceeding, Justice Ginsburg, that had allowed for no

discovery against the drug manufacturer.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you -- you say that

4

in court you could prove causation, since you had

5

discovery, although you couldn't prove it before the

6

special master because discovery was very limited?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

That's our submission.

And

8

that was the design that Congress intended.

That's why

what happens in the vaccine court under section 23(e),

10

as a matter of law, is inadmissible in a subsequent

law provides the general rule.

Now, that's the legal point.

6

The policy point is that by channelling the vast

7

majority -- and the SG's brief says 99 percent of the

8

people who go through vaccine court accept the judgment

9

of the vaccine court.

10

And on the First Circuit, the Schaefer

11

decision -- which you wrote, Justice Breyer -- said that

12

even in the instances in which people lose in the

13

vaccine court, they may regard the hurdles and obstacles

14

of the State court process to be so great that they

15

don't bother to try.

of cases in State court.

It's difficult to win these kinds

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Explain why.

Because proving causation

19

and proving the availability, based on science, of an

20

alternative design is not something that is a relatively

21

easy thing to do.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's -- that's why I

23

asked the question.

Frankly, if I see the Academy of

24

Pediatrics telling me one thing, and I in an earlier

25

case wrote the other thing, I do tend to think I could

am asking you:

Is that the best you can find on the

5

other side, namely something I once wrote in a case?

6

are there other -- are there other things?

(Laughter.)

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

Or

It happened in the moment to

come to mind, Justice Breyer.

11

MR. FREDERICK:

The point that I want to

make is that the threat of liability is only a realistic

one if there is a threat that there's actually going to

be payment at the end.

15

cases to lose; they bring cases if they have a

reasonable prospect of winning based on what the

evidence would show a design defect to be.

And so when Congress set up this system and

19

it exonerated the vaccine makers of 99 percent of all

20

cases that are going to go through this system claiming

21

defects or problems, if you ask manufacturers around the

22

country that you get a special defense against punitive

23

damages, you get a regulatory compliance defense for

24

failure to warn, you have to have a trifurcated

proceeding, and you are not going to have to pay damages

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't take too

10

many $60 million verdicts to make you come out on the

11

other side of your calculus.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

And that's why, going back

13

to the wording of the statute, Mr. Chief Justice, in

14

section 23, where Congress said for someone who had

15

elected not to accept the judgment in 21, you get to go

16

to State court and try to prove your claim.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Anyone could go to the

State -- I mean, somebody who won in the vaccine court

could go to court on the argument that the amount was

20

insufficient, the amount of compensation.

21
22
23

There is -- there is no foreclosure of
anyone to come to court; is that right?
MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

But you

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would happen if a drug

manufacturer sought FDA approval of an alternative

vaccine and the injury occurred during the period while

5

that was under consideration by the FDA?

6

that's just too bad?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

That's -足

A harder case, but not one

8

that couldn't be proved under State law.

The negligence

9

inquiry would look into whether or not a reasonable

10

manufacturer would have tried earlier and more

11

aggressively to obtain FDA approval.

12

Here, we think we can meet that standard,

13

because we had a drug that was on the market, the split

14

cells Tri-Solgen, that was proved to be safer and just

15

as efficacious, and it had been on the market until

16

Wyeth took it off, after Wyeth concluded that when it

17

purchased the rights from Eli Lilly it couldn't

18

manufacture the vaccine Tri-Solgen in a way that it

19

would get it the profit stream that it wanted.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the -- when it was -足

21

when Tri-Solgen was owned by Lilly and you said that it

was approved and marketed, was that one available for

And the problem here with the other side's

approach, fundamentally, is that not only does it render

part of 22(b)(1) surplusage, and not only does it ignore

5

the many benefits that manufacturers got, but at the end

of the day it allows for an exoneration from liability,

7

even for manufacturers who know there is a safer design

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

Our submission,

Justice Kennedy, is that for many vaccines there is no

safer alternative, and there could be no design defect

claim.

manufacturer to act reasonably in pursuing the safer

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH,

12

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

13

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

14
15
16

MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I think the Court finds itself actually

17

three-quarters of the way through the argument without

18

actually hearing about the most important federal agency

19

that is involved with this, which is arguably not the

20

Food and Drug Administration but the Centers for Disease

21

Control and Prevention.

22

And so with respect to the question about

23

what is it that is governing whether the -- whether

24

the -- the - a given vaccine is subject to the Act and

25

what are the incentives and who is actually making the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

45
1

decision and who is trying to determine if there's

2

something better that's out there that we should be

3

pursuing -- that is the mission of the Centers for

4

Disease Control and Prevention.

5

That is why Congress took the original

6

table -- the vaccines that are on the original table in

7

this statute were taken from CDC's recommendations that

8

reflect CDC's expert scientific judgment, based on the

9

input from the medical and scientific community, of what

10

vaccines do we have that are the ones we should use to

11

protect the public health?

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do they get the information

13

from the manufacturers?

And -- I mean, would they find

14

out if in fact there had been a change -足

15

MR. HORWICH:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

-- and it was now -- there

is a safer alternative?

18
19

Well -足

MR. HORWICH:

Well, let me -- let me give -足

kind of -- let me answer that in -- in two ways.

20

The -- the first is that the -- the nature

21

of vaccine research is not something that manufacturers

22

do in a cloistered laboratory somewhere.

23

actually very unlikely to imagine that a manufacturer

24

somehow comes uniquely into possession of this

25

knowledge.
Alderson Reporting Company

So it's

Official - Subject to Final Review

46
1

I mean in fact, the Federal Government

2

spends billions of dollars doing vaccine research that

government scientists themselves perform.

government sets the agenda for what are our targets for

development.

Federal Government.

improve that.

development of an acellular vaccine, and so that's the

14

research path that -- to go on.

15

We don't understand that vaccine very

We know the ultimate target needs to be the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose then that in -足

16

suppose I look into this, which I will do, the CDC and

17

what they do.

18

completely right, that this is a government agency that

19

is top of this and the chances of something going wrong

20

are very small and they will figure it all out, together

21

with the manufacturers.

And suppose I become convinced you are

Suppose I conclude that.

22

What do I do about this word unavoidable?

23

MR. HORWICH:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Well I think -足
Now I can't say that the

word unavoidable -- it's pretty hard to say that that
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

47
1

word unavoidable means avoidable; and I am in fact -足

2

like to look to the purposes of this statute, that if

3

something says "day" I can't say it means "night."

4

so -- so what --what is it about this word that allows

5

us to say that it's avoidable?

6

MR. HORWICH:

And

Well, I think the answer to

7

that actually came in a question that Justice Ginsburg

8

posed to Mr. Frederick, which is that unavoidable is

9

being used in the sense of okay; what are the vaccines

10

that FDA has approved that CDC has recommended for

11

routine administration to children, and that are the -足

12

and that are the ones that the Federal Government has

13

determined are appropriate therefore to protect the

14

public health?

15

affairs that we are in, was this injury -足

16

And given that that is the state of

JUSTICE BREYER:

To show that -- remember

17

they only want to say, because of special circumstances

18

this is an avoidable -- this is an avoidable injury.

19

think I am right on that.

20

And -- and so the best place to look in your

21

opinion, for me to look, to show that this word

22

unavoidable includes that avoidable claim, is where?

23

I

MR. HORWICH:

I think the way to understand

24

it is -- is to see that as the -- as the committee

25

report -- as the '86 committee report says, that what
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

48
1

Congress is trying to convey in using the word

2

unavoidable is it is -- it is respecting the principle

3

of comment k, which is the principle that socially

4

beneficial products that nonetheless have these adverse

5

effects ought to be on the market and we ought not to

6

allow tort law to push them off the market, which is

7

exactly what -足

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me -- going back

to the point you just started with -足

10

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- which was is this -足

12

is the Control -- Disease Center, is it making a

13

judgment before it approves a drug for licensing, that

14

it's the most efficacious drug on market?

15

MR. HORWICH:

CDC does not issue a license.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. HORWICH:

No -足

But the way the statute works

18

is that the statute only covers, in its present form,

19

the way -- I'm referring now to the present version of

20

the provision in the statute that explains how vaccines

21

become subject to the Act, because not all vaccines are.

22

The provision is in 14(e) of the Act, which I believe

23

may not be reproduced in any of the papers, but it

24

basically says that two things have to happen.

25

that before the vaccine becomes subject to either the
Alderson Reporting Company

One is

Official - Subject to Final Review

49
1

compensation program or the preemption provision -- is

2

that CDC has to recommend it for routine administration.

3

And that is a judgment that CDC makes with the advice of

4

the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where do I look at that?

6

At what documents do I look at to make a judgment that

7

in fact, CDC is doing what I ask, that it is looking at

8

the question of whether this is the most efficacious

9

drug with the least adverse effects?

10

Is that a judgment

it's making?

11

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
We know the FDA is not.

13

Are you representing to us right now that CDC makes that

14

judgment?

15

MR. HORWICH:

CDC makes that judgment and

16

announces it in a reasoned, published announcement in

17

its official journal which is the Morbidity and

18

Mortality Weekly Report.

19

And so for every drug -- or excuse me, for

20

every vaccine that it recommends for routine

21

administration, it publishes a notice in its journal

22

explaining, this is -- these are the products that we

23

are recommending for routine use, this is the -- the

24

studies, this is the development of them, this is our

25

basis for this determination.

And so --

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That would include

comparisons to other drugs on the market?

3

MR. HORWICH:

Well, it -- there often won't

4

be other drugs actually on the market to compare it to,

5

but there will be -- there will be a vast body of

6

scientific literature that again is not exclusively

7

within the manufacturers' control, because it has been

8

produced by the Federal Government, by other countries'

9

public health agencies, by academic scientists, that CDC

10

will reference or its advisory committee will have

11

incorporated in its recommendation.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it doesn't make a

13

determination that the one that they are listing in

That's never the

Certainly they do.

mean, the Federal Government -足

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When they publish

15

that information in their weekly report, do they compare

16

it both with respect to losses or mortality and with

17

respect to efficiency, with -- to the other vaccines on

18

the market.

19

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

Let me give you an

20

excellent example of that which is probably familiar to

21

the Court, that there are two types polio vaccines.

22

There is the Sabin vaccine, with is associated with

23

certain very rare but serious side effects but which is

24

extremely efficacious at protecting a population, and

25

then there is the Salk vaccine, which is not associated
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

52
1

with those same side effects, but is not as effective at

2

protecting the population.

3

Now CDC made a determination and this was a

4

determination in effect from the 1960s through the

5

1990s, that the Sabin vaccine -- the one that is, quote,

6

unquote, "less safe," was the appropriate one for use

7

because it better served the public health.

8

polio -- now this is a dynamic process that CDC is

9

continually engaged in, and so as polio approached

Now as

10

global eradication and you are not as concerned about

11

actual control of disease running in the community, CDC

12

transitioned its recommendation to the Salk vaccine.

13

So I -- I think that answers the question

14

that the CDC is making determinations in this regard in

15

a comparative way; and I think it would be extraordinary

16

then to have juries -- to have -- to imagine that

17

Congress set up a system in which juries would

18

effectively be second-guessing decisions like that,

19

because CDC has made -足

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It has not only

MR. HORWICH:

And part of the on going

The only law cited by the Government today

was section 14 of the Vaccine Act.

It is not reproduced

in the materials, but it is -- the title of section 14

8

is a vaccine injury table.

9

that the CDC makes as to which vaccines will be on the

10

vaccine table, so that when the person goes throughout

11

vaccine court process, you can look and determine

12

whether or not on a no-fault basis the vaccine is listed

13

on the table or not listed on the table.

It's about recommendations

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

about something that Mr. Horwich said?

16

understanding of this scheme, if a -- a person suffered

17

a very serious injury as a result of the Sabin vaccine

18

during the period when the CDC recommended that over the

Salk vaccine, would the -- would that injured person

have a claim for design defect if the person could -足

21

could produce experts who said the CDC was wrong, that

22

they should never have made this recommendation?

MR. FREDERICK:

May I ask you this question
Under your

It's not that the CDC would

be wrong, Justice Alito.

There is a difference between

25

strict liability and a no-fault arrangement and where
Alderson Reporting Company

negligence would be asserted that a reasonable

2

manufacturer would have come forward with information

3

about a safer design.

they voted this down in the Energy and Commerce

6

Committee was a regulatory compliance defense solely on

7

the basis that the FDA had approved at the time -足

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this may be -- this

9

may be what Congress wanted and may be the better

10

policy, but your answer to my question is that -足

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- that would permit a lay

13

jury relying on experts produced in court, the CDC got

14

this wrong, the Salk vaccine was really the better one.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, yes, that would be a

16

viable design defect claim.

And let me give you an

17

example right out of the Joint Appendix in this case.

18

In 1965 Lederle's researchers determine that Lily, the

19

Tri-Solgen, had a "superior product," that's at page 245

20

of the Joint Appendix.

21

later the internal scientists at Lederle wrote a memo to

the head of Lederle and said we recommend that we

approach Lily for its pertussis vaccine process and/or

That was in 1967.

They had made the determination they were

2

not capable internally of doing a safer design and they

3

knew that for eight years and they nonetheless kept the

4

wholesale pertussis in its market and the documents in

5

this case indicate they did it for economic reasons.

6

And the whole idea behind having design defect claims is

7

to put manufacturers to the duty of putting out safest

8

possible products in light of what the science holds.

9

The CDC -- there are no regulations that the

10

Government cites in its brief or today saying that the

11

CDC does the kind of comparative analysis for safety

12

that is provided under State law design defect claims.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Their argument is that the

14

CDC will do it better than juries.

15

him say.

16

MR. FREDERICK:

That's what I heard

And, Justice Breyer, there

17

are now six DTaP vaccines on the market that CDC doesn't

18

distinguish between them, but if it comes to pass that

19

the science would indicate that one of them was woefully

20

not as safe, and here, their argument is that the

21

vaccine industry is going to go out of business.

22

vaccine that's at issue in this case was taken off the

23

market in 1998.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought

Mr. Horwich told me that the CDC does compare new

vaccines to the ones that are out in the market?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

He cited no law.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You think he was

4

incorrect in that assertion.

5

these weekly reports and they are either going to say

6

this is better than the one that's out there or they are

7

not.

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

We can go back and look at

Yes.

And if you compare

that to what Congress wrote in the statute, our

10

submission is that Congress's words in section 22 take

11

precedence.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm just trying to

13

find out what your position is on that.

14

it to existing vaccines or not?

15
16
17
18

MR. FREDERICK:

We found no law that gives

the CDC the authority.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FREDERICK:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23
24
25

I'm not asking about

law, I'm asking matter of fact.

19

21

Do they compare

Whether, I'm not.
You open up the

weekly report.
MR. FREDERICK:

I'm sorry,

Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you open up the

weekly report and it says this new vaccine is better
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

59
1

vaccine than the one that is out there or not?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

I'm not aware that the CDC

3

does the kind of granular comparisons that would go to

4

the level of safety that is at issue in this kind of

5

case.

6

about trying to eliminate some of the most horrifying

7

and horrible incidents of injury to vaccines that we

8

compel children to take.

9

And that's what's important here.

We are talking

And the whole idea behind Congress's scheme

10

was to balance having vaccine supply available with

11

providing a generous form of compensation to those

12

persons who would be injured.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.
