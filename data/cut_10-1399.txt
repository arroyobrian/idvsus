CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next this morning in Case 10-1399, Roberts v. Sea-Land

5

Services.

6

Mr. Gillelan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA T. GILLELAN, II,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. GILLELAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Dana Roberts was injured and shortly

12

thereafter became disabled in the course of his work for

13

Sea-Land in fiscal year 2002, but he was not awarded

14

compensation until fiscal year 2007.

15

The question presented here is whether the

16

maximum weekly rate established by section 6 of the

17

Longshore Act that was in effect at the time his

18

disability began or that which was in effect at the time

19

he was awarded compensation governs his case.

20

entitled to whichever maximum is the applicable one.

21

He is

Section 6(c) of the Act provides explicitly

22

that the applicable maximum is that in effect at the

23

time that the claimant is "newly awarded compensation."

24

The term "award" or "awarded" in the Longshore Act has a

25

consistent meaning throughout, contrary to the views of
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the court of appeals below; and that meaning is a


2

compensation order filed pursuant to section 19(e) of


3

the Act, which is described in section 19(e) as "the


4

order making the award."

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

What happens in the

case --

8
9

It seems to me that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that the two parties are

at extremes and that there is indeed something in the

10

middle.

11

of entitlement to compensation by the agency.

12

side says no, it's just entitlement, whether it's been

13

decreed or not.

14

however, if it was the employer that voluntarily paid

15

the amount due, which is what he's supposed to do

16

anyway, right?

17

compensation?

18

I mean, you say it has to be the determination
The other

Why -- why wouldn't it be an award,

Why wouldn't that be an award of

MR. GILLELAN:

Well, because the statute --

19

in some sense of the word "award" it is.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, a sense that -- that

21

the text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense

22

that the other side argues here.

23

MR. GILLELAN:

I think that the text will

24

not bear that reading, in particular because the

25

payments that you are describing that could be
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

considered an award are described throughout the Act as

2

payments "without an award."

3

have been newly awarded benefits at the time the

4

employer makes a payment "without an award" I think

5

defies the meaning of that word.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, how the claimant can

Where -- well, I wish you

7

would submit the sections of the Act that use it that

8

way, that say "compensation without an award."

9
10

MR. GILLELAN:

Section 14(a) through (e)

refers to compensation payments without an award.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. GILLELAN:

Okay.
Those are the provisions.

13

Section 14(a) and (b) directs those payments without an

14

award.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

And the -- and the

16

critical time, then -- I think, isn't it true that most

17

compensation payments are the -- are as a result of

18

voluntary action by the employer and not a proceeding?

19

MR. GILLELAN:

That is true, yes.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- and then in those

21

cases, when the employer says, okay, I will voluntarily

22

make this compensation available, then measuring --

23

the -- the pay would be measured by the time the

24

employer makes -- makes the compensation available,

25

right?
5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GILLELAN:

I think not, because the --

2

the statutory provision says it's the award that's

3

determinative.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MR. GILLELAN:

7

But there's no award.

But there can be an award.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
I mean, there can be.

But we have -- what is --

But here's a person who has been

10

injured and gets compensation without having to bring

11

any legal proceeding for it.

12

measure then?

13

award, because there is no award.

14

What is the weekly -- the

It can't be an award, the date of the

MR. GILLELAN:

So, what is it?

The employer that wants to

15

lock in this year's maximum rate and not have his

16

liability progress above that simply needs to have an

17

award entered.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, he doesn't.

He can just begin payment.

No, he

19

doesn't.

20

the section we're talking about here, doesn't just

21

provide for newly awarded compensation.

22

"survivors currently receiving compensation for

23

permanent total disability or death benefits."

24

"Currently receiving."

25

I

think that's the critical --

8

Well, it's --

This (c), which is

It also says

Now, does that mean

it has to have been decreed by the agency?
6

Alderson Reporting Company

I don't

3

MR. GILLELAN:

That provision, which -- that

clause --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. GILLELAN:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. GILLELAN:

8

That clause.
-- that separate clause -Yes.
-- which is not in this case,

because --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand.

But it --

10

but it applies to the question, it seems to me, that

11

Justice Ginsburg asked, doesn't it?

12

MR. GILLELAN:

No, I think not.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. GILLELAN:

No?
The function of that clause

15

is that in permanent total and death cases, because

16

there's an annual escalator provision, whatever your

17

rate is this year is going to go up -- if it's a

18

permanent total or death case -- is going to go up each

If neither the

doesn't apply.

4
5

Right?

MR. GILLELAN:
apply, no.

6

I wouldn't say (c) doesn't

I think -JUSTICE SCALIA:

How else would it apply?

7

You are either receiving compensation, which I would

8

understand to mean receiving it from the employer or by

9

reason of an award, or else you've been newly awarded

10

compensation, which I guess means it hasn't yet been

11

paid, but -- but you have the award in your pocket.

12

MR. GILLELAN:

Well, the -- the function of

13

that separate clause is for cases in which an award has

14

been entered of death benefits or permanent total

15

disability benefits, and everything up to that point is

16

governed by the maximum that's in effect at the time of

17

9

I understand that.
Okay.
But I'm just trying to make

MR. GILLELAN:

And it doesn't seem to me

Okay.

I hope I can provide

10

that sense.

The function of that separate clause is

that a claimant who has been awarded compensation at a

given rate, at the -- which is the maximum at the time

13

of the award, will continue to receive compensation

those terms would appear to apply --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GILLELAN:

25

The last part talks about

Yes.
-- to that situation in which

the employer is paying compensation for death or for
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

permanent total disability.

That wouldn't provide us

2

for a maximum -- any applicable maximum.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think it affects

4

your case.

5

this provision is talking about.

6

It's just a matter of understanding what

MR. GILLELAN:

Yes.

And the -- what I'm

7

trying to say about the function of this clause is that

8

a claimant who has been awarded compensation for

9

permanent total disability -- let's assume the employer

10

hasn't paid anything until the ALJ issues an award, and

11

at the time that award is issued the maximum is $1,000 a

12

week, and the employer was making -- the employee was

13

making more than 1500.

14

So, that maximum is the rate.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if the employer has

15

been paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee

16

for not having an award, right?

17

position; the employer has conceded the liability.

18
19
20

MR. GILLELAN:

I mean he's in the same

He certainly is not in the

same position, no.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, would

21

Justice Scalia's reading in your judgment -- accept his

22

proposition that those currently receiving voluntary

23

payments from the employer fall under subsection (c).

24

Would his reading require the employer every year to

25

recalculate the benefits to the maximum that's
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

established that year?

2
3

MR. GILLELAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. GILLELAN:

10

function of that clause.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

and future.
MR. GILLELAN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14
15
16

The function of (b) is

to set a maximum that will control all payments present

11

13

And that's why his

reading --

6
7

Yes, it

would.

4
5

Yes, it would.

Yes, yes, definitely.
And so, if you read it

the way he does, that maximum would change each year.
MR. GILLELAN:

Yes.

And for permanent total

disability and death cases -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand why

17

that's so only for employment -- for employer payments

18

and not the case for awards.

19

employer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have

20

been decreed?

21
22
23
24
25

If that's so for the

Why don't they change every year?

MR. GILLELAN:

They do.

If the award is for

permanent total disability or for death, they do.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So, then my reading

makes perfect sense.
MR. GILLELAN:

Yes, your reading does make
11


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

perfect sense.

2

-- the clause for those currently receiving compensation

3

for permanent total or death is that even when the

4

maximum continues to go up after the date of an award,

5

that new maximum is the applicable one for the

6

continuing period of disability or survivorship.

7

And the function of that second -- that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When -- one of the

8

arguments on the other side that I thought made some

9

sense was the idea that you should focus on a particular

10

point in time when you're figuring out what the amount

11

of the award is going to be; that it doesn't make --

12

that it's at least odd to say, well, we're going to

13

calculate how much you're entitled to at this point, but

14

in terms of the applicable maximum, we're going to wait

15

however long it takes and calculate that as of this

16

point.

17

applicable numbers at the same point in time?

Doesn't it make more sense to figure out the

18

MR. GILLELAN:

Marginally more sense,

19

perhaps so.

But that is an argument that should be

20

addressed to Congress.

21

section 6(c) turn on the time of injury.

22

provided very explicitly --

Congress could easily have made
Instead, they

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

if we think the statute -- in other words, your

25

argument, your response, is that the statute is
12

Alderson Reporting Company

So, if we think --

Official

1

unambiguous and it can't be read --

2

MR. GILLELAN:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

Yes.
-- in a more

sensical way.

5

MR. GILLELAN:

Yes.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. GILLELAN:

Okay.

Yes, and that each use of the

8

term "award," contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, is

9

consistent with that.

That is, whenever Congress refers

10

in this statute to an award or compensation being

11

awarded, it is talking about the order making the award

12

as it's described in section 19(e).

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't really have to

14

establish that, do you?

All you have to establish is

15

that it is -- there is no way in which "newly awarded

16

compensation" means entitlement to compensation.

17

all you have to establish.

18

MR. GILLELAN:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's

That is exactly correct.
You don't have to show that

20

it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never

21

used to mean entitlement to compensation.

22
23
24
25

MR. GILLELAN:

That is -- that is exactly

correct, and I -JUSTICE ALITO:

Are you conceding in answer

to these questions that your reading doesn't really make
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

any sense; that's just what Congress -- that's what

2

Congress did?

3
4

MR. GILLELAN:

No, I hope I'm not conceding

that.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what sense does it

6

make?

What -- why should the ceiling depend on whether

7

an employee is getting compensation voluntarily from the

8

employer or as a result of a formal award?

9

two identical -- identically situated employees and one

10

is getting the compensation without an award and one is

11

getting it with an award, as you understand the term

12

"award," why -- what sense does it make to treat them

13

differently?

14

MR. GILLELAN:

I would say they certainly

15

are not identically situated.

16

17

The claimant who has an

19

one does not.

20

differently then?

21

If you have

One has a formal award;

What sense does it make to treat them

MR. GILLELAN:

There are serious

22

consequences of the fact that one has an award and the

23

other is being paid only without an award.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, if I understood

your response to my prior line of questioning, you deny
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that they are treated differently.

2

receiving compensation is treated the same, under the

3

same provision.

4

currently receiving compensation and survivors newly

5

awarded compensation.

6

The one who is

There are two parts to it:

survivors

Those two classes are treated exactly the

7

same.

The only one that is treated differently is

8

somebody who is neither being paid by the employer nor

9

has yet received an award.

10

MR. GILLELAN:

No.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. GILLELAN:

No.

No?
No, no.

The clause that

13

depends on whether you're currently receiving only

14

applies to permanent total disability and death cases.

15

In all other cases, the clause that says "newly awarded"

16

is the only applicable provision.

1

I'll add one footnote, perhaps, which -- make it a more

2

complete answer, and that is that it makes very little

3

sense to me when a worker becomes disabled on January 1,

1990, for example.

5

calculate what his wage was.

6

And now we say:

7

average weekly wage, and we're not going to apply it to

8

him.

9

He is now disabled.

And so, we

His wage was $200 a week.

But that shouldn't exceed twice the

You're going to apply it to him at some

10

random date.

His wage that he's getting paid is figured

11

out as of January 1, 1990.

12

MR. GILLELAN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the maximum that it

14

could be is figured out as of January 1, 1998, when he

15

finishes a proceeding.

16

Now, I just -- for both reasons, why would

17

you distinguish and why would you get that result?

18

those two reasons, it doesn't seem to make much sense to

19

me, your reading of it, while theirs does make sense.

20

Now, you explain why that is.

21

MR. GILLELAN:

Okay.

Okay.

For

I think the

22

point is to encourage the employer to get an award

23

entered promptly because that way they will lock in that

24

early maximum rate or minimum rate.

provision applies exactly the same way under section

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I thought Congress

3

wanted the system to operate so that people just did it

4

voluntarily without an award.

5

MR. GILLELAN:

Well, they want that to

6

happen as often as possible, but the employer has the

7

right in any case to file a notice with the Department

8

of Labor saying we do not believe the claimant is

9

entitled to compensation.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, it really doesn't

11

make a whole lot of sense.

12

have to acknowledge it would be a much better statute

13

had it been written differently.

14

argument here is it's not up to us to revise the

15

inadequacies of a statute.

just can't read the language that way.

it is not stupid because you think it is a good idea to

4

All right.

I'll take that as --

5

the way that it seems to make somewhat more sense?

6

don't see any words here that stop me from reading it.

MR. GILLELAN:

I

"Newly awarded compensation"

Where now there exactly?

In -- yes, 6(c).
You just told me that just

has to do with permanent or total disability, and this

14

is far -MR. GILLELAN:

No.

Excuse me.

The other

16

clause of that provision, the one that says "currently

receiving compensation" -- that one only applies to

18

survivors and permanently totally disabled workers.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

But why -- why don't they

20

both?

I mean, as I read it naturally, it says that --

21

we now have a special thing, you know, which these

22

people are the dead ones and the widows are getting it

23

and the permanently disabled people, and the -- this

24

individual, and the Secretary, the Secretary or his

25

delegate is going to calculate this thing all the time.

And they've got a special thing here for -- for

2

permanent people, permanently disabled, and they're

saying as to those people, we're giving them a break.

They can't look for more work.

5

they're dead, for example, and they can't find other

6

sources of income.

7

average wage goes up and their wage was higher to begin

8

with, we will raise it a bit.

And so, we say that, that if the

Yes.

11

to the people who are just getting this for the first

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, what happens to

14

your argument if we disagree with you that employers

15

have a way to seek a compensation order?

16

regulations, the only way they can do that is if the

17

employee files a claim, and the employee's filing of the

18

claim then sets the process in motion.

19

that an -- any employee, knowing that a future award

20

It's not a


I think the way the argument

has gone so far is that we've all been saying this can't

make sense, and you've been saying, as you have every

11

right to say, yes, but this is what the statute says

12

based on the "newly awarded" language.

13

But that does assume that "newly awarded"

14

can't mean an entitlement.

15

some other statutory provisions where an award does seem

16

to mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an

17

entitlement to funds.

18

the word "award" means entitlement; 910(h)(1), it seems

19

as though the word "award" means an entitlement; and

20

933(b), which says "award in a compensation order,"

21

suggests that awards can be made in a formal order or

22

awards can be made differently because of an entitlement

23

that is automatically paid.

24

reading of the phrase "newly awarded," you know, runs

into problems in those three ways, and I'm left then

thinking we should do what makes sense.

933(b), 908(d)(1), and

8
9

I may have missed what the

MR. GILLELAN:

Ah, okay.

Yes, 9 -- the

section 8(d)(1) that they're referring to refers to an

10

award to an -- the unpaid portion of an award to an

11

employee who dies before that award has been paid out.

12

Their reading of "award" in that provision is

13

contradicted by the subsequent paragraph of the same

14

subsection, which says "an award may be made after the

15

death of the injured employee."

16

It's 908(d)(3).

Now, that is impossible on their reading of

17

"award" -- on the reading they give "award" in section

18

8(d)(1).

19

20

while the claimant is still alive, it's entered after

me, by saying that it always means an award of

means that, but it certainly means an amount due and not

MR. PALMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner's interpretation of section 906,

11

which hinges entirely on the date of an administrative

12

compensation order, renders that provision impossible to

13

apply in the many cases expressly contemplated by the

14

Act in which there is no such order.

interpretation also creates arbitrary distinctions

-- "filed by the deputy

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. PALMORE:

9
10

Right.

Right.

-- that aren't important here.

That sentence, even read by itself, suggests there can
be an award that's not in a compensation order.

11

Moreover --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. PALMORE:

Oh, yes.

Yes.

-- the last sentence says:

14

"For purposes of this subsection" -- not the purposes of

15

the entire Act -- "for purposes of this subsection, the

16

term 'award' with respect to a compensation order means

17

a formal order issued by the deputy commissioner, an

18

administrative law judge" --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's -- that's true.

And

20

what that means is that it can be considered an award if

21

you've gotten it from the employer voluntarily.

22

still an award of compensation.

9

difficulties, and application would be really

10
11

inconsistent.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, no.

I think he's

12

persuaded me that in -- in the section we're talking

13

about, subsection (c), the only meaning left for "award"

14

is an award by the agency, because --

15

MR. PALMORE:

16
17

like to try to convince you otherwise.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

you can give "award" is entitlement to money.

22

another example.

So, it makes a

There's no

I think -- but if I could go back to
section -34

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

His answer to that was

2

that the provision also permits an entry after someone

3

-- of an order after someone dies.

5

MR. PALMORE:
the other provisions --

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, it's -- the

incongruity is taken care of by the Act directly.

8
9

That's his answer on some of

MR. PALMORE:

Right.

But here that -- here

there'd be no reason for someone to go in and get a

10

compensation order, because these were long-past

11

disabilities, and Congress was simply creating a rule

12

for how to true up these past beneficiaries and provide

13

them additional benefits.

14

But I think if you --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what does "awarded

16

compensation at less than the maximum rate" mean?

17

not sure what that refers to.

18

MR. PALMORE:

There was an old maximum.

19

Prior to 1972, there was a $70 maximum.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. PALMORE:

22

25

the maximum?

I'm

Right.

So, if someone was --

Aren't you entitled to get

No?
MR. PALMORE:

Yes.

But some people --

two-thirds of their average weekly wage resulted in a
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

figure below the maximum, right?

2

what section 910(h)(1) did was said if you were awarded

3

compensation at less than the prior maximum, you're

4

going to get an inflation adjustment.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. PALMORE:

So, for those people,

I got you.

For everyone else who was

7

already at the maximum, they got a new, statutorily

8

created time of injury, which is itself significant,

that Congress went -- used that route.

these are the key provisions for understanding how

21

section 906 works in the statutory scheme.

22

at the bottom of the page, 17a to the Government's

23

brief, provides that employers must pay compensation

24

without a compensation order promptly, as soon as they

25

have notice of an injury.
36

Alderson Reporting Company

Section 914,

2

that the first payment has to come in 14 days, within

3

14 days of notice of the injury, unless the employer

4

controverts liability.

means compensation order, and I'm not here to suggest

that the -- that the statute never uses the word "award"

has to know what statutory maximum applies.

The employer is supposed to know how

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your reading doesn't

5

encourage employers to pay, because they can stop just

6

by saying they contest, right?

7
8

MR. PALMORE:

Absolutely.

They have a

statutory right to controvert.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- so, your reading I

10

think leads to protraction.

And they get that date of

11

injury rule no matter how long they string it out under

12

your reading.

13

phrase -- newly --

If you read -- what is the magic

14

MR. PALMORE:

Newly awarded compensation.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You can say, well, that

16

means in the case of the employer who pays promptly,

17

pays immediately and continues to pay voluntarily, that

18

the compensation is acquired when the employer starts

19

paying voluntarily.

20

then the compensation is newly awarded when there's an

21

award.

22

But if the employer is not paying,

So, I don't see why -- what kind of problems

23

this statute would have if we say newly awarded could

24

mean awarded by the statute, which would be newly

25

awarded when you're injured; but it can also mean
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

compensation ordered by an award.

So, you have the

2

employer who pays promptly can lock in that early date,

3

but if he doesn't pay promptly, the -- then the ceiling

4

is going to go up till the time the award is entered.

5

What's wrong with that reading?

6

MR. PALMORE:

That's again a reading that

7

hasn't been advanced in this case, but I understand Your

8

Honor's question and Your Honor's point.

9

reading of it would be very difficult to apply because

I think that

10

there may be many cases where an employer will write one

11

or two checks and then stop.

12

which an employer will write a check for the wrong

13

amount; there will later be a dispute about what the

14

proper benefit level would be.

15

There made be cases in

So, I think you'd develop a whole body of

16

case law and controversy about what it meant for the

17

employer to have paid, in that sense.

going to be the typical cases, I think.

22

this is how we calculate what we owe you.

23

based on the maximum of this year, not any future ones,

24

and if the employee says no, no, no; I have a right to

25

get the -- then the employer will say, well, okay, I

3

MR. PALMORE:

Well, the -- the employer will

need to protect itself by writing that check unless it's

5

going to controvert liability.

6

to one of Petitioner's arguments that this provides an

7

incentive for employers not to controvert liability when

8

they don't have a good-faith basis for doing so, but

9

section 928 of the Act provides for attorney's fees in

Justice Ginsburg pointed

So, there's already a remedy for that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I understand

13

the amounts at issue here.

What is a usual amount

14

that's at stake in this sort of case?

15

about the concerns -- I guess on both -- about

16

gamesmanship, but how much difference are we talking

17

about?

MR. PALMORE:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

We're talking

Well, the -I don't know; maybe

you don't have statistics, on an average.
MR. PALMORE:

Well, I can -- we can use this

22

case as an -- as an illustration.

So, in this case, the

23

Petitioner's disability began in 2002.

24

that that's when he was initially awarded compensation.

25

And so, the 2002 maximum of $966 applies.
41

Alderson Reporting Company

So, our view is

Official

1

Petitioner's view is that because he

2

received a formal compensation order in 2007, the 2007

3

maximum applies, this 1,114.

4

So, it can make a considerable difference.

5

I think, though, that Petitioner recognizes --

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The consequence -- I

7

mean, there's the time value of money, too.

The

8

consequence of the employee saying I'm going to wait 5

9

years because I think the maximum is going to be a lot

10

higher is that he doesn't get anything in the meantime,

11

right?

12

MR. PALMORE:

Well, that's -- that's right.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's reasonable for

14

an employer to say, okay, if you want to wait, I'll

15

wait.

16

MR. PALMORE:

That's right.

The larger

17

point though is that in many cases in which compensation

18

is paid without compulsion of a compensation order, an

19

employee never files a claim.

20

contemplates that by saying that an employee has 1 year

21

in which to file a claim from an injury unless he has

22

been receiving payments, in which case the time runs

23

from the last payment received.

interpretation the statute, which is that he needs a

13

way he can get a claim in every case, because in many

14

cases claims are not filed today, is that the employer

must threaten the disabled employee to cut off benefits

17

controvert liability when that employer has no

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

to the problem of an employer protracting -- so he

apply to cases that don't implicate the statutory

17

solution using his reading of the statute to deal with

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT

7
8

MR. KEISLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

I'd like to begin, if I may, by addressing

10

Justice Scalia's and the Chief Justice's questions on

11

whether the term "award" can bear the meaning that we

12

ascribe to it and then explain why, since it can bear

13

that meaning, this is the only sensible interpretation

14

of the Act.
First, it is not uncommon, Your Honor, to

15
16

use the term "award" to describe a benefit conferred by

17

a statute.

The dictionary definition is a benefit

18

conferred.

Your Honor, Justice Scalia used a

19

formulation -- what if a statute awards a tax credit?

20

Well, the Court's decision in New Energy Company v.

21

Limbach began:

22

certain producers of ethanol.

23
24
25

An Ohio statute awards a tax credit to a

I think even Your Honor was the author of
that decision.

It is --

(Laughter.)
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, well, I -- I agree

2

with that.

You can speak of the statute as awarding

3

something.

But when you use the phrase "newly awarded,"

4

you're not referring to the enactment of the statute;

5

you're referring to the time at which the person

6

qualifies under the statute.

7

of that sort, that a person -- well, you know, when my

8

wife has a baby, I've been awarded money.

9

And I don't know any usage

You haven't been awarded money.
MR. KEISLER:

10

I think the party becomes

11

newly awarded at the time the party becomes disabled,

12

and, therefore, there is an amount due under the

13

statute.

14

And -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, that's what you say.

15

But I don't know -- I don't know any common usage that

16

employs the term --

17
18
19

MR. KEISLER:

But it is a usage within the

Longshore Act elsewhere, as Mr. Palmore -JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the -- the

20

business was newly awarded the tax credit at the time

21

they made the deduction?

22

MR. KEISLER:

At the time they became

23

qualified for what the statute required them to do to

24

get the tax credit, yes.

25

910(h)(1), as Justice Kagan said.

And that is how it is used in
It's how it's used in

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

908.

And section 933 specifically provides Petitioner's

2

definition of "award," a formal compensation order, but

3

says it is only for purposes of this subsection.

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's not the way

it's used in 914.

6

MR. KEISLER:

That's correct.

And that's

7

why this is a case like Robinson v. Shell Oil, in which

8

the word "employer" was used throughout Title VII in

9

different ways.

And what the Court said is you then

10

have to look at the context of the individual provision

11

in which the word appears that you're construing to

12

determine how the word is being used in that particular

13

provision.

14

And here the most fundamental reason why it

15

is an untenable construction of this Act to rely on the

16

date of a compensation order to determine the applicable

17

maximum rate is that then the Act would be silent as to

18

the maximum rate in the vast majority of instances in

19

which compensation is paid, because, as Mr. Palmore

20

said, in the vast majority of instances no claim is

21

filed.

22

claim is filed, no compensation order will ever be

23

issued.

24
25

And, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, when no

And that's not an accident.

That is a

function of a very central feature of the Act's design
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that Petitioner's interpretation is entirely at odds

2

with.

3

calculated precisely and as early as possible so that

4

the money can get into the employee's hands very quickly

5

and with a minimum of instances in which the

6

administrative machinery has to be invoked.

7

the norm is no compensation order.

8
9

The Act is designed to enable compensation to be

That's why

And so, Petitioner's interpretation is
counter to that in at least two respects:

It relies on

10

the existence of a compensation order, which in most

11

instances won't and shouldn't issue, and it would

12

maximize, rather than minimize, the number of instances

13

in which someone has to go and get an order to force

14

compensation orders out of the system to make

15

Petitioner's interpretation work, even though everything

16

is happening exactly as the Act says it should.

17

employer is voluntarily paying exactly the amount that

18

the employee says is due, and there's no need to get the

19

agency involved.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

But how much of a

21

practical problem is this?

I understand the -- the

22

amounts are here, but it's 5 years, and apparently the

23

employee was happy to wait 5 years to get an award.

24

Normally, if you're an employee and you're disabled, and

25

the employer says, well, here's what we're going to give
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you, and it's based on the maximum of the latest we

2

have, you're not going to say:

3

wages are going to go up nationally, and I'm going to

4

wait a year; maybe I'll wait 4 years because I think

5

there's a trend on national average wages, and I'm going

6

to cash in on that; I'm going to be without money for

7

the next 4 years and I'm disabled, but -- I mean, that

8

doesn't sound to me to be a plausible situation.

9

MR. KEISLER:

I'm going to wait; these

But if Your Honor thinks about

10

the situation in which the employee is voluntarily

11

receiving from the employer everything that the employee

12

agrees is due, then the question is, in that

13

circumstance where the employer is doing everything

14

right, what can the employer do to force out of the

15

system a compensation order that will lock in the

16

maximum rate?

17

evidences the problem with his position.

18

And Petitioner's solution to that problem

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no, I mean --

19

I don't know what the employers do, but usually in a

20

situation like this, the employers have good lawyers and

21

they write at the end of the check, you know:

22

in full satisfaction of any claims under the -- the

23

whatever.

24
25

MR. KEISLER:

This is

But there is no compensation

order until that employee files a claim.
53

Alderson Reporting Company

And under

Official

1

Petitioner's interpretation, there would therefore be no

2

knowable maximum rate.

3

that problem, on page 16 of his reply brief, is to say

4

that the employer should threaten a bad-faith cutoff of

5

funds.

6

unless you file a claim.

And Petitioner's solution to

The employer should say I will cut you off

That's bad for everyone.

It's bad for the

employee who has access to payments delayed.

It's bad

9

for the employer who apparently is being told it must

controvert liability in bad faith, because the employer

doesn't in fact disagree that the employee is entitled

to liability, or face a 10 percent penalty for cutting

off the employee without a basis for controverting

Whether it happens frequently or


4

infrequently, Mr. Chief Justice, I think an


5

interpretation that relies on a mechanism that is so

6

obviously counter to the way the statute is supposed to

7

function is, by virtue of that, an extremely unlikely

8

and unnatural interpretation of the statute.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

About what percentage of

10

the compensation cases involve the statutory maximum?

11

Because if you -- if your pay is less than the statutory

12

maximum, this issue doesn't come up.

13

MR. KEISLER:

In 1972, Congress was told

14

that it would be about 10 percent.

15

since then, it's grown so that I'm told that about 20

16

percent of cases today require application of the

17

maximum rate.

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My understanding is

Does the maximum

always go up?
MR. KEISLER:

20

Ever since 1972, each year's

21

maximum as calculated by the Secretary of Labor has been

22

higher than the preceding year.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Theoretically, it

can go down.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Keisler, if I could just

4

go back to this language.

If -- if according to Justice

5

Scalia's old opinion, the statute awards compensation at

6

the time of disability, essentially what you would be

7

saying is that an employee who becomes disabled in a

8

certain year is awarded compensation at that time.

9

that right?

10

MR. KEISLER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is

That's right, Your Honor.
Yes, but I -- I didn't say

12

in that opinion that the -- the employer in -- in that

13

-- or whoever it was that was entitled under the statute

14

-- was "newly awarded" it.

15

it, but when you say somebody is "newly awarded," you're

16

talking about an event at that time.

17

MR. KEISLER:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. KEISLER:

I agree the statute awards

And that's --

I think the function -That's a different usage.

I think the function of

20

"newly" in this statute is something different,

21

Justice Scalia.

22

Your Honor and Justice Breyer were asking about the

23

relationship between the "currently receiving" clause

24

and the final clause.

25

clause, which relates to those with permanent total

And that relates to the questions that

I think the "currently receiving"

disability and death, is an adjunct to another provision

2

of the Act, section 19(f), which provides for a COLA, a

3

cost-of-living increase, every year for that narrow

4

subset of the most disabled of employees.

5

alone get that annual bump-up.

6

They and they

And so, that "currently receiving" clause is

7

written for that category to make sure that their

8

bump-up isn't capped by a static maximum rate.

9

other part of the clause, "newly awarded compensation,"

10
11

The

is about everybody else.
Now, I think the use of the word "newly"

12

there is just to distinguish it from the "currently

13

receiving" clause, which is escalating year by year.

14

And those newly awarded compensation, meaning at one

15

point, fixed in time -- only when you are "newly"

16

awarded compensation are you then going to have your

17

maximum rate fixed.

18

And then -- and both Petitioner and we

19

agree -- whatever it's fixed at, whatever year, that

20

stays the same for the duration of your collection of

21

compensation.

thank the Court.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA T. GILLELAN, II,


3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, let's assume an


5

employer pays, continues to pay over a period of time,

6

and the employee needs more money and goes in and says

7

you owe me more money; I'm going to make a claim.

8

board says no, he doesn't owe you more money; he was

9

paying the right amount.

The

And so, you're not entitled to

10

the 1200 you're asking for; you're only entitled to the

11

1,000 he was paying.

12

Under your view, if that happened 5 or 10

13

years after the payments started, would the employer be

14

liable for the higher average 10 years later?

15

MR. GILLELAN:

Only, of course, if the

16

employee's own wages at the time of the injury qualified

17

for that, but yes.

18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assuming it does, that

the answer is "yes"?

20

MR. GILLELAN:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
So, what stops an

22

employee from simply doing what I said?

23

employee from kicking up his own maximum by -- whenever

24

he chooses to do it, years and years later?

25

MR. GILLELAN:

What stops an

Well, I think in that

situation, the claimant hasn't triggered that award.

2

fact, the claimant has triggered the maximum that's in

3

effect at the time of that award that only makes -- it's

4

an award only of what the employer has been paying.

5

It's not a denial, as it's characterized in the

6

Government's brief.

7

the employer has been paying.

8
9

But it is an award only of what of

If the claimant did not bring it forward
with that and the employer let it go for still further

10

years, then even a subsequent year's maximum would be

11

the actual --

12

In

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we find any ambiguity

13

in the statute, in the statutory language, would it then

14

make more sense to adopt your meaning or the

15

Government's, given all of the factors that the

16

Government argues counsels in its favor?

17

MR. GILLELAN:

I think each of those

18

arguments is fallacious.

They misdescribe the statute

19

in their reasons why this is not a sensible provision.

20

But even if there is an ambiguity --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. GILLELAN:

Assume that --

Before we lose, that -- the

23

other possible meanings of "newly awarded" have got to

24

include what they say the test is.
