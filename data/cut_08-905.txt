We will hear

Reynolds.

Mr. Shanmugam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

10

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The statute of limitations for private

12

securities fraud claims incorporates the equitable

13

principle known as the discovery rule; that is, the

14

principle that the limitations period begins to run from

15

the discovery of the facts constituting the violation.

16

Under the discovery rule, a plaintiff who suspects the

17

possibility that the defendant has engaged in wrongdoing

18

is on inquiry notice and thereafter must exercise

19

reasonable diligence in investigating his potential

20

claim.

21
22
23

The court of appeals in this case erred at
the first step -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counselor, that presumes

24

that then Congress is using unnecessary words when it

25

differentiates in a statute between discovery of facts
3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

constituting a violation and a different statute, like

2

section 13 or 77m, however you want to call it, when

3

it says "due diligence."

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, Congress did say that,

5

Justice Sotomayor, in section 77m, section 13 of

6

the 1933 Act, but we don't think --

7
8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So are we supposed to

presume that they like using unnecessary words?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we don't think that

10

Congress's inclusion of that express language referring

11

to constructive discovery in that provision was

12

significant, and that's because of the default

13

understanding --

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're answering me

yes, it's unnecessary.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

We don't think it makes any

17

difference in terms of the application of the rule.

18

And, indeed, there are cases applying section 13 of the

19

1933 Act that interpret it in exactly the same manner

20

that we’re suggesting the Court should interpret section

21

1658(b) in, in this case.

22

And that’s simply because the default

23

understanding has long been that when a statute of

24

limitations is triggered by a discovery rule, that

25

includes both express and -- both actual and
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

constructive discovery, and with the exception of three

2

sentences in Respondents' brief, the parties before this

3

Court are really in agreement on that proposition.

4
5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you want to go beyond

constructive discovery?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, no, Justice Scalia.

7

We believe that the concept of constructive discovery

8

itself incorporates the specific principle of inquiry

9

notice, which is --

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think there’s a

11

line between constructive discovery -- constructive

12

discovery asks, when should you have known?

13

rule you are arguing for is something beyond that.

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And the

Well, we are asking the

15

Court to adopt the principle of inquiry notice, but we

16

don't believe that that is a particularly significant

17

additional step.

18

principle has likewise long been understood as part of

19

the discovery rule with regard to fraud claims

20

specifically, and it was well understood to be part of

21

the application of the discovery rule with regard to

22

securities fraud claims specifically, at the time

23

Congress enacted section 1658(b).

24
25

And that is simply because that

fallback approach, under which a plaintiff who actually

2

exercises reasonable diligence and conducts an

3

investigation gets the benefit of additional time, one

the words of the statute, which is to say a plaintiff at

19

indication that it does so -- that the other drug that

20

it's comparing with may have an anti-heart attack

element.

22

23

The story that was being put out is, yes,

And that's accepted.

We could -- it could be

How would the most diligent plaintiff have

24

gone about finding out whether Merck really had no good

25

faith belief in this so-called naproxen hypothesis?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Right.

Well, just to be

2

clear, as a preliminary matter, as I understand

3

Respondents' position, it is that the alleged

4

misstatement in this case is that Merck made

5

misstatements when it expressed its belief that the

6

naproxen hypothesis was the likely explanation for the

7

disparity in cardiovascular events that was reported in

8

the VIGOR study.

9

Now, as a first-order response, we believe

10

that there was considerable information in the public

11

domain suggesting the possibility that Petitioners had

12

engaged in securities fraud when they made those

13

statements.

14

were on inquiry notice, and that is a point that is more

15

than 2 years before the limitations period --

At that point, we believe that Respondents

Well, excuse me.

-- before the plaintiffs

filed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

believe that there is substantial evidence of fraud when

21

there is simply substantial evidence of inaccuracy,

22

without -MR. SHANMUGAM:

23
24
25

Well, there was more than

that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- without any evidence of
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

scienter.

2

What evidence of scienter was there?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, most notably, you had

3

the FDA specifically accusing Merck of deliberate

4

wrongdoing in connection with its public representations

5

concerning the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but deliberate

7

wrongdoing -- as I understood that, it was simply you

8

didn't give adequate weight to the -- to the other -- to

9

the other side of it.

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, but the FDA did more

11

than that in the warning letter.

12

misrepresenting the cardiovascular safety profile of

13

Vioxx, and it accused Merck of minimizing the potential

14

of cardiovascular arrests.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It accused Merck of

That means it's -- that

16

means it's wrong.

17

without having scienter to defraud.

18

You can misrepresent something

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I do think that the fair

19

reading of the FDA warning letter is that the FDA was

20

accusing Merck of intentional misrepresentation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

But it didn't stop it.

22

Didn't -- didn't Merck submit a curative label,

23

whatever, and the FDA said that was okay?

24

that submission continued to give the naproxen

25

hypothesis?

And that --

Not the -- the reason that we are seeing
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this heart attack thing showing up is that the other

2

drug has a -- has a clotting inhibitor.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, it is true that Merck

4

continued to maintain its belief in the naproxen

5

hypothesis.

6

somehow to toll the running of the limitations period.

7

Such an approach would render the limitations period in

8

section 1658(b) effectively triggered by a continuing

9

violation theory.

We don't believe that that is sufficient

10

But I do want to get back to your question

11

about what more the plaintiffs in this case could have

12

done, because I do think that that is a very critical

13

question here.

14

We do believe that there was sufficient

15

information in the public domain to cause Respondents to

16

suspect the possibility that Petitioners had engaged in

17

wrongdoing.

18

that Respondents could have done.

19

talked to experts to test the validity of Merck’s

20

naproxen hypothesis.

21

At that point, there are several things

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They could have

But one of the things they

22

could not have done was file a lawsuit right then.

Is

23

that correct?

24

facts to comply with the rules barring plaintiffs from

25

filing suits based on information and belief?

Because they would not have had adequate

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we don't believe that

2

the Respondents would have had sufficient information to

3

file a complaint then; and, indeed, we have taken the

4

position that they still don't have sufficient facts to

5

satisfy the PSLRA's pleading requirements.

6

it's notable in this case that Respondents really can't

7

point to any facts that came into the public domain

8

between the date of the FDA warning letter and the date

9

in October of 2003 when the plaintiffs first filed

10

suit --

11

And I think

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but if we had that

them additional information.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we had that kind of

analysis, where the -- where the company has to reserve

17

Right.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I think you

don't get -- get very far.

And -- and it seems to me,

25

as Justice Stevens's and Justice Ginsburg's questions
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indicate, that the companies can't have it both ways.

2

They can't endorse the Twombly case and then say just an

3

inquiry notice of a general -- of a general nature

4

suffices.

You have to have specific evidence of

5

scienter.

And there’s nothing here to indicate that

6

the plaintiffs had that.

has engaged in securities fraud but doesn't, at the

point of inquiry notice, possess information bearing on

3

5

Is there some information in some publicly

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I would say that the very

6

fact that other lawsuits were filed that accused Merck

7

of making intentional misrepresentations with regard to

8

the very same statements that are at issue here actually

9

itself constitutes additional information that should

10

have put the plaintiffs on inquiry notice in the first

11

place.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How when -- when there

13

were -- doctors across the country were continuing to

14

write prescriptions for this, when the market apparently

15

accepted this -- it may be one thing, it may be another

16

-- but there were not signals from the market itself,

17

and the medical profession seemed to be going on and

18

writing -- lots of doctors were writing prescriptions

19

for this?

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, first of all, Justice

JUSTICE ALITO:

Your arguing that if the --

if the plaintiffs' attorneys made diligent

10

investigation, they would have uncovered facts about the

11

safety of Vioxx that the FDA was unaware of?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Because the FDA never took

14

any action during this period, other than changing the

15

label.

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, the FDA did issue the

17

warning letter, and the label was changed to incorporate

18

language indicating the cardiovascular disparity from

19

the VIGOR study.

20

that it is noteworthy for purposes of the merits of this

21

case that the FDA itself thought that that was

22

sufficient.

23

That took place in 2002.

And I think

But in this case, Respondents seem to be

24

pointing to much later information as the point on which

25

they were on inquiry notice.

They seem to suggest in

15
Alderson Reporting Company

1

their brief that they were not on inquiry notice until

2

as late as 2004 when The Wall Street Journal published

3

an article disclosing certain internal e-mails.

embarrassment to their position, I would submit, that

difference should exist, why not just apply the same

13

rule to the investors whether they really do investigate

begins to run on July 1, not January 1?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Along with the difficulty of drawing a

I think there’s no doubt,

17

Justice Breyer, that the easiest rule in some sense for

18

the Court to apply would be a rule that started the

19

clock running from the date of inquiry notice.

20

you're comparing our fallback position, a rule that is

with Respondents' rule, which looks to what a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why not say that because

of one -- one element of the claim is scienter, that

there’s no inquiry notice based on -- there may have

5

been a misrepresentation, whether it was innocent or

6

because scienter is an element of the claim, and you

can plead that with particularity, that it's only when

Why not say

10

you have that indication that you have what you call

11

inquiry notice?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, again, Justice

13

Ginsburg, the fundamental inquiry, so to speak, in

14

determining whether a plaintiff is on inquiry notice is

15

simply whether a reasonable investor based on the

16

information in the public domain would at least suspect

17

the possibility that the defendant has engaged in

18

securities fraud.

19

information bearing on each and every element of the

underlying violation in order to be on inquiry notice.

would collapse --

MR. SHANMUGAM:

opposite.

In those cases, of course,
Is that right?
No.

We certainly don't

believe -JUSTICE STEVENS:

If we go back to the text

of the statute, it says 2 years after discovery, and you

9

argue it should mean 2 years after he should have

10

discovered, though -- and that period being measured by

11

a date from inquiry notice, which is not mentioned in

12

the statute at all.

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that in

14

understanding the term "discovery," Justice Stevens --

15

that term really can't be meaningfully understood

16

without reference to the common law against which the

17

statute was enacted.

18

discovery rules --

are reading as though it meant 2 years after he should

have discovered?

again, I think that getting to the point of "should have

is the principle that a plaintiff who sleeps on his

rights is not entitled to the benefits of equity.

Mr. Shanmugam, in Lampf we

two choices:

12

13

statement or the omission or after such discovery should

14

have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence."

15

That was one choice.

16

And we had

One was section 77m, which reads:

“After

The other choice was 78i(e), which simply

17

said:

"unless brought within one year after the

18

discovery of the facts constituting the violation.”

19

statement of "or after it should have been made by the

20

exercise," okay?

No

We chose the latter in Lampf.

Now, you are telling me that there was no

21
22

choice between the two, that -- that "after discovery"

23

always means after discovery was made or after it should

24

have been made?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, no, I don’t --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, I read this -- this

3

statute -- and 1658 tracks, not 77m, which says "after

4

discovery should have been made"; it tracks 78i(e),

5

which says "after discovery."

6

after discovery, period.

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Now, to me that means

Well, Justice Scalia, the

8

Court did choose to essentially incorporate the language

9

from -- it was section 9(e) of the 1934 Act.

There were

10

various provisions in the '33 Act and the '34 Act that

11

incorporated discovery rules.

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that’s one -Well, just tell me what the

difference it was between 77m and 77i(e)?

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -What was the difference,

16

unless it was that 77m -- I'm sorry, 78i(e) --

17

absolutely required knowledge?

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think one potential

19

difference is that section 13, section 77m, refers to

20

discovery of the untrue statement or the omission.

21

I think more broadly with regard to both section 9(e)

22

and the other provisions of the 1934 Act to which the

23

Court looked, courts had actually construed those

24

provisions as reaching both actual and constructive

25

discovery at the time the Court decided Lampf.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
between the two --

MR. SHANMUGAM:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

So there was no difference

No, there was really --- and we were just wasting

our time?

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There was no difference

8

between the two, and I think really for the reasons that

9

the government states in its brief as well as the

10

reasons that we state in our opening brief, the default

11

understanding has always been that a reference to

12

discovery includes at least constructive discovery.

13

a rule that triggers the limitations period from actual

14

discovery would have significant vices because it would

15

give plaintiffs --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Could you -- could you

17

tell me what the difference is between actual knowledge

18

and constructive knowledge?

19

who have submitted briefs arguing that actual discovery

20

should be our standard, they appear to say that actual

21

discovery or actual knowledge includes anything that’s

22

in the public domain; that parties are presumed -- and

23

we have plenty of cases that say that -- to know what's

24

out there.

25

Because as I read the amici

So outside of that, how would constructive

Alderson Reporting Company

1

knowledge or constructive discovery be any different?

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It would require the

4

shareholder to find the guy in Burma?

5

attempt in every case to engage employees in

6

dishonorable conduct by talking about their business in

7

private, company business -- as I understood it, we were

8

asking employees to engage in potentially fiduciary

9

breaches?

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Or to go and

I think it's an open

11

question, Justice Sotomayor, as to what actual discovery

12

would -- would actually mean, and I think that there

13

would be a pretty good argument that you don't actually

14

discover the underlying facts until the plaintiff

15

himself subjectively actually has them in his

16

possession.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's going

18

further than the amici are suggesting.

19

suggesting -- and assuming we accept their suggestion --

20

that it should be everything that’s in the public

21

domain, which seems reasonable to me.

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think it does --

2

constructive knowledge obviously also includes

information in the public domain, and we believe that

the plaintiffs in this case were on inquiry notice

look to.

13

14

domain.

15

You look to either information in the

conceding amici's point that actual -- an actual

17

knowledge standard is the same as a constructive

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I would hope at a

20

minimum that if the Court were to embrace an actual

21

discovery standard, it would look to information in the

22

public domain, precisely because otherwise you really

23

would be rewarding an ostrich plaintiff because a

24

plaintiff who claimed not to read what was in the

25

newspapers could have the benefit of additional time.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

But --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if actual knowledge

3

means things that the plaintiff doesn't actually know,

4

then I don't know what the difference is between actual

5

knowledge and constructive knowledge.

6

meaningless distinction if that's how actual knowledge

7

is defined.

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It's a

Well, again, that’s not how

I would ordinarily understand the phrase "actual

10

knowledge."

11

that if in essence the standard that this Court were to

12

adopt is a standard that does not start the clock

13

running until there is sufficient information in the

14

public domain for a plaintiff actually to plead a

15

complaint, that would radically extend the limitations

16

period for private securities fraud actions.

But I think that it's important to remember

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is the problem --

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

No circuit --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

What is wrong with the --

20

with the inquiry notice rule that the court of appeals

21

in this case set out on pages 29a to 30a of the joint

22

appendix?

23

from a Seventh Circuit decision:

24

constituting inquiry notice must be sufficiently

25

probative of fraud, sufficiently advanced beyond the

This is from a Seventh Circuit -- quoting
"The facts

2

substantiated, not only to incite the victim to

3

investigate but also to enable him to tie up any loose

4

ends and complete the investigation in time to file a

5

timely suit."

6

So that the statute would run upon inquiry

7

notice, provided that within the 2-year period, the

8

plaintiff could, if the plaintiff diligently

9

investigated, find sufficient facts to -- to file a

10

complaint that would satisfy -- satisfy the PLRA?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think I’ll answer that

12

question, and then I would like to reserve the balance

13

of my time.

14

I think the only problem with that rule is

15

that, at the tail end, it effectively mandates the same

16

hypothetical plaintiff inquiry that Respondents suggest.

17

It requires a court to attempt to assess whether a

18

plaintiff could have discovered the remaining

19

information within a 2-year period.

20

of the same vices, we would submit, as Respondents' rule

21

and the government's rule.

And that has all

22

I’d like to reserve the balance of my time.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

2
3

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

4

Our position is that Congress intended the

5

word "discovery" in section 1658 to have its normal and

6

well-established meaning.

7

By contrast, Merck asks the Court to add

8

concepts to section 1658 not found in its text by

9

interpreting the word "discovery" to mean suspicion and

10

for the 2-year limitations period to be triggered when

11

facts cause an investor to suspect the possibility of

12

fraud.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you're adding --

14

you’re adding concepts to it, as well.

15

before us intends discovery to mean actual discovery.

16

Your -- you say constructive knowledge is enough; don't

17

you?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Nobody arguing

Well, we say, at the first

19

part of our submission, that the Court can decide the

20

case on an actual discovery -- actual knowledge

21

standard.

22

We have gone on to brief constructive

23

discovery because, prior to 1934, in the numerous State

24

statutes that use the phrase "discovery of facts

25

constituting," many courts had adopted a constructive
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

knowledge standard.

2
3

We think we win under either standard.

If

the Court decides this is an actual knowledge case --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can -- can you tell me

5

what you see as the difference between the two?

I keep

6

going back to what the amici has argued, which is actual

7

knowledge that includes knowledge of what's in the

8

public domain, under the theory that every shareholder

9

is presumed to know what's in the public domain because

10

that's what they buy with and that's the market theory

11

of securities law.

12
13
14

So, what do you see as a difference between
the two?
MR. FREDERICK:

In a fraud-on-the-market

15

case, like this one, where an efficient market is

16

pleaded, there’s no practical difference.

17

individual case, where the securities fraud alleges that

18

an individual investor is harmed by the individual

19

actions of some broker or some other person, there could

20

very well be a difference in terms of what the

21

reasonable investor should have known on the basis of

22

information that would be available.

23

In an

And the point of the constructive knowledge

24

standard was to have plaintiffs not rest on their --

25

their ability to hide information, but to be diligent,
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonably, in ascertaining that information, and the

2

constructive knowledge standard really came to address a

3

case different from the case that we have here, Justice

4

Sotomayor.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I -- it sounds

6

right, but give me a practical -- give me a practical

7

example --

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.
-- of what you are

10

talking about, where -- where an individual investor

11

would have something that's not in the public domain.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

That would be information

13

that the -- the broker, for instance, would have made

14

available to the investor, that the investor simply

15

didn't look at, or that the investor could have asked

16

for, but -- but never followed up in obtaining.

17

And that kind of constructive knowledge

18

standard, this Court has held in numerous cases, dating

19

back to the 19th century, is an appropriate form of

20

attributing knowledge to a reasonable person.

21

And the cases that we’ve cited in our brief

22

-- Kirby, Wood -- those kinds of cases talk about what a

23

reasonable person in those kinds of circumstances would

24

be imputed to know.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -- but actual

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

knowledge would include anything the investor had in

2

their possession because that's what actual knowledge

3

is; I have it in my possession -- or I have it in the

4

public domain.

You start it from there.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Correct.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The -- the only

7

difference then would be information the individual

8

would have been able to get that wouldn't have been in

9

the public domain?

10

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, through

11

reasonable inquiry, that by following up with questions

12

to the broker or to other persons associated with that

13

entity.

14

Sotomayor, in a fraud-on-the-market case, which is what

15

this case is.

16

It's a different theory, concededly, Justice

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- so we are in

17

agreement that on a fraud-on-the-market case, it might

18

have a different -- they would be identical?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, and --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You are suggesting that,

21

in an individual fraud case, the inquiry has to be

22

constructive knowledge because there could be things

23

that --

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

It could be actual or

constructive, depending on the facts and circumstances,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but the important point to draw away from this is that

2

Congress also wrote in a 5-year period of repose in

3

this statute and followed up on the suggestion of the

4

Lampf dissenters, who believed that the period of repose

5

was too restrictive.

6

So, in 2002, when Congress amended the

7

statute, they cited the Lampf dissenters and extended

8

the period of repose, which created an absolute bar to

9

claims of fraud being brought against defendants.

10

The statute of limitations period -- by

11

using a discovery rule -- was intended to preclude

12

persons from resting on their rights and not taking

13

action when they had discovered the facts constituting

14

the violation.

15

It was not intended --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But when does the –- when

16

does the 5-year -- what is the trigger for the

17

5-year period?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20
21

From the violation.
Well, what is the

violation?
MR. FREDERICK:

The violation would be a

22

material misstatement made with scienter.

23

what we assert in the class period, Justice Ginsburg, is

24

that the first statements that were made with scienter

25

were those statements after Vioxx was put on the market,
32
Alderson Reporting Company

And, here,

Official

1

in which Merck touted the naproxen hypothesis as an

2

explanation for what it asserted to be a cardio-neutral

3

effect of Vioxx, which was only subsequently -- there

4

was empirical evidence to -- tending to disprove that

5

thesis.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you say that

7

you did -- you did begin this action even before that

8

point was reached because you -- you attribute this to

9

the disclosure of the internal e-mails in the Wall

10

Street Journal article?

11

So you -- you say, well, we sued even

12

earlier than -- than the point at which we had evidence

13

of scienter.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

Under

15

our theory of the case, the period of constructive

16

knowledge of all of the elements of the violation would

17

have occurred in November of 2004 with the publication

18

of The Wall Street Journal article.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

So you are admitting

20

that you filed an improper complaint, that you didn't

21

have a basis -- a good faith basis for the complaint you

22

filed?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

No.

I'm saying -So, if you had a

good faith basis, what was -- what was in your
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

possession that gave you that good faith basis?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

first complaint is now a legal nullity.

4

superseded by --

5

First, let me say that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It has been

Counsel, I -- whether

6

it's a legal nullity or not, answer my question which

7

is:

8

was in your possession or in the public possession that

9

gave you that basis?

10

You had to have a basis for your complaint.

MR. FREDERICK:

What

Shortly before the filing of

11

the first complaint, there were public releases of a

12

study that was done by the Harvard Brigham and Women's

13

study, and that was a large epidemiological study that

14

was the first empirical basis that disproved an aspect

15

of the naproxen hypothesis.

16

Naproxen was not a drug studied at that

17

time.

18

Celebrex users had a higher rate of cardiovascular

19

incidents, and, in fact, Vioxx had higher than Celebrex.

20
21
22

But what the study showed was that Vioxx and

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That doesn't prove

scienter, though.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, to an investor who was

23

following this information, that very well may have led

24

to a strong inference of scienter because of the

25

vociferous denials that Merck subsequently made to a
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

study that was publicly reported as being funded by a

2

Merck grant.

3

Now, whether that would have met a

4

post-Tellabs pleading standard, we will not know because

5

that was not subject to that kind of scrutiny.

6

here on a subsequent, superseding complaint that pleads

7

those allegations, and we’re here on a statute of

8

limitations argument in which Merck attempts to argue

9

that the suit was filed too late, rather than too early.

10

Obviously --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We’re

But Judge Sloviter used

12

the so-called Harvard study, it seems, in her opinion.

13

She thought that that was the point at which you had

14

enough to suspect scienter.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

But, of

16

course, at that time, Justice Ginsburg, the case wasn't

17

about the pleading standards for scienter of the first

18

complaint.

19

It had long since gone past that, and the

20

fourth and now the fifth amended complaint, which

21

Merck acceded to its filing in the district court after

22

certiorari was granted in this case is now the operative

23

complaint, and I would submit that the allegations well-

24

established the pleading standards for scienter.

25

Of course, that’s not an issue before the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court, and the question of whether the first complaint

2

was premature is also not before the Court.

3

fact that there is constructive knowledge only on the

4

basis of new information that came to light is relevant

5

because Merck cannot point to a single fact that came

6

out between the FDA warning letter and the file -- and

7

2 years before the filing of the first complaint, so

8

that narrow window between September 2001 and

9

November 6, 2001.

10

But the

And, in fact, when the FDA expanded the uses

11

of Vioxx in April 2002, it approved a label that

12

specifically addressed the uncertainty about the

13

naproxen hypothesis.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, your -- your

15

position is that the statute begins to run at the time

16

when a -- a plaintiff is -- has constructive knowledge,

17

at least, of information that would be sufficient to

18

file a complaint that would satisfy the PLRA?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

That’s correct.

That was

20

the general rule, prior to 1934, when Congress first

21

wrote those words into the Federal statute.

22

But, Justice Alito, we have also provided

23

information to the Court of a case in the 19th century

24

called Martin -- this is on page 25 of our brief -- in

25

which the standard was seen to be somewhat lower than
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the normal pleading standard, and that is what a

2

reasonable person would have believed that he had been

3

subject to fraud.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, my question -- why,

5

then, did Congress allow 2 years after that?

6

point, the plaintiff has everything that’s necessary to

7

file a complaint.

8

years after that point?

9

At that

So why does the plaintiff need 2

MR. FREDERICK:

In the legislative reports

10

that accompany the Act in 2002, what the Senate

11

described in its report was a concern that a 1-year

12

period would be too short for a plaintiff to file an

13

action, survive a motion to dismiss, and then gain

14

discovery about the possibility of other codefendants

15

who had participated in that fraud.

16

This was the era, Justice Alito, in which

17

Enron and WorldCom exposed to the world the complexity

18

of vast and difficult-to-ascertain frauds, and Congress

19

was seeking to extend that period so that investors

20

would have an opportunity responsibly to bring cases

21

that would ferret out that fraud and to get at all of

22

the people who might have participated in that fraud.

23

That was the explanation that the -- the

24

Senate gave for that, and that couples with the action

25

by Congress in the PSLRA, which was intended to ensure
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that these pleading standards would be well investigated

2

and well ferreted out prior to pleadings.

3

period was intended to ensure that that kind of action

4

would -- would take place.

5

The 2-year

And when you couple that with the 5-year

6

statute of repose, the statute of limitations is simply

7

an -- an insurance that a plaintiff is not resting too

8

far on information within its possession when the

9

statute of repose is going to provide absolute

10

protection.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, is there a difference

12

-- I'm trying to get these terminological differences

13

clear in my mind, and I'm not quite certain of the

14

difference between you and the government.

15

If you go back to my -- my Burma example, I

16

think both you and the government agree that the statute

17

doesn't begin to run until you find this person in

18

Burma.

19

whether you agree or disagree about this.

20

you find the person in Burma.

21

you had all the other indications.

22

the statute begins to run.

23

find that person in Burma, you have to get, through him,

24

enough information to be able to file your complaint now

in respect to scienter.

13

rule and that this Court should adopt it.

14

something less than that and adopts a reasonable

15

person’s believing that fraud had occurred, that might

16

not quite meet the pleading standards, but would

17

nonetheless encapsulate the laws that existed prior to

We accept that the pleading standard

And that’s consistent with our view.

There certainly were courts that adopted

Petitioners' view that the statute began to run at the

5

time of inquiry notice, at the time suspicions were

6

aroused.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, under your position, as

9

very unimportant, if not completely meaningless.

You

11

investor have obtained knowledge of the necessary facts.

And so, what difference does it make when a person was

Well, I think it is -- I

think you are right that that is the ultimate question

16

for the Court:

have obtained actual knowledge?

18

notice can be a useful subsidiary step, because even

19

once it has been established -- for instance, there are

20

many cases of this Court in which the plaintiff's

21

failure to exercise reasonable diligence consisted of

22

the failure to look at documents that were available in

23

public records offices or corporate records that were

24

open for inspection.

When would a reasonably diligent person

MR. STEWART:

When

Official

would a reasonably diligent investor have discovered

2

sufficient facts to file a well-pleaded complaint?

3

Now, constructive discovery does still play

4

a role, because if there was information in the public

domain, but a particular investor simply didn't read

6

news reports, didn't follow even public information

7

about the -- the nature of what was going on with Vioxx,

Why does the -And, Mr. Stewart, the --

evidencing scienter.

But the Tellabs Court was
It was construing the

2

the specific statements that are alleged to be false or

5

-- and then, in subsection (2), it requires also to be

6

pleaded with particularity the facts that establish

7

strong inference of scienter.

8
9

And the Court in Tellabs used the term
"facts constituting the violation" as a shorthand

10

reference to that subsection (1); namely, you have to

11

plead with particularity facts about the alleged

12

misstatement and why it’s misleading.

13

The statute itself, the PSLRA, does not use

14

the term "facts constituting the violation" to describe

15

the first category.

The other thing we would say -- two other

19

things we would say in that regard are, first, as the

20

introductory language of section 1658(b)

21

points out, this limitations period only applies to

22

suits in which the plaintiff alleges misconduct

23

involving fraud, deceit, manipulation, or contrivance.

24
25

And so, the limitations period is limited
to violations that have scienter as an element.
52
Alderson Reporting Company

And,

Official

1

therefore, it would be particularly peculiar to think of

2

a violation as not encompassing the fact of scienter.

3

The other thing we would say -- and Justice

4

Scalia was asking earlier about the differences between

5

differences.

12

concept of inquiry notice, really has no role.

15

Instead, they really advance two other

My friend Mr. Frederick suggested, at least

16

in cases involving alleged fraud on the market, that the

17

standard really should be an actual discovery standard.

18

But no court of appeals has adopted that interpretation

19

of section 1658(b), and as a practical matter that would

20

dramatically lengthen the limitations period for private

21

securities fraud actions.

22

And it is no answer to say that Congress's

23

inclusion of a statute of repose makes everything okay.

24

We would respectfully submit that the inclusion of the

25

statute of repose suggests that Congress was simply
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particularly concerned with the inclusion -- with the

2

fact that plaintiffs could bring stale claims, and that

3

Congress in no way intended to modify the traditional

4

operation of the discovery rule.

5

With regard to the suggestion that the Court

6

should simply adopt a constructive discovery rule that

7

pays no heed to inquiry notice, which is the standard

8

that the government seems to be advancing, I think,

9

first of all, Respondents' difficulty in coming up with

10

a date on which constructive discovery occurs in this

11

case simply illustrates the problem that would be

12

multiplied a hundredfold if that standard is applied

13

nationwide.

14

And where a statute of limitations is

15

concerned, one needs to have clear rules and rules that

16

courts can easily apply without inconsistency.

I do

17

think that that rule would also lead to abuse.

It would

18

lead to the abuse of the ostrich plaintiff who simply

19

lies in wait and waits to see how a company's stock

20

performs before bringing suit.

21

And make no mistake about it:

That is what

22

precisely happened in this case.

By counsel for

23

Respondents' own admission in the district court, the

24

filing of the lawsuit in 2003, before the withdrawal of
