ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. PAUL D. CLEMENT

9

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

10
11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

In McConnell against FEC this Court upheld

13

Title II's restrictions on electioneering communications

14

by unions and corporations against facial attack.

15

doing so, this Court reviewed a voluminous record and

16

concluded that the vast majority of the ads that had

17

been run in previous cycles and came within the

18

statutory definition could constitutionally be regulated

19

by Congress.

20

overbreadth challenge and upheld the statute on it face.

21

To be sure, the last time this case was before the Court

22

the Court made clear that nothing in McConnell

23

foreclosed an opportunity for as-applied challenges to

24

the statute and the Court remanded the case for that

25

purpose.

In

Accordingly, this Court rejected the

But to be consistent with McConnell's

overbreadth decision, any as-applied challenge cannot

2

have the effect of calling into question a substantial

3

percentage of the statute's applications.

4

district court's decision below has precisely that

5

forbidden effect.

6

Yet the

There is nothing atypical about the three

7

ads that are before this Court.

Indeed, they closely

8

resemble the Jane Doe hypothetical ads that this Court

9

identified at page 127 as the prototype of ads that,

10

although they took the form of issue ads, nonetheless

11

were functionally equivalent to express advocacy.

12
13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe we were wrong last

time.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

15

don't think you were wrong, and I suppose that obviously

16

you thought the rest of the Court was wrong in

17

McConnell, and if the Court wants to reconsider that

18

decision -- I mean, that's an option the Court can take

19

in the appropriate case.

20

I would suggest that this is not the

21

appropriate case for a number of reasons, not the least

22

of which is that I think it was briefed in this case

23

really as something of an afterthought, not as a

24

principal focus of the briefing.

25

this Court, as you well remember, had an unbelievably

In the McConnell case

4

Alderson Reporting Company

exhaustive record before it in making a judgment about

2

the facial constitutionality of the law.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we didn't have a

4

concrete case such as this one, in which the assertions

5

of the other side are very appealing as far as the

6

rights of citizens to band together for an issue ad,

7

even an issue ad that names somebody who's up for

8

election within, within 90 days.

9

appealing case before us.

We didn't that have

Now that we have it before us

10

and now that you tell us that this is a typical case,

11

maybe we were wrong about the overbreadth challenge

12

before.

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, I don't

14

think you were.

15

before you, you had many, many concrete cases before you

16

that are really indistinguishable from this case.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You

How are we supposed

19

to decide whether this case -- if you think it's

20

important to our resolution, how are we supposed to

21

decide whether this particular case is typical or not?

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I guess it's hard

23

for me to say how you would decide whether it's typical.

24

I'm not sure that's the question.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
5

Alderson Reporting Company

I think it's very

hard to determine.

2

determine in the abstract whether its inconsistent with

3

the conclusion in McConnell that a vast majority of the

4

cases would not be covered or if it's inconsistent with

5

it.

6

Therefore, I think it's hard to

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

let me try to come at it this way, which is to say I

8

would have thought that if you're not going to overturn

9

McConnell, you're just going to apply it and say, well,

10

what kind of as-applied challenges are left, I would

11

have thought that what you would have in mind is ads

12

that had an identifiable characteristic that marked them

13

as being outside of the mainstream and somehow different

14

from most of the ads.

15

And so -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That gets back to my

16

same question:

19

How do we tell whether this

GENERAL CLEMENT:

One strong indicator that

23

these are in the mainstream is how close they are to the

24

Jane Doe hypothetical that this Court identified as the

25

prototype of the kind of ads that, although they took
6

the form of issue ads, they looked like issue ads, they

really were indistinguishable from and the functional

equivalent of express advocacy.

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

General Clement, that
They were

There were hundreds.

I

8

mean, as you well remember, there were hundreds of ads

9

in the record.

And this Court was able to draw

10

conclusions about them both by looking at some of the

11

specifics, but also looking at the forest, if you will.

12

One of the things they recognized, for example, is that

13

these ads weren't turning up uniformly wherever issues

14

were being debated.

15

elections, in the close races.

16

These ads turning up in the close
And there was -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the Court

17

in McConnell used the term, as you've used it this

18

morning, "vast majority."

19

a vast majority, so that 30 percent of the ads are going

20

to be outside of that and would be candidates for this

21

as-applied challenge?

22

What is that?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Is 70 percent

No, no, Mr. Chief Justice,

23

because the Court used "vast majority," and I mean, that

24

could mean 70 percent, it could mean 80 percent, it

25

could mean 90 percent.

of the opinion, when it was specifically addressing

2

overbreadth, it made the argument, it made the

3

conclusion, that both in absolute and relative terms

4

this statute was not substantially overbroad.

5

And it seems to me then at a minimum for any

6

as-applied challenge to be consistent with that

7

overbreadth determination, it can't have the effect of

8

opening up the statute wide open such that on a going

9

forward basis the majority, certainly a substantial

10

number, percentage, inconsistent with an overbreadth

11

holding, of the ads that would be run by unions and

12

corporations within the last 60 days of the election

13

would qualify for the exception.

inconsistent with the overbreadth holding.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That just seems

Well, did that statement

refer only to issue ads, or did it refer to all ads?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

It referred to all ads

that would come within the statutory prohibition.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right, and here we are

20

dealing with a subset of all ads and that is issue ads.

21

So that statement doesn't necessarily speak to whether,

22

you know, a vast majority of all issue ads have to be -

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

But with respect,

24

Justice Scalia, there were so many issue ads in the

25

record in McConnell that if issue ads were an
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appropriate category for as-applied challenges, it would

2

have been impossible for this Court to reject the

3

overbreadth burden.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know if that's so.

5

So long as that statement applied to the totality of

6

ads, many of which were ads just directed at defeating

7

particular candidates, I don't see how you can see that

8

we're bound by that statement.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, the

only other obvious candidate that we could carve out

11

would be express advocacy.

didn't engage in express advocacy, this Court still had

no difficulty concluding that the vast majority of them

were within Congress' conception of the purposes of the4

You're using the term "issue ad."

I wouldn't divide it that

way.

I would think there are a lot of express advocacy

I think there are a lot of non-express advocacy

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Scalia, you're use

3

the term "issue ad" as if it's self-defining.

I don't

4

view it that way.

5

to narrow it to grassroots lobbying.

6

there's a problem with the grassroots lobbying argument

7

and that is it was made to this Court in McConnell, and

8

at that time the nature of the argument wasn't, oh,

9

grassroots lobbying, that's a sort of idiosyncratic or

And I mean, even Appellee has tried
Now, of course

10

atypical application that would give rise to a narrow

11

as-applied exception.

12

No, the argument there, and a great

13

illustration is Appellee's national affiliate, National

14

Right to Life.

15

McConnell, they argued about grassroots lobbying and

16

said, boy, this statute applies to grassroots lobbying,

17

therefore it's substantially overbroad.

18

At pages 6 and 7 of the reply brief in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're suggesting

19

the district court decision is not consistent with

20

McConnell.

21

inconsistent with our decision last year that you can

22

have as-applied challenges.

23

we allow this as-applied challenge to go forward that we

24

have to facially strike down the section.

25

But it seems that your approach today is

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You're suggesting that if

Oh, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm

10
Alderson Reporting Company

not saying that.

2

challenges are created equal.

3

My point is that not all as-applied

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So tell me what one,

4

an ad that would succeed in an as-applied challenge

5

looks like, or what the standard would be that we would

6

apply in a way that you think would not call into

7

question the decision in McConnell about Section 203?

8
9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, let me give you a

couple of as -- I mean, look, my job is to defend the

10

constitutionality of the statute on its face and as

11

applied.

12

as-applied challenges would necessarily success or I

13

wouldn't be up here trying to make some argument in

14

defense of the statute.

So I'm not suggesting that any of these

15

But let me give you -

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What you're saying,

17

though, is if this as-applied challenge succeeds you're

18

saying the only way we can do that is if we think that

19

the statute is facially unconstitutional.

20

trying to see if there's a way of -

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm just

Sure.
-- approaching this

23

as-applied challenge in a way that doesn't require us to

to set up a - a - a - a separate PAC that, that would

a separate segregated fund.

5

they didn't have one.

6

vis a vis what it would cost to fund these ads.

that itself is clearly a conscious decision, because if

That's the time in which you -- in which
So the fact that the filibuster

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

tend to focus on issues in the context of an election.

2

But I think the record in this case does not bear out

3

the conclusion that people only care about them at those

4

times or that groups don't bother running ads at other

5

times.

6

record reflects that a number of groups, not Appellee,

7

but a number of groups had issue ads addressing the

8

filibuster issue.

9

me is if you look at joint appendix 45 and 46 for the

examples they were able to do it in terms of tag line,

12

those same ads which would capture the issue, then they

13

wouldn't even have come within the statute.

14

illustrate both that this is an issue that drew enough

15

public interest to generate ads at different time

16

periods, not just in the reelection context, and even

17

when did it that, it was possible to engage on the issue

without coming within the confines of the statute.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

issues -- instances in the political process, do you

think, in which the public runs an ad against a, a

24

candidate knowing the candidate is probably going to win

25

anyway, he or she is from a safe district, or it's very
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difficult.

But they want to run the ad anyway in order

2

to affect his conduct or her conduct once they're

3

reelected, so that they'll take a different position, a

4

second look.

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Kennedy -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -- it seems to me

7

logically that's possible.

8

if that happens very often.

9

I just don't know if that,

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Kennedy, it's

10

certainly possible.

11

And the reason I say that is just to go back to the

12

record in McConnell, the one thing the record there made

13

pretty clear is when you got to the period 60 days

14

before the election, these ads were not being ran in a

15

way that would have some random distribution that you

16

might expect if they were just interested in the issues

17

or just interested uniformly in all reelections.

18

ads were really concentrated in the close districts.

19

mean one of the lines that stick out in my mind from the

20

record is in trying to fund money for these so-called

21

issue ads, the Club for Growth executives said "we need

22

money for these issue ads because they make all the

23

difference in close elections."

24
25

I don't think it's common, though.

upheld on its face.

24

we're not just interested in this issue in the abstract,

25

and we're not running this issue just because there's a

this ad because it's a pretty effective vehicle both to

don't succeed on that maybe we'll convince him to change

his mind.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You can't tell which of the

two they had in mind.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And why do you

Well -- I don't know, the

14

fact that by the time they ran these ads Senator

15

Feingold voted 20 times out of 20 to filibuster suggests

16

to me that they probably concluded that the best to get

a Wisconsin Senator who wouldn't filibuster was to

change senators not to change to change Senator

First of all, I'd like to, I think just with respect

12

correct a premise of one of Justice Scalia's questions.

13

Then I would like to address the two questions that I

14

think I heard the Chief Justice ask, which is how do we

15

know that the this is an atypical ad, and what would the

16

standard -- what standard would a court apply in

17

adjudicating as-applied challenges?

18

And then finally, assuming there's time

19

permitting I'd like to address the question of why we

20

shouldn't revisit McConnell which I think was posed both

21

by the Chief Justice and by Justice Scalia.

22

First, as to the premise, Justice Scalia,

23

and it relates to what the predicate was of the now

24

famous vast majority reference.

25

it's entirely clear from this Court's opinion and I

I'm quoting from -

20
Alderson Reporting Company

believe it's on page 207 that the referent was issue

2

ads.

3

percentage of issue ads that clearly identified a

4

candidate and were aired during those relatively brief

5

pre-election time spans but had no electioneering

6

purpose is a matter of dispute between the parties and

7

among the judges on the district court.

8

the "vast majority" of ads clearly had such a purpose.

9
10
11

In fact, what this Court said was the precise

Chief Justice ROBERTS:

your test, if it has any electioneering purpose?
MR. WAXMAN:

We think the test is whether or

12

not it is as this Court indicated, I think, whether it's

13

the functional equivalent of express advocacy.

14

doesn't use the magic words but does it have the same

15

effect, that is, the test that this Court should -- not

16

this Court, a district court adjudicating an as-applied

17

challenge that is based on the content of the ad not the

18

sort of as-applied challenge brought in MCFL or Brown

19

versus the Socialist Workers Parties that relate to the

20

nature of the speaker, but one that's based on the

21

content requires the challenger to show okay, in a

22

context of a statute that is facially valid and can

23

constitutionally be applied to the vast majority of ads

24

that are covered by the definition of electioneering

25

communications, he needs to come in and show that with

It

1

respect to this ad, it has characteristics such that no

2

reasonable voter could view it as promoting, attacking,

3

supporting or opposing a candidate.

4

Chief Justice ROBERTS:

Do we, do we usually

5

place the burden when we're applying strict scrutiny

6

under the First Amendment on the challenger to prove

7

that they're allowed to speak, as opposed to the

8

Government to prove -- to carry the burden that they can

9

censor the speech?

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, you -- I think the rule

11

is quite clear that you never do that.

12

scrutiny clearly applies here.

13

a -- the application of a statute that has already been

14

upheld as facially constitutional in the vast majority

15

of applications, the Government doesn't have the burden

16

of reconvincing the district court the -- what the -

17

the very things that the Supreme Court has already

18

decided.

MR. WAXMAN:

It's -- well, we would have an

But that statement and a

statement that follows shortly after it on the following

applying the strictest possible scrutiny, this law was

12

very narrowly tailored.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the test as to any ad is

whether any reasonable person could view the ad as -- as

an electioneering ad?

3

understood to the contrary, and so they never utter

4

those words.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They are

I think it's an

6

important part of their exercise of First Amendment

7

rights to petition their senators and congressmen, and

8

to urge others to -- as in these ads -- contact your

9

senators, contact your congressmen.

Just because the

10

ACLU doesn't do that doesn't seem particularly pertinent

11

to me.

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, though, I mean, I think

13

it does demonstrate a few things.

14

entirely possible, as this Court reiterated in

15

McConnell, for the exact same message or an equally

16

effective message to be given at any particular time.

17

If the ACLU or the National Rifle Association or any of

18

the other groups that never wants to actually bring an

19

as-applied challenge but always wants to say oh no, no,

20

no, this is horrible, wants to run an ad, as this

21

Court has -- they can establish a separate segregated

fund.

that's impractical or impossible, maybe they get an

MR. BOPP:

10

No, but I don't -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then if your advertisement

assume that no one in Wisconsin knows what the senator

13

No, that we be allowed to speak

MR. BOPP:

JUSTICE BREYER:

We've heard

Yes, but you said And what happened before -

5

either you can distinguish this, which I don't see how

6

frankly, or you're back into the chain, and if you want

7

to say one more thing about the chain, I didn't draw it

8

to the final ending there, if I take most of the ads -

9

and that's what that Kollar-Kotelly opinion is about.

10

That's what that 1,000-page record is about.

That's

11

what the 10,000 pages of testimony were about.

12

what McCain-Feingold was about, and all those witnesses.

13

They said in today's world these are the kinds of ads

14

people run just to defeat people.

15

moreover, most of the campaign money goes on them.

16

then they said, moreover, if you let corporations and

contribute to the campaign.

out before was, if you're prepared to say the

corporations and unions buy these kinds of ads, well,

22

how could it be constitutional to have a statute that

forbids them to contribute directly to the candidate,

24

something that's been in existence only since I guess

25

1904?

That's

And then they said,
And

And the only thing I left

But how could that be constitutional if they can

Alderson Reporting Company

just give this money directly?

2

same money to the candidate?

3

MR. BOPP:

Why can't they give this

Well, because of your decision in

4

Beaumont, which creates a distinction between

5

contributions and independent speech, and this is

6

independent speech.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's pretty easy to tell

8

whether you're giving money to the money to the

9

candidate or not, isn't it?

10

MR. BOPP:

Very readily.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a fairly bright line

12

that you don't have to worry about stepping over the

13

wrong side of it.

14

MR. BOPP:

That's right.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whereas this one,

16

especially if you adopt a context determination that

17

requires a 1,000-page district court opinion, who knows.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that right?

I mean,

19

1,000 is what we have here, is we happen to have three

20

criteria, absolutely clear:

21

Does it run within 30 or 60 days before the election?

22

And is it targeted to an electorate?

23

Does it mix the candidate?

Now, that's clear.

Now, if you're prepared to say that's

24

unclear, I don't understand it, you don't need a

25

1,000-page record about that.

All you need is a record

where you have your organization to come in and show how

yours is significant different from the mine run of

The problem is you're not giving

court judges that there were genuine issue ads.

that our part -- our system of self government is based

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Bopp, your

argument that McConnell's facial holding should be

12

you have at least 61 page arguing that your as-applied

13

challenge can succeed without overturning McConnell's

position?

15

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

I take it

Yes, we have, which would

16

require the adoption of a reasonably ascertainable test,

17

one that people would not be subject to three years of

18

litigation, scorched earth litigation tactics, intrusive

discovery into every aspect of their organization for

objective and be able to be implemented on short notice,

because things pop up, like the filibuster of a Supreme

What's yours?

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Their
Do you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have a clear one that does not invalidate the whole

2

statute?

3

MR. BOPP:

Well, based on their evidence in

4

McConnell and these grassroots, and these genuine issue

5

ads, I think there are three key or essential features

6

of those ads that we are satisfied would protect

7

grassroots lobbying and genuine issue ads.

8

based upon the content of the communication, they focus

9

on a current legislative matter, take a position on it,

The first is

10

urge people to contact them, their congressmen and

11

senators, to take a particular action or position.

12

Secondly -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That says what's good.

14

What is your test for what's bad?

15

MR. BOPP:

Second, the ads do not mention an

16

election, candidacy, political party, challenger, or the

17

official character, qualifications, or fitness for

18

office.

19

that these ads not, as Buckley said -- and of course

20

McConnell was litigated under Buckley -- is that they

21

were not unambiguously candidate- related.

22
23
24
25

That was the key link the district court found,

JUSTICE SOUTER:
one.

That's -- give us the third

I want to go back to MR. BOPP:

The third one is, as long as the

ad meets this pattern, that the fact that the ad -- ours
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

does not -- but the fact that the ad mentions the name,

2

the position of a public official on an issue and

3

praises or criticizes him or her for that does not

4

affect its genuineness.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

May I go back to

6

your second criterion?

It seems to me your second

7

criterion is simply the injection of magic words back

8

again.

9

words it's okay.

You're saying if we don't use certain magic

10

That's a magic words test.

You're not looking for any particular word.

11

You're looking for the meaning and breadth of the, of

12

the item.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but you said if we

14

don't mention the election and the candidacy of this

15

person for this election, that is one of the

16

sufficient -- one of the conditions with the other three

17

which would be sufficient to justify the, on First

18

Amendment grounds, justify running the ad.

19

to me simply to be reinjecting magic words in a negative

20

form.

21

MR. BOPP:

That seems

Well, in a much more expansive

22

and comprehensive test which looks to three features of

23

time.

25

words, what are they saying?

But in any event, you look at the words all the

we look just at the words?

Well, relevant context, that

15

there is an election upcoming, so it's within 60 days.

16

The person's a candidate.

17

that matter, whether the is a current Legislative Branch

18

matter or likely to arise in the near future.

19

These are relevant -- and for

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Bopp, you do not have

20

to establish, do you, that the test you propose will get

21

at every bad ad, that it will be sure to get at every ad

22

that is not a genuine issue ad?

23

Is that the burden on you?

24

MR. BOPP:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.
I thought when we're

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

dealing with the first amendment we give wide scope to

2

the principle that it is, it is better to allow, you

3

know, some bad speech than it is, in the effort to get

4

rid of that bad speech, to eliminate any good speech

5

that is justified.

6

So even if there is something that might

7

sneak through that does achieve what Congress didn't

8

want to achieve, the answer in the First Amendment is

9

that's too bad.

There's some stuff you just can't get

10

at.

There's a lot of bad speech that is allowed all the

11

time because you can't get at it without suppressing the

12

good speech.

13

MR. BOPP:

I think that's the standard.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

In fact this isn't the

15

First Amendment totally on one side.

16

this a case where the courts held that there are very

17

significant constitutional interests on both sides of

18

the equation, which is what makes this kind of thing

19

difficult.

20

Isn't this, isn't

Isn't that so?
MR. BOPP:

And so giving meaning to one side

21

was upholding it facially.

22

meaning to the other side, which is genuine issue ads

23

that are to be protected as applied.

24
25

Now your job is to give

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm just suggesting why a

pure First Amendment test doesn't necessarily answer the
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question and why we've upheld McCain-Feingold.

2

MR. BOPP:

But even if you use balancing,

3

you've already used it.

4

because you said the vast majority were shams.

5

same time, you said there were genuine issue ads.

6

reserved the question of whether or not the interest is

7

sufficient, the governmental interest is sufficient, to

8

prohibit genuine issue ads in footnote 88.

9

they refuse to give the test.

10

You upheld it on its face,
At the
You

You know,

They refuse to tell us

what is the standard.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But your test, as I

12

understand it, is the test to determine whether you fall

13

within this sort of heartland of the statute which we

14

upheld on facial challenge.

15

exclusion from the facial rule; isn't that correct?

16

That's -- that was why you were giving the answer to

17

Justice Scalia that you gave?

18

MR. BOPP:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yours is a test where

I did What you're saying:

I have

20

three criteria and if I satisfy those criteria, then

21

the, then the facial validity of the statute is not an

22

answer to my claim.

23

saying.

That's basically what you're

24

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And of course, if you

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

success in that you're saying, okay, the Government then

2

has the burden of satisfying strict scrutiny.

3

the reason for your test, isn't it, to get you out of

4

McCain-Feingold -- I mean, to get you out of the holding

5

in McConnell?

6
7

MR. BOPP:

We're not trying to get out of

the holding in McConnell.

8
9

That's

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure.

You're saying this

is an applied challenge which is different in some

10

relevant respects, so that the facial holding in

11

McConnell shouldn't apply to us, it shouldn't bar,

12

shouldn't justify the Government barring our ad.

13

that your logic?

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't

You could say yes to that,

I think.

16

MR. BOPP:

17

But the -- we're trying to -- actually -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

that, I know.

Thank you.

But that's your first step.

MR. BOPP:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22
23

You want to go further than

No, our first That's what you were

getting at.
MR. BOPP:

Our first step is we want to give

24

meaning to the promise of McConnell that there were

25

genuine issue ads that could be protected by as-applied
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

challenge.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

The way to do that is say,

3

there's something different about my case from the case

4

which was taken as typical in upholding statute against

5

facial challenge.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He fears the Greeks even

when they bear gifts.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. BOPP:

Yes, we have.

We have

10

11

the genuine issue ads this Government presented to this

12

Court and you relied upon that representation.

13

demonstrated why and their experts have agreed that the

15

than our ad.

say it doesn't matter if you name a candidate or not,

any genuine issue, any ad, can influence an election if

22

you mention an issue.

23

I mean, in McConnell the Government

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now their experts

But your, your principle

24

concern at this point is getting yourself out from the

25

holding of McConnell, in other words, by saying we have
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a case which was not the typical case in McConnell,

2

that's why it's an as-applied challenge and that's why

3

this is a new ball game.

4

argument for that in criticizing the Government's

5

position is that the Government didn't use to say that

6

there's something significant or something insignificant

7

about naming the candidate, and now they do.

8
9

And I take it your principle

That it seems to me -- if I understand your
argument -- goes back to this context argument or not.

question?

Congress to pass a statute that prohibits your using

MR. BOPP:

Yes.

MR. BOPP:

MR. BOPP:

You're talking about the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You know, perhaps.

General Clement, you have two minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN.

PAUL D. CLEMENT

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION

24
25

Thank you, Mr. Bopp.

GENERAL CLEMENT:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Just a few points in rebuttal.
55
Alderson Reporting Company

First, I would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

like to stress the virtue of as-applied challenges.

2

might wonder in the abstract, wasn't there a problem

3

with the statute that applies to a group running a

4

series of ads and then one of them falls in the period.

5

But then you look at an as-applied challenge and you see

6

that didn't happen here.

7

This issue was percolating since March of 2003.

8

ads were run some 500 days after the first filibuster

9

vote.

In fact, the opposite did.
These

Both before and after Senator Feingold's

10

reelection cycle, they addressed this -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does that go to their

12

meaning or to the intent of -- is that what governs?

13

It's the intent of the person who puts it on?

14

-- I thought you were focusing on the meaning of it,

15

what it conveys to the public.

16

You

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I thought

Justice Scalia, if you're

17

looking for an as-applied challenge that's going to

18

identify a genuine issue ad, I would think that it would

19

go somewhat to intent.

20

reason that -

21

And I would think the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's new to me.

I

22

thought you were asking us to look at the meaning.

23

does it mean to the -

24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No.

What

Our position is

slightly different than intervenors on that point.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I think the reason that the series of ads hypothetical

2

is beguiling is because it suggests that because they

3

run the same issue ad all the time, they must be

4

interested in the issue, not the election, and the

5

opposite is true here.

6

They run ads about this issue, they run -

7

they have communications about this issue outside of the

8

period of Senator Feingold's reelection.

9

rely on broadcast ads.

They don't

They rely on e-alerts when it's

10

not during the election cycle.

11

election cycle, all of a sudden they start running

12

broadcast ads.

13

suggests.

14

influence the election, not an intent to engage on the

15

issue.

16

But when it's during the

And I think it shows what the timing

The timing here suggests an intent to

JUSTICE ALITO:

How long will the blackout

17

period be during the upcoming year for the presidential

18

candidates?

19

MR. BOPP:

Well, I think that in various

20

places it will be 30 days before the primary and then

21

obviously 60 days before the general.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It could be as long as 200

days; isn't that correct.
MR. BOPP:

Not in any one place.

And if

there's an argument, though, that because of the way the
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

various broadcast media affect Manchester, New

2

Hampshire, that's a great as-applied challenge.

3

virtue of as-applied challenges are that you get a

4

concrete record and you don't have to speculate, wow,

5

you know, is it possible to address the filibuster -

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

You have to speculate

before you try to put the ad on.

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, you don't.
You have to speculate

10

whether the Court is going to say well, since you're in

11

the zone of three different radio stations or television

12

stations, a different rule applies.

13

who wants to speak have to speculate, roll the dice?

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Doesn't the person

No, they don't, Justice

15

Scalia, and one of the arguments that's made to try to

16

suggest that there should be a reconsideration of

17

McConnell is, as-applied checks don't work.

18

say that?

19

there were preliminary injunction proceedings that were

20

completed before the blackout period began.

21

case, bring your preliminary injunction if you have a

22

question.

23

How can you

In the two cases that have been brought,

So in that

But the virtue of as-applied challenges, and

24

the last thing I'll say, is the virtue of as-applied

25

challenges, they're not all created equal.
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Just because

Official - Subject to Final Review

this as-applied challenge fails doesn't mean the statute

2

isn't open to them.
