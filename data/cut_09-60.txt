Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder.

Mr. Srinivasan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Long-time lawful permanent resident aliens

12

with two convictions for minor drug possession offenses

13

are subject to removal from the United States, but they

14

are not categorically ineligible to seek discretionary

15

relief from removal from the Attorney General based on

16

their connections and deep family ties to the country.

17

Categorical ineligibility for discretionary relief

18

arises under the Immigration and Nationality Act when a

19

permanent resident has been, quote, "convicted of an

20

aggravated felony," close quote, with the relevant

21

category here permanent residents who have been, quote,

22

"convicted of a felony punishable under the Controlled

23

Substances Act," close quote.

24
25

Individuals, such as Petitioner, who have
been convicted of drug possession, but as to whom there
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has been no finding of recidivism, have been convicted

2

of a misdemeanor punishable under the Controlled

3

Substances Act rather than a felony.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Srinivasan, as a

5

threshold question, is there a mootness problem here,

6

because, as I understand it, the Petitioner came back to

7

the country illegally and committed another minor crime?

8

But his coming back illegally and being turned away

9

again, as I understand the law, means that he cannot get

10
11

any dispensation as a result of the illegal entry.
So even if we were to hold in your favor

12

now, I take it that he could not -- he would not have

13

any hope of getting any cancellation of removal or any

14

other dispensation.

15

Is that so?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's not correct,

16

Justice Ginsburg, in our view.

17

notable, doesn't make a mootness argument.

18

reason they don't is that the -- in Lopez, this Court

19

understood that the initial removal doesn't annul the

20

ability of an individual to get cancellation.

21

as Your Honor correctly observes, the question would be

22

whether the reentry has an effect on the cancellation

23

and the eligibility for cancellation.

24

because Petitioner was removed again by reinstatement of

25

the original removal order.

And the government, it's
And I think the

And so,

And it does not

And so, if there's an
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

argument that the initial removal order wasn't good

2

because cancellation should have been granted, that also

3

carries through to the reinstatement.

4

And as a consequence of that procedural

5

context, there is no mootness argument and I think

6

that's why the government doesn't make -- doesn't take

7

that position.

8

So the question before the Court --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I -- I'm not sure I

10

understand what you're saying.

11

reentry was not illegal because his removal was illegal?

12

Is that what you are saying?

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

You're saying that his

No, it's not that his

14

reentry wasn't illegal.

15

again removed, that the -- the way that that was

16

accomplished was by reinstatement of the original

17

removal order.

It's that when he was then

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I see.

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And so, if the original

20

removal order would have been extinguished by a grant of

21

the cancellation order, then that carries forward to the

22

reinstatement of the original removal -- removal order

23

as well.

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But -- but does -Nothing additional happens

5
Alderson Reporting Company

because of the reentry.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But does it make the --

the second unlawful entry now lawful?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It doesn't make the --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought -- I thought

6

it's a separate offense to enter, to reenter improperly,

7

and -- and that stays no matter, isn't that correct,

8

regardless of the correctness of the prior removal

9

order?

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It does, Justice Kennedy -Or am I wrong?
-- but I think -- I think

13

the way that gets taken into account is it would be one

14

of the discretionary considerations that the Attorney

15

General could take into account in determining whether

16

to grant discretionary relief in the same way that the

17

original conviction for drug possession could be taken

18

into account.

19

Our position --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I -- I -- I think also in

20

the picture is that he never contested removability.

21

The only thing was the grace:

22

for discretionary relief by the Attorney General?

23

the -- the removal order itself, I take it, would stand.

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Would -- would he qualify
So

The removal order would

stand, but if cancellation were granted, then he
6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

couldn't be removed pursuant to that removal order,

2

because the -- the effect of granting cancellation would

3

be that he's no longer removable.

4

discretionary relief that enables him to stay in the

5

country.

6

question is correct, that we don't contest removability.

7

He was removable because of his drug possession -- drug

8

possession conviction.

9

He gets favorable

And I think the predicate of Your Honor's

The question is whether he retains

10

eligibility to seek a favorable exercise of relief from

11

the Attorney General based on affirmative equities in

12

his -- in his favor, such as his deep family ties to the

13

country, the presence of United States citizen children

14

here, his lack of connections to the country to which he

15

would be removed, his employment history, and

16

considerations of that variety.

17

And the question before the Court is whether

18

he and other individuals who are similarly situated

19

should have an opportunity to make that case to the

20

Attorney General.

21

whether the Attorney General is in a -- is in a position

22

to grant him a favorable exercise of discretion.

23

He is removable.

The question is

And we think the Attorney General is,

24

because in order to be categorically ineligible for

25

discretionary relief from removal, a permanent resident

What elements would a

State conviction have to contain to qualify as a finding

MR. SRINIVASAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What elements?
Yes.

What would have

you to recognize, under your argument, that it would

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Sotomayor, at the

16

very least what would have had to have happened is that

17

he would have had to have been found to be a recidivist

18

under a State provision that attaches sentencing

19

consequences to being found to have been a recidivist.

offense to the Federal offense of recidivist possession.

A felony

Isn't the -That didn't happen in the

1

State court.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't the crux of your argument

3

that for present purposes the term "conviction" must

4

include a determination of recidivism?

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

For present purposes,

6

that's correct.

And Justice Alito, I think it's

7

important to understand -- and this goes to the second

8

response to your question, Justice Scalia -- that the

9

statute, the Immigration and Nationality Act, defines

10

"conviction" in a particular way.

11

"conviction" as "a formal judgment of guilt ... entered by

12

a court."

13

It defines

As Your Honor's opinion for the Court in

14

Deal v. United States understood, statutes could define

15

convictions in one of two ways:

16

conviction as a finding of guilty, or it could define a

17

conviction as the formal judgment based on that finding.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

It could define a

Well, what would you say -Here we have the latter.
What do you say about

21

21 U.S.C. section 851, the Federal recidivism provision,

22

which says:

23

under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment

24

by reason of one or more prior convictions."

25

"No person who stands convicted of an offense

So under that statute, the conviction does not
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

include the recidivism determination.

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Under -Isn't that right?
Under that statute --

5

different statutes conceive of it different ways, but

6

the applicable definition of "conviction" here, because

7

we're talking about an immigration consequence, is

8

the definition of "conviction" under the Immigration and

9

Nationality Act.

And that definition is set forth at

10

page 2a of the appendix to our brief, the blue brief,

11

the opening brief.

12

and it says that:

13

respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the

14

alien entered by a court."

And it's 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(48)(A),
"The term 'conviction' means, with

15

And so, here you have "a formal judgment of

16

guilt" as the operative definition of a conviction, and

17

that formal judgment of guilt includes both the

18

adjudication of guilt and the sentence.

19

important point to bear in mind is that at the time that

20

the conviction, as defined by the Immigration and

21

Nationality Act, is entered, we know whether the person

22

has been found to have been a recidivist.

23

the adjudication of guilt has happened, the sentence has

24

been imposed, and we know whether a finding of recidivism

25

has been made.

And so the

At that point,

In the absence of such a finding, the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

maximum sentence they could attach under Federal law,

2

Justice Scalia, is a misdemeanor sentence of 1 year of

3

imprisonment.

4

A felony sentence is not on the table, and

5

if the maximum sentence to which a person is subject is

6

a misdemeanor sentence, the person has been -- has been

7

convicted of a misdemeanor; they haven't been convicted

8

of a felony.

9

And that -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's assume we're not

10

talking about immigration consequences.

11

assume we're talking about an American citizen who has

12

committed a -- a misdemeanor drug offense.

13

brought up under the Controlled Substances Act, even

14

though he wasn't found to have been a recidivist by the

15

State conviction, couldn't he be prosecuted under the

16

Controlled Substances Act for a felony because in fact

17

he is a recidivist?

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Oh, sure.

think -- I think that confuses two things.

In that

situation, the second proceeding is in Federal court --

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- and in that Federal court

23

proceeding, you can take account of the prior State court

24

conviction, but in that second proceeding, the fact that

25

he was convicted previously in State court would have to

Alderson Reporting Company

recidivism, the Federal defendant wouldn't be subject to

6

That's the relevant

He would only be subject to a

No, but -- the crucial word

7

here is "punishable" as a felony under the Controlled

8

Substances Act.

9

And the fact is if indeed he's a

10

felony.

11

court would have to find the recidivism, but -- but

12

still he would be punishable as a recidivist.

Now, you're quite correct that the Federal

that a person commits recidivist possession when they

commit possession and they have a prior conviction.

20

possession, and if they were charged and found to have

It is in those five States,

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Kennedy, but I don't think that should give the

2

Court a great deal of pause, for the following two

3

reasons.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

In my

5

hypothetical, what would happen if -- if there was a

6

deportation proceeding?

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

What would happen is this:

8

The person would not be categorically ineligible for

9

discretionary relief.

10
11
12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because there is no

recidivist finding.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

They wouldn't have been

13

convicted of recidivist possession.

14

to note, Justice Kennedy, that doesn't mean that those

15

prior convictions don't enter into the picture at all.

16

They do, because, in the exercise of discretion by the

17

Attorney General, the Attorney General can take into

18

account any prior convictions, including those that

19

don't render somebody categorically ineligible.

20

But it's important

All we're talking about here is whether the

21

person has a chance to make a discretionary case.

22

do have that chance in Your Honor's hypothetical, but

23

those convictions would be taken into account.

24
25

They

Now, I want to point out, though, that there's
another reason that I think the fact that in that
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

hypothetical it wouldn't render the defendant

2

categorically ineligible for discretionary relief

3

shouldn't give the Court a great deal of pause.

4

that's because the relevant category of aggravated

5

felony that we're talking about here is illicit

6

trafficking in a controlled substance.

7

category that's outlined by the statute.

That's the

Now, with respect to that category, every

8
9

And

State has trafficking laws.

Every State punishes drug

10

trafficking.

So every State's offenses do count for

11

purposes of this category of aggravated felony.

12

we're -- that's the iceberg.

13

recidivist possession, which is a subset of illicit

14

trafficking in a controlled substance.

15

to that tip, Federal convictions for recidivist possession

16

still do count, so we have those.

The tip of the iceberg is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

When

Now, with respect

With respect to the State -No, but the State

18

prosecutors often prosecute when they have a recidivist

19

provision under that, rather than the much more difficult

20

illicit trafficking crime.

21

go to jail for a certain amount of years for a

22

recidivist possession, that's easier to show than illicit

23

trafficking.

24
25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I mean, if you're going to

Well, sure, but if a

State -- two responses, Mr. Chief Justice:

18
Alderson Reporting Company

If a State

Official

1

prosecutor does prosecute under an available recidivist

2

possession offense, then that would count because the

3

State prosecutor would have brought the charge, the

4

finding by hypothesis would have been made.

5

be felony recidivist possession under Federal law, and

6

there would be categorical ineligibility.

7

That would

Now, I think what may be -- what may be sort

8

of lurking beneath Your Honor's question is the

9

recognition that the Federal consequences of a State

10

conviction are going to turn on State prosecutorial

11

decisions.

12

any scheme in which Federal immigration consequences

13

turns on what happens in State court, and this Court's

14

decision in Lopez recognizes that.

15

That's true.

But that's a fixed feature of

For example, States -- several States don't

16

have a Federal offense of possession with intent to

17

distribute drugs.

18

States, some States, have instead is possession with a

I see no rule absolute how you treat

really happens under this statute in the world.

Well -- well, with respect,

Justice Breyer, I don't think that's the inquiry that's

conviction.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you say that it says

15

"elements."

I don't see any of our cases that say

16

could do is look to the conduct that's likely to be at

issue under these State words, and if in fact it's

regular that the State does punish people for more than

10

point out to the Court that the Court dealt with that

sort of situation in the four corners of Lopez itself

in the Federal system.

5

have an individual who is convicted of possession, and

6

then the fact that they had a prior conviction could

7

have some role in the -- for example, in the

8

presentencing report.

9

In the Federal system, you could

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what's missing there?

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

You don't have -What is the difference

12

between that and -- and a situation where, just because

13

of the vagary of State law, recidivism is something that

14

has to be proven in order to bring the offense into the

15

-- into the felony level?

16

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Two things are

17

missing, Justice Alito:

First, you don't have a formal

18

judgment of guilt entered by the court, which is what

19

a conviction requires.

20

having a formal judgment of guilt is that the statutory

21

maximum penalty isn't raised.

22

relevant here is that when you have a finding of -- a

23

formal judgment of guilt of recidivism in the Federal

24

system, which happens when the prosecutor brings a

25

charge and the court makes the finding at sentencing,

And the consequence of not

And I think what's

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the maximum sentence that could be imposed against the

2

defendant is raised from a misdemeanor sentence to a

3

felony sentence.

4

But that doesn't happen in a situation in

5

which the fact of a prior conviction is taken into

6

account, for example, under a presentencing report.

7

doesn't raise the statutory maximum, and there's no

8

formal judgment entered based on that determination by

9

the court.

10

It

And so that's the distinction.
And I think the relevant way to look at it

11

is you take account of what would happen in the Federal

12

system and you ask:

13

the Federal system of rendering somebody guilty of the

14

felony of recidivist possession as opposed to the

15

misdemeanor of simple possession?

16

the Federal system, and by parity of reasoning it also

17

would not have that consequence in the State system.

18

Would it have the consequence in

JUSTICE ALITO:

And it wouldn't in

That seems to be a totally

19

formalistic distinction that's based on the vagaries of

20

State law.

21

someone who is found by a court under a State recidivism

22

provision to have -- to be eligible for an increased

23

punishment as a result of that finding and someone who

24

is found by a court in the context of sentencing,

25

discretionary sentencing, to have a felony possession,

What -- what is the difference between

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to have a prior -- a prior conviction and receives an

2

increased sentence as a result of that?

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5
6

Well -What is the -- is there any

functional difference between those two situations?
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think there is,

7

Justice Alito, and let me just say as a preliminary

8

matter it's not based on the vagaries of State law,

9

because it's -- I'm applying the same analysis to State

10
11

convictions as I do to -- to Federal convictions.
But one way to look at it is to ask, suppose

12

that a State or even Federal law made it salient for

13

sentencing purposes whether somebody intended to

14

distribute when they possessed.

15

drug possession.

16

intent to distribute, but they're not charged with that

17

offense; they're charged with drug possession.

18

then sentencing somehow makes it salient, not for

19

purposes of raising the statutory maximum, but just for

20

purposes of sentencing within the range whether the

21

person intended to distribute.

They were convicted of

There is an offense of possession with

And

22

I don't think anybody would say that the

23

individual was convicted of the felony of possession

24

with intent to distribute because the -- the judge in

25

sentencing took into account an intent to distribute
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in some way under a sentencing scheme.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But does it matter in that

3

situation that that's an element, that has to be an

4

element of the offense?

5

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It has to be a sentencing

6

factor that raises the statutory maximum.

And the

7

reason that matters is that under this statute, the

8

person has to have been convicted of a felony, and the

9

only way they're convicted of a felony is the offense

10

of which they are convicted can lead to a felony

11

sentence.

12

And the sentencing factor in this case of

13

recidivism is necessary in order to give rise to a

14

Federal sentence.

15

person has been convicted of a misdemeanor, because the

16

maximum sentence they can receive is a misdemeanor

17

sentence of 1 year of imprisonment.

question?

there might be.

I want to know what words in the statute say there -- or

what words in a case say go look to some other thing

interpreting the statutory language that the State's

judgment about how an offense is punished does not

control.

It's certainly

With respect, we disagree

6

because Congress made different judgments in the

immigration context and in the criminal context.

8

Immigration is very different from criminal proceedings.

9

This Court has said that on numerous occasions the

10

rights in terms of due process and counsel and the like

11

are very different.

12

And in immigration, Congress made a

13

categorical judgment that individuals who have been

14

convicted of conduct should all be treated the same and

15

that they all should be removed from the United States

16

and should be -- not be able to get discretionary

relief.

19

Congress made a judgment that those procedures which have

criminal consequences and already are individualized, that

there would be this notice provision.

Congress did not apply anywhere in the immigration laws.

have gotten the notice and the opportunity to knock it

16

offense in the State court.

17

He doesn't -- didn't get that in the State

MS. SAHARSKY:

That's right.

And that's

18

because Congress made the decision to have those types

19

of notice procedures in criminal proceedings, but they

20

are not applicable by their terms anywhere in the

21

immigration laws.

22

understand the hypotheticals that you and Justice

23

24

prosecution and the person has sought to challenge the

25

validity of his conviction and it has been proven to be

2

question whether that conviction could be used in the

3

immigration proceedings.

4

that when a conviction has been vacated, it doesn't

count as a conviction under the immigration proceedings.

6

There is an entire body of law

So the answer is if it is a person in State

use whatever procedures are available for challenging

that.

MS. SAHARSKY:

With respect, I think that

our position is entirely consistent and, in fact,
43
Alderson Reporting Company

follows from Lopez and Nijhawan and is consistent with

2

the Court's modified categorical approach.

3

So, let me just talk about Lopez and

4

Nijhawan, because I want to make sure there's not any

5

confusion about that.

6

question here about whether the State offense -- and a

7

State offense is made up of here drug possession;

8

recidivism isn't something that you're convicted of,

9

it's a sentencing factor.

10

Lopez said that we have a

You look at the State offense and you see

11

does it correspond to a Federal offense?

12

There is State drug possession; there is Federal drug

13

possession.

14

this Court said in Lopez that that's an important

15

question because we care about what Congress thought,

16

which is how is this offense punishable under Federal

17

law.

18

Here it does.

And then you ask another question.

And

This is a two-part inquiry where the first

19

part, the offense elements, does need to be established

20

in State court, and the second part, which goes to how

21

it is punishable, does not need to be established in

22

State court.

23

recognized in its opinion under Nijhawan --

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MS. SAHARSKY:

And that's exactly what the Court

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

1

Under the Federal statute,

2

it's only punishable on -- for recidivism purposes if the

3

prior conviction was valid, because, as Justice Ginsburg

4

pointed out, the statute permits a defendant to object.

5

Who has the burden of proof of proving validity is irrelevant.

6

It's not punishable as recidivism unless the prior conviction

7

was valid, constitutionally valid.

What the Court said in Lopez in saying, in

19

footnote 6, that recidivist possession counts as

20

punishable under the CSA, it pointed to section 844,

21

which defines the penalties available and not anything

22

about procedures.

23

And even conviction --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you would

24

suggest, then, that even if a prior State court

25

conviction was secured without the advice of counsel,
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that would qualify as a Federal offense of recidivism.

2

So let's assume this case, that in neither the

3

conviction for the one marijuana stick or the conviction

4

for the one sleeping pill, that if those convictions

5

were secured without the advice of counsel, that would

6

be enough to qualify him as a recidivist under the

7

Federal law.

8

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, that -- that raises a

9

very narrow question that, so far as we are aware, has

10

never been addressed in the immigration context, which

11

is whether there could be a proceeding to challenge the

12

narrow question of a conviction obtained in the complete

13

absence of counsel.

14

This Court said in Custis that there -- even

15

though there is a very broad general rule that prior

16

convictions are presumed valid, that in one narrow

17

situation, the complete absence of counsel, that a due

18

process type challenge could be brought.

19

Now, that question has never been raised in

20

this case, whether such a challenge could be brought in

21

immigration proceedings despite the general rule that

22

there are no such collateral challenges, but that is a

23

different rule and a different body of jurisprudence

24

from this Court, the due process body, as opposed to

25

importing all of the very complicated section 851
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

procedures into the -- the -- the inquiry here.

2

And just to get back to the --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could a -- could a defendant

4

whose prior conviction was under a State recidivism

5

statute claim that that conviction was invalid because

6

that defendant was at that time deprived of the right of

7

counsel?

8

and the situation in which -- and the situation in the

9

sort of case we have here with respect to the issue of

Do you see a difference between that situation

10

whether the prior conviction was invalid because of the

11

deprivation of the right of counsel?

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes, I think that they're

13

potentially distinguishable.

14

this is not a question that has ever come up in the

15

immigration context.

16

would be based on the Court's decision, we think, in

17

Custis and not anything about "punishable" referring to

18

section 851 procedures.

19

But, you know, this is --

It would be a special rule that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why are they

20

distinguishable?

You could -- you can -- you could

21

-- a person faced with removal could challenge

22

a prior conviction on the ground that there was a

23

deprivation of the right of counsel, whether or not it

24

was pursuant to a recidivism -- whether or not there was

25

a recidivism issue in it, couldn't -- couldn't they?

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes, but I think

2

recidivism -- I think there's some confusion in the

3

Court's discussion, perhaps, that recidivism is not an

4

element of the offense.

5

6

might be subject to an increased punishment for that

And that's essentially what Petitioner wants
here, is to define the State court offense as having an

element of recidivism, but there is one thing that's

clear from this Court's jurisprudence to this point is

12

that recidivism is separate and unique from anything

13

else that might --

2

to repeat under the drug offense laws, and I thought the

3

position was that this shows a particular propensity, a

4

particular immoral attitude that's not being corrected.

5

And so that the recidivism makes him a worse person.

6

This is -- this is a drug offender who continues

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, what this Court said in

7

Rodriguez generally about recidivist punishments is you're

8

always being punished for the last offense, but

9

you're being punished more severely because it's shown

10

that incapacitation and deterrence isn't working for

11

you.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what was worrying

13

me, that's why I asked the other question.

14

what was worrying me would be a statute where they --

15

it's big enough in the State to cover possession with

16

recidivism or not, and they deal with it at the

17

punishment stage, and I can see your point in respect to

18

that.

19

But the --

But that isn't this statute.
This statute not only doesn't deal with it

20

at the punishment stage; it's forbidden to take it into

21

account because what this says is you can only get

22

recidivism if you previously had a conviction for a

23

class A misdemeanor, and the prior conviction here was a

24

class B; and, therefore, one thing we know about the

25

statute is that under this statute, his behavior as a
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

recidivist is as close to irrelevant as you could make

2

it.

That's why I'm back to the cat burglar.

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

And what -- what I'm

4

suggesting about that State statute is that -- and this

5

Court said this in Lopez -- that Congress didn't want

6

those variations in State law to change the treatment

7

for individual offenders.

8
9

What it wanted, and it did this in
aggravated felony provisions, all throughout them, is to

10

identify categories of persons who had done certain

11

conduct that Congress thought was serious enough and

12

treat them all the same for immigration purposes.

13

the Court said in Lopez, we're not going to make the

14

way that State law treats recidivism -- or we're not

15

going to make State law treats an offense change the

16

outcome.

17

Federal law treats the offense.

18

And

The outcome is going to be based on how

And that's why, to get back to one of my

19

earlier answers to your questions, we think that this

20

Court's decision in Nijhawan is extremely important

21

here, because what the Court recognized in that decision

22

is that Congress, in defining an aggravated felony,

23

sometimes talks about required elements of the offense,

24

and it sometimes talks about extra facts that can be

25

established in the immigration court.
51
Alderson Reporting Company

They had --

Well, Nijhawan uses

this provision as an example of where it didn't.

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, we think that that

actually two parts of the definition.

15

part, illicit trafficking, is like a generic burglary

17

the -- essentially elements correspond under a modified

18

when you look at a felony punishable under the Controlled

how it's punishable in Federal court, and that extra

6

problems that you identified in terms of the wide

We talk in our brief -- and there's a long

list of differences in State laws, not only in the

State procedures, which vary widely from Federal court,

consider a second possession offense for recidivist

enhancement, or only a third or fourth; whether the

lead to a -- a patchwork application laws of the

MS. SAHARSKY:

In neither case does the

prosecutor's judgment matter.

What matters is the

22

offense conduct that was established by the conviction

25

Federal offense that was punishable as a felony in

What matters is the offense that the

2

It is true that some charges may be

3

brought and some charges may not be brought, and that

4

would impact what a person has been convicted of.

5

there could be disparities based on that.

6

Congress decided was that it had to balance its need for

7

uniformity with a rule that is administrable, and the rule

8

that it picked as administrable is, let's look at the

9

offense conduct that was established by the conviction.

So

But what

And when you look at that offense conduct, you have to ask

11

how it could be punished in Federal court.

12

"punishable" language that requires this more hypothetical

13

inquiry on how the events -- how the offense could be

14

treated.

15

And it's that

And just to summarize, it is clear from the

16

last 20 years that Congress has had a very serious

17

concern about recidivist criminal aliens in the United

18

States, and Congress has made a judgment since 1970 in

19

the drug laws that two drug possession offenses should

be punishable as a felony.

those two drug offenses and who concededly, if taken to

designation that Congress intended for all aliens who

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. SRINIVASAN:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Thank you -We usually think of

12

recidivism when we talk about statistics as being

13

repeated for any crime.

14

kind.

15

that essential to your argument?

16

to the -- to the Federal statute.

17

This is a recidivism of a special

It's repeating the same -- the same thing.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Is

I know it's essential

Right, and because it's

18

essential to the Federal statute, it's necessarily a part

19

of our argument.

20

any different if the Federal statute read differently,

21

but you can only be punishable as a felon under Federal

22

law if you had a prior drug conviction, and if you had a

23

prior drug conviction that was in fact found to exist.

24
25

I don't think our argument would be

And I think, Justice Kennedy, the first point
I'd like to make in rebuttal -- there's two points I'd
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

like to make.

The first addresses a question you

2

raised concerning what happens in a situation in which

3

the second proceeding is a Federal proceeding rather

4

than a State proceeding.
And I think this is important to highlight

5
6

the government's response, because if the second proceeding

7

is a Federal proceeding, we have a person who has a prior

8

conviction for drug possession.

9

then prosecuted in Federal court for a second time for

We have a person who is

10

drug possession.

The prosecutor by hypothesis never

11

brings the initial conviction into play.

12

therefore never finds that the person is a recidivist.

13

As a consequence, that person cannot as a matter of law

14

receive a felony sentence.

15

as a misdemeanant.

16

say that they have been, quote, "convicted of a felony,

17

punishable under the Controlled Substances Act," close quote --

The court

They can only be sentenced

But nonetheless, the government would

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do you --

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

-- even though no felony

20

sentence could be imposed.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

How do you distinguish

22

Nijhawan?

I mean, there what made it a Federal felony

23

was the fact that more than $10,000 was obtained from

24

the victims.

25

State conviction.

But that was not found in the -- in the
It simply was not.

58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There were -- there were

2

two things that made it a Federal felony,

3

Justice Scalia.

4

involved fraud.

First was it had to be an offense that

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And then -- and that had to

7

be found by the convicting court.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

There was no issue about

10

that.

Our --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No issue.

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Our point is that --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what about the

14

$10,000? That --

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's the --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He was never convicted of

17

having obtained by fraud more than $10,000 from the

18

victim.

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But -- but there's a very

20

important textual distinction, Justice Scalia, because

21

under the provision at issue in Nijhawan, the offense

22

had to involve fraud, and then there was a separator in

23

which the loss exceeds $10,000.

24

on the fact that the text read "in which."

25

critical, and another thing that was critical in

And the Court focused

59
Alderson Reporting Company

That was

Official

1

Nijhawan was that if you looked at Federal statutes and

2

asked, were there any that as to which the elements would

3

require a loss in excess of $10,000, there were none.
And because of that practical consequence,

4
5

the Court reached the conclusion that Congress would

6

have intended, that the $10,000 be something that the

7

immigration judge could have found.

8

We have the opposite situation here.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You still had the word

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

You had -- sure.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which is what you're

10

"convicted."

13

relying on.

14

it's applicable here, and we did not require him to

15

have been convicted of having obtained more than $10,000.

16

That word was applicable there as much as

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Because, again, the test --

17

the text also had "in which," which the Court found

18

critical -- that text is lacking here -- and because the

19

statute would have had no practical consequence, absent

20

the Court's interpretation.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's -- that --

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's not true here.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because she got to that argument

24

at the end, and she said my -- I wrote that, I think, and I --

25

when I used as an example or the text uses an example, this

60
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provision is one where you don't look to real conduct.

2

She said that was a mistake, really.

It

3

was overstated, because what they're saying is that

4

recidivism analogous to the $10,000 was meant to be a

5

real conduct aspect, not just offense of conviction, and

6

-- and she gave similar reasons.

7

reasons are that the States are too mixed up in

8

this; it will be too difficult to look at that element

9

itself.

10

That's why -- similar

So she's trying to analogize that to the

$10,000.

11

Now, why isn't that a good analogy?

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Because for both reasons

13

that the Court found that you could look to the

14

circumstances in Nijhawan, neither of those two reasons

15

applies here.

16

don't have the words "in which."

17

word "convicted."

18

consequence that the -- the provision would cease to

19

have any practical implications under our reading.

20

You don't have a textual separator.

You

All you have is the

And you also don't have the

It would absolutely have practical

21

implications under our reading, because anytime a person

22

was found to have been a recidivist and their sentence

23

was raised, their maximum sentence was raised as a

24

consequence, they will have been deemed to have been

25

aggravated felon.

But here, that didn't happen.
61
Alderson Reporting Company

You'd

Official

1

have to understand that in the Federal system, even

2

though an individual could not as a matter of law be

3

sentenced as a felon, they nonetheless would have been

4

deemed to have been convicted of a felony, and at the

5

very least -- and this is the second point I'd like to

make, if I could just --
