 (10:17 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 121184, Octane 

5

Fitness v. ICON Health and Fitness, Incorporated.

 Mr. Telscher. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUDOLPH A. TELSCHER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. TELSCHER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 An exceptional case under Section 285 

12

requires a court to assess the full range of traditional 

13

equitable considerations, including the degree of 

14

reasonableness of the merits by the plaintiff's action, 

15

procedural aspects of the case, and evidence of economic 

16

coercion.  Frivolous and badfaith cases are not 

17

prerequisites to an award of fees under Section 285. 

18

 The Federal Circuit's test conflicts with 

19

the statutory language, it violates established canons 

20

of statutory construction, and it deprives district 

21

courts of the discretion they need to effectively combat 

22

abusive patent litigation practices. 

23

 Below, the Federal Circuit found that ICON's 

24

claims require a Cchannel structure and that ICON's 

25

claim construction to the contrary was without merit;

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appendix at A10.  The Federal Circuit also affirmed the 

2

district court's grant of summary judgment that no 

3

reasonable juror could find, as a matter of law, that 

4

Octane's structure had an equivalent to the Cchannel; 

5

appendix A13. 

6

 This means that ICON's infringement 

7

allegations against Octane were meritless.  This fact, 

8

in combination with other undisputed evidence of 

9

record  namely the worthless nature of the patent, 

10

evidence of economic coercion, and the fact that two 

11

other elements of the claimed  the core elements of 

12

the claim were missing as well  make this case 

13

exceptional.  And it's such that this Court should 

14

reverse the district court and award fees on its own. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You were talking about 

16

economic coercion.  Suppose it were reversed.  Suppose 

17

that Octane had the patent and sued ICON.  Would the 

18

analysis be precisely the same? 

19

 MR. TELSCHER: 

The analysis would be 

20

primarily the same.  The evidence of economic coercion 

21

may be less.  So, for example, if you're a smaller 

22

competitor and you're suing a larger competitor, there 

23

would be less opportunity for abuse.  Knowing, if ICON 

24

was the competitor with the weak patent, they would know 

25

that their larger competitor would stand up to them.  So

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the opportunity for economic abuse would be less. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I've been listening to 

3

your adjectives  this is a search for adjectives, in 

4

part.  I think you used the word meritless.  What  is 

5

there a difference between merit  meritlessness and 

6

objectively baseless? 

7

 MR. TELSCHER: 

I don't know that the case 

8

law is perfectly clear.  In Christiansburg, this Court 

9

did define meritless to the tune of it's unjustified and 

10
11

without foundation. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Because if we remand to 

12

the district court, the district court's already said 

13

it's not objectively baseless, it's not brought in bad 

14

faith.  I'm not quite sure what words we're going to 

15

give to the district court if you're to prevail. 

16

 MR. TELSCHER: 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well 
You  you had just said 

18

that we should return it to the district court with 

19

orders to require fee shifting.  And how could that be 

20

if the discretion is to be exercised by the district 

21

court? 

22

 I can understand your asking for a remand, 

23

but I can't understand your asking for a reversal and an 

24

order that the fees be reimbursed. 

25

 MR. TELSCHER: 

We understand the tension

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between the discretionary standard and asking for a remand 

2

with a finding.  However, there are cases that are 

3

rare  not that rare, but they are rare enough  where 

4

appellate courts look at a record and have a firm and 

5

definite conviction that an award should be made such 

6

that it would be an abuse of discretion 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And you think this Court 

8

is the proper court to look at the record and make that 

9

determination, that the district court got it wrong when 

10

the district court didn't think this was an exceptional 

11

case. 

12

 MR. TELSCHER: 

On this record, yes, Your 

13

Honor.  The  the Federal Circuit's finding is such 

14

that the  the infringement claim is meritless.  As a 

15

matter of law, the claim construction position had no 

16

possibility of success under 35 U.S.C. Section 112, 

17

paragraph (f). 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, what do you  what 

19

do you want to add to meritless?  Don't you have to add 

20

something to meritless?  I mean, every time you win the 

21

summary judgment motion, that's a determination that the 

22

claim is without merit, isn't it? 

23

 MR. TELSCHER: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

It is not, Your Honor. 
Doesn't meritless just mean 

without merit?

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. TELSCHER: 

No, it  for example, in 

2

most patent cases, there is the Markman phase.  So a 

3

district court judge, as a matter of law, is required to 

4

find on the claim construction.  So there could be a 

5

reasonable dispute about the meaning of a term that's 

6

resolved against the plaintiff, so it  just because 

7

they lose a claim construction doesn't mean their 

8

position was meritless. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  I understand.  Well, 

10

all right.  What  what must be added to the word 

11

meritless? 

12

 MR. TELSCHER: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14
15

In our strong view 
That no  no reasonable 

judge could have found it to be with merit? 
 MR. TELSCHER: 

If someone brings a claim 

16

construction position that's unreasonably weak, in our 

17

view that qualifies under Section 285 and is consistent 

18

with the words that other cases have used. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That  that's not a 

20

standard I would  I would want to, you know  you 

21

realize how  how differently various district courts 

22

would operate if  if you just say  what was your 

23

phrase?  Unreasonably weak? 

24

 MR. TELSCHER: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And yet, that's the 
You've got to give me

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

something tighter than that. 
 MR. TELSCHER: 

That is the standard, 

3

however, that this Court used in Martin and in Pierce. 

4

 And if we're looking at  if  if we want 

5

to make  so  so in  for example, in most of these 

6

cases what we're talking about is going to typically 

7

involve the merits.  And so if we say that the only way 

8

you can get a fee award is to have a zeromerit, 

9

frivolous case, it's impossible to show.  It's 

10
11

inconsistent with the statutory language. 
 So when we're looking at this from a 

12

statutory context, on the merits, what should qualify? 

13

And there comes a point at which a case goes from strong 

14

to medium and it crosses into the territory of weak.  It 

15

gets weaker and weaker, and then it becomes frivolous. 

16

 This Court, even in Pierce, recognized that 

17

the reasonableness standard was something more than 

18

frivolous.  And we think if Section 285 is to have any 

19

teeth in deterring the abusive practices currently in 

20

the system, something more than frivolousness is 

21

required, and it is consistent with this Court's prior 

22

precedent. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We're deal  we're 

24

dealing with a term that could be read in many different 

25

ways:  exceptional.  Right?  Maybe that means 1 out of

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

100; maybe it means 10 out of 100.  And why shouldn't we 

2

give some deference to the decision of the court that 

3

was set up to develop patent law in a uniform way?  They 

4

have a much better idea than we do about the 

5

consequences of these fee awards in particular cases. 

6

And since we're just  as Justice Kennedy pointed 

7

out  dealing with adjectives  you know, meritless, 

8

frivolous, exceptional  why don't give some deference 

9

to their judgment? 

10

 MR. TELSCHER: 

Well, I think we need to look 

11

at the basis of the judgment, which is grounded in the 

12

fact that they've  they've found constitutionally that 

13

the  the PRE standard was required.  And I think this 

14

Court's precedent in BE&K just two years earlier says 

15

that the validity of feeshifting statutes is not 

16

governed by the PRE standard. 

17

 And if  if the Court were to so hold, that 

18

would throw into question all of the fee statutes of 

19

this country because, accordingly, they presumptively 

20

would have to have the sham litigation test to be 

21

constitutional. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What is the difference 

23

between the Federal Circuit's use of objective 

24

reasonable  objectively meritless and your standard? 

25

 MR. TELSCHER: 

To my way 

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I know that you've been 

2

arguing that they shouldn't be using subjective intent, 

3

so I'm putting that aside.  And you can tell me why 

4

Kilopass doesn't answer that now. 

5

 But what's the difference you see? 

6

 MR. TELSCHER: 

To my way of thinking, when 

7

you say meritless or baseless, it means there's 

8

absolutely no foundation of zero merit.  When we talk 

9

about objectively unreasonable  and, again, as this 

10

Court found in Pierce  it suggests something lesser 

11

than frivolousness.  And the reality of  I think of 

12

district court litigation is it's near impossible to 

13

show that something is frivolous, that somebody had no 

14

argument 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand your 

16

answer to the question.  How does the first part of the 

17

Federal Circuit's test differ from your perception of 

18

what meritless means? 

19

 MR. TELSCHER: 

We understand the first part 

20

of the Federal Circuit's test to require zero merit or 

21

frivolousness, which is what the district court  she 

22

used interchangeably "objectively baseless" and 

23

"frivolousness."  So we think frivolousness is too low 

24

of a standard under 285. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So would you say without

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

substantial merit?  I mean, if we're playing around with 

2

words again. 

3

 MR. TELSCHER: 

Without substantial merit, 

4

unreasonably weak, or low likelihood of success, I think 

5

those are all ways of getting to the same point, which 

6

is something less than zero merit will satisfy under 

7

285. 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You have several objections, 

9

I take it, to what the Federal Circuit has said.  One is 

10

that you think objectively baseless is too low, correct? 

11

 MR. TELSCHER: 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

13

faith is necessary. 

14

 MR. TELSCHER: 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
You also don't think bad 

Agreed. 
And do you also believe that 

16

litigation misconduct taken in conjunction with a case 

17

that is, let's say, of little merit, but perhaps not as 

18

low as the standard that you have, that you're 

19

suggesting, would justify an award of fees? 

20

 MR. TELSCHER: 

Yes.  We believe litigation 

21

misconduct, especially in consideration with a weak case 

22

on the merits, makes for a strong candidate for 

23

exceptional. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, now I'm a  say I'm a 

district judge someplace and I rarely get a patent case.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

How am I supposed to determine whether the case is 

2

exceptional if the standard is take everything into 

3

account, litigation misconduct, the strength of the 

4

case, any indication of bad faith, and decide whether 

5

it's exceptional?  Exceptional compared to what?  I have 

6

very little basis for comparison.  How do I do that? 

7

 MR. TELSCHER: 

So, I do not think it's a 

8

numerical comparison.  I think when we're talking about 

9

an uncommon case, it's what would we expect of a 

10

reasonable litigant.  So in the normal course, a 

11

plaintiff develops a product, they bring it to market, 

12

they get a patent, they're successful.  A defendant 

13

recognizes the success.  They look at the patent, and 

14

they try to design around and a reasonable dispute 

15

ensues.  So that's a normal case. 

16

 What we're saying to a district court judge, 

17

the guidance we would give them is that this litigant, 

18

this plaintiff acted in reasonable ways, and district 

19

court judges are called on every single day to make 

20

those determinations. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Compared to what?  Compared 

22

to the types of cases that the district court hears on a 

23

more regular basis? 

24

 MR. TELSCHER: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

District courts handle 
Or compared to patent cases?

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. TELSCHER: 

I think all cases.  Complex 

2

litigation requires litigants to act reasonably in 

3

procedural aspects and on the merits.  I think 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

See, this is what I find 

5

somewhat troubling about your "take everything into 

6

account" standard.  Most district court judges do not 

7

see a lot of patent cases, and when they see one, it's 

8

very unusual.  So you've got these patent attorneys 

9

showing up in court.  They are different from other 

10

attorneys. 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Sometimes they 

13

particularly if it's a very technical case, they speak a 

14

different language.  They do things differently.  The 

15

district judge is struggling to figure out how to handle 

16

the case.  And then the  one  one party wins, the 

17

other party loses, and the party that wins says, this 

18

was an exceptional case and you should award fees in my 

19

favor under 285. 

20

 And the district judge says: 

How can I tell 

21

whether this is exceptional?  If I had had  if I had 

22

25 patent cases, I could make some comparisons.  But I 

23

don't have a basis for doing that. 

24
25

 Now, the Federal Circuit has a basis for 
doing it.

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. TELSCHER: 

Well, first of all, 

2

Congress  Congress has spoken and said that in 

3

exceptional cases, the district court should do this. 

4

And I also  I think if you went back 10 to 15 years 

5

ago, perhaps the notion that district court judges 

6

haven't seen a lot of patent cases might be true. 

7

 District court judges see lots and lots of 

8

patent cases.  Many of those cases may not be decided on 

9

the merits.  The only thing that the Federal Circuit 

10

sees are the ones that went to final conclusion.  So I 

11

do think district court judges see a lot of patent 

12

litigation. 

13

 I also think 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is that really true? 

15

There's nearly 700 district judges in the country. 

16

If  if we had a statistic about the average number of 

17

patent cases that a district judge hears and receives 

18

on, let's say, a 5year period, what would it be? 

19

 MR. TELSCHER: 

I don't know what that number 

20

is, Your Honor.  But I know that district court judges 

21

carry a widely varying docket of different areas of law 

22

and are called upon to learn the law and assess the 

23

reasonableness of those positions. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Telscher, it occurs to 

me that you really cannot answer the question of what

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adjectives should be attached to meritless.  And the 

2

reason you can't is, since it is a totality of the 

3

circumstances test, that is only one factor and it 

4

doesn't have to be an absolute degree of meritlessness. 

5

Even in a  I assume you would say that even in a very 

6

close case, if there has been outrageous litigation 

7

abuse by the other side, the court would be able to say: 

8

My goodness, I've never seen lawyers behave like this. 

9

You're going to pay the attorneys' fees for the other 

10
11
12
13

side.  Couldn't the  couldn't the court do that? 
 MR. TELSCHER: 

That's absolutely correct, 

Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So then how can we possibly 

14

define meritless?  We can't, because it goes up and 

15

down, even in a case where it's  it's a close case, it 

16

could still be exceptional. 

17
18
19

 MR. TELSCHER: 

It's the degree of the 

unreasonable nature of the case as one factor. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you agree with 

20

the Solicitor General's test that fees are authorized 

21

when they are  I'm quoting  "necessary to prevent 

22

gross injustice"? 

23

 MR. TELSCHER: 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

Yes, we do, Your Honor. 
Well, now, I was 

surprised at that because I would have thought your

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

friend on the other side would say that.  I mean, gross 

2

injustice sounds like a very tiny portion of cases; 

3

lower than meritless.  I mean it's  injustice is bad 

4

too.  It's doesn't mean you just loss, but there's 

5

something very unjust about it.  Gross injustice, well, 

6

it's just some more adjectives, and it's the test  I 

7

gather that's the test you adopt. 

8
9
10
11

 MR. TELSCHER: 

Well, it's certainly what 

the  what's  what Congress said in the legislative 
history and what was adopted by the courts. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but you've 

12

been up here for several minutes and you haven't even 

13

used those particular  or that adjective, which is 

14

your test. 

15

 MR. TELSCHER: 

Section 285 is remedial, so 

16

certainly in order to remedy something there must be 

17

some level of injustice.  I think consistent with the 

18

notion that a case is exceptional and uncommon is the 

19

notion that it's gross injustice, not justice.  And to 

20

my way of thinking, when somebody brings a very weak 

21

case, which we believe this one was, and it costs 

22

someone $2 million to defend it, and they go through 

23

that and they pay that price tag, a district court 

24

should be able to find that that is gross injustice. 

25

And I think it is, especially for many of the small

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

businesses in this country when they face these types of 

2

suits. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Telscher, can I just 

4

ask very quickly the factors that you would think a 

5

court should consider.  One is the degree to which the 

6

case is meritless.  Another, I presume, is bad faith. 

7

Another is litigation misconduct.  Is there anything 

8

else or are those the three? 

9

 MR. TELSCHER: 

No, there  there's more.  I 

10

think it's  there's no exhaustive list and, for 

11

example, even in this case  and in ParkinTheatres 

12

where the court said other equitable consideration.  We 

13

believe it is a totality of the circumstances.  Anything 

14

that bears on the gross injustice and the uncommon 

15

nature of the case. 

16

 So, for example, in this case, the fact that 

17

Icon brought a patent that it, with all of its 

18

resources, couldn't commercialize, was indisputably 

19

worthless.  To this day they've never made a product 

20

under this patent.  That's a factor that bears on the 

21

equities of this case and the uncommon nature and is one 

22

that doesn't fall neatly within those categories. 

23

 The fact that our client licensed under a 

24

different patent that shows its linkage is another 

25

factor that shows that what they are asserting isn't

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable.  So I don't think there is a laundry list, 

2

but the categories that you identified are the big ones. 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I think you  you did 

4

say if it's an exceptional case, the district court must 

5

award fees, but the statute says may.  So even in the 

6

exceptional case, according to the statute, the district 

7

court is not required to award fees.  Or do you read may 

8

to mean something else? 

9

 MR. TELSCHER: 

Certainly, there  there has 

10

been the issue of whether this determination is a 

11

one or twostep finding.  My belief is that district 

12

courts will look at all of the factors and make up their 

13

mind whether it's exceptional and in that same step 

14

award fees.  There has been the notion that first we 

15

determine a case is exceptional and then we make the 

16

determination of whether fees should be granted.  I'm 

17

not sure once a court determines that a case is 

18

exceptional, what other factor would bear on that  on 

19

that determination. 

20
21

 If there are no other questions, I'd like to 
reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

 SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 Section 285 grants district courts 

5

discretionary authority to look at the totality of the 

6

circumstances and award fees when necessary to prevent 

7

gross injustice.  Such awards can be proper in unusual 

8

cases where the losing party has committed bad faith or 

9

harassing conduct during the litigation, or has advanced 

10

objectively unreasonable legal arguments, just as courts 

11

had held under the 1946 statute.  The Court should 

12

restore this understanding of Section 285 and make four 

13

additional points that we think will clarify the inquiry 

14

for the district courts: 

15

 First and most importantly, the Court should 

16

say that baselessness and bad faith do not both have to 

17

be present in a case in order to justify a fee award; 

18

 Second, the Court should  the Court should 

19

say that district courts can grant fees based on a 

20

combination of different factors even if no single 

21

factor would necessarily support the award on its own; 

22

 Third, the Court should say that an 

23

objectively unreasonable argument can trigger a fee 

24

award, even if that argument is not so unreasonable that 

25

it's actually considered frivolous;

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 And fourth, the Court should say that clear 
and convincing evidence is not required. 
 I'd like to turn to Justice Scalia's 

4

question and the discussion that occurred earlier about 

5

the battle of the adjectives, so to speak.  We think 

6

that, as I said earlier, that the  a fee award should 

7

be appropriate or can be appropriate in a case in which 

8

there's an objectively unreasonable litigating position 

9

or objectively unreasonable arguments that are made in a 

10

case.  We appreciate that that's not a  a 100 percent 

11

precise, brightline test, but we think it's similar 

12

to  it's, in fact, the same as what the Court has said 

13

in other contexts, such as EAJA in the Pierce case 

14
15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No matter what other 

factors exist, it has to be objectively unreasonable. 

16

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I 
I mean, even if it is clear 

18

from other factors that this is a shakedown, a big 

19

country  a big company trying to suppress a little 

20

company, even if it's clear that there has been 

21

outrageous litigation abuse, misconduct by attorneys? 

22
23
24
25

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

It is an important point, 

Justice Scalia 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All of those things cannot 

justify shifting the award unless it is objectively

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

unreasonable. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

No, Justice Scalia, that's 

not our position. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Oh, okay. 
Our position is if the only 

6

factor is an objectively unreasonable argument, that in 

7

appropriate circumstances, that can be sufficient.  We 

8

believe very, very strongly that if there are other 

9

factors present, that would only strengthen the case for 

10
11

appeal. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I see that.  But, look, 

12

what you listed in your brief on page 17, which I think 

13

was nonexclusive:  Willful infringement, litigation 

14

misconduct, inequitable conduct by the patentee in 

15

securing the patent, vexatious or unjustified 

16

litigation, bad faith, the assertion of frivolous claims 

17

and defenses.  And then you cite cases which say all of 

18

those in different instances have been sufficient, 

19

either alone or together.  Well, why don't we just copy 

20

that?  Isn't that your view? 

21
22
23
24
25

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think our view is that 

those are the kinds of circumstances 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Do you want to 

add to that list, or to subtract? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think as long as the Court

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

makes clear that that is an illustrative list that I 

2

think captures the kind of bad faith 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You want to add et cetera, 

right? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

And add "or similar," 

6

"similar equitable"  "similar inequitable conduct," 

7

which is what the Ninth Circuit said in the 

8

ParkinTheatres case, which I think all the parties 

9

agree is a  fairly captures what Congress intended to 

10
11

incorporate from the cases decided in the late '40s. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So where does gross 

12

injustice come from?  I understood that to be your test. 

13

You say, Fees are authorized when necessary to prevent 

14

gross injustice to the defendant. 

15

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I think 
Again, you have your 

17

long laundry list that doesn't say anything about gross 

18

injustice. 

19

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Well, I think the long 

20

laundry list reflects the kinds of circumstances in 

21

which courts operating between 1946 and 1952 

22

interpreting the prior statute, those are the 

23

circumstances in which those courts had concluded that 

24

there was a gross injustice.  So in other words, we 

25

think gross injustice is maybe the umbrella term and 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You don't think it.  Where 

2

it comes from, which maybe you don't want to say, is the 

3

Senate report on the bill, that is similar to this one 

4

enacted in 1946.  Still, there are some of us who think 

5

that's a highly relevant consideration. 

6

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We are comfortable saying 

7

that and we  and we do say that and we think it's 

8

especially salient and worth relying on here, not just 

9

because it's the legislative history, but also because 

10

that same legislative history and that same gross 

11

injustice language was repeatedly cited and talked about 

12

in the 1946 to '52 cases. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I think, Mr. Martinez, 

14

what the Chief Justice is driving at is there's a bit of 

15

a disconnect between your list of factors and those two 

16

words.  Gross injustice, I mean that's kind  that's 

17

really, really exceptional.  That sounds like, shocks 

18

the conscience.  That sounds like something you've never 

19

seen happen in the litigation system ever. 

20

 But then you're saying essentially ratchet 

21

it down when you list all of these various factors.  And 

22

maybe that's  that's right, we shouldn't be obsessed 

23

with this word, gross injustice.  It just seems a 

24

disconnect between the two words and all the factors. 

25

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Let me  let me explain by

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

stepping back. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But it's in the Senate 

report, so 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Justice Kagan, we think that 

6

the way to look at the statute is to try to figure out 

7

what Congress understood the statute to mean in 1952. 

8

And it's very clear and I think both sides agree that 

9

Congress intended to essentially incorporate the  the 

10

thrust of the judicial opinions that had been issued 

11

under the 1946 statute.  Those opinions repeatedly 

12

talked about gross injustice, drawing from the prior 

13

legislative history, and when they awarded fees and then 

14

when  and when they discussed when fees would be 

15

appropriate, the  the circumstances that we list in 

16

our brief are what they said would equate to gross 

17

injustice. 

18

 So I think in the abstract you may be right, 

19

that gross injustice is a broader standard or maybe it's 

20

a little bit  it's a, you know, only the most 

21

exceptional of exceptional cases would be covered.  But 

22

in practice what Congress was looking at and what they 

23

were responding to and what they were intending to put 

24

in this statute was an idea of gross injustice that 

25

reflected those bad faith, harassing, and unreasonable

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

situations that were presented earlier. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So if that's what you mean, 

3

why don't you say exceptional injustice instead of gross 

4

injustice? 

5
6
7
8
9

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We're trying to tie the 

interpretation of the statute to the language 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

To the Senate  to the 

Senate report. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Not just to the Senate 

10

report, Justice Scalia, but to the judicial decisions. 

11

And this Court has often looked to judicial decisions 

12

judicial decisions as a backdrop against  against 

13

which Congress legislates. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's a different statute. 

15

Could we borrow from  you mentioned EAJA.  I take it 

16

that's substantially justified? 

17
18
19
20
21

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Yes, Your Honor.  We think 

that  that 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's a different statute, 

It was passed later, all of  all those problems. 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

We think that when  when 

22

the situation involves, say, just an objectively 

23

unreasonable argument, we think that essentially the 

24

same test would apply from the EAJA context. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So is there anything

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other than the objectively baseless and bad faith of the 

2

Brooks Furniture test that you would change?  Doesn't 

3

all of the other factors that the Court uses 

4

litigation misconduct, all of that other stuff 

5

encompass all the factors you're talking about? 

6

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think it does, but I think 

7

it's  it's very important if the Court were to go in 

8

that direction, as long as it elaborates a couple of the 

9

additional points that I mentioned earlier. 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That it has to be a 

combination, a combination of factors, and 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Both, yes, right, that both 

13

are not required, that it can be a combination of 

14

factors, that when the Brooks Furniture test says 

15

unjustified, that is a  that embraces the concept of 

16

objective unreasonableness. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

By the way, I thought 

18

I thought the Federal Circuit said that you only use the 

19

objective unreasonable if there isn't one of the other 

20

things.  So it seems to be saying that 

21

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

I think they do, but I think 

22

that catchall category in which they apply the 

23

twopronged Brooks Furniture test covers potentially a 

24

very wide array of cases, because it covers any case in 

25

which perhaps there's bad faith conduct in bringing the

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

litigation, and also it covers the range of 

2

circumstances in which frivolous or unreasonable 

3

arguments are made. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And could you spend a 

5

moment on clear and convincing, and  because there's 

6

not a whole lot in your briefs on that part of it, 

7

although you do mention it in passing. 

8
9

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

Right.  Yes, Justice 

Sotomayor.  As the Court well knows, the standard rule 

10

in civil litigation is that  that facts need to be 

11

established by a preponderance of the evidence unless 

12

Congress says otherwise.  The i4i case, decided a few 

13

terms ago, I think confirmed that general view. 

14

 Here, Congress did not say otherwise. 

15

Congress did not embrace a clear and convincing 

16

standard.  There's nothing in the text or the history of 

17

Section 285 that suggests that it did.  Appreciate we 

18

didn't have enough  I wish we had had more time in our 

19

brief to get into this issue, but I would just suggest 

20

that if the Court wants to look more deeply, it can look 

21

at Judge O'Malley's opinion in the Kilopass case, which 

22

I think has a very thorough and very convincing 

23

discussion of the clear and convincing evidence issue. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What is the difference 

between  you say the correct phrase is objectively

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

unreasonable? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

When we're dealing with just 

that, a  a case that raises a weak legal argument. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's different from 

5

objectively baseless.  That's a little higher than 

6

objectively baseless? 

7

 MR. MARTINEZ: 

It's not clear, Justice 

8

Alito, how the Federal Circuit conceives of it, And let 

9

me just explain why.  I think they use the term 

10

objectively baseless.  In some of their opinions when 

11

they are talking about that term, they seem to use 

12

frivolous as a synonym.  In other cases when they're 

13

talking about that term, they seem to use objectively 

14

unreasonable.  And so we think there's a little bit of 

15

confusion. 

16

 We think the Pierce case makes very clear 

17

that justified and reasonableness are the same thing, 

18

and to  that a reasonable argument is not the same as 

19

merely a nonfrivolous argument. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And that's higher than the 

Rule 11 standard? 
 MR. MARTINEZ: 

The Rule 11 standard, when it 

23

comes to unreasonable arguments, is frivolous.  And so 

24

we think that it should be a little bit lower than that 

25

standard and it should be closer to something like in

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

EAJA. 
 The  I would like to get to the Chief 

3

Justice's question earlier about why not defer to the 

4

Federal Circuit's view on this statute, and I think two 

5

principal reasons.  First of all, I don't think the 

6

Federal Circuit's view really has any basis in either 

7

the text or the history of  of the  of Section 285. 

8

So that's reason number one. 

9

 Reason number two is I think if the Federal 

10

Circuit had had a consistent view over its history or if 

11

the Federal Circuit were not internally divided on this 

12

issue, that may be a consideration.  Deference might be 

13

more appropriate.  But here there is no consistent 

14

history and the Federal Circuit, as we've seen in 

15

Kilopass, is divided.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

22
23

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Phillips. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 I'd like to start with the objective 

24

baseless issue in this particular case, because it seems 

25

to me the district court has done a very thorough job of

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

analyzing every element of this case.  The district 

2

judge obviously presided over the entirety of this 

3

litigation, analyzed the case for purposes of summary 

4

judgment, and then reanalyzed the case for purposes of 

5

analyzing the merits of  of the claim and to  and 

6

whether or not this would be an exceptional case. 

7

 To be sure, it applied the Brooks standard, 

8

but basically what it analyzed was just simply whether 

9

there was an objectively legitimate basis for the 

10

decision.  It's not that it has zero merit.  Counsel 

11

keeps saying zero merit is objectively baseless.  That's 

12

not the standard.  This Court held in PRE that 

13

objectively baseless means that there has to be probable 

14

cause  that it lacks probable cause to go forward, 

15

that it has to be reasonably possible. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, in PRE, of 

17

course, we were concerned about infringing on First 

18

Amendment rights, and that's not the case here. 

19

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, I think you could argue 

20

that there is at least a First Amendment concern that's 

21

in here.  But  but in any event, what it seems to me 

22

you really 

23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

First Amendment 

concern, what, to bring a patent case? 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, access to the courts,

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

access to the courts.  Any time you talk about imposing 

2

multimillion dollar fee awards at the end of the 

3

litigation, particularly if you do it on a fairly 

4

arbitrary basis

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you think Congress could 

not require the loser to pay  in all cases? 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Oh, I have no doubt that 

Congress could 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

 in all cases? 
Well, I'm not sure about in 

all cases. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, if it can do that, 

there's certainly no First Amendment problem. 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, I'm not sure I concede 

15

that in all cases.  I do think in the runofthemill 

16

cases, but when you're talking about a situation where 

17

you're talk  where the assertion is that the conduct 

18

of the litigation, the bringing of the litigation itself 

19

is inappropriate 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's the English rule.  It 

21

used to be our rule.  I don't see how you can possibly 

22

say that it's unconstitutional to make the loser pay. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

This is not your best 

argument. 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

It is not my best argument, I

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appreciate that, Justice Kennedy. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

On the other hand, if you 

4

if you go back and look at Christiansburg, 

5

Christiansburg, in that case the court also didn't treat 

6

it as a First Amendment issue, but it still recognizes 

7

an important policy of  of trying not to have too much 

8

interference with access to the courts. 

9

 In any event, objectively baseless is a 

10

standard that every court knows how to use and it goes 

11

directly to the ultimate 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How different is this 

13

from sanctionable misconduct?  It seems to me that under 

14

the way you're articulating things, the conduct has to 

15

be sanctionable before you can give attorneys' fees 

16

under this provision.  So why bother having the 

17

provision? 

18

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, because the provision 

19

was enacted in 1952, Justice Sotomayor, long before this 

20

kind of litigation  these kind of rules that would 

21

have rendered the litigation sanctionable existed, and 

22

so as a consequence of that  and I think it's 

23

important to put it in context.  Because, you know, when 

24

Congress did this initially in 1946, to be sure, it's 

25

the Senate report that talks about gross injustice, but

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it is the decisions of the courts that adopted that 

2

approach of gross injustice.  And then when Congress, in 

3

1952, incorporates the exceptional case standard, the 

4

revisor's notes say it's designed to go back to the 

5

legislative history and the decisions that have been 

6

interpreting that. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why does it always have to 

8

be objectively baseless?  I mean, I've read enough cases 

9

in this area to be able to approach it as a district 

10

court judge who's not expert. 

11

 I patent the following: 

For a computer, 

12

enter somebody's name; ask phone number, and they'll 

13

give you the phone number if you put in the right city. 

14

That puts some lists in the computer.  They can patent 

15

that?  Well, you add a couple of things, and then, 

16

apparently, you can have an argument that they can 

17

patent it.  Okay?  Because it'll be very abstract 

18

language.  It will be able to patent almost anything. 

19

No, you can't finally, but objectively baseless?  Patent 

20

attorneys are very brilliant at figuring out just how to 

21

do this.  So we're never going to have attorneys' fees 

22

in a suit if that's your standard. 

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Well 
But you could couple that 

with just barely over the line.  What line?  This vague

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

line, no one knows what it is.  In addition, all they 

2

did was say, We don't want to go to court and cost you 

3

$2 million.  Please send us a check for 1,000, we'll 

4

license it for you.  They do that to 40,000 people, and 

5

when somebody challenges it and goes to court, it costs 

6

them about 2 million because every discovery in sight. 

7

Okay?  You see where I'm going? 

8

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
And so I do not see why you 

10

couldn't have an exceptional case where attorneys' fees 

11

should be shifted.  But if I'm honest about it, I cannot 

12

say it's objectively baseless.  I can just say it's 

13

pretty close to whatever that line is, which I can't 

14

describe and look at all this other stuff.  Are you 

15

going to say that I can't shift? 

16

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

I think the problem with the 

17

approach you propose there, Justice Breyer, is you're 

18

trying to deal with a very small slice of the problem of 

19

litigation.  You know, what you've described 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, but I'm  of course, 

21

it may be a small slice of litigation, but it is a slice 

22

that costs a lot of people a lot of money. 

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

But the problem 
And so I would like to know 

if I do run across that small slice why cannot I, the

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

district judge, say, I've see all these things, taken 

2

together they spell serious injustice, and therefore, 

3

I'm shifting the fees.  Okay? 

4

 Why can I not do that even though, as I've 

5

just said and repeat, I cannot in honesty say it's 

6

frivolous given the standards for patenting that seem to 

7

be administered? 

8
9

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Because when Congress enacted 

the statute, adopted the exceptionalcase standard, it 

10

meant, essentially, to require that the litigation be 

11

unjustified and vexatious.  Unjustified means that it is 

12

baseless.  That's the understanding that existed all 

13

along.  It has to have  it's not that it has zero 

14

merit, but it has to have enough merit to be  to 

15

satisfy the standards of probable cause. 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, baseless is at the 

17

end of the day  I mean, you have a case that involves 

18

a straight stroke rail that at one end goes in an 

19

elliptical arc, and the district judge had to figure 

20

this out with all the experts.  After he goes through 

21

all the underbrush, he finds there's nothing there.  And 

22

it's hard to say that that's objectively baseless to a 

23

district judge who's spent weeks studying this thing. 

24

But at the end of the day, suppose he finds there's 

25

nothing there?

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, if at the end of the 

2

day there's nothing there, then I think it is 

3

objectively baseless, even though they've gone through 

4

the litigation.  But what the district judge 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not nothing there.  It's 

6

highly abstract language.  I gather you, like I, have 

7

read some of these claims.  They are very hard to 

8

understand and when you get to the bottom of it, the 

9

abstract nature of the language, plus the fact that it 

10

has something to do with computer input, plus the fact 

11

that, you know, you suspect very strongly it's baseless, 

12

but you really don't like to say something that isn't 

13

true and you can say, well, I could see how somebody 

14

might think there was something to this claim, just in 

15

that tone of voice, which you can't write down that tone 

16

of voice.  You see?

 (Laughter.)

25

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, let's send it back 

2

and tell them that they were imposing a standard that 

3

was too narrow, that was  didn't take count of all the 

4

circumstances where something could be unusually 

5

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But see 
 unjust, and then let 

7

them, no clear and convincing, but it's up to you, 

8

district judge.  You're the expert on litigation.  You 

9

decide. 

10

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Can I say two things about 

11

that?  First of all, the clear and convincing evidence 

12

issue is not in the case.  It wasn't  they didn't seek 

13

certiorari on that issue.  You know, if the Court 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

If the Court is dealing 

15

with the Federal Circuit's test and it's got these two 

16

things, baseless and 

17

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Subjective 
 subjectively, and 

19

clear and convincing evidence, I think to leave out that 

20

piece of it when it all comes out of that one paragraph 

21

in the Brooks Furniture case, so I think once the case 

22

is before us, if we leave out that one piece 

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

I don't  well, Justice 

24

Ginsburg, I do not believe that the clear and convincing 

25

evidence standard is fairly subsumed within the question

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of whether or not the objective baselessness standard 

2

ought to be applied, any more than the second case 

3

you're going to hear today is subsumed by this case. 

4

Those are  I mean, they all come out of the Federal 

5

Circuit, but it seems to me you ought to hear  you 

6

ought to grant separately on the question of the 

7

standard of review or the standard of proof at the 

8

appropriate time. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, why don't why don't 

10

we just take  there's another statute, as you know, 

11

that has identical wording, the Lanham Act, and that 

12

says exceptional means not run of the mine, uncommon. 

13

And then there's a nice illustration, a case from the 

14

D.C. Circuit. 

15

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

17
18

I read that opinion. 
Why don't we say, Well, 

we have it there in the Lanham Act, the same words. 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Right.  But there are a 

19

couple of reasons for that.  One is obviously this 

20

statute was passed long before the Lanham Act was 

21

enacted and against a very different backdrop, and 

22

Congress clearly, in literally sticking its toe in the 

23

water of allowing prevailing defendants to get fees from 

24

plaintiffs in a situation was pretty unprecedented at 

25

that point in time, set the standard very high and

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

intended for it to prevent gross injustice. 
 The legislative history of the Lanham Act, 

3

which this Court apparently was willing to read for 

4

those purposes at that time, doesn't  doesn't remotely 

5

suggest that.  And the Court didn't take into account in 

6

that opinion the  the standards under the Patent Act 

7

in interpreting the Lanham Act.  So it seems to me you 

8

could make the argument the opposite way 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

But you just look to 
 which is that the Lanham 

Act ought to be interpreted 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

13

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG:  and the text is 

You look to the text 
 the way I propose. 

15

identical in both.  The legislative history, some people 

16

like it, some people don't.  But the text is identical. 

17

So I think it would be odd to construe the very same 

18

words in the context of the Lanham Act one way and a 

19

different way in the context of the Patent Act. 

20

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, I  I  two answers 

21

to that.  One is, you know, if you  if you want to 

22

if you want to interpret them in tandem, I would say you 

23

should interpret the Patent Act in the strict way that 

24

Congress intended it to be interpreted in 1952, and the 

25

Lanham Act should follow that.

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The alternative is there is a different 

2

history.  Patent litigation and trademark litigation are 

3

very, very different in the impact that they have.  And 

4

as a consequence, you could in fact say that Congress 

5

didn't intend that. 

6

 But  but, you know, I  that seems to me, 

7

in some ways, the tail wagging the dog, and that  and 

8

that's a mistake. 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Mr. Phillips 
Justice Breyer 
Please 
The one thing I do want to 

13

say, Justice Breyer, in  in response to  to your 

14

argument about why don't you leave it for the district 

15

court in that  in that circumstance.  The problem is, 

16

is what you're saying to plaintiffs who bring patent 

17

litigation with  with, in this case, counsel's advice 

18

and experts' advice.  They got the machines.  They did 

19

everything you'd want a litigant to do before bringing a 

20

litigation.  They handled the case.  They spend more 

21

money on legal fees as the plaintiff than the defendants 

22

did in this case.  They have to hire an expert.  They 

23

put in  in play the validity of their patent. 

24
25

 There are lots of disincentives for 
plaintiffs to bring in this case.  And at the end of the

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

process, based on a completely indeterminate standard, 

2

the district court would then retain authority to say, I 

3

conclude that what you did here is unreasonable. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's true, but you could 

5

then appeal.  I mean, you're making an argument on the 

6

merits there.  And really the question is, is who's 

7

better suited to figure out whether this is a  whether 

8

this is a really special case. 

9

 And if, you know, of course, you're right. 

10

Plaintiffs are often right in these things, and 

11

sometimes they are wrong.  So  and they costs 

12

everybody a lot of money.  So you go to the Federal 

13

Circuit and ask them to review it for an abuse of 

14

discretion. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Phillips, their lawyers 

16

might well have given them different advice if they 

17

didn't know that, Hey, nothing to lose, given the test 

18

that the Federal Circuit has, you know. 

19

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, I mean, the idea that 

20

there's nothing to lose 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

would give the same advice.  Bring the suit. 

23

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Hey, I would give  I 

Justice Scalia 
This guy is a possible 

competitor, sue him.  Hey, there's nothing to lose.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

But there is something to 

2

lose.  First of all, as I say, the plaintiff  this 

3

you know, there's a reason why you don't see 

4

advertisements on television when Saiontz & Kirk says, 

5

If you think your patent has been infringed, call us. 

6

 Why? 

Because there's not a long line of 

7

people who can bring plaintiffs' patent cases.  They are 

8

expensive to litigate, and the ultimate effect  and 

9

you have to get an expert, and  and at the end, you 

10
11

put your patent into validity. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If it goes to litigation, 

12

yes.  But if  if the alternative for the defendant is 

13

either, you know, spend $2 million defending or pay off 

14

the $10,000 that  that the plaintiff demands to go 

15

away, hey, that's an easy call. 

16

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, I mean, I don't know 

17

whether that's an easy call for the defendant.  Doesn't 

18

make the  it doesn't make the decision for the 

19

plaintiff all that easy to  at the beginning of the 

20

process because, as I say, it's both expensive and it 

21

puts the validity of the patent at issue. 

22

 And in most cases, you know, the Federal 

23

Circuit, long time ago  or not that long ago said that 

24

the inequitable conduct, that is challenging what the 

25

plaintiff did before the PTO had become a plague of

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

patent litigation.  So plaintiffs who walk into court 

2

under those circumstances are not doing it without risk. 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yeah, but the  the 

4

difficulty here, I not  see it from my point of view 

5

for a second.  Of course I think that  that there's no 

6

plaintiff/defendant necessary difference of who can act 

7

badly. 

8

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Of course. 
All right.  And  and so 

10

the question is really who is likely most to know.  And 

11

I think probably the district court.  But then if you 

12

give the power to the district court, there's a problem, 

13

of course, that you'll abuse it. 

14

 So I say, Well, then go to the Federal 

15

Circuit, and say they have.  You see, well, there's 

16

another way of approaching it, and that is have definite 

17

standards, which is what you want.  And then the 

18

difficulty with definite standards is I can't think of a 

19

set of definite standards that doesn't do what you don't 

20

want to have happen, that it leans one way or the other. 

21

 I mean, it looks as if, you see, the Federal 

22

Circuit's current standards leaned pretty much against 

23

the person who was sued.  And it looks like the 

24

the  and so the government comes up, well, we can't do 

25

better than this.  It's a long list.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And  and nobody's been able to think of 

2

some, so then I say, Okay, let's try the first approach, 

3

which is what we do with the Lanham Act.  That's the 

4

whole long story. 

5
6
7

 And what you would like to say, I'd like to 
listen. 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Right.  And the answer to 

8

that is that the standards for inequitable conduct are 

9

reasonably well set.  They get applied pretty routinely, 

10
11

and they create exceptionalcase determinations. 
 Litigation misconduct, the standards are 

12

pretty well set, pretty well understood, and they give 

13

rise to the exceptionalcase determinations and award of 

14

attorneys' fees. 

15

 This case is unusual in the sense that all 

16

it deals with is that bucket that talks about whether or 

17

not you had a substantial basis for putting before the 

18

Court this litigation in the first instance.  And 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Phillips, I realize that 

20

you have this argument that this statute was before 

21

Rule 11, so the superfluity argument doesn't work. 

22

 But just as a matter of fact, would your 

23

standard give the court authority to order fees in any 

24

case in which it does not have authority by virtue of 

25

either Rule 11 or its inherent authority?

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Are  are you  are you 

2

asking me that just about the baseless litigation or all 

3

of 285?  Because clearly, inequitable conduct, willful 

4

infringement, and  and certain forms of litigation 

5

misconduct, which might  might create a basis for fees 

6

against the lawyer, might not actually operate against 

7

the  against the party where that obviously 285 

8

operates against the party.  So there's a whole range 

9

of  of behavior that is controlled by 285 that has 

10
11

nothing to do with Rule 11, et cetera. 
 So, yeah, I mean, there  there's clearly 

12

some overlap between them, but that  that overlap 

13

shouldn't be shocking because, again, 285 was enacted in 

14

1952, and Rule 11 didn't come into being a serious force 

15

until 1983. 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But let me make sure I 

17

understand you.  Give me an example of a case in which 

18

under your standard, 285 could be used to order a 

19

payment of fees, but Rule 11 and inherent authority 

20

would not allow. 

21

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Again, I mean, the  the 

22

clear one  again, if you're only talking about the 

23

baselessness component, I don't know that there is one 

24

like that. 

25

 If you're talking about inequitable conduct,

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they would all be because Rule 11 will never reach 

2

inequitable conduct involving the Patent and Trademark 

3

Office because it's completely irrelevant to that.  So 

4

the  the statutes do have some overlap, but they don't 

5

have complete correspondence. 

6

 But that  but to me, that's the key. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Inequitable conduct to the 

8

Trademark Office, but not with respect to the suit 

9

itself? 

10
11

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Right.  Right.  There is 

patent misconduct. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

13

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So there's nothing 
There is 
There's nothing with respect 

15

to the suit itself that Rule 11 and inherent authority 

16

wouldn't get you anyway. 

17

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, litigation misconduct 

18

is something that may or may not go against the party, 

19

depending on which rule it is and how it plays out.  So 

20

there  and the courts have long recognized that 

21

certain forms of vexatious behavior by litigants may 

22

lead you to a particular  to  to determine that 

23

something's an exceptional case.  So there  there seem 

24

to me clearly there might be. 

25

 What I'm  what I am conceding is that I 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I can't envision a situation where you have brought what 

2

a court has said is objectively baseless litigation in 

3

the first instance that might not have been actionable 

4

under Rule 11.  The question would be  it would be 

5

at this  at this stage it would go immediately against 

6

the party as opposed to potentially against the lawyer. 

7

And  and to that extent, it obviously provides broader 

8

relief, depending on which of the two parties might 

9

actually have more resources. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about the inherent 

11

authority  Justice Kagan brought this up  not just 

12

Rule 11, but inherent authority when the court finds 

13

that the litigation is baseless and brought in bad 

14

faith?  It seems to me that your standard is the same as 

15

what the Court could do without any statute.  Are there 

16

other pieces 

17

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

Well, today  today 

18

that's  I think that may be true.  I don't think that 

19

was true in 1946 and then again in 1952.  The  the 

20

whole notion of shifting fees to a  to a losing 

21

plaintiff was  was all but unprecedented at the time. 

22

And the best evidence we have of  of the circumstances 

23

in which Congress wanted to have those fees imposed 

24

is  is to prevent a gross injustice.  And it seems to 

25

me nothing better suits that test than something that is

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

objectively baseless, as  as just that one bucket 

2

within which 285 operates.  The other buckets, 

3

obviously, equally involve situations of gross 

4

injustice. 

5
6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
faith come in? 

7

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10

So where does the bad 

I'm sorry? 
Where does the bad faith 

come in?  Rule 11 doesn't include bad faith.  It just 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

I mean, we  we obviously 

11

have, because it's in the Federal Circuit's standard, 

12

we  we embrace it, but the reality is we  I don't 

13

need to win the bad faith argument if this Court 

14

concluded that bad faith is  it shouldn't be an 

15

independent factor.  That would  that would not bother 

16

me because the district judge already found that this is 

17

objectively not baseless, so there ought to be a basis 

18

for affirmance on that ground alone. 

19

 Alternatively, the Court obviously could 

20

wait for another case in which to take up that issue. 

21

I  I  but we don't need to win that in order to 

22

prevail on this particular case, and it certainly 

23

wouldn't cause me any heartburn if the Court were to 

24

to jettison that part of it. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Would you address the

48

Alderson Reporting Company

clear and convincing? 

2

 MR. PHILLIPS: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4
5

Yeah, I  well. 
I know your argument 

that it's not 
 MR. PHILLIPS: 

It's not in the  that it's 

6

not before us.  I mean, the rationale of clear and 

7

convincing obviously is that  is whether you assume 

8

that the patent is being implemented in good faith or being 

9

 being brought in good faith and therefore creates 

10

sort of a presumption in favor of the  of infringement 

11

and legitimacy; and then clear and convincing evidence 

12

is obviously designed to make it harder to get over that 

13

hurdle. 

14

 Again, I  I'm not here to defend the clear 

15

and convincing evidence standard.  I  I read the 

16

concurring opinion in the Federal Circuit as well and 

17

but it seems to me clearly not in this case.  It's not 

18

subsumed by the question presented and that's  that's 

19

an issue that the Court ought to wait for another day. 

20

Hopefully I won't have to defend it at that time.

 Mr. Telscher, you have 3 minutes remaining.

Take  take your time,

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RUDOLPH A. TELSCHER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. TELSCHER: 

Thank you.  What we're all 

7

really talking about here is how extreme should the test 

8

be for an exceptional case.  I mean, that's what this 

9

boils down to.  Should it be at the extreme of 

10

frivolousness, or what we believe objectively baseless 

11

means the same thing  that's how the district court 

12

used it  or should it be something lesser that's 

13

practical. 

14

 The plain meaning of exceptional doesn't 

15

mean extreme.  As the D.C. Circuit found in Noxell, it's 

16

not a hardly ever rule.  So when we look at the plain 

17

meaning it doesn't signal extreme.  When we consider the 

18

larger objectives of the Patent Act which this Court has 

19

discussed in numerous cases.  You look at Pope and Lear, 

20

where this Court said there's an important public 

21

interest in making sure, quote, worthless patents are 

22

not used to restrain trade. 

23

 Four weeks ago in Medtronic this Court found 

24

that we should have a paramount interest in making sure 

25

the bounds of patents are not unreasonably stretched to

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

get royalties.  And so when we consider the larger 

2

objective, what we're looking for is a balance, and if 

3

you look to this Court's precedent in Martin, where 

4

there was no standard, what this Court found is when you 

5

look to the larger objectives and you want to encourage 

6

good conduct and you want to discourage bad conduct, you 

7

set it at reasonable.  You don't set it at the extreme 

8

of frivolousness, which smart lawyers know how not to do 

9

that, how not to get sanctioned under Rule 11. 

10

 And in the complex world of patent cases 

11

it's not hard to avoid frivolous cases.  So setting an 

12

extreme standard would defeat the whole purpose of the 

13

Act and it's inconsistent with the language. 

14

 On the topic of injustice versus gross 

15

injustice, I found that very interesting, because 

16

certainly exceptional, there's nothing about it that 

17

signals gross injustice versus injustice.  And to the 

18

extent  because I think the question was asked by one 

19

of the Justices, well, doesn't that  that signal 

20

extreme conduct?  I don't know that it does or doesn't, 

21

but certainly the plain meaning of the statute doesn't. 

22

 And so to the extent that gross injustice, 

23

as used in this Court's opinion, it has to signal 

24

something other than the extreme conduct.  We could debate 

25

whether winning a hardfought case and spending

defend a case and spend $2 million, especially one like

 But I don't know what the standard is, 

6

justice or injustice  or gross injustice.  It's just 

7

not extreme, and that's how this Court's opinion need to

be written if we're going to discourage the maintenance 

9

of unreasonable cases.

 And there's not 15 amici briefs and some of 

11

the largest technologies companies in this country 

12

before this Court if it weren't the case that there's a 

13

problem.  These are companies with a selfinterest in a 

14

strong patent system.  They have patents; they sue.  And 

15

yet they are here telling this Court to not pick an 

16

extreme standard.
