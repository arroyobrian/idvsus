ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER 


6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 


7

9

We'll hear argument

MR. FISHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 


and may it please the Court: 


10

The Fifth Amendment prohibits using a

11

person's silence during a noncustodial police interview

12

against him at trial, and nothing about the specific

13

facts of this case give this Court cause to refrain from

14

applying that rule here.

15

To the contrary, the State's closing

16

argument in this case urging the jury to find

17

Mr. Salinas guilty because, quote, "an innocent person

18

would have denied law enforcement's accusations,"

19

strikes at the core of everything the Griffin rule and,

20

indeed, the Fifth Amendment is designed to prohibit.

21

It evokes an inquisitorial system of

22

justice.

23

the defendant, and it demeans individual dignity by

24

conscripting the defendant as a product of his own

25

demise.

It effectively shifts the burden of proof onto

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Now, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals

2

resisted this logic and held the Fifth Amendment didn't

3

apply because there was supposedly no compulsion in this

4

case in the sense that there was no physical or

5

psychological coercion of the kind that's inherent in 


6

custody. 

But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals 


7
8

simply misunderstood the nature of a Griffin claim and 


9

the nature of the compulsion.

The compulsion that 


10

Mr. Salinas faced was when the police asked him the

11

question about ballistics evidence, there was nothing he

12

could do to avoid supplying the State with incriminating

13

evidence that it could use against him.

14

If he answered the question --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why isn't it -- why isn't

16

it like the -- is it Berghuis case?

17

someone who was given Miranda warnings, and, even so,

18

the Court said he was silent.

19

Fifth Amendment; therefore, his silence can be commented

20

on.

21

MR. FISHER:

There was a case of

He didn't invoke the

No, that's not the holding of

22

the Berghuis case, with all due respect.

23

case was about whether his subsequent statements could

24

be used against him.

25

silence that preceded those statements could be used

The Berghuis

This Court didn't hold that his

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

against him, and, indeed, that would be contrary to

2

Miranda itself in footnote 37, where the Court said, if

3

somebody stands mute in a custodial setting in the face

4

of law enforcement accusations, they may not be --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then what's the law?

What

6

is -- I mean, Joe Smith leaves a -- a blank in part of

7

his tax return.

8

to be relevant, and the prosecutor wants to say, hey, he

9

left this blank.

The IRS gets it.

Later, it turns out

Okay?

10

Now, Griffin doesn't apply, right.

11

MR. FISHER:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

If the -I mean, isn't it -- you're

13

not going to say that any -- any time you refuse to tell

14

the government anything and, later on, it turns out to

15

be relevant to a criminal prosecution, that that's taken

16

as an invocation of the Fifth Amendment.

17

want to go that far?

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

I mean, do you

No, I don't need to.
Okay.

Then you need a

line.

21

MR. FISHER:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

This case is -Then what is -- then you

23

need a line.

24

we have a case they're selling tickets to the

25

policeman's ball, and somebody comes to the door, and

So where is -- there's the tax case; then

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the policeman says, hey, I haven't seen you around 


2

before, and he doesn't answer.

3

probably not an invocation. 


4

Okay?

Now, that's 


And then we have the clear line, which, in 


5

custody, and, now, you want to extend that line.

6

what I want to know if we -- if I follow you and extend

7

it, what line do I draw?

8
9

MR. FISHER:

And so

Well, it's sufficient to decide

this case to say that a noncustodial police interview

10

during the investigation of a crime, where they're

11

interviewing somebody about --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. FISHER:

So then --

-- who is -- who is, as the

14

State concedes, a suspect in a crime.

15

be that Griffin extends a little bit further, and,

16

remember, the Solicitor General at least agrees that

17

Griffin applies in a noncustodial setting.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, it may well

Well, but it's -- it's

19

well settled that, when you're -- wherein you're

20

examining the witness and he takes -- and he suddenly

21

says, I don't want any more questions, that

22

that's -- he's waived if you're in court, if you're

23

examining a witness on the stand.

24
25

So, against that background, suppose, in
this case, the facts were just about the same, and he
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said what -- the police said, what would you do if we

2

matched the shotgun shells?

3

"Well" -- and then he starts to cry.

4

"Well," and he started to cry.

5
6

MR. FISHER:

He said one word,

Admissible?

I think that would be 


admissible, but it would be forbidden for the --


7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. FISHER:

9

And he said -- he said,

Yes.

Because he said, "Well"? 

That word would be 


admissible if the State had -- had any


10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but could the

11

police officer also testify that and then he started to

12

cry?

13

MR. FISHER:

Perhaps.

But the State -- what

14

the State would not be able to do would be to argue that

15

his silence and refusal to answer the question

16

demonstrated his guilt.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or the prosecution could

18

say, Well, he said, well, and started to cry, and he

19

never told us anything else.

20

sentence that I used is impermissible?

21

MR. FISHER:

That -- that final

I think that may well cross the

22

line.

23

custodial settings, where, under Doyle and footnote 37

24

of Miranda, you've held that silence can't be used

25

against a criminal defendant.

You have the exact issue that arises already in

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So, Justice Kennedy, you're right, that

2

questions will arise in two ways:

3

that the defendant uses are tantamount to refusing to

4

answer the question, and then there is a second question

5

about physical demeanor evidence.

6

One is whether words

The law is already sorted out on this in the

7

lower courts, and I think it's a very workable test.

8

The Solicitor General agrees with what it is, and the

9

reason why this Court hasn't seen a case or -- itself,

10

seen a case like that is because, once the rule is

11

established that the prosecution can't use silence

12

against the defendant, the temptation drops away to try

13

to introduce that evidence for some, supposedly,

14

different purpose.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Fisher, but then --

16

do -- do I understand correctly that you're saying

17

demeanor is different, so, although it was impermissible

18

to comment on silence, it was okay to say he looked

19

down, he seemed to be sweating, he was very nervous, he

20

was shuffling his feet.

21

MR. FISHER:

Insofar as demeanor evidence

22

that the State offers has communicative value and the

23

State argues that it has communicative value,

24

independent of, simply, what the defendant looked like

25

when he remains silent, then it -- then it may well be
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

able to introduce that evidence. 


2

Now, as I said, as I was just finishing up 


3

telling Justice Kennedy, you're not going to have hard 


4

cases in this respect because, once the temptation --


5

once it's clear that silence can't be used, then the

6

prosecution, I think, has little motivation to try to

7

walk that line.

8

And, indeed, I think it would be appropriate

9

in a case, if the prosecution said, look, the fact that

10

the defendant started crying, we think, is relevant for

11

some reason independent of what he -- of failing to

12

answer the question.

13

they are in Griffin -- Griffin settings already, that

14

you aren't to consider the defendant's refusal to answer

15

the question against him, but --

16

The jury could be instructed, as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, may -- I have

17

a number of problems.

18

seen to be giving noncustodial defendants more rights

19

than those defendants in custody because you're arguing

20

that -- I think -- that a greater degree of expression,

21

other than silence, would be needed to show the

22

invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.

The first is your rule would be

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

No.
Or are you trying to

equate the rights that a defendant has to custodial and
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

noncustodial, with respect to invocation?

2

MR. FISHER:

No.

And I -- and this is where

3

Justice Ginsburg's question came from, so I think it's

4

very important for me to be clear on this.

5

A person in a noncustodial setting still has

6

fewer rights than a person in a custodial setting.

7

the Court held in Berghuis is that, if the defendant

8

wants to exercise his prophylactic right under Miranda

9

to cut off police questioning -- those are the words

What

10

this Court used -- that has to be expressly invoked in

11

some manner during the interrogation.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem -- I have an

13

easier problem understanding this argument with

14

respect -- and I'm going to ask your adversaries -- with

15

respect to the situation in which someone is approached

16

by the police and said, come in and talk to us.

17

a hard time understanding how the refusal to come talk

18

to them could be held against them.

19

it.

20

I have

There, I understand

But, here, your defendant went in and

21

talked.

22

more rights than Berghuis did, who remained silent for

23

2-and-a-half hours?

24

that that was an invocation of the privilege against

25

self-incrimination.

So, once he chose to do that, why does he get

The Court wasn't willing to find

Why would it find the refusal to
10


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ask one -- answer one question indicative of the 


2

privilege against silence -- or the privilege for 


3

silence? 


4
5

MR. FISHER:

Let me -- if I may, let me 


focus on the Berghuis question.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. FISHER:

I know --

And then turn to the selective

8

silence point.

9

Mr. Salinas doesn't have the right that Mr. Berghuis had

The reason why he doesn't have --

10

to cut off questioning.

11

expressly invoked, and it, indeed, can only be

12

effectuated in this setting.

13

That's the right that has to be

There was no issue in Berghuis, I don't

14

think, that his silence could be used against him.

15

State never argued in the Berghuis case that, because he

16

failed to answer for 2 hours, that shows he's guilty.

17

What the State argued in Berghuis was the fact that he

18

later confessed is what shows that he is guilty.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The

Is -- I don't want -- are

20

you saying that, before the Miranda warning is required,

21

you cannot invoke the Fifth Amendment?

22

MR. FISHER:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

No.

You can.
I mean -- that's --

that's how I understood that.
MR. FISHER:

You can.
11


Alderson Reporting Company

There's two

Official

1

different rights --

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I know you're not arguing

that, but that's why I'm --

4

MR. FISHER:

Let me separate two rights.

5

One is the prophylactic right under Miranda to have

6

police cease asking you questions.

7

and that right has to be expressly invoked in some

8

manner during the interrogation, after you've been

9

warned, in order to effectuate it.

10

That's one right,

There is a separate right, which is the

11

genuine Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.

12

this Court said, in Miranda itself and it's never

13

questioned since, that that right doesn't have to be

14

expressly invoked.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Well, but it can be

16

invoked, and that might make a big difference.

17

your -- in your brief, you acknowledge that most

18

citizens know they have a Fifth Amendment right.

19
20
21

MR. FISHER:

Right.

In

So, I think, Justice

Kennedy -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so if there's -- if

22

questions are somehow troublesome, you say, I'm invoking

23

my Fifth Amendment right; go away, even if you're not in

24

custody, even if Miranda doesn't apply.

25

MR. FISHER:

Right.
12


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And your client didn't do

that here.

3

MR. FISHER:

He didn't.

And so the

4

question -- I think, unless the Court's prepared to hold

5

that even an expressed invocation could be used against

6

him, then it reduces to the question you framed, Justice

7

Kennedy.

8

reason to require an express invocation in that setting.

And so ask yourself whether there's any good

9

Mr. Salinas, remember, did expressly invoke

10

his right to -- Fifth Amendment right to remain silent,

11

at trial, in a timely manner, asking for the evidence to

12

be excluded.

13

reason to ask him to do it sooner.

14

it's unnecessary, unfair, and a rule like that would be

15

unadministrable.

16

can.

17

So the question is whether there's a
And our argument is

So let me walk through those, if I

It's unnecessary because all the cases the

18

Solicitor General cites for an express invocation

19

principle involve a scenario where the government has no

20

good reason to know that it's seeking incriminatory

21

information.

22

And, Justice Breyer, this is the limiting

23

principle that you were searching for in the tax cases

24

and the like.

25

good reason to know that the defendant who is silent is

If the government doesn't know or have

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

likely to be exercising his right, then the government

2

needs to be put on notice because the government may --

3

may well challenge that, may well go seek a court order.

4

It may well decide to grant immunity.

5

of things.

6

It may do a number

But, here, the government would do

7

absolutely nothing different.

Police would have done

8

absolutely nothing different.

Indeed, look at the

9

record in this case.

What the Solicitor General says is

10

that Mr. Salinas should have said, "I refuse to answer

11

that question," and, if he had said that, everything

12

would be different.

13

But look at what the State argued at trial

14

and what the officer testified.

15

when we asked him that question, he wouldn't answer.

16

The prosecution argued to the jury, he refused to answer

17

that question.

18

whether he was remaining silent.

19

The officer testified,

So there is no ambiguity in the setting,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, yes, there's no doubt

20

he was remaining silent, but the issue is whether he was

21

trying to raise his Fifth Amendment right.

22

Now, suppose your rule were, whatever the

23

situation, where either the individual expressly raises

24

his right or, at the least, it's a fair implication from

25

the circumstance that he was trying to assert his right,
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would that be a sensible rule?

2

And, if so, how would your case stack up?

3

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

I think, as long as the

4

latter part of that test, Justice Breyer -- can be

5

satisfied by exercising the right, that is remaining

6

silent --

7
8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It depends on the

circumstance.
MR. FISHER:

-- in a setting in which -- in

10

a setting in which the government has every good reason

11

to know that the person is most likely to be relying on

12

the Fifth Amendment.

13

investigating a murder and bringing in somebody as a

14

suspect and asking him, basically, did you commit the

15

crime, I think it's a fair assumption -- at least absent

16

any clarification by the police -- remember, when he was

17

silent, the police would have had every right to say,

18

Mr. Salinas, why aren't you answering the question?

19

And, here, where they are

And so the police could clarify.

But,

20

absent any clarification from either the police or the

21

suspect, the more likely than not scenario -- and that's

22

the test the Solicitor General agrees should be used --

23

the more likely than not conclusion there is that he is

24

exercising the right.

25

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How would you deal with

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

another common situation where a defendant meets up with

2

the police, gives a story, and then, later, changes the

3

story.

4

volunteered that story to the -- to the police when they

5

questioned you.

6

And the question is asked at trial, you never

Would that be silence, to you?

Would that

7

be an invocation of his right not to incriminate

8

himself?

9

from arguing to the jury, as often is done, he chose to

10

Or would you -- would the prosecutor be barred

say this, but not that, so this is a made-up story.

11

MR. FISHER:

No, Justice Sotomayor, for two

12

reasons:

13

sounded like the defendant may have been on the stand,

14

and that would be an impeachment scenario that's

15

entirely different.

16
17
18

One is, if I understood your hypothetical, it

But even --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, sometimes, they

come back and later do a different confession.
MR. FISHER:

Right.

So but -- but even if

19

that were the case, then that would be basically using

20

his statement against him.

21

from a statement is not the same as silence.

22

Mr. Salinas was silent.

23

And so a material omission
Here,

Now, it's also not just that there's no good

24

reason to require some sort of magic words to be spoken

25

by the suspect, but it's unfair.

Remember, the States

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

tell you, in their amicus brief, that, if you affirm in

2

this case and adopt the rule they're asking you for,

3

police officers are going to tell people in its custody,

4

which would be nothing more than an accurate statement

5

of the law, sir, if you are silent in response to any of

6

our questions, the prosecution is going to argue that

7

that -- that shows that you're guilty.

8
9

They're also going to have every good reason
to bring people in.

I think this goes a little bit to

10

Justice Kennedy's question and -- and perhaps just yours

11

as well, the fact that Mr. Salinas did agree to commence

12

this interview.

13

Remember, he agreed --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, he's not in

14

custody.

15

All of a sudden, he gets a particular question, and he

16

says, you know, it's getting late, I think I'm done, and

17

going to go home.

18

Amendment right?

19

So let's say he's answering the questions.

Is that an invocation of the Fifth

MR. FISHER:

I think you'd have to ask that

20

to the Solicitor General.

21

requiring an invocation.

22

23

no idea of all the permutations, one of which you've

24

raised --

25

I don't -- I'm not the one

I have

Well, is that

1

something --

6

MR. FISHER:

-- but you can imagine many 


more. 

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that something 


that could be used against him at trial?
MR. FISHER:

It can be introduced.

It's

7

hard to understand how that is probative, the fact that

8

he said, I have to leave now, it's time to go.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

if that he says that -- he's answering all the

11

questions, they're fine.

12

well, is your shotgun going to match the shell?

All of a sudden, they say,

13

MR. FISHER:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

Yeah.

it's late, I'm going to go home.
(Laughter.)

17

MR. FISHER:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

Then he goes, gosh,

That seems as --

16

19

Well, it's probative

Well -That seems as

probative as the silence.
MR. FISHER:

Well -- and so -- what the

21

State cannot do is what it did in this case and sort of

22

transform that into he refused to answer, and,

23

therefore, it shows he's guilty.

24
25

And, if I could go back to the part of the
unfairness and the difficulty here, it's not -- it's
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just that -- yes, Mr. Salinas did come to the police

2

station, but remember why he came to the police station,

3

because they said, we want to bring you in to clear you

4

as a suspect, to get elimination prints.

5

So he was effectively told to come in, so 


6

that we can clear you as a suspect, asked perfectly 


7

innocuous questions at the beginning of the interview, 


8

and then everything shifted on a dime to this one 


9

"gotcha" question. 


10

And I think it's perfectly reasonable and

11

customary in out-of-court settings, where the defendant

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you draw a distinction

4

between Mr. Salinas's situation and someone who's

5

questioned in the home -- in the person's home or on the

6

street?

7

MR. FISHER:

No, I don't think there is a

8

relevant distinction there, Justice Alito, as long as an

9

investigatory interview -- and this Court has said, time

10

and again, whether it's Berkemer in a traffic stop or

11

plenty or Royer, that the police can try to initiate

12

consensual encounters.

13

again, that people don't have to participate in them, and

14

they can cut them off at any time.

15

And it would be odd --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the Court has said, time and

And what if -- what if the

17

person -- what if the person was totally unknown to the

18

police, but called up the police and said they want --

19

wants to talk to them for some purpose.

20

wouldn't draw a distinction between that situation?

to them --

right to remain silent, no.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

He wants to talk to them,

3

and then, in the course of this conversation, the same

4

thing happens that happened here.

5

MR. FISHER:

I think that might, depending

6

on the precision of the hypothetical, be a little bit of

7

a difficult -- different case.

8

I want to talk to you about criminal activity, started

9

giving statements about a -- about a past crime, so it

But, if the person said,

10

was an investigatory interview, I think it may well

11

apply.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You're -- you're giving us

13

Miranda, not Miranda, custody, not custody, gray area.

14

That -- that's what you're arguing.

15

area opinion to be written?

16

MR. FISHER:

You want a gray

No, I don't want a gray area

17

opinion.

18

Solicitor General -- and I'll let the State speak for

19

itself -- but the Solicitor General agrees that Griffin

20

rule applies in a noncustodial setting.

21

Remember, Justice Kennedy, at least the

I -- I totally understand there's a bright

22

line between custody and noncustody, and so a custodial

23

suspect is in a different situation than a noncustodial

24

suspect.

25

But all I'm saying is, again, in agreement
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with the Solicitor General, whereas all we disagree on

2

is whether the magic words need to be spoken, that a

3

person who is at least in a police investigatory

4

setting, and so the police would reasonably expect that

5

a failure to seek or answer your question was relying

6

on a Fifth Amendment --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm assuming, now

8

that I'm thinking about your argument, you would argue

9

that, even in a custodial setting, a prosecutor couldn't

10

say, I asked him, did he shoot his wife, and the

11

prosecutor can't argue that, because he refused to

12

answer, that makes him guilty.

13

MR. FISHER:

That's precisely what the Court

14

said already in Footnote 37 in Miranda, what the lower

15

courts have depended on for a generation now, and I

16

don't think my opponents are even arguing to the

17

contrary.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, in fact, at most

19

trials, district court judges tell juries the evidence

20

is not the unanswered question.

21

the answer.

22

MR. FISHER:

Right.

It's the question plus

Right.

Fair enough.

23

think that's perfectly well-established law.

24

reason is, is there any reason to distinguish for

25

purposes of the Griffin rule -- I understand there's
22

Alderson Reporting Company

I

And so the

Official

1

reasons to distinguish in the -- in the settings that

2

Berghuis raises, but, for purposes of the Griffin rule,

3

is there any reason to distinguish between a custodial

4

and a noncustodial setting?

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Yes.

The answer

6

is going to be yes because we're going to hear it in

7

one minute because, as you say, it follows a fortiori

8

for Berghuis, you know, it's -- if you're going to have

9

to make an explicit statement to invoke your Fifth

10

Amendment right, when you're not in an inherently

11

coercive setting, I mean, that's going to be the

12

argument.

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but -- but -You're not in an inherently

15

coercive setting, as you are in the Miranda situation,

16

you're not at trial, and, outside those two situations,

17

you have to say explicitly, I'm invoking the Fifth

18

Amendment --

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

No.

Constitution or something in order to indicate --

22

MR. FISHER:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

-- or tap on the

No.
-- that's what's at issue

and that's what -MR. FISHER:

Justice Breyer, this is
23


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crucial.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

If Mr. Salinas had been in a --

4

if everything about the case was identical, but he'd

5

been in custody, there would be no argument that his 


6

silence could be used against him. 


7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

8

because, there, we have a line.

9

in-custody line.

10

And that's saying 


It's called the 


Once you get outside of custody --


MR. FISHER:

But it's not because of the

11

physical or inherent pressures of custody because what

12

the Court has said, time and again, is that, after

13

somebody receives their Miranda warnings, they have a

14

free and deliberate choice whether to talk.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't want to make

16

the government's argument for them.

17

very well.

18

MR. FISHER:

And so --

They'll make it

Well, no, but I do want -- I do

19

want to make sure that the Court understands the

20

critical difference between the express invocation

21

requirement that this Court established in Berghuis and

22

what I'm asking for today.

23

And the express invocation requirement in

24

Berghuis is the -- is -- is to administer the Miranda

25

prophylactic rule, that the police have to stop asking
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

somebody questions when they invoke their rights, the 


2

rights they've just been advised of, remember. 


3

It didn't hold in Berghuis and it -- and 


4

it's never held that, if somebody is Mirandized -- and 


5

let's say Mr. Berghuis was Mirandized and just remained

6

silent for two hours, and then the police said to

7

themselves, oh, this guy is never going to talk, we end

8

the interview, there would have been no argument the

9

State could have made in that case, that his silence

10
11

could be used against him.
And so I understand that -- that -- you

12

know, I'm -- that custody is different, but, in terms of

13

the express invocation requirement, there's no express

14

invocation requirement in custody, and there's no reason

15

for it here.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I think the argument

17

will be, I think -- it is, at least in my mind, that if,

18

after sitting there for 45 minutes -- or maybe it was an

19

hour and 45 minutes -- without saying anything, I'm --

20

I'm maybe taking a dissenting position, but, if -- when

21

he answers -- doesn't answer over that long period of

22

time, but doesn't say, I want to remain silent, if that

23

long period of behavior is insufficient without the

24

express statement to show that he wanted to remain

25

silent, so, outside custodial setting, should it be
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

insufficient to simply remain silent to show that -- you

2

see, it's argument by analogy, I think --

3

MR. FISHER:

I understand, but his silence

4

wasn't able to be used against him in Berghuis; his

5

state -- his later statements were.

6

could have a scenario --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so, yes, you 


Isn't the -- isn't the 


point, Mr. Fisher --

MR. FISHER:

Pardon? 


JUSTICE KAGAN:

The question is:

11

insufficient for?

12

the purpose of cutting off police questions.

What is it

In Berghuis, it was insufficient for

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Exactly.
That's not the case here.

15

The question here is whether it's sufficient or

16

insufficient for the purpose of allowing his -- his

17

silence to be used against him at trial.

18

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20
21

Precisely.
That's an entirely different

question, isn't it?
MR. FISHER:

That's exactly my point.

And

22

remember, again, the layperson in this setting who

23

knows -- if there's one thing the layperson knows and

24

most every American knows, is that they have a right to

25

remain silent.

So somebody nervous in this setting,
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

without a lawyer, the one sanctuary they have is simply

2

not to talk.

3

If you issue an opinion that says, as the

4

Solicitor General would like, you have to pronounce some

5

sort of magic words, it's terribly unfair and terribly 


6

misleading and, again, for no good reason.

7

raises all kinds of administrability problems.

8

Court is going to have an absolute, I think, flood of 


9

cases of all the permutations of somebody under

The 


10

different kind of police warnings or the other that may

11

be given ahead of time and different kind of verbal

14

something else.

innumerable permutations.

There is

The easy rule --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Unless you're going to argue

19

that -- that silence cannot be -- can never be commented

20

on in any noncustodial situation -- and I didn't think

21

you were willing to go that far when I was questioning

22

you previously -- you're going to have the same kind of

23

line-drawing questions, aren't you?

24

MR. FISHER:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.
Where was it held?

Alderson Reporting Company

What was

1

the nature?

2

4

Who initiated it?

Was the person really

What was the purpose of the -- of the

MR. FISHER:

So as to where -- as to where

5

you draw the line, if I understand your question, as to

6

where an express invocation before trial would be

7

required, you are going to have to draw a line.

8

it's very easy to draw the line and just say a police

9

investigatory interview because that's the setting where

I think

10

the police have every reason to believe that silence is

11

an exercise of the right.

12

All the other settings, whether they be tax

13

settings, whether they be immigration cases, all the

14

totally disparate settings the Solicitor General cites

15

cases involving, it's perfectly reasonable to require an

16

advance invocation there.

17

But, remember, the Court said in Chavez that

18

the Fifth Amendment is a trial right, and so invoking it

19

at trial is perfectly timely in the ordinary setting.

20

The only question is whether you should have some sort

21

of special requirement for special reason.

22

there is no good reason, and it would be very unfair.

23

I'd like to --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN K. CURRY

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

Thank you, counsel.

MR. CURRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

Absent an invocation, a defendant's failure

8

to answer a question during a noncustodial, voluntary

9

interview should not be protected by the Fifth

10

Amendment.

11

It should be -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why, counsel?

I

12

mean, really, what you're saying is, merely because I

13

asked you the question and you choose not to answer, it

14

makes you guilty.

15

MR. CURRY:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -It -- no problem.

Here,

17

you're asking about the crime of investigation.

18

could have asked him, did you kill Joe Blow on another

19

street, and, if he had remained silent, you would be

20

arguing that proves he is guilty, I could introduce that

21

at trial.

22

But you

And you would be arguing it would be

23

sufficient to convict him, that you merely asked the

24

question and he remained silent about it shows his

25

guilt.
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CURRY:

Yeah, I don't know that that

2

would be sufficient to convict him.

3

hypothetical might suggest that the probative value of

4

that particular failure to answer a question was less --

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a little scary to 


me that an unanswered question is evidence of guilt. 


7

MR. CURRY:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

And that -- that

Well --

He is not arguing that 


the physical response is not admissible.

He is just 


10

arguing that the mere asking of a question and a failure

11

to answer it, you can't argue, as a prosecutor, that

12

that shows someone is guilty.

13

MR. CURRY:

I think one of the things we are

14

asking the Court to do, Justice Sotomayor, is to

15

recognize that silence, certainly, as occurred in this

16

case, doesn't always occur in a vacuum.

17

defendant's failure to answer this question, accompanied

18

by things that he did, along with or contemporaneously

19

with -- you know, the shuffling of the feet, the biting

20

of the bottom lip -- revealed a guilty conscience on his

21

part.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the

Well, it would be up to the

23

jury, wouldn't it?

24

Justice Sotomayor, that it doesn't prove anything that

25

he answered a question, right?

The jury might well agree with

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CURRY:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

I mean --

The question is whether you

3

can ask the jury to consider that.

4

MR. CURRY:

Correct.

And I think that's --

5

I think that's the import of our argument.

6

referenced this Court's language in Baxter, to that

7

extent, that a jury can give what weight they wish to

8

give it, but the --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we've

Your -- my hypothetical

10

that I posed earlier, if the police call you and say,

11

come in for questioning, and you ignore them, is that an

12

invocation of the right to silence or not?

13
14

MR. CURRY:

invocation, Your Honor, but I don't know --

15
16

I don't know that that's an

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why -- why could you

argue that that's --

17

MR. CURRY:

Number one, I don't think a

18

prosecutor ever would argue that because that's

19

ambiguous and not probative, and I think -- not

20

probative for someone just to not come in when police

21

offer them a chance to come in.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They -- then they're

23

arguing what the legal theory of guilt is in that

24

situation.

25

MR. CURRY:

Right.

The legal theory of

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

guilt in that situation would be lessened than it is in

2

this case because there is no -- there is nothing to

3

suggest that that defendant was guilty, necessarily,

4

because he decided not to show up to the police.

5

But, here, in this situation, the

6

defendant's failure to answer the question, accompanied

7

by the other things that he did, did reveal a guilty

8

conscience on his part.

9

that he was trying --

10

And it was nothing to reflect

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So why is

11

it -- would it be admissible that someone decides --

12

someone comes in, and they say -- police say to him or

13

her, we are investigating this crime, help us.

14

start asking questions, and it's clear from the first

15

question -- there is a waiver of Miranda, and, from the

16

first question, the first question is, did you kill this

17

person?

18

The guy remains silent.

They

They ask a whole

19

bunch of other questions, and he remains silent.

20

has he invoked his right?

21

MR. CURRY:

Had --

I don't believe he has, Your

22

Honor.

23

Miranda rights, so maybe they feel he is in custody or

24

not, but --

25

I mean, if he -- you said he was provided

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So a prosecutor could go

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

into the jury and say, he waived his Miranda rights, and 


2

he is guilty because he refused to answer our questions? 


3
4

MR. CURRY:

He is guilty if he revealed a 


guilty conscience, Your Honor. 


5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He wouldn't say that.

He 


6

would say one of the indications of his guilt is that he 


7

refused to answer the question.

8

argue that, that alone, would support a conviction, 


9

right? 


10

MR. CURRY:

No prosecutor would 


Correct, Your Honor.

And that's

11

not what we're -- that's not what we are asking the

12

Court to do here.

13

that, every time silence occurs, that's necessarily

14

going to be probative, and every time silence occurs,

15

that's necessarily going to be something that we

16

utilize.

17

We're not asking the Court to say

We're merely saying that, in this particular

18

situation, the defendant needs to tell something to the

19

police in order to reveal that he is relying on a

20

constitutional right and not merely having --

violation of the rule --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't the mere silence

suggest, "I don't want to talk anymore"?

20

how worried he is about the question than how he wants

21

to respond to it.

It might suggest that he can't
It might suggest that he is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

he did want to talk some more, right?

Correct.

He continued to

respond -- you know, several questions thereafter,
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

continuing to provide exculpatory responses.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't the most

3

logical inference from the silence not that he isn't

4

quick enough to come up with an exculpatory answer, but

5

that it would incriminate him if he answered?

6

MR. CURRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

That may be --

7

that may be a permissible inference, but I do not

8

believe that that necessarily means that he was invoking

9

his -- his Fifth Amendment right because he did continue

10

to talk.

11

investigating.

12

He already knew what the police were

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he could -- he could

13

invoke the Fifth Amendment with respect to one set of

14

questions and not another, and what's disturbing me

15

about your position, if it's -- if you have -- someone

16

being interrogated, who is savvy, will say, "I plead the

17

Fifth."

And somebody who is not that smart is just

18

silent.

To make a difference between those two people

19

on whether comment can be made on the failure to respond

is troublesome.

MR. CURRY:

allow the use of evidence, if there was no invocation

But, Mr. Curry, in a case

defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone

through the entire interview and, really, never said a

word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but

23

he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not

go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him

questions, and he didn't talk.

there, for some of the reasons that Justice Ginsburg was

saying, why should there be an invocation requirement

If there's no invocation necessary

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any authority, or

is it just your opinion that we have to go on?
MR. CURRY:

Well, I believe this Court would

23

have had the opportunity to extend Griffin, for example,

24

Doyle v. Ohio.

25

the -- the opportunity to extend Griffin in Fletcher v.

The Court did not do that.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

This Court had

1

Weir and did not do that.

2

So I do not believe this Court has

3

necessarily -- you know, sought to always attempt to

4

extend Griffin in that situation.

5

ambiguity in the standing mute phrase from footnote 37.

6

Does that mean not talking at all?

7

answering one particular question?

8
9

Now, we -- I see some

Does that mean not

In your hypothetical, if it was as probative
as it was in our case -- you know, that might be

10

something the prosecution would want to use without

11

violating the Fifth Amendment right because there's no

12

clear indication that the defendant did, in fact, rely

13

upon his Fifth Amendment right.

14

Now, I don't want to -- you know, misread

15

footnote 37, but that's how we read footnote 37 because

16

in the absence of -- there's many, many cases cited

17

there, and it's not clear that it's attempted to apply

18

an -- an extension of Griffin in that situation.

19

The rule we're -- we're offering here would

20

not -- would not change the law with regard to how it

21

exists in much of the Federal Circuits.

22

Federal Circuits, these defendants where -- where the

23

courts have held that we cannot utilize this evidence,

24

those defendants have, in fact, done something to

25

invoke.
44

Alderson Reporting Company

In much of the

So I think the -- the rule that we're asking

2

the Court to adopt would allow for these -- that case

3

law to stand; i.e., if a defendant says, I don't want to

4

talk anymore, I plead the Fifth -- you know, we're not

5

asking this Court to issue a rule that says that we can

6

introduce that.

7

All we're asking this Court to -- to

8

introduce is consistent with this Court's case law that

9

would require an invocation -- or some invocation that

10

the Fifth Amendment right was being relied upon and not

11

just a difficulty with the question or I can't think up

12

an exculpatory answer for that particular question, so I

13

don't know what to say.

14

I mean, there, the defendant is not relying

15

upon a constitutional right.

16

this Court to -- to look at whether an inference has to

17

be made that the Fifth Amendment right is being done, or

18

perhaps another inference can be -- can be provided.

19

And Baxter v. Palmigiano allows for acquiescence -- you

20

know, to -- to be something that we can utilize against

21

a defendant.

And I think we're asking

22

Here, the jury --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Where does the

24

compulsion line come in?

25

that, under this scenario, the police can ask you

questions and say to you -- you know, if you stay quiet

trial, that police will actually to that, that they'll

4

actually come in and tell defendants who are telling the

5

story -- you know, either answer or it'll be used 


6

against you. 


7

MR. CURRY:

I could perceive then, Your 


8

Honor, the -- the trial court upholding a claim by the 


9

defendant that he was coerced at that point, that, at 


10
11

that point, the officer -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why can't you say

12

that a call from a police officer to someone who says,

13

come in and talk, that that can't be used against them

14

at trial as -- you gave me a different answer.

15

it wasn't probative, but you didn't say Griffin would

16

protect that.

17

MR. CURRY:

You said

No, if -- no, if -- I don't know

18

that I would say Griffin is protecting it, but what I

19

would say is this Court's penalty jurisprudence would

20

say that, when a penalty flows directly from something

21

the defendant is -- you know, either saying or not

22

saying -- you know, that could be a problem.

23

So when an officer says -- you know, I'm

24

going to hold -- hold against you your failure to answer

25

a question -- you know, that can be something where the
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court might utilize as -- as -- for some sort of

2

penalties flown.

3

Justice -- Justice Stevens said, in his

4

dissenting opinion, in McKune v. Lile, that there is an

5

appreciable difference between some sort of sanction --

6

official sanction being placed upon a -- you know, of

7

essentially disobeying of an order, as opposed to a

8

voluntary choice arising from -- from just a possible

9

adverse consequence.

10

And, here, I think, the fact situation that

11

confronts this Court in this case is just the risk of an

12

adverse consequence and not something that necessarily

13

is going to occur.

14

However, if an officer says, I'm necessarily

15

going to use this against you, the adverse consequence

16

may become more -- more tangible at that point.

17

isn't the facts of this particular case.

18

That

I also want to disagree with Mr. Fisher with

regard to his suggestion that the police essentially

manipulated this.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS,

10

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

11

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MS. ANDERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

In Minnesota v. Murphy, this Court applied

15

the general rule that the Fifth Amendment privilege is

16

not self-executing and that a suspect must invoke it in

17

order to claim its protection to a noncustodial

18

interview in which the -- the probation officer doing

19

the questioning was aware that the questions that she

20

asked could be incriminating.

21

The Court there held that because the

22

suspect had not invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, his

23

statements could be used against him as evidence at

24

trial.

25

admissible against him when he fails to expressly invoke

A suspect's silence should similarly be

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the privilege.

Requiring invocation --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That is such a radical

3

position, that silence is an admission of guilt.

4

really what the argument is.

5

that speaking can implicate you, and, if you choose to

6

speak, clearly, whatever you say can be used against

7

you, unless you're in custody and unless you've invoked

8

the right before.

9

That's

I certainly understand

But this is radically different.

We are --

10

we are -- you're trying to say acts of commission and

11

omission are the same, but statements are different than

12

silence because, then, you're making the person who is

13

asking this question your -- your admission.

14

saying you're adopting their statement as true.

15

MS. ANDERS:

You are

Well, I think the Court has

16

repeatedly recognized that, when a citizen is

17

voluntarily interacting with the police and there --

18

there is no coercion because it's not a custodial

19

situation, we expect that person to be treated as fully

20

capable of deciding whether or not to assert his rights.

21

This is what the Court said in United States

22

v. Drayton in an analogous context, which is whether

23

someone has voluntarily consented to a search.

24

person, even if he is not told that -- that he can

25

refuse to -- to consent, we still assume that he knew
49

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

that he could refuse to consent, and, therefore, it was

2

a voluntary choice.

3

And I think you can draw the same inference

4

here, that, when someone -- we -- I think we all agree

5

that most people know -- people know what their Fifth

6

Amendment rights are, and, therefore, they can assert

7

them when they don't face any coercive pressure.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

MS. ANDERS:

10

Ms. Anders --

And so when the person does not

do that --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

We don't require

12

invocation at trial, and we don't require invocation in

13

a custodial setting.

14

custodial, that's very different because, after all,

15

custodial is inherently coercive, but that's the whole

16

point of Miranda warnings, is that, once we give Miranda

17

warnings, that coercion is dispelled and the custodial

18

setting, essentially, becomes like a noncustodial

19

setting.

20

And you might think, well,

So, if we don't require invocation, even

21

after Miranda warnings are given in a custodial setting,

22

why should we require invocation here?

23

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think the reason that

24

we don't require invocation in the Miranda setting, I

25

think, highlights the fundamental difference between
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

custodial interrogation and noncustodial interrogation.

2

So, in the custodial setting, the Court has said

3

that -- that the suspect faces inherent coercive

4

pressures to confess --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

MS. ANDERS:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

Yes, but then --


-- and, therefore --

-- you're given the 


warnings, and then that's gone. 


9

MS. ANDERS:

Exactly.

That's why we give 


10

the warnings.

11

suspect that his silence will not be used against him.

12

And so this is what the Court said in Doyle v. Ohio,

13

that, because of that promise, the suspect does not have

14

to expressly invoked, and his silence can't be used

15

against him.

16

And, in the warnings, we promise the

But, in the voluntary situation, we presume

17

that the suspect knows his rights, and, because he is

18

not facing any pressure, he can simply say, I don't want

19

to answer that question.

20

that --

21

And so when he doesn't say

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You've -- you've said in

22

your brief that there might be a whole other -- many

23

other reasons for remaining silent, and I -- I suggested

24

that the -- in -- in this kind of scenario, the most

25

likely reason that the suspect will clam up is that he
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

fears incrimination.
But what -- what obvious other reasons

3

unrelated to the Fifth Amendment, why a defendant might

4

remain silent?

5

have to say, I plead the Fifth, because we assume that,

6

when he doesn't take the stand, he is doing so because

7

he doesn't want to incriminate himself.

8
9

I mean, the Griffin rule is he doesn't

MS. ANDERS:

That's right.

The -- the

Griffin rule says -- or it's premised on the idea that,

10

when you fail to testify at trial, you're inherently

11

exercising your Fifth Amendment right.

12

But I think, when you're looking at a -- a

13

noncustodial interrogation, the question whether the

14

person is trying to exercise his Fifth Amendment right,

15

I think the operative question is not whether he wants

16

to avoid inculpating himself, it's whether he wants to

17

refuse to answer as a matter of right.

18

And I think we know that because, if you

19

look at the interview as a whole, presumably, his

20

overarching motivation is not to inculpate himself.

21

That's why his statement -- his statements can be used

22

against him at trial because those statements we --

23

we've -- the Court held in Minnesota v. Murphy, those

24

statements are inconsistent with a desire to refuse to

25

answer as a matter of right.
52

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE BREYER:

Are you -- are you

2

conceding the -- the point that they make?

3

that even if in the custodial setting he waives his

4

Miranda right, he answers 500 questions, but doesn't

5

answer one of the 500, that the prosecutor cannot 


6

comment on that fact that he didn't answer that one? 


7

MS. ANDERS:

I -- that --

I think that raises a 


different --

JUSTICE BREYER:

think?

11

Okay?

Does it?

What do you 


He says, no, you can't, and he quotes Miranda.
So what do you think?

12

MS. ANDERS:

Well, there is -- there is a

13

circuit split on that, and -- and I think the circuit

14

split shows that it raises a different analytical

15

question that the Court doesn't have to get into here.

16

The circuit split is that some courts say, as I

17

understand it, that, even after the person waives his

18

Miranda rights, Doyle still applies, and so you can't

19

use his silence against him.

20

And some of those other courts say, no, once

21

he has waived his Miranda rights, he is essentially in

22

the same situation as he would be, if he weren't in

23

custody --

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And do you have a view

on it?
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. ANDERS:

I -- I think we think that the

2

better view is that Doyle probably does not apply, but I

3

think there is a serious question there.

the Court doesn't have to resolve it here because,

5

again, that highlights a distinction between custodial

6

and noncustodial interrogation, that, once the suspect

has been promised, that --

don't really want to answer that question?

2

MS. ANDERS:

I think, if he expresses the

3

desire not to answer the question, that is sufficient

4

because he is saying, I'm not going to answer that, and,

5

implicitly, he has a right not to do that.

6

20 questions hypothetical that Justice Kennedy proposed,

7

probably that would not be sufficient by -- by analogy

8

to Thompkins, where the suspect sat silent for two

9

hours.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.

I think the

But -- but I don't

11

think you -- you were going to tell me this great deal

12

of conduct, what silence could mean other than, I fear

13

incrimination.

14

What else is --

MS. ANDERS:

Absolutely.

I think -- I think

15

there are several types -- there are several mental

16

states that silence can reflect that are both probative

17

of guilt and not consistent with the desire to refuse to

18

answer the question as a matter of right.

19

instance, the suspect could want to answer the question,

20

but have trouble coming up with an exculpatory answer.

21

So, for

He could strategically decide that he is

22

just going to sit silent for a bit, to see what else the

23

prosecution -- or, I'm sorry -- the police say, in order

24

to spin it out, see what they know.

25

dismayed or shocked, momentarily, because the question
55

Alderson Reporting Company

He could be

Official

1

reveals that the police have more evidence than he

2

thought they did.

3

So I think, in all of those situations,

4

those -- those mental states are not consistent with the

5

desire to invoke the privilege, and that's why 


6

Petitioner's rule is, essentially, a prophylactic rule 


7

that would protect a great deal of conduct that has 


8

nothing to do with the desire to exercise the Fifth 


9

Amendment right. 


10

I think -- you know, this case is a good

11

example of that, where you have a -- a suspect who

12

speaks for -- you know, several minutes -- you know,

13

half an hour, whatever, and he's answering questions in

14

an exculpatory manner.

15

to one question, and so I think the inference that could

16

be drawn there is that he was surprised by the question

17

and didn't know how to answer it in the most exculpatory

18

manner.

19

He's suddenly silent in response

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. Anders, suppose --

20

you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be

21

one thing, and then it turns out that the interview was

22

something else.

23

police really do see him as a suspect.

24

himself, I better stop answering, right?

25

He realizes, it dawns on him, that the

4

MS. ANDERS:

Is that an

I think that would be

5

sufficient, yes, to say, I don't want to answer any more

6

questions.

7

And I think -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Or, if he says, I don't want

8

to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an

9

invocation?

10

MS. ANDERS:

I think that would be

11

sufficient to invoke with respect to questions on that

12

topic.

13

important to have a clear rule here because invocation

14

does affect --

And I think, as -- as in Thompkins, I think it's

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That doesn't sound like a

16

clear rule.

17

18

particular topic, I don't want to answer that question,

19

or just like could we go on to a different question

20

or -- or I don't know.

21

I mean -- you know, as -- as between -- you

MS. ANDERS:

Why is that different?
Well, I think it's -- it's an

22

objective standard, and it's the same formulation that

23

the Court has already adopted in Berghuis and in

24

Thompkins and in Davis.

25

Court has already faced this problem, how do we know

So, in the Miranda context, the

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

when the defendant has invoked his rights and what

2

should the standard be?

3

And it has said that it is an objective

4

standard, it's what's reasonably perceived as an

5

invocation, and so -- you know, the lower courts are

6

very used to applying that.

7

administrable because --

8
9

I think it's very

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's not administrable

about telling the police you just can't argue to a jury

10

that merely not asking a question is guilt?

11

what lacks administrable?

12

MS. ANDERS:

What --

Well, I -- I think there are a

13

variety of circumstances in which, as I said before,

14

silence is probative of guilt.

15

whether you want a broad, prophylactic rule that will

16

protect a great deal of conduct that -- that has nothing

17

to do with the exercise of the right.

And so the question is

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

21
22
23
24
25

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

I'd like to make

three points.
First, Justice Breyer, your question about
the state of the law, with respect to question number
58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

432, In our reply brief, at page 4, we cite cases that 


2

are all Fifth Amendment cases, and Canterbury, also, 


3

which is a Tenth Circuit case cited elsewhere in our 


4

brief, uniformly holding that the Fifth Amendment 


5

applies.

6

The Solicitor General, when they speak about

7

a circuit split with relation to Doyle, they're talking

8

about impeachment cases.

9

which are the cases the State cited to you in response

Remember, Doyle and Jenkins,

10

to your question are impeachment cases that are entirely

11

different.

12

Second, if I -- we can look at the

13

transcript this afternoon, but I believe both the State

14

and the Solicitor General said to you, today, if

15

Mr. Salinas would have said, I don't want to answer that

16

question, then he would win, then Griffin would apply.

17

But, because it was somehow ambiguous, that it

18

shouldn't, that is ridiculous.

19

transcript in this case, what did the officer testify

20

when he said -- he asked him the question, he said he

21

did not answer.

22

If you look at the

What did the prosecutor argue to the jury in

23

closing?

24

today is all Mr. Salinas had to say.

25

State said, the police officer testified that he

Verbatim of what the State is telling you

59

Alderson Reporting Company

At closing, the

Official

1

wouldn't answer that question.

2

that.

3

He didn't want to answer

So the whole principle behind express

4

invocation jurisprudence is to put the State and the

5

police on fair notice that somebody is exercising the

6

right to remain silent.

7

this case that was going on.

There was zero ambiguity in

8

So it explains why the rule that the State

9

and the Solicitor General have fallen back on in court

10

today is formalism of the absolute worst kind, and the

11

only thing that this formal requirement of saying some

12

sort of magic words -- and I agree with Justice Kagan, I

13

don't know what they are -- but whatever they are,

14

what -- exactly what the State argued to the jury

15

apparently would have been enough, is just nothing more

16

than a trap for the unwary, who is told, through culture

17

and learning, that he has a right to remain silent.

18

And he does the one thing that is consistent

19

with his right, which is exercising it, and, somehow,

20

the State is telling you that it can walk into court and

21

say, because he remains silent, he's guilty of a crime;

22

jury, you should conclude he's guilty of a crime.

23

And, Justice Sotomayor, when you asked the

24

State, well, what about an officer that tells the

25

defendant, as he will have every incentive to do, in
60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

South Carolina v. Neville, in a roughly comparable

2

situation, that law enforcement actually admitted they

3

were already doing it, but the States tell you they'll

4

do it here, when the officer says, if you don't answer,

5

we're going to use that against you, the State said that

6

would be coercion.

7

nothing more than stating the rule the Court is asking

8

you to announce today.

9

But the officer would be doing

So wouldn't the defendant know the law?

10

Don't we assume that the suspect knows the law?

11

State's telling you, well, if the officer tells the

12

person what the law is, it's coercion.

13

And the

So, really, what we're asking today is

14

nothing radical.

15

deepest traditions, which require the government to

16

shoulder the load itself, to prove the case itself, and

17

not to enlist the defendant as an instrument in his own

18

demise.

19

It's nothing of a departure of our

People's silence -- it is the time-honored

20

concept of the Fifth Amendment, which, remember, was

21

created for out-of-court questioning by law enforcement

22

authorities, that people who remain silent could not

23

have that used against them at trial.

24
25

And, finally, I hope the -- the confusion
with respect to the Berghuis, as related to this case,
61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

I think Justice Kagan got it 


1

has been dispelled.

2

exactly right.

3

clear is that, if Mr. Salinas had said, in response to 


4

the question, I'd like for you to stop asking me 


5

questions, the police wouldn't have had to honor that.

6

But, remember, another way to make it 


Somebody not in custody doesn't have a right

7

to have questioning cut off, so the police could have

8

kept asking him questions.

9

custodial suspect has and needs to expressly invoke.

That's the only right that a

10

The right to remain silent is not something that's ever

11

had to be expressly invoked by somebody in custody or

12

not in custody, and there's no good reason to require it

13

to be invoked here.

14

If the Court has any further questions, I'd

15

be happy to entertain them.

case.

17

Otherwise, I'll submit the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'd like to go back to

18

what Justice Ginsburg argued because there is an

19

argument here that there wasn't an invocation of the

20

right, that, by physical conduct, there was a statement.

21

Would you have had a problem if the prosecutor had

22

argued at trial -- you know, when he was asked about

23

this testing, he didn't remain silent, he got nervous?
