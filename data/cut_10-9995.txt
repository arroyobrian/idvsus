Ms. Lord.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MS. LORD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Tenth Circuit, after finding that

11

Mr. Wood's petition presented two substantial

12

constitutional claims, denied him habeas relief solely

13

on the ground that his petition was untimely.

14

this even though the State had done three things that

15

should have precluded this result:

16

deliberately relinquished a known statute of limitations

17

defense.

18
19
20

It did

First, the State

Second, in doing so, the State acted
strategically, not inadvertently.
And, third, in doing so, the State induced

21

the district court to expend substantial resources in

22

deciding claims of exhaustion and -- and deciding claims

23

on the merits.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
two questions presented.

Counsel, we asked for

The first was:

Alderson Reporting Company

Do court of

Official

4
1

appeals have the power sua sponte to raise issues?

2

in your reply brief, you appear to say, yes, they do in

3

some circumstances.

4

power exists or that there is no power whatsoever?

5

And

So, are you conceding that that

MS. LORD:

I'm proposing a clear line that

6

would divide situations in which the court of appeals

7

would have power and those in which it absolutely has no

8

power.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

power or a question of exercise of discretion?

11
12

Is that a question of

MS. LORD:
power, and this is why:

13

I would say it's a question of
I --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That seems sort of

14

strange.

15

can do something or you can't.

16

can do it sometimes, that's still power, and then the

17

question is, did you do it when you couldn't do it?

18

Both rely on a factual situation.

MS. LORD:

That's power.

Either you
If you

Well, what I'm proposing is that

19

there are situations when it is never a proper exercise

20

of the appellate court's jurisdiction to consider sua

21

sponte a statute of limitations defense even in the

22

habeas context.

23
24
25

And now --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that's what we

said in Day, isn't it?
MS. LORD:

Correct, that in Day the Court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

said that courts -- "courts" -- it wasn't directed at

2

appellate courts, but no court would be free to

3

disregard a deliberate waiver of a statute of

4

limitations defense.

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, all this fight is

about is whether there was a deliberate waiver or not?

7

MS. LORD:

Well, that's --

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MS. LORD:

As opposed to power?

That's our primary -- our primary

10

argument is that there was a deliberate waiver in this

11

case, and, given what this Court said in Day, the case

12

could be resolved on that narrow ground.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it is -- it is what

14

the -- swords are crossed over here because you say this

15

is a deliberate waiver, and the government says, no,

16

it's -- it's a forfeiture, and forfeiture -- if it's

17

forfeiture, then the court of appeals has discretion to

18

take it up.

19

so, it's a question of which box this case fits into:

20

Is it forfeiture or is it waiver?

21

it's waiver.

22

If it's a waiver, then Day makes clear --

MS. LORD:

And your position is

That's correct, and my position

23

also is that there is an overlap between those boxes and

24

that when the statute of limitations defense is

25

forfeited in the sense of not being preserved in a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

timely manner because of a deliberate choice, I mean --

2

and in this instance --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are there a lot of cases

4

raising the -- you know, the ambiguity that exists in

5

this case?

6

is about, I think we ought to dismiss this -- dismiss it

7

as improvidently granted.

I mean, if you tell me that's all this case

8

MS. LORD:

Well --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We don't sit here to decide

10

whether when the government says, you know, we do not

11

concede it but we're not arguing it, or whatever the

12

language was -- we don't sit to decide factual questions

13

like that, that come up in a particular case.

14

I thought we took this case to decide the

15

more significant issue, on which there is a division in

16

the lower courts, as to whether there is, as you say,

17

power of the court to disregard the fact that a statute

18

of limitations defense has not been raised.

19

agree it wasn't raised.

20

or not is another question.

21

to decide, I don't want to decide that.

22
23

We all

MS. LORD:

Now, whether it was forfeited
If that's all you want us

Well, I clearly want a decision

that would favor my client.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MS. LORD:

This --

This Court granted cert on two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

issues, and certainly this case presents the first

2

issue, which is whether a court of appeals, once the

3

State has had an opportunity to raise the statute of

4

limitations defense and chooses not to, whether the

5

court -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Only the opportunity or

7

when it acknowledges -- in Day, we faulted the district

8

court for not telling the State, essentially, which we may --

9

not telling the State that it had a potential statute of

10

limitations defense.
Is it your position that if the State had

11
12

just been silent about the statute of limitations

13

defense and not raised it, that the court of appeals

14

wouldn't have power?

15

because they knew they had the defense and didn't raise

16

it that the court of appeals didn't have power to sua

17

sponte raise it.

Or is it your position that

18

MS. LORD:

19

ordered the State to announce -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Well, both -- the district court

You're not answering my

question.

22

MS. LORD:

I'm sorry.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does the court of

24

appeals have the power to sua sponte raise it if the

25

State -- neither the court or the State addressed the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

issue?

2

MS. LORD:

Probably yes.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Probably yes.

All right.

So, it

4

doesn't have the power if the issue has been raised?

5

that your position?

6

MS. LORD:

That's correct.

Is

If the stage of

7

the proceedings is after it was in Day, because in Day

8

when the issue arose under the Rules of Civil Procedure

9

and under traditional treatment of statute of

10

limitations defense, there was still time for the State

11

to announce we -- there was still time for the State to

12

change or to raise the statute of limitations defense.

13

Here --

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

It sounds to me that what

15

you're -- what you're arguing is that the court of

16

appeals abused its discretion in viewing this as a plain

17

forfeiture, which you've just said would permit the

18

court of appeals to raise the issue sua sponte, instead

19

of a deliberate waiver.

Is that what it comes down to?

20

MS. LORD:

21

mean, there are forfeitures by --

22

Or a purposeful forfeiture.

JUSTICE ALITO:

I

They put it in the wrong --

23

they -- they abused their discretion by putting it in

24

the wrong box.

25

box; they put it in the deliberate waiver box.

They didn't put it in the forfeiture

MS. LORD:

Well, the way the court of

2

appeals handled it will create problems if it's approved

3

by this Court because --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, this is what -- this

5

is what troubles me about your argument that the court

6

of appeals abused its discretion.

7

you did not raise the issue of the court of appeals'

8

lack of authority to raise this sua sponte until

9

rehearing?

10

MS. LORD:

Is it correct that

What happened, Your Honor, is

11

that we were appointed at the certificate of

12

appealability stage, and we were ordered to brief

13

timeliness.

14

briefed timeliness, but I also set out exactly what

15

happened, which is in the briefs and which sets forth

16

the State's position.

17

Perhaps I took the order too literally.

I

The court itself raised Day and raised its

18

limited authority under Day to consider a statute of

19

limitations defense.

20

deliberate waiver, which I believe the record supports,

21

that the State's comments were cryptic, and I will

22

stress --

23

They found, rather than a

JUSTICE ALITO:

But youâ€™re -- but you're arguing

24

that the court of appeals abused its discretion by

25

failing to rule in your favor on an argument that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

didn't make?

2

MS. LORD:

No.

I -- the court was aware of

3

Day, and the court analyzed what it was doing under Day,

4

and it determined whether there was a deliberate waiver.

5

Once the court found there was a deliberate waiver, I

6

definitely challenged that finding.

7

strong argument not included within the -- the -- the

8

questions presented, that this is a totally timely

9

petition.

I -- there's a very

And it's only a -- it's a very difficult

10

argument, which is one of the reasons why it shows how

11

much the State's actions in the district court were

12

strategic.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you had two

14

opportunities at least to make the argument based on the

15

original postconviction motion, the 1995 postconviction

16

motion.

17

twice.

18

You -- you did not raise that.

MS. LORD:

You were silent

Silent on the impact of the 19 --

19

we were not silent on the impact of the 1995 motion.

20

We've always said, and in fact the State has never

21

disputed, that that was a properly filed motion, and the

22

only issue was whether it was tolled -- whether it

23

tolled the statute of limitations period until 2004.

24

And the State realized that that issue -- if they were

25

to prevail on the timeliness issue, it was a very, very

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

difficult issue.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then, I'm confused

3

because I thought that there was -- it was conceded that

4

the question was asked, did you file another

5

postconviction motion?

6

MS. LORD:

Answer:

No.

I understand your question now.

7

When Mr. Wood was pro se, he filled out pro se motions,

8

and in those pro se motions, he did say that there --

9

and I'm talking about the 2004 motion -- he said there

10

was no prior postconviction motion.

11

And I believe he was confused because if you

12

look at the forms, both the Federal forms and the State

13

forms that show what a -- a defendant should check, it

14

makes it sound like a motion has to have been ruled on.

15

And Mr. Wood was pro se and simply confused.

16

else was confused once the State entered their

17

appearance.

18

pending.

19

bring up the minute orders from the State, and they

20

could learn that.

21

And no one

They knew that the 1995 motion was still

All they had to do was sit at a computer and

So, the courts in making their rulings

22

always from the time -- and, you know, one of the

23

reasons why what happened was so strategic and so clear

24

is that the district court had initially dismissed

25

Mr. Wood's petition as untimely.

And --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Lord, could I ask you

about the first question presented?

3

MS. LORD:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

As I understand the opposing

5

argument, it goes sort of like this:

6

we said it's fine to do this in the district court.

7

Even if the party hasn't raised it, the court can raise

8

it on this exact issue.

9

respect to a different issue that the appellate court

In Granberry, we said with

10

could raise it.

11

issues were really the same.

12

It says, in Day,

And, in Day, we said that those two

So, that seems sort of like a logical

13

argument that just gets you to a place where you lose on

14

the first question, unless perhaps there's a difference

15

between a court raising a question sua sponte and a

16

court allowing a party to raise it later than the party

17

ought to have raised it.

18

distinction, or are you questioning the logic of the

19

basic argument that Granberry and Day decided this?

20

MS. LORD:

Are you relying on that

Both.

And with respect to the

21

first argument about there being a difference between a

22

party presenting an issue and a court sua sponte raising

23

the issue, there is a difference.

24

circuit courts do not always make that distinction and

25

do not always focus on that.

And the courts -- the

For example, in Granberry,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

it actually was a case where the party presented -- the

2

State presented on appeal the exhaustion issue, and the

3

court agreed to hear it even though the State hadn't

4

raised it below.

5

Here, you know, at least five times in our

6

joint appendix, you'll see the court saying that they

7

can't act as an advocate for Petitioner.

8

fact, when the Petitioner, Mr. Wood, tried to raise an

9

-- the exhaustion issue again, the Tenth Circuit in its

And in,

10

certificate of appealability said he is bound by his

11

decision to dismiss these unexhausted claims,

12

notwithstanding his pro se status.

13

breath, the court of appeals resurrected the at least

14

concededly forfeited statute of limitations defense on

15

behalf of the State.

16

But I'd also like to --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in the same

I'm a little confused.

18

You seem to be arguing that because the court of appeals

19

raised it before the party did, that that's worse than a

20

party raising it first.

21

that -- that the court of appeals has more power after a

22

party who has forfeited below or waived below now tries

23

to come up on appeal and assert a defense that they

24

didn't assert below?

25

power?

Is that your position?

That

Now the court of appeals has more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

MS. LORD:

It raises different concerns.

2

concern is not the relative power.

3

court is raising something sua sponte, it defeats the

4

party presentation principle.

My

It's that when a

That's one concern.

5

When the court is -- when the party raises

6

it after having forfeited, everyone concedes here that

7

they wouldn't be allowed to.

8

happens is the court is acting as a super-advocate

9

for --

So, in essence, what

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

rejected in Granberry and Day.

12

MS. LORD:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

MS. LORD:

But those arguments were

Well, that -Why should they win now?

Well, and that was -- I was going

15

to -- I had a second part of my answer to Justice Kagan,

16

which is there's something really different going on in

17

Granberry and in Day, and you can't add the two and come

18

up with a neat package such as what's suggested by the

19

State.

20

And, in Granberry, of course, as the Court

21

all knows, the Court was dealing with exhaustion, and it

22

was dealing with exhaustion, which goes to the heart of

23

habeas and comity and all those concerns, at a time when

24

dismissing a case to exhaust claims -- all that would do

25

is delay Federal relief.

It wouldn't eliminate Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

relief.

2

And this Court in Rhines v. Weber recognizes

3

that when AEDPA -- AEDPA was passed, it transformed the

4

landscape, and it really made some changes.

5

the -- the notion in Granberry that exhaustion can be

6

raised for the first time on appeal transfers to the

7

statute of limitations -- I think there's real doubt

8

about that, and I think that goes to an important

9

question and the question that the Court granted cert

10

And whether

on.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But didn't Day say that

12

those two issues were functionally identical for this

13

purpose?

14

MS. LORD:

Not for this purpose.

And by

15

"this purpose" I mean the court of appeals' authority to

16

raise sua sponte the defense.

In Day, this Court --

17

there were two prongs to Day.

In the context of Day,

18

which was, you know, where the State had filed a Rule 5

19

response and patently erroneously calculated the -- the

20

limitations period, and the court noticed it, and

21

there's no law that required, as this Court held, the

22

court to muzzle itself and not mention you've

23

miscalculated these days.

24
25

We're in a totally different situation.
the Rules of Civil Procedure allowed what happened in

Alderson Reporting Company

And

16

2

And --

They don't allow what happened in our case.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

applies here?

5

here.

6

governs this?

You're talking about appellate procedure

Is there a rule of appellate procedure that

7
8

What Rule of Civil Procedure

MS. LORD:

I'm referring to Civil Rule of

Procedure 8(b) and 12.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they refer to what

10

happens in the district court, and Day dealt with that.

11

Now you're in the court of appeals.

12

that addresses the situation in the court of appeals?

13

MS. LORD:

What rule is there

Well, there's the traditional

14

rule that if you don't raise it, you lose it, when we're

15

talking about a statute of limitations defense.

16

it's really key here because when AEDPA engrafted this

17

1-year statute of limitations into the habeas

18

proceedings, it knew how 1-year statute of limitations

19

were treated.

20

Court held that in that context you're going to treat

21

those defenses the same, especially with respect to Rule

22

4, which would allow a court to dismiss a petition just

23

on its face.

24
25

And

And, yes, in Day, quite correctly the

JUSTICE ALITO:

You made an argument in your

brief that I found a little difficult to follow, but --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

so, maybe you can explain it.

2

that the State's position on timeliness in the district

3

court somehow induced your client to dismiss the claims

4

that were arguably not exhausted.

5

difficult to understand why the -- why your client's

6

strategy as to whether he wanted to dismiss those claims

7

or not would be affected by the State's position on

8

timeliness.

9

MS. LORD:

You seemed to suggest

And I found it

Well, if the State had challenged

10

timeliness at the stage that AEDPA contemplates it

11

would, it would have created a real complicated issue on

12

abandonment, and I think the briefs suggest just how

13

complicated that is under Colorado law.

court, could have appointed counsel for Mr. Wood, I

17

the Tenth Circuit found, the issue was so complex that

18

counsel was necessary.

19

And if that had

So, once you had counsel, in the State's

reply or in its answer, they indicated that several of

Mr. Wood's claims were not exhausted.

17

I don't understand the connection.

18

MS. LORD:

Well, the connection is the State

19

guaranteed that they would not challenge timeliness, and

20

that allowed Mr. Wood to go forward on two

21

constitutional claims without ever having to worry that

22

they would be subject to time bar.

23

And when the court --

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, I understand why that's

25

a benefit to him, but what is the connection between

26

that and the dismissal of the unexhausted claims?
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

MS. LORD:

Oh.

Because if they had -- if

2

they had challenged timeliness, they would have raised

3

this very complicated issue, because the only way they

4

can win on timeliness is to win on this newfangled

5

notion of abandonment under Colorado law, which under

6

Colorado law requires a hearing and requires factual

7

development.

8
9

And once they pursued in the district court
that claim of abandonment, it was very likely that a

10

lawyer would be appointed.

That lawyer could see that

11

there were claims still pending in the 1995 motion and

12

could possibly have sought a stay and abey, could have

13

gone and tried to exhaust those claims, serious

14

constitutional claims that were in the 1995 motion.

15

And -- and maybe a better way of putting it

16

is if they had raised timeliness in the district court,

17

abandonment would have been front and center.

18

though the court of appeals ultimately resolved this

19

issue without an evidentiary hearing, that was an abuse

20

of discretion itself, too.

21

Colorado law, analyzing that issue.

22

And even

It was totally contrary to

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In contrast to the new and fairly
complicated set of doctrines my friend asked the Court

10

to adopt today, this Court can resolve this case by

11

applying two straightforward longstanding rules.

12

First, in Granberry v. Greer, the Court

13

recognized that courts are not bound by a State's

14

failure to properly argue and preserve a procedural bar

15

to a habeas claim.

16

And, second, to the extent there is an

17

exception to that rule for deliberate waivers, the Court

should apply the common rule that a waiver must be

unequivocal.

This Court's decisions in Granberry and Day

Ms. Sherry, there is one

it late.

11

So, why should that difference not matter?

12

If you think that party presentation has some

13

consequence in this area, you might think that that

14

difference does matter, that once you get to the court

15

of appeals and even then the party doesn't raise it,

sort of enough is enough.

12

been worried about sandbagging or strategic behavior, I

13

think that's largely absent in circumstances where the

14

court is raising it on its own motions as opposed to the

15

party belatedly raising the issue on appeal.

16

For example, to the extent this Court has

So, I do think if you look at Granberry, you

17

look at Day, you look at Caspari, you look at Schiro,

18

and you look at the procedural default cases, I think

19

that really does resolve the first question presented.

20

And, again, I don't think Petitioner really argues

21

otherwise at this point.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I may have forgotten

23

the procedural complications of this case, but here, did

24

the State have any opportunity before the court of

25

appeals to raise the timeliness issue prior to the time

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

when the court of appeals issued its certificate of

2

appealability?

3

issued a certificate of appealability on the issue of

4

timeliness, would the issue have come up at all?

5

And if the court of appeals had not

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

The State did have an

6

opportunity in the court of appeals because, after the

7

application for a certificate of appealability was

8

filed, the court did order the State to file a response,

9

and the State didn't argue timeliness in that response.

10

But when the court of appeals did ask for briefing on

11

this issue in the certificate of appealability process,

12

the State, of course, did have an opportunity to respond

13

there, and it did argue that the petition was untimely,

14

and it strongly argued that.

15

And so, I guess, turning to the second

16

question presented, of deliberate waiver, I don't think

17

there has been a deliberate waiver in the way that Day

18

spoke about that term here for two primary reasons.

19

Number one, when Day spoke of deliberate waiver, it

20

spoke of overriding a State's deliberate waiver, and I

21

think if you look, when the court of appeals decided the

22

timeliness question, there's no way to look at that as

23

the State -- as a court, rather, actually overriding the

24

State's deliberate waiver.

25

argued that the petition was untimely.

At that point, the State had

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

Petitioner never argued that the court

2

shouldn't decide the issue, never argued that that --

3

that the State had waived that issue below.

4

at that time, it's really difficult to characterize that

5

as overriding the State's deliberate waiver.

6
7
8
9

And I think

The other point I would make is in the
district court -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the difference is

that in Day counsel didn't know that he had a statute of

10

limitations defense.

11

In this case, the defendant -- I mean, the -- the

12

attorney knew, the State's attorney knew, they had a

13

statute of limitations defense and nonetheless told the

14

court we won't challenge timeliness.

15

So -- but the court suggested it.

It seems a big difference between the

16

factual background of Day, where the lawyer didn't know

17

there was a statute of limitations defense, and this

18

one, where the lawyer knew very well there was and

19

decided to tell the district court not to -- not to deal

20

with that issue.

21

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I -- I think that

22

certainly is true, but I think it's important, in

23

deciding whether or not this should be treated as a

24

deliberate waiver, to look at what the consequences of

25

treating it as such would be.

The consequences of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

treating it as a deliberate waiver under the language of

2

Day is that the court's hands would be bound; the court

3

would be unable to decide the timeliness question.

4

it's not just the court of appeals; it's the district

5

court as well.

6

waiver in district court when the State filed its

7

pre-answer response, the district court would have been

8

without any authority to consider --

9

So, if this were a clear deliberate

the issue in the defense.

So, why is that -- why is

The -- I -- imagine the facts are

Okay?

Well -Now, in two and three, you

You could say the reason that we depart

24

from the normal rule that you have to actually assert it

25

in your defense is we're trying to protect the State

So, we protect the State at least by

2

giving them a chance to make the argument when they

3

forget or some other reason.

Now we gave them the

4

chance.

Who cares?

Now they say:

5

If that's their attitude, why is

6

it the habeas court's business to protect the State from

7

themselves?

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:
about the State.

Because it's not just

Because it's -- because of the

10

institutional interests that are at stake.

11

why Granberry and Schiro and Caspari and Day allowed

12

there to be consideration of these issues despite

interest --

It's because of the institutional

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

17

And that's

Despite forfeiture?
Despite forfeiture.

Right.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

And -And -- and that's the

20

very question here, whether it should be treated like

21

forfeiture or whether it would be treated like waiver.

22

And the reason why I think it would be a bad result to

23

treat it as waiver here and why it would be bad to have

24

bound the district court's hands in this case, if you

25

look at what happened here, the district court on its

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

own motion initially dismissed this as untimely.

2

came back and it went to the State and said, you know, I

3

need more information.

4

additional information.

5

It

And the State provided that

It would be a somewhat odd system for --

6

when the district court now had this information in

7

front of it, now knew about the 1995 motion, for it not

8

to have been able to do anything further with respect to

9

timeliness on -- on that point.

The fact that the State

10

for whatever reason decided to press other issues

11

shouldn't bind the district court's hands except in the

12

rarest of circumstances.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Except we have a system

14

where the court doesn't raise issue on its own.

15

ordinary rule is the party presents it, and when the

16

party says to the court we will not challenge

17

timeliness, it seems to me that's quite a different

18

thing from just having an answer that doesn't raise the

19

defense.

20

that we -- we are not making this an issue.

21

The

It's affirmatively representing to the court

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

And -- and to be clear, I

22

think that's certainly a factor that the courts can and

23

do consider in deciding whether to exercise their

24

discretion to consider a timeliness issue.

25

here is whether or not the court should lose any

6

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

8

position would be that it should be strictly construed

And our

because of the consequences of that waiver.

11

I think it's significant that the Court in Day did talk

12

about overriding a State's deliberate waiver.

13

And, again,

In the dissent, Justice Scalia, you

14

mentioned the example of a court amending a party's

15

pleading over that party's objections.

16

really is a narrow circumstance in which the waiver rule

17

should operate.

And I think that

18

It's not that the State's behavior is

19

irrelevant to the question before the court as to

20

whether the court should exercise its discretion; it's

21

actually quite relevant, and it's something that courts

22

of appeals can and do look at.

23

or not the courts lack any authority to consider a

24

limitations defense or other procedural defense --

25

The question is whether

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

So, you're saying

Official

49
1

that if the court of -- court says, you know, you have a

2

good state -- limitations defense, you would clearly win

3

on that, but I'm going to ignore it, even though you

4

didn't raise it?

5

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would it be an abuse

7

of discretion for the court not to accept a valid,

8

evident statute of limitations defense on the ground

9

that the State didn't raise it?

10

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I think under Day -- the

11

question is whether it's a deliberate waiver, and I

12

think, under Day, the Court said quite plainly that it

13

would be an abuse of discretion in those circumstances.

14

And I think there are a limited number of circumstances

15

where -- where that makes sense, and I think the Court

16

has seen examples of that recently this term, for

17

example.

18

The Court denied cert in a case, Buck v.

19

Thaler, earlier this term, where -- a predecessor case

20

that is an example of the State expressly waiving a

21

procedural default defense because it wanted the court

22

to reach the merits.

23

plainly -- in the predecessor case, I should say, the

24

State said quite plainly because the use of race in the

25

punishment phase seriously undermined the fairness and

In that case, the State said quite

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KATHLEEN A. LORD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. LORD:

The problems with the rulings

12

urged by the amicus and by the State are severalfold.

13

One, it's not contemplated at all by AEDPA that the

14

1-year Federal timing statute of limitations would be

15

subject to such a wide latitude in the court of appeals

16

to resurrect defenses.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

If a State knows that it has

18

a potential statute of limitations defense and says

19

nothing, is that a forfeiture or a waiver?

20

MS. LORD:

It would be a violation of

21

Rule 5, which requires them to assert a time bar if they

22

are required to file a response.

23

would have been a violation of the court's order.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

In our case, it also

So, simply saying nothing

can be a waiver, in your view.

MS. LORD:

Probably not.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if you are --

If the answer to that is

3

not, then what is the difference between saying nothing,

4

knowing that you have a defense, and saying we're not

5

challenging but we're not conceding?

6

What is the difference?

7

MS. LORD:

Well, by not conceding, that

8

doesn't undercut the deliberateness of the waiver.

9

actually establishes it.

It

It establishes that they know

10

that there's a defense, and they're not agreeing that

11

the petition is timely, but they're deliberately

12

choosing not to assert the statute of limitations.

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

more way, and then I'll --

15

MS. LORD:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me just ask it one

I'm sorry.
Back in the office, they're

18

considering what they're going to do.

19

well, what we're going to do is we're not going to

20

challenge it, but we're not going to concede it.

21

therefore, they say nothing.

22

MS. LORD:

And they say,

And,

In the face of Rule 5's

3

and clear.

4

there also has to be an advisement by the court.

5

don't think they're going that far.

6

I don't know if they're suggesting that
I

But the fact is, you look at the nature of

7

the waiver or the right being waived.

And this Court

8

recognized in Hill v. New York and other cases that if

9

the right being waived is, for example, the right to be

10

tried in a timely fashion under IAD, it can be waived

11

just by a lawyer accepting a date.

12

And the statute of limitations issue here is

13

a typical strategic decision.

14

this in, it didn't bring it in as it brought in comity.

15

It is something to move the case along from the Federal

16

point of view.
