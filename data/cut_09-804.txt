Mr. Olson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Congress crafted a carefully balanced ERISA

12

enforcement scheme that enables plan participants to

13

recover plan benefits under section 502(a)(1)(B) and

14

equitable remedies for ERISA violations under section

15

502(a)(3).

16

In this case, Respondents are seeking a

17

remedy for misleading plan summaries that violated

18

ERISA.

19

plan summaries, is under 502(a)(3), equitable remedies,

20

not for plan benefits under 502(a)(1)(B).

21

22

antecedent to any of the other questions in this case,

23

and ERISA carefully structures, and this Court has

24

repeatedly said the Court is not interested and does

25

not -- is not willing to alter the structure that

The section

Congress carefully crafted and carefully developed over

2

the years to provide remedies with respect to ERISA

3

programs.

4

And the scheme is such that, if there is a

5

participant to the plan who is seeking benefits under

6

that plan, section (a)(1)(B) of -- subsection (a)(1)(B)

7

of section 502 provides for relief under the plan.

8

there are other violations of ERISA, section 502(a)(3)

9

provides for equitable relief.

10

If

That is the scheme

carefully developed by Congress.

11

Now, in this case what happened is that

12

Cigna changed its pension program, its ERISA plan, from

13

a defined benefit plan to a cash benefit plan, a cash

14

value plan.

15

summaries of the new plan that the district court found,

16

and the court of appeals affirmed, were misleading in -­

17

in the sense that they did not provide all of the

18

information necessary for plan participants to evaluate

19

what was happening.

And it put out, as required by ERISA,

In other words -- they were not accurate.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, when you say

8

the employees had no choice, but the district court

9

found, didn't it, that the reason for this plan summary

10

being misleading was that the employer, Cigna, feared

11

that there might be a backlash on the part of the

12

employees if they found out, if they were told the truth

13

about this plan; that is, that it was less favorable,

14

that they would not have the same benefits that they had

15

under the prior plan?

16

MR. OLSON:

That is correct, Justice

17

Ginsburg.

18

could adopt a change in the plan, as it did.

19

permitted under ERISA, but it was required to give

20

accurate summaries.

21

They had no choice in the sense that Cigna
That was

The choice that you're suggesting and the

22

district court was concerned about is that an individual

23

could have left the employ of Cigna if he or she was

unhappy with the change in the plan, or the district

court said there could have been some sort of a protest.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Olson, we have

8

several times referred to the plan as having a range of

9

documents associated with it, not as having just a

10

single written instrument, but we referred to documents

11

and instruments governing the plan.

on.

We did that in

that govern the plan.
MR. OLSON:

And one would think that

It's quite clear from the

structure of the statute that is correct, as you

suggest, that there may be multiple instruments or

22

documents that are the -- create the plan itself.

the summary plan document, the SPD, is not a part of the

Well, the written instruments,

the opposite?

25

Because the statute seems to be written

MR. OLSON:

And together, they all somehow

Well, I -- I submit that that is

Alderson Reporting Company

not the way the statute is written, and subsections (2)

2

and (4) of the provision that I was referring to make

3

that clear if the word "summary" itself did not make

4

that clear.

5

referred to in your earlier question also proves that.

6

Curtiss-Wright case talked about a summary

But the Curtiss-Wright case to which you

8

using "plan," "summary plan description," in different

9

terms -- it cannot modify the plan, which is what the

10

district court here held, unless the plan specifically

11

says that it may be modified in a certain way and that

12

the summary is an appropriate amendment to the plan.

13

the Court -- and this was a unanimous decision of this

14

Court -- was referring to the summary as something that

15

was separate, that might modify the plan if the plan

16

itself allows for it to be modified in that fashion.

17

So

Now, the Government says that the summary

18

plan description is a part of the plan and so do

Respondents.

21

of the plan.

its opinion, that it was a modification, it was an

23

amendment to the plan.

district court said was that they would treat the plan

as containing what the summary said, not that -- that it

I thought that was what the district court

11

13

that the terms of Part B have been correspondingly

referring, Justice Ginsburg, to the relief that the

court ordered, but the court was ordering that relief on

19

20

it to be amended in that way.

21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the SPDs -­

MR. OLSON:

3

Joint Appendix, specifically say that if there's any

4

5

governs.

6

at the bottom of 922a.

7

The language is at the bottom of, for example,
So -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the SPD can't negate the

8

force of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has

9

to be consistent with the plan documents, nothing in the

10

SPD can negate that requirement.

11

MR. OLSON:

That's correct.

No one -- but

12

Congress did consider prohibiting a provision like that

13

in SPDs, that they could not disclaim, they could not

14

say that if there's any inconsistency, the plan

15

governed, and Congress did not adopt such a provision.

16

This is a perfectly legal provision, to tell

17

someone that if there's any discrepancy -- and there's

18

bound to be discrepancies, the -- as I said, the plans

19

themselves can be 90, 100 pages, very long and very

complex.

That's why there is an SPD that can't contain

MR. OLSON:

Curtiss-Wright talked

It

It seems to me -- I think we

17

might disagree about that, respectfully.

18

the sense of the opinion in Curtiss-Wright was that if

can only do so if the plan permits the SPD to modify the

Then you can't -­

Excuse me, Chief Justice.
Then you can't

5

require, it seems to me, each individual to make a

6

calculation about whether they have actually been

7

harmed, whether there's detrimental reliance.

8

point of these plans is to give people some comfort and

9

assurance when they are age whatever, that:

The whole

Don't

10

worry; retirement is taken care, or at least I can rely

11

on that.

12

And your formulation would sort of put that

up in the air and say:

14

be harmed or not; wait until you're 65 and we will see.

MR. OLSON:

The Rules Enabling Act provides

that a class mechanism cannot change the substantive

10

provisions of law.

11

this is brought as a class action, the rules of equity

12

somehow change.

13

And so, it cannot be that, because

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then the question is,

14

under the -- under the section that the district court

15

proceeded under, not the one that you say is proper, a

class action would be appropriate.

MR. OLSON:

A class action might be

appropriate, but it would not change the detrimental

reliance requirement.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My question had no import.

I really wanted to know the answer to that.

(Laughter.)

4

MR. OLSON:

Well, the answer -- the answer

5

is what the district court ordered and the Government

6

seeks and the Respondents seek, is they're all harmed by

7

this, that there's any material disparity, then

8

everybody -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe it wouldn't be too

10

hard.

11

in light of a certain set of characteristics, and the

judge would find that, other things being equal,

individuals who have that set of characteristics which

in this circumstance make them members of the class

would be harmed in all likelihood, okay?

They're -- they're joined as members of the class

Now, it's up to -- it's up to the -- the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. BRUCE

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BRUCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

16

Our position is that detrimental reliance is

17

not found in section 102 of ERISA, which establishes the

18

summary plan description requirement.

19

section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA, which establishes the

20

fiduciary duty that's in accordance with the plan

21

documents and instruments, plural, insofar as consistent

22

with the provisions of this title.

23

It's not found in

It's also not consistent with any language

24

in section 502(a), either in 502(a)(1)(B) or 502(a)(3).

25

The reference to equitable relief is to appropriate

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

equitable relief to redress a violation of Title I or a

2

violation of the terms of the plan.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that seems to me

4

like just a roundabout, complex way of saying that you

5

must recover under the plan, because if reliance is not

6

required then there must be some basis on which you must

7

recover, and that recovery must be under the plan.

8

it's -- it's -­

9

MR. BRUCE:

10

So

Well, the -- the -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, if you say -- if

11

you say injury is not required, then -- then I don't see

12

how the SPD can give you recovery, unless the SPD is the

13

plan, which brings us right back to the argument, which

14

is your argument, under the first -- under the first

15

section, under (a) -­

16

MR. BRUCE:

Under either (a) -­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. BRUCE:

-- (a)(1), (a)(1).

Under -- our understanding is

19

that under either (a)(1)(B) or (a)(3), that the court is

20

effectively providing an injunction in a case like this,

21

where -- where an action violates the statute.

22

a plan provision which had a very detrimental effect on

23

people was not disclosed to them, and so the effect of

24

the statute is to make that unfavorable provision

25

ineffective.

And so -Alderson Reporting Company

And here

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the -- if the SPD is part

2

of the plan, then where does the "likely harm" standard

3

come from?

4

MR. BRUCE:

I think, as we've said in our

5

brief, we think that the likely harm, possible

6

prejudice, and the material conflict that -- that is

7

used in the Third Circuit in Burstein, we think that all

8

of those standards are very similar, that they are

9

really looking at whether it -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but why is there any

11

requirement whatsoever, other than the fact that it's in

the plan?

14

written document, then -- the previously executed

15

written document, then you get the benefits under the

16

SPD, period.

17

harm or reliance or anything else, right?

18

If the SPD is the plan and the SPD says you

It doesn't matter whether there's likely

MR. BRUCE:

Well, I think, Justice Alito, we

19

see this more as a nondisclosure issue, that the

20

unfavorable provisions in the plan were not disclosed,

21

and that the effect of the statute is to make those

22

unfavorable plan provisions ineffective.

23

the statute refers to, for example, material

24

modifications and being sufficiently comprehensive and

25

reasonably apprising, that there are enough
Alderson Reporting Company

But because

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

qualifications in there where the court can look and

2

see, is this really -- was this conflict, was it really

3

about something that was significant to people that

4

might have an impact on their decision making and

5

whether the terms of their employment are satisfactory,

6

whether they might want to seek another job, they might

7

just go into the office and say:

We need more benefits.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me that

9

it's a very tough argument to say -- to make a

10

nondisclosure claim on the theory that the summary is

11

part of the plan, because the whole point of a summary

12

is not to disclose everything.

13

everything, it wouldn't be a summary.

14

claim something because it didn't disclose it, it seems

15

to me that's in tension with the idea that it's not

16

supposed to be just a repetition of the plan.

17

MR. BRUCE:

If it disclosed
And if you can

Our position is that the SPD is

18

one of the documents or instruments governing the plan.

19

And by statute it's required to have certain -- to meet

20

certain requirements, and therefore it becomes a

21

document governing the plan.

22

Mr. Olson, it is referred to as a document in section

23

1024(a)(6) of the statute, and of course this Court has

24

repeatedly referred to it as a plan document and to

25

"plan documents" plural.

It is -- in response to

So, what --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

29
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's -- I think

2

the brief -- the Petitioners' brief pointed out, it

3

governs the plan only when it's more favorable to the

4

participants, because you wouldn't say, if the plan were

5

more favorable and the summary would show fewer

6

benefits, that the summary would then govern.

7

MR. BRUCE:

I think the -- the

8

favorable/unfavorable is that the way -- the way I see

9

it is that an unfavorable plan term, when you look at

10

Curtiss-Wright, an unfavorable plan term must be validly

11

adopted and it must be disclosed in accordance with

12

ERISA in order to be effective.

13

And so, in the Frommert v. Conkright case,

14

that was specifically what the Second Circuit held, was

15

that the summary plan description did not disclose the

16

phantom offset, and therefore the phantom offset was

17

ineffective.

18

disclose the wear-away provisions.

19

expectation is that if they are under a pension plan and

20

they are continuing to work, that they are continuing to

21

earn pension benefits.

22

apprising them that there were unfavorable provisions in

23

the plan, which were validly adopted, but which were

24

secret as far as they were concerned.

25

Here the summary plan description did not

it understates the benefits, that doesn't count?
MR. BRUCE:

4

I

If it -- if

The -- the Congress in ERISA is

5

6

7

on losses of benefits, and there is a specific provision

8

in the regulations and in the statute about disclosing

9

all the circumstances that can result in a loss of

So the focus is

10

benefits.

So there was a plan provision here which

11

caused the loss of benefits that was never disclosed to

12

people.

13

people knew, well, the plan document may have a

14

wear-away provision, and the SPD doesn't mention it and

15

therefore there is no wear-away.

And it was -- there was no baseline where

They didn't know what wear-away was.

16

They

17

don't know what wear-away is today, because it has never

18

been disclosed to them that there's a way to -- to rig

19

up a pension plan where you can have a period of years,

20

unbeknownst to you, where you're not earning any an

21

additional benefits.
JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23

Okay.

Are you finished

with that?

24

MR. BRUCE:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sorry.
If you're finished.

Alderson Reporting Company

As I

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

understand what you have been saying and written, you

2

don't mean that the SPD, the summary, is a contract?

3

mean, one thing would be to say it's a part of the plan

4

and moreover it's a contract, so therefore we enforce it

5

according to terms.

6

I

That's one view.

But if you took that view, you get into

7

problems such as were mentioned.

The employer would

8

write 10,000 pages because he knows it's an enforceable

9

contract.

Nobody would understand it.

You'd have to

10

worry about the time when it was less favorable than the

11

written document.

12

long as you don't mean it's an enforceable contract.

13

So call it a plan if you want, as

Now, there's a provision that deals with it,

14

saying just what you said in response to Justice Alito.

15

And what I don't understand is why wouldn't that

16

provision govern?

17

1054(g)(1), that says a plan cannot reduce the rate of

18

accrual of future benefits unless there's written notice

19

in a manner calculated to be understood by the average

20

plan participant.

21

I take it there's a provision,

So I would have thought, I read that, I get

22

what you've said in your brief.

The summary was

23

inadequate.

24

therefore, according to this particular provision, those

25

provisions in the plan that reduce benefits are void.

It wouldn't have been understood, and,

Alderson Reporting Company

So now we enforce the plan with the -- in the absence of

those particular void provisions, and you get what you

No, it is in the opinion.

MR. BRUCE:

It is?

The district court found a

violation.

15

that provision -- the district court found a violation

16

of that provision, which if the court had provided

relief would have resulted in the class receiving much

more relief than the court ultimately ordered; that it

would have resulted in the class receiving four or five

MR. BRUCE:

violation of it, the district court declined to provide

relief because there had been an intermediate interim

amendment that might have -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand that.

So

8

suppose we can't reach that, which would seem to be the

logical thing to govern this, but we can't, okay?

Then

10

we only have two choices.

11

which seems to -- you want to use that by treating the

12

summary as a contract, or we go to (3), in which case

13

we're under equity.

14

The first choice is (1)(b),

Now, between those two, the first one gets

all the problems that we just were talking about.

16

second one would seem to be you're free and clear as

long as you show some kind of reliance and harm, and

18

then we're back to what I thought we granted this for,

which is why not say if harm is likely, then the burden

shifts?

Now, how do the -- how does

This can't be the first time
We have a big class, and -­

Well, I -- we didn't go based on

a trust law case involving a big class, but we based it

10

on Bogert and on section 173 in the Restatement of

11

Trusts, that when there is a breach of the duty to

12

disclose all of the material information that the

13

beneficiary needs to know in interacting with a third

party, which in this case would be Cigna with respect to

proving reliance; that the trustee can prove -- as the

prove that the beneficiaries have all the information

that they needed.

My understanding is -- I mean,

that's the law that's been -- that this Court has

12

adopted in securities cases where we have nondisclosures

reliance, which -- because it's unrealistic for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's -- that's what I'm

19

saying, that there's a commonality between the

20

securities cases, trust law as stated in the -- in the

21

comment to section 173 and in Bogert, and what the

22

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I just stop -­

the securities cases, does that involve stock traded in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

much more obvious and follow more logically than in the

2

trust context?

3

MR. BRUCE:

Well, one -- one of this Court's

4

very first ERISA cases was Teamsters v. Daniel, in which

5

the Securities and Exchange Commission had considered

6

pension plans to be a security.

7

actually involved break-in-service rules, and this Court

8

concluded that whatever protections the securities laws

9

offered, potentially offered, to participants were now

10

And -- and the case

offered in more concrete form under ERISA.

11

But the -- the point that I want to get back

12

to on reliance is that my reading of this Court's

13

decision in Bridge and in Lyng v. Payne is that this

14

Court does not look for the closest analogy to a

15

statutory provision.

the employees knew about these benefit reductions.

well-established in behavioral economics that people are

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

The pension benefits an employee accrues

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Kneedler, do you

14

view this as essentially a contract case, as that just

suggested, or instead a trust case?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

We view it as basically a

17

contract case.

18

contractually -- contractually guaranteed benefits,

19

those under the plan.

20

here, in this case the district court found that the SPD

21

basically promised, represented to employees, that after

22

the conversion they would receive pension benefits in

23

the form of A plus B, the old benefits plus the new

benefits, accruing right away.

the SPD contains these sorts of representations such

that the employee could reasonably be expected to rely

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we have a statute here

that -- that's -- don't you think that's a crucial

that -- I think it really gets at materiality, whether

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kneedler, I -- I think

11

it's a hard question here as to whether to think of this

12

as more like a contract dispute or more like a -- a

13

trust issue.

14

If we were to look at it as a trust issue,

15

what would be the result of that?

16

would we use?

MR. KNEEDLER:

What kind of test

I think it would be -- I

18

think it would be the same thing where you -- where you

representation of what the -- of what benefits will be

due, or you could have a situation where there was a -­
