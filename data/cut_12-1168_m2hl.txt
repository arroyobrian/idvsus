 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (10:04 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument first this morning in Case 121168, 

5

McCullen v. Coakley. 

6

 Mr. Rienzi. 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. RIENZI 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9

 MR. RIENZI: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 This Court has held that the public 

12

sidewalks are a natural and proper place for free 

13

citizens to exchange information and ideas, and for that 

14

reason the Court has held that public sidewalks occupy a 

15

special position in First Amendment analysis. 

16

 If the Massachusetts law at issue here makes 

17

it a crime to enter onto certain public sidewalks, even 

18

for the purpose of peaceful conversation, or 

19

leafletting, the law applies at abortion clinics 

20

throughout the State on every hour of every day that 

21

they are open, regardless of the circumstances. 

22

 Massachusetts asked this Court to uphold 

23

that statute under the time, place, and manner test, but 

24

the law fails each aspect of that test. 

25

 I would like to begin with narrow tailoring.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The State says the law is necessary to protect its 

2

interests in preventing obstruction and congestion.  But 

3

the law is not narrowly tailored to those interests for 

4

three reasons:  First, the law applies regardless of 

5

whether there's any threat of obstruction or congestion 

6

at all, even when the sidewalks are entirely open and 

7

empty. 

8

 For example, Mrs. McCullen generally does 

9

her counseling early in the morning on Tuesdays and 

10

Wednesdays beginning at 7:00 in the morning.  She 

11

testified that she is sometimes alone when she does this 

12

counseling.  Nancy Clark testified that 90 percent of 

13

the time that she is at the clinic in Worcester, she is 

14

all alone. 

15

 A statute that makes it illegal for 

16

Mrs. McCullen or Mrs. Clark to engage in peaceful, 

17

consensual conversation on a public sidewalk for fear of 

18

obstruction and congestion is not narrowly tailored. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Rienzi, the problem 

20

that the State faced is it doesn't know  and it has a 

21

history, there was a considerable history of 

22

disturbances and blocking the entrance, and it doesn't 

23

know in advance who are the wellbehaved people and who 

24

are the people who won't behave well.  So  and after 

25

the disturbance occurs, it's too late.

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So the State is trying to say, We want to 

2

make sure that the entrance is not blocked, and the only 

3

way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to 

4

everyone.  We can't  we can't screen people to know 

5

who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive. 

6

 MR. RIENZI: 

So I think the State is simply 

7

wrong about that fact for several reasons.  There are 

8

many tools that the State either has in its current 

9

toolbox or could enact that would deal with that 

10
11

concern. 
 And if I may back up for a second, I think 

12

there are really two different interests that the State 

13

asserts when it makes that argument, Justice Ginsburg. 

14

First, they say that there are actual deliberate bad 

15

actors.  All right.  There are some people whom the 

16

State claims have deliberately violated the law and 

17

blocked the door and interfered with access. 

18

 And then secondly, the State says there is 

19

also some circumstances where there are enough people on 

20

the sidewalk that even lawful, consensual conversation 

21

might accidentally block a door.  I think those are 

22

actually two quite different interests, but there are 

23

tools in the toolbox to deal with both of them. 

24
25

 For example, Section E of this statute makes 
it illegal to impede, block, obstruct or even hinder

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

somebody's access to the clinics.  And that section of 

2

the statute is not challenged here and never has been. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You know, I should probably 

4

ask this of the other side, and I will, but do you 

5

happen to know when was the last time that Massachusetts 

6

prosecuted somebody for obstructing entrance to an 

7

abortion clinic? 

8
9

 MR. RIENZI: 

So I believe the last cite in 

the record that I'm aware of is, as of 1997, there was a 

10

decision in a previous injunction case against people 

11

who had been adjudicated to have broken rules.  There is 

12

a 1997 case on that. 

13

 To my knowledge, they've never brought a 

14

case, for example, under the Federal FACE law, which has 

15

been in existence for 20 years. 

16
17
18
19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So there have been laws 

against obstruction during this entire period, right? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

There have been laws against 

obstruction the entire time. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And you say that only once, 

21

in 1997, that was the last time a prosecution was 

22

brought. 

23

 MR. RIENZI: 

And that was an injunction 

24

against prior bad actors.  That was not a FACE 

25

prosecution or a Section E prosecution.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You are not taking the 

2

position that 1997 was the last time an entrance was 

3

obstructed or that the police were called to open access 

4

to a clinic?  Are you taking that position that the last 

5

time it happened was 1997? 

6
7
8
9
10

 MR. RIENZI: 

I frankly don't  I couldn't 

say that I know the last time it happened. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you do know that in 

the record there were more examples? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

I know that in the record there 

11

was testimony claiming that that happened.  My argument 

12

is simply that the State has tools that are deliberately 

13

designed to deal with that.  And so the United States 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Rienzi, the State says, 

15

of that particular tool, that it's a hard thing to 

16

prosecute because you have to show intent, and there is 

17

a lot of obstruction and interference that goes on 

18

naturally just because there are a lot of people around. 

19

So that is an insufficient tool is what the State 

20

argues. 

21

 MR. RIENZI: 

Yes.  And so to the extent, 

22

what the State is saying  to the extent the State is 

23

claiming that there are deliberate bad actors 

24

deliberately blocking the door, I don't think that's a 

25

very persuasive argument.  There are police on the

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

scene, and if the police say, Get out of the doorway, 

2

either the person moves in which case there is not a 

3

problem anymore, or they don't, in which case, intent is 

4

pretty clear. 

5

 Amicus United States has prosecuted, I think 

6

more than 45 cases and gotten more than 70 convictions 

7

under that statute. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And sometimes there are 

those bad actors, but probably more often it's just a 

10

function of there are just lots of people, and they, 

11

your clients and all of  all of them want to be as 

12

close as possible to the site, and that that naturally 

13

leads to an interference with normal access. 

14

 MR. RIENZI: 

And so I agree that's the 

15

second part of the State's argument.  I don't think this 

16

law is narrowly tailored to that concern, in two 

17

respects. 

18

 One, the law applies  you know, the 

19

evidence in the case is that the crowds that the State 

20

is concerned about happened essentially at one clinic, 

21

one day, one time  Saturday mornings in Boston  and 

22

when they happen, there are video cameras rolling and 

23

police officers present. 

24
25

 And there is no reason to believe the police 
can't simply say, Move out of the doorway.  And if

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

someone is in front of the doorway, they certainly 

2

should do that. 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Does the record show how 

many clinics in the State are covered by the law? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

I believe there are 11 or 12 

6

clinics in the State.  So long as they are freestanding 

7

abortion clinics they fall within statutory definitions. 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

How far do you want to go 

in your concession?  Would you want to concede this 

10

point that imagine the State has two groups of people 

11

and one group feels what the other is doing is terribly 

12

wrong.  And the second group feels, We absolutely want 

13

to do it. 

14

 And everyone is in a fragile state of mind, 

15

and they want to, if possible, at least one group wants 

16

to sort of shout as loud as you could at the other, 

17

Please don't do this.  And the other says, Please leave 

18

me alone.  And we are not saying which group is which; 

19

the analogy is obvious, but I keep all the titles out. 

20

 Does the State have the right, in your 

21

opinion, to say, It's tough to referee this, we see the 

22

potential for real harm on one side or the other, so 

23

we're going to have this kind of 35foot boundary?  You 

24

want to concede that and say, okay, but the evidence 

25

here didn't doesn't justify it, or do you want to fight

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

that, too? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

So, no, I do not mean to 

3

concede that.  I don't think  I think a solution that 

4

is done with painted lines on the sidewalk that says at a point 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But now you are into the 

6

details.  I want to know about the principle.  I mean, I 

7

can imagine the principle applying special care and need 

8

must be taken outside of hospitals for veterans, even 

9

though there are some who are very much opposed to the 

10

war, because these people are gonna be coming out, they'll be 

11

in wheelchairs, it will be terrible. 

12

 And others thinking  you know, we can 

13

think of many, many situations, irrespective subject 

14

matter, where there is a need for such refereeing.  And 

15

I just want to know if the  if the concept is okay 

16

with you or if not. 

17

 MR. RIENZI: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

 MR. RIENZI: 

20
21

Generally 
With the details. 
Generally speaking, no.  I 

don't think the concept that 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So protestors like the 

22

one we had in the Schneider case at a funeral of a 

23

veteran can go right up to the public sidewalk outside 

24

the church and put up the signs that they did and give 

25

out the leaflets that they did, talking about that

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

veteran in the ways that they did?  That's okay by you. 

2

 MR. RIENZI: 

3

that.  One I think 

4

So  so, a couple points about 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There was no evidence 

5

there that they were  that they were disruptive.  They 

6

were just expressing their First Amendment rights. 

7

 MR. RIENZI: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9
10
11

So I think that that 
But there was the 

potential for disruption because of the strong 
sentiments around that. 
 MR. RIENZI: 

Agreed.  I think a statute that 

12

worked the way the one  this one does here, that would 

13

make it illegal to even engage in peaceful conversation 

14

on sidewalks near a church or near a funeral or near 

15

just about anything else, I think clearly is not 

16

permitted by the First Amendment. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

In Schneider, they were 

18

held not so far back that their shouts and protests 

19

couldn't be heard.  Isn't that the case?  They could 

20

still be heard 

21

 MR. RIENZI: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. RIENZI: 

I think it made 


they were not out of earsight 

 perhaps were part of the 

24

funeral procession that passed by.  I don't think 

25

they 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do you see now why I am 

2

trying to narrow it?  Because in my case, in Schneider, 

3

I thought it was pretty important that the demonstrators 

4

were behind a hill somewhere and the police restricted 

5

where they can go.  Many States have enacted similar 

6

laws, and I thought that's important, because maybe it 

7

would have come out differently.  I mean, you could 

8

argue that, I could. 

9

 So I'm trying to narrow it. 

I'm trying to 

10

see to what extent do I have to look at this particular 

11

set of facts, in which case we are into the hearings, 

12

et cetera; and to what extent is there a matter of very 

13

broad principle here, and any help you can give me on 

14

that would be appreciated. 

15

 MR. RIENZI: 

So the matter of very broad 

16

principle is that a law that makes it illegal to even 

17

engage in consensual conversation, quiet conversation, 

18

on a public sidewalk, an act that makes that a criminal 

19

act for which Mrs. McCullen can go to prison, I think, 

20

is not permissible under the First Amendment. 

21

 If you compare it to, for example, the 

22

Federal military funeral protest law, that law is 

23

specifically drawn to acts that disrupt the peace and 

24

good order of the funeral, and I think that is 

25

different.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But are you saying that you 

2

could not do an act that instead just says, look, it's a 

3

little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not 

4

disrupt peace and order, so we're just going to say 

5

25 feet around a funeral, or 25 feet around any 

6

facility, that that's never permissible? 

7

 MR. RIENZI: 

So, generally speaking, I think 

8

any law like that runs into a big First Amendment 

9

problem of even eliminating peaceful, consensual 

10

conversation that doesn't disrupt anything.  And this 

11

Court's past First Amendment decisions have said that 

12

precision of regulation is required. 

13

 One difference, if it's a rule around any 

14

facility or a rule around all funerals, for example, is 

15

that  that there isn't nearly as much distortion of 

16

the marketplace of ideas as happens when you do what 

17

Massachusetts did here, which is pick 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, for example, I was 

19

intrigued by one of the examples that you gave in your 

20

own brief, which you said slaughterhouses.  So, let's 

21

say, that there are animal rights activists, and this is 

22

easy to imagine, who try to interfere with access in and 

23

out of slaughterhouses.  And a State passes a regulation 

24

that says there's a ton of interference, it's preventing 

25

the operation of these facilities, employees can't get

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in, suppliers can't get in, slaughterhouses are leaving 

2

the State because of this problem, and so we're just 

3

going to set up a zone and let's call it 30 feet, 

4

because it's very hard to enforce anything else. 

5

 I guess my reaction to that hypothetical 

6

you  you must have used it for me to say, oh, that's 

7

terrible.  But my reaction, my intuition was kind of 

8

what's wrong with that?  Just have everybody take a step 

9

back. 

10

 So what is wrong with that? 

11

 MR. RIENZI: 

So what's wrong with that is a 

12

couple of things.  One, again, this Court's decisions 

13

require precision of regulation.  So an injunction, for 

14

example, against groups and individuals like Madsen and 

15

Schenck, for example, an injunction against groups and 

16

individuals who have interfered with access, keeping 

17

them back, I think that's perfectly permissible.  We 

18

take no issue with that type of solution. 

19

 It's the generally applicable statute, 

20

right, that's tied to just one particular 

21

oftenprotested event that gives the State enormous 

22

power to interfere with the marketplace of ideas. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

one of the examples that 

24

is given in one of the amicus briefs in this case, and 

25

they  they provide a lot of background, is a State law

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that creates a buffer zone around every fraternal lodge. 

2

What would you say about that? 

3

 MR. RIENZI: 

I think it is difficult to 

4

imagine the government interest to  well, first, I 

5

guess, I don't know the particulars of that law and what 

6

it  what it restricts.  If it restricts peaceful 

7

conversation on public sidewalks anyplace there's a 

8

fraternal lodge, I would say that  that should not be 

9

permissible under the First Amendment. 

10

 I think, generally speaking, the idea of the 

11

government picking one particular item and saying, well, 

12

around this, suddenly the character of the public forum 

13

changes from a place where people can have peaceful, 

14

consensual conversations to a place where we will 

15

imprison them for doing that, I think that's a dramatic 

16

restriction of First Amendment rights. 

17

 I think if there is a particular group or 

18

individual who keeps interfering with the fraternal 

19

order, of course, you can get an injunction against that 

20

type of behavior, but I don't think the State can say 

21

even peaceful discussion and leafletting 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But let's go back to the 

23

slaughterhouse case.  I mean, there might be people who 

24

say it's really important to us to actually be able to 

25

facetoface talk with the employees and tell them why

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they should get different jobs or why they should change 

2

their practices in various kinds of ways.  And  you 

3

know, there are some people who think signs and chants 

4

are great, but there are people who really want to make 

5

onetoone contact with the truck drivers, with the 

6

employees, whoever. 

7

 But  but you say  you know, we have to 

8

let whatever interference goes on, even if there's a 

9

record of  of real obstruction, of real interference 

10

with the operation of the facility, in order to allow 

11

that to happen.  And I guess I think that that's 

12

that's pretty hard. 

13

 MR. RIENZI: 

To be clear, Your Honor, I'm 

14

not saying the government has to let it go on.  I'm 

15

saying the government has tools that are better drawn to 

16

it than eliminating even the peaceful, consensual 

17

conversation. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But suppose  and this is 

19

still Justice Kagan's question  suppose it were a 

20

given, assume that those laws just did not work.  Could 

21

there then be consideration of a buffer zone? 

22

 Now, this is a hypothetical that I'm sure 

23

that you wouldn't accept in the context of your case, 

24

but suppose. 

25

 MR. RIENZI: 

Suppose it were a given that

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

there is no way to keep the abortion clinic open 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The laws simply do not 

3

reference to obstruction and blocking entrance, simply 

4

do not work. 

5

 MR. RIENZI: 

If the laws simply do not work, 

6

I think perhaps the government could come in and make a 

7

case that it has a compelling interest and that this is 

8

the least restrictive means of doing it. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So that  now, at 

10

this point  that was a better way of getting what I 

11

was trying to get at.  Just assume that there is 

12

let's look at the narrow part of the case, and let's 

13

assume that the Colorado case is right.  And this 

14

particular restriction is more a restrictive than 

15

Colorado in two important respects, which you've gone 

16

into. 

17

 Now, the reason that they did that is they 

18

had hearings in Massachusetts, and they discovered that 

19

the Colorado law didn't really work very well.  And so, 

20

what are we supposed to do?  Are we supposed to now go 

21

look at  as long as those hearings are  are 

22

legitimate hearings and they have good explanation on 

23

something like whether the zone is 8 feet and consensual 

24

or whether it's 35 feet and different amounts of 

25

sidewalk, depending on the nearness of the facility,

17

Alderson Reporting Company

when doesn't it become just up to them? 
 We can't  we're not legislators. 

We don't 

3

know the situation in Massachusetts.  We can insist upon 

4

a reasonable record.  But how can we do more than that 

5

on this detail? 

6

 MR. RIENZI: 

So  so, on this detail, 

7

what  what I think the Court should look for is, for 

8

example, had they had a  the State said they did not 

9

even convict a single person of one unconsensual 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But you understand that. 

11

We all understand that.  It's one thing to try to prove 

12

an intent on such matters, particularly when people are, 

13

in good faith, they're trying to explain it, and it's 

14

another thing to actually stop the congestion and to 

15

protect the interests of the woman who wants to have the 

16

abortion, may be in a fragile state of mind, and this 

17

kind of thing could interfere with her health, et 

18

cetera. 

19

 So there are two interests, one on each 

20

side.  We know 8 feet with the bubble is okay.  We're 

21

not sure about 35 feet, and they have an evidentiary 

22

record. 

23

 MR. RIENZI: 

So, a few things.  One, the 

24

reasons this Court gave in Hill for allowing the 8foot 

25

noapproach zone was precisely that it only was about

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

protecting unwilling listeners and it did not stop 

2

discussions with willing listeners.  There are real 

3

people 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, do you accept that 

5

the record here shows that it did not work well in the 

6

sense that Justice Breyer 

7

 MR. RIENZI: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 MR. RIENZI: 

10

No, not at all. 
 seems to use it? 
I understood I was being asked 

to assume that. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

As I recall the record, 

12

all  all it says is that the police found it difficult 

13

to apply a bubble; that  you know, they have to 

14

measure 8 feet or whatever it is.  They didn't say that 

15

massive obstruction and protests are occurring, 

16

preventing people from  that wasn't the finding, was 

17

it? 

18
19
20

 MR. RIENZI: 

No.  I  I agree, it was not. 

The claim was 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's why I just asked you 

21

that question.  It just happens that the police testify 

22

with some evidence and examples that the 8foot bubble 

23

doesn't work.  And it also  they have some evidence 

24

and reasons for thinking that if you want to have a 

25

conversation, you have to convince the woman to walk 10

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

feet. 
 I mean, the difference is about half  you 

3

know, if you were near me, Price is near we have Colorado.  If 

4

we're over to where the first row is, we'd have 

5

Massachusetts, and  and they have some evidence that 

6

we can't enforce this Colorado thing very well; it 

7

doesn't help. 

8

 Now, go ahead. 

9

 MR. RIENZI: 

10
11
12

I want your answer. 
I  I agree, but if 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not trying to put 

words 
 MR. RIENZI: 

 if you sent me 35 feet 

13

further back and asked me to make my argument from 

14

there 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

 MR. RIENZI: 

I'd hear you. 
You might hear me, but I would 

17

suggest you'd  you'd receive it quite differently.  If 

18

I were sent back there, but the clinic  or the State 

19

were permitted to stand in front of you like a normal 

20

lawyer and make their argument in the normal way, I 

21

would suggest that would be a significant difference. 

22

And what we have here is 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not denying the 

difference. 
 MR. RIENZI: 

Yeah.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I am asking you, we've now 

2

heard different characterizations of the record.  I 

3

didn't mean to characterize it.  I want you to explain 

4

what it is in the record, from your point of view or 

5

lack thereof, that means that the Constitution 

6

intervenes to prevent Massachusetts from doing it. 

7

 MR. RIENZI: 

So the constitutional narrow 

8

tailoring test under the time, place, and manner test 

9

requires that the law not restrict substantially more 

10

speech than necessary to serve the government's 

11

interest.  Here 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How much is  how much 

13

is restricted?  How  how long does it take from when 

14

you enter the buffer zone until you reach the clinic 

15

entrance? 

16

 MR. RIENZI: 

If  if you're walking 

17

nonstop, I assume 7 to 10 seconds or something like 

18

that. 

19
20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So the conversation can 

go on before those 7 to 10 seconds. 

21

 MR. RIENZI: 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yeah. 
There's not much you're 

23

going to be able to do to have a conversation that will 

24

persuade people in 7 to 10 seconds. 

25

 MR. RIENZI: 

I respectfully disagree on that

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

last point, Your Honor.  The evidence in this record is 

2

that the  the inability to speak with people close to 

3

the clinic has a dramatic effect on the Petitioners' 

4

ability to reach their audience.  So if someone happens 

5

to be walking from the same side of the zone that you're 

6

standing on, you may have a shot. 

7

 Now, the clinic still has the space in front 

8

of the clinic to talk to people, which you don't, but 

9

you may have a shot if you're on the right spot. 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And if you know they're 

going to the clinic. 
 MR. RIENZI: 

And if you can identify the 

13

audience early enough.  But, for example, places like 

14

Worcester and Springfield, where essentially the only 

15

chance to reach the audience is by standing on the 

16

public sidewalk and waving a leaflet as they drive 

17

through the driveway entrance. 

18

 If you have to stand 35 feet back and do 

19

that, the evidence here shows there's essentially zero 

20

chance to reach that audience.  So it is 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But isn't that more a 

22

function that they just have a private parking lot?  So 

23

even if this law didn't exist, you actually couldn't 

24

reach most of these people because they drive into the 

25

private parking lot and you can't talk to them anyway.

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. RIENZI: 

No, Your Honor.  I don't think 

2

that's a fair characterization of it.  So yes, there's a 

3

private parking lot, but there's a public sidewalk on 

4

which, before this law, you had the right to engage in 

5

speech.  The fact that this law pushes you 35 feet back 

6

is what makes it impossible to make the offer. 

7

 Many people would just drive on by, and they 

8

don't want the information, and that's fine.  That's 

9

their right.  But many people do want the information 

10

and have acted on the information.  And this law makes 

11

it much harder, almost impossible in places like 

12

Worcester and Springfield, to offer it. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is there a buffer zone that 

14

you would concede is permissible?  In other words, if it 

15

were 12 feet, would that be all right? 

16

 MR. RIENZI: 

So, as the size of the zone 

17

decreases, I think the  the imposition on the speech 

18

rights is  you know, gets less and less and better and 

19

better.  And so the adequacy of the alternatives, for 

20

example, that may improve as you go. 

21

 It would still be a problem, I think, to 

22

have zones on the sidewalk where, even when no one's 

23

there, it's a criminal act to have a conversation. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but that goes back to 

Justice Ginsburg's question.  I mean, how is a law

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

supposed to deal with  with that, sort of the 

2

fluctuating conditions that may be at a particular 

3

clinic site? 

4

 MR. RIENZI: 

That's  that's precisely the 

5

point.  That's why this is not something that should be 

6

addressed with a statute like this.  This is something 

7

that should be addressed with either a statute drawn to 

8

something like large crowds or a dispersal statute. 

9

 The brief  amicus brief for New York State 

10

in support of Massachusetts here talks about how 

11

Concord, New Hampshire and Los Angeles deal with this 

12

problem.  They give the police the power to disperse 

13

crowds when they become obstructive or violent, the same 

14

way this Court approved in Boos v. Barry. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It is the case, isn't it, 

16

that not only abortion counselors are  are excluded 

17

from this area, everybody is, right?  Anybody who wants 

18

to talk to anybody or who just wants to be there 

19

 MR. RIENZI: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21
22

So 
 can't  I mean, this is 

a  a dead speech zone, right? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

In many respects it is.  In 

23

many respects it is no different than the speechfree 

24

zone in the Jews for Jesus case.  It's a place where the 

25

government claims it can essentially turn off the First

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Amendment. 

2

 But the government says 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's more than a speechfree 

4

zone.  It's also a conductfree zone, right?  You can't 

5

sell hats there, you can't  you know, beg there.  I 

6

mean, you just can't go there. 

7

 MR. RIENZI: 

I agree the government has 

8

eliminated more than speech on that sidewalk, but 

9

they've eliminated speech on that sidewalk as surely as 

10

in the Jews for Jesus case. 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It's still a thoroughfare 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, they haven't entirely 

13

eliminated speech because employees are permitted 

14

 MR. RIENZI: 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

16
17

Yes. 
 to speak within the scope 

of their employment; isn't that right? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

Thank you, Justice Alito.  Yes. 

18

So they haven't eliminated speech for all people.  They 

19

have 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, that's a  a 

21

contested point because the Attorney General reads 

22

"scope of employment" to mean getting to my job and 

23

leaving my job, and does not include speech activity. 

24
25

 MR. RIENZI: 

So on the face of the statute, 

I don't think that  that that interpretation doesn't do very

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

much.  That statute 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

This is the  the chief 

3

legal officer of the State says this is a term that 

4

needs to be interpreted.  The term is "scope of 

5

employment."  Scope of employment within this statute 

6

means getting to work and leaving work, and it doesn't 

7

mean political speech. 

8

 MR. RIENZI: 

9
10
11

So the Attorney General says 

it's more than just getting to work and leaving work. 
It says it's just doing their jobs. 
 First, I don't believe  I don't believe 

12

that they have the authority to do that; in other words, 

13

I don't think they could go arrest somebody who happened 

14

to speak about abortion when they work for an abortion 

15

clinic.  They have an absolute statutory defense. 

16

 But even if they could limit it to just 

17

doing their job, you end up with the problem that the 

18

Ninth Circuit sought in the Hoyt case, which is if the 

19

clinic is allowed to use that sidewalk, even just to 

20

say, "good morning, may I help you into the clinic," and 

21

the government says that's a valid use of our public 

22

sidewalks, but the State says Mrs. McCullen will go to 

23

prison if she goes on that sidewalk and says, "good 

24

morning, may I offer you an alternative?" 

25

 As the Ninth Circuit panel said, that's

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

indubitably contentbased. 
 The government doesn't get to decide that 

3

the public sidewalk  which it leaves open for people 

4

just walking by, right?  If I'm going down that sidewalk 

5

to get a cup of coffee, it's fine. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, am I correct that 

7

the Attorney General's regulation with respect to 

8

employees of the clinic in a way made this even more 

9

contentbased because there was a prohibition on 

10
11

discussing the  the abortion procedure? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

I  I agree.  That's one of 

12

the reasons that the interpretation is flagrantly 

13

unconstitutional.  The government can't simply say to 

14

people who work for Planned Parenthood, we won't arrest 

15

you when you talk on the sidewalk unless you talk about 

16

abortion, right?  If you talk about abortion, then we'll 

17

arrest you. 

18

 And that mirrors  that mirrors the State's 

19

interpretation of its  of the exemption for people 

20

walking through the zone, where it says you can walk 

21

through, and this is JA9394, "provided that the 

22

individual does not do anything else within the buffer 

23

zone, such as expressing their views about abortion." 

24

So the government's saying you can walk through, but you 

25

can't talk about abortion.

27

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it's "such as," it's 

"such as."  It says you can't talk about anything. 
 MR. RIENZI: 

Well, I  I agree.  I don't 

think 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, it's not content 

6

it's not based on speech about abortion.  It's that you 

7

can't speak about anything. 

8
9

 MR. RIENZI: 

Well, the  the interpretation 

as to the employees that the Attorney General has 

10

proffered for 6 years is about speech about abortion. 

11

So it's not they can't talk about abortion 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Excuse me.  If  if you're 

13

going through the zone just to get somewhere, not to get 

14

to the clinic, and you're walking with a companion, 

15

can't you speak to your companion as you walk  it doesn't 

16

ban speech by everybody who's walking through. 

17

 MR. RIENZI: 

The Attorney General has taken 

18

multiple positions on that.  In the lower court, their 

19

position was you can't talk about abortion or partisan 

20

issues.  They told the First Circuit that you can't even 

21

wear  that you can be arrested if you wore a Cleveland 

22

Indians shirt while you were just passing through.  At 

23

this Court, they say that people passing through have 

24

speech rights. 

25

 Either one is bad. 

Either way the

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

government doesn't have the ability to say who gets to 

2

speak and who doesn't get to speak on an open public 

3

sidewalk.

 If I may reserve my time?

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER GRACE MILLER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

9

 MS. MILLER: 

10

please the Court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

11

 Petitioners can and do protest abortion in 

12

Massachusetts and they can do it in the public spaces 

13

right outside abortion facilities. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

This is not a protest case. 

15

These people don't want to protest abortion.  They want 

16

to talk to the women who are about to get abortions and 

17

try to talk them out of it.  I  I think it  it 

18

distorts it to say that what they want to do is protest 

19

abortion. 

20

 If it was a protest, keeping them back 

21

35 feet might not be so bad.  They can scream and yell 

22

and hold up signs from 35 feet.  But what they can't do 

23

is try to talk the woman out of the abortion.  It's a 

24

counseling case, not a  not a protest case. 

25

 MS. MILLER: 

It  Your Honor, I would say

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's a congestion case.  Certainly, Ms. McCullen and 

2

others can have those conversations right in front of 

3

the abortion facility.  It's just that those 

4

conversations are moved back a few feet.  And in point 

5

of fact, Ms. McCullen 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it's more than a few 

7

feet.  You know, 35 feet is a ways.  It's from this 

8

bench to the end of the court.  And if you imagine the 

9

Chief Justice as sort of where the door would be, it's 

10

most of the width of this courtroom as well.  It's 

11

it's pretty much this courtroom, kind of.  That's a lot 

12

of space. 

13

 MS. MILLER: 

Just as a factual matter, I did 

14

want to point out that in Boston, for example, the door 

15

is recessed.  It's a private entrance with a recessed 

16

door and the 35 feet is measured from the door.  So it's 

17

actually only about 23 feet.

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's, I think, a 

little less than this courtroom. 

3

 MS. MILLER: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We measured this courtroom. 
I'd just like you to go 

5

back to Justice Scalia's question for one second.  I 

6

didn't hear the  as he was saying that this case is 

7

not a protest case, it's simply about calm 

8

conversations.  And that is what I want to know if the 

9

evidence showed that. 

10

 MS. MILLER: 

11
12

Well, certainly, there's a 

picture of a calm conversation 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, the evidence upon which 

13

Massachusetts based its decision to go to 35 feet 

14

instead of 8 feet.  There were hearings.  Did the 

15

evidence show that what was involved was calm 

16

conversations between one person trying to counsel 

17

another or did the evidence show something else? 

18
19

 MS. MILLER: 

Certainly, the evidence showed 

something else. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MS. MILLER: 

What? 
Experience showed that there 

22

had to be a certain amount of space around the 

23

facilities.  What we had, for example, were pro choice 

24

advocates swearing and screaming at pro life advocates 

25

within the buffer zone.  That's at Joint Appendix 26

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

through 28.  You had the Pink Group, which is a pro 

2

choice organization, pushing and shoving and jockeying 

3

for position. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, surely you could have 

5

a law against screaming and shouting within 35 feet or 

6

protesting within 35 feet.  Isn't that more narrowly 

7

tailored?  I mean, what this case involves, what these 

8

people want to do is to speak quietly and in a friendly 

9

manner, not in a hostile manner, because that would 

10

that would frustrate their purpose, with the people 

11

going into the clinic. 

12

 MS. MILLER: 

But, again, experience showed 

13

that even individuals who wanted to engage in close, 

14

quiet, peaceful conversation were creating congestion 

15

around 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Rather  I note there's 

17

some people who are peaceful, in which case I would 

18

accept Justice Scalia's suggestion this is a counseling 

19

case.  But you've cited some other evidence that 

20

suggests there were other people who were screaming, 

21

pushing and shouting, which sounds like, in his 

22

characterization, a protest case.  And the reason that 

23

Massachusetts found it difficult to write a statute that 

24

distinguishes one from the other is? 

25

 Why do people write statutes that sometimes

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do not make these fine distinctions?  Why did they in 

2

this instance? 

3

 MS. MILLER: 

They didn't make a fine 

4

distinction, Your Honor, because it didn't matter 

5

whether people were being peaceful or whether they 

6

were 

7
8
9
10
11
12
13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Could you have written such 

a statute that would have worked? 
 MS. MILLER: 

It would have been very 

difficult to write such a statute, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

How did you pick 35 feet? 

Why 35? 
 MS. MILLER: 

Well, again, experience showed 

14

that some amount of space around the buffer zones 

15

around the facilities needed to be open.  So then it was 

16

simply a question of looking at past experience, at the 

17

prior injunctions, for example, Your Honor. 

18

 For example, in Planned Parenthood v. Bell, 

19

which is cited at page 2 of our brief, there was 

20

actually a 50foot buffer zone imposed by a district 

21

court judge in Massachusetts.  We knew from, of course, 

22

Madsen and Schenk, that 36foot buffer zones were 

23

acceptable in  when you were being responsive to that 

24

kind of problem; and we knew that a 15foot buffer zone 

25

would be acceptable if responding to a similar kind of

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

problem. 
 So at some point or another, the  the 

3

legislature was aware that some amount of space needed 

4

to be created, and it chose 35 feet as a reasonable 

5

response, a reasonable amount of space around the 

6

facility to allow 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

To go to  go back for a 

8

second.  I see that.  Is there anything in the record 

9

the obvious reason for a legislator, I think  I did 

10

work in the legislature for a while as a staff member 

11

that you don't write these fine statutes is they won't 

12

work.  They have too fine a distinction.  The activity 

13

is commingled.  The activity  all right.  Now, I knew 

14

you were just going to nod my  your head as soon as I 

15

said that. 

16

 So I was trying to get you to say it in 

17

spontaneously if it's true.  Is there anything in this 

18

record that suggests that this is one of those cases 

19

where it's just too tough to say whether they're 

20

counseling somebody or whether they're screaming at 

21

somebody, whether they're pushing somebody or whether 

22

they're standing near them peacefully? 

23
24
25

 Is there any evidence in the record I could 
turn to that would suggest that? 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You should say yes.

isn't there, because I'm going to ask her where because 

6

I want to read it. 

7

 MS. MILLER: 

I will of course, Your Honor. 

8

The best description of that is, of course, Commissioner 

9

Evans's description of the space functioning like a 

10
11

goalie's crease. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let  let me ask 

12

this question:  Assume it to be true that an elderly 

13

lady who was quite successful and had meaningful 

14

communication with over 100 women going into the clinic, 

15

before this law, was unable to talk to even one after 

16

this law.  Assume that's true. 

17

 Does that have any bearing on our analysis? 

18

And does that have any bearing on Justice Breyer's 

19

question about whether or not a law can be written to 

20

protect that kind of activity but still to prevent 

21

obstruction and blocking? 

22

 MS. MILLER: 

I  I think, Your Honor, that 

23

no one is guaranteed any specific form of communication. 

24

So, there is no guarantee, as a doctrinal matter, to 

25

close, quiet conversations.  The question is, are there

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adequate alternatives?  And in this particular instance 

2

in this record, there are adequate alternatives.  Take, 

3

for example, the situation 

4
5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You say there's no  no 

guarantee of talking quietly? 

6

 MS. MILLER: 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There is 
Do you want me to write an 

8

opinion and say there's no free speech right to quietly 

9

converse on an issue of public importance? 

10

 MS. MILLER: 

Generally on the public 

11

sidewalk.  But, of course, that right is tempered by 

12

the  the State's interest in making sure that the 

13

public sidewalks function as they should and that there 

14

is peace and good order. 

15

 But I would give you an example, Your Honor. 

16

I'd  I'd point you 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I still don't know where 

18

you're going to  this  this goes to Justice Breyer's 

19

question.  You  you cannot write an ordinance that 

20

says obstruction, intimidation, blocking is prohibited, 

21

and still allow the kind of conversation that I 

22

described earlier and that I want you to assume to be 

23

true for the  for the purposes of this question. 

24
25

 MS. MILLER: 

Your Honor, we  we couldn't 

here, obviously, because that wasn't the problem.  The

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

problem with making that kind of a fine distinction is 

2

that it doesn't address what the State's 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But in speech cases, when 

4

you address one problem, you have a duty to protect 

5

speech that's  that's  that's lawful. 

6
7
8
9

 MS. MILLER: 

You do.  As long as your 

protection is narrowly tailored to your interest, you 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But I  I think what you 

have to say to this Court is that it's impossible to 

10

write a statute of the kind that we are discussing now, 

11

and this is Justice Breyer's question. 

12

 MS. MILLER: 

It would be enormously 

13

difficult to write a statute that addressed the problem 

14

and the significant interest here where you are making 

15

that kind of a fine distinction 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

May I ask you a question 

17

about a distinction that is in this statute?  Now, let 

18

me give you this  this example.  A woman is 

19

approaching the door of a clinic, and she enters the 

20

zone.  Two other women approach her.  One is an employee 

21

of the facility, the other is not.  The first who is an 

22

employee of the facility says, good morning.  This is a 

23

safe facility.  The other one who's not an employee 

24

says, good morning, this is not a safe facility. 

25

 Now, under this statute, the first one has

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not committed a crime; the second one has committed a 

2

crime.  And the only difference between the two is that 

3

they've expressed a different viewpoint.  One says it's 

4

safe; one says it's not safe.  Now, how can a statute 

5

like that be considered viewpointneutral? 

6

 MS. MILLER: 

Your Honor, I think what the 

7

statute distinguishes is based on what those two 

8

different people are doing.  The  as you say, the 

9

employee could say, if she was performing her job, which 

10

would be escorting that individual into the facility, 

11

and if she wasn't unnecessarily cluttering up the  the 

12

buffer zone, which was the reason that the statute 

13

was  was enacted in the first place, then that person 

14

could say that.  You judge it on what she's doing, not 

15

what she's saying. 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's what she 

17

what she's doing is what she's saying.  She approaches 

18

and she says this is a safe facility.  The other one 

19

says it's not a safe facility.  They have a bad safety 

20

record.  And they're  they're the only people in the 

21

zone. 

22

 MS. MILLER: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

24
25

Right. 
If it's as big as this 

courtroom, they're the only three people in that zone. 
 MS. MILLER: 

Right.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO:

viewpoint difference. 

3

 MS. MILLER: 

The difference is a 

The  what the legislature has 

4

done is that it has created a circle around these 

5

entrances and has only permitted particular conduct 

6

within that buffer zone to allow the traffic to keep 

7

moving on the sidewalk and to allow people to get in and 

8

out. 

9

 So unless you have a permissible purpose for 

10

your conduct to be in the buffer zone, then you cannot 

11

be in the buffer zone and that is what the statute is 

12

addressing.  With respect 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand it. 

14

It's a permissible purpose to say this is a safe 

15

facility, but not a permissible purpose to say this is 

16

an unsafe facility? 

17

 MS. MILLER: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MS. MILLER: 

The 
Is that 
The statute is not focused on 

20

that person's speech.  The statute is focused on  on 

21

what they're doing in the buffer zone. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But the consequence is 

23

just what is described by Justice Scalia; that is, the 

24

consequence of the statute.  Are you saying that the 

25

consequences of what you write are irrelevant to this

39

argument? 
 MS. MILLER: 

Certainly, I wouldn't say that, 

Your Honor.  However, with respect to 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me that you 

should answer Justice Scalia's question, then. 
 MS. MILLER: 

With respect to viewpoint 

7

discrimination, Your Honors, the statute has a perfectly 

8

legitimate sweep.  It allows people to go in and out of 

9

the building.  It allows pedestrians to go work  back 

10

and forth across the sidewalk, and it allows for even 

11

employees, the snow shovelers mentioned in the Walter 

12

Dellinger brief. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you could have created 

14

a completely silent zone.  Now, I don't know whether 

15

that would be permissible or not, but it would be a 

16

different question.  You could have  you could say 

17

nobody can speak here.  People can shovel snow.  If they 

18

work for the  for the clinic, they can sweep the 

19

sidewalk, they can do maintenance, they can go in and 

20

they  and out, but they can't utter a word. 

21

 Well, that would be a different statute. 

22

But that's not this statute.  This statute says that 

23

there is an exemption for employees of the facility if 

24

they are operating within the scope of their employment. 

25

And surely coming out and saying this is a safe facility

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is within the scope of their employment. 

2

 MS. MILLER: 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Right. 
So how do you justify that? 

4

Forget about the conduct now.  The speech that's 

5

allowed.  One can speak and say it's safe.  The other 

6

cannot speak and say it is not safe. 

7

 MS. MILLER: 

What I would argue, Your Honor, 

8

is that speech in that particular circumstance of the 

9

employee actually doing her job and not unnecessarily 

10

cluttering the buffer zone, what  then that speech is 

11

simply incidental to the permissible conduct.  And it 

12

doesn't make the statute on its face  it doesn't make 

13

it viewpointdiscriminatory.  Because as I said 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You think it's incidental? 

15

What if there's a real question about whether this is a 

16

safe facility?  That's incidental speech? 

17

 MS. MILLER: 

It's incidental to her 

18

performing her job.  And, Your Honor, it  if there 

19

were a circumstance where that kind of speech were 

20

habitual or widespread or touched on advocacy in any 

21

way, shape or form, then obviously, Petitioners would 

22

have an opportunity to challenge the statute as applied. 

23

But, of course, they haven't even begun to make the case 

24

that there's viewpoint discrimination actually happening 

25

in the buffer zone.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It's very hard for me to 

2

credit the statement or the implication that for an 

3

employee to say, "We're glad you're here.  You're going 

4

to be well taken care of.  This is a safe facility. 

5

It's important for you to be here," it's very hard for 

6

me to credit your statement that that's incidental to 

7

their function. 

8
9

 MS. MILLER: 

It's incidental to the 

permissible purpose for which they are allowed in the 

10

buffer zone.  And I should point out, actually, that 

11

PPLM  and again, this is in the Walter Dellinger brief 

12

at page 2A  they actually train their escorts not to 

13

engage in that kind of speech.  So that's first of all. 

14

 And second of all, escorts really only exist 

15

and only operate in Boston on Saturday mornings for a 

16

couple of hours.  They don't work at all in Worcester or 

17

Springfield. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that raises another 

19

question, Ms. Miller, because I assume that that's true 

20

because the crowds and the obstruction really are with 

21

respect to one facility at certain periods of time.  So 

22

Mr. Rienzi says, look, if it's at one facility, not all 

23

ten of them or whatever it is, and it's only for certain 

24

periods of time, not all day every day  you know, why 

25

not narrow it that way?

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. MILLER: 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

3

 MS. MILLER: 

Right. 
So why not? 
Because the experience has 

4

shown that you do have problems at Worcester and 

5

Springfield, and those problems do center around the 

6

driveways.  85 to 90 percent of patients who approach 

7

those facilities do so by car. 

8
9

 And the only public sidewalk  there's a 
small slice of public sidewalk between the road and the 

10

private driveway, and that's the only opportunity that 

11

you'd  that individuals would have in order to 

12

protest. 

13

 And what's happened in the past in Worcester 

14

and Springfield is that you would have pacing across 

15

these driveways.  That's at Joint Appendix 41.  You'd 

16

have individuals stopping and standing and refusing to 

17

move in Worcester.  You'd have literature thrown into 

18

cars.  You'd have hands and heads thrust into open 

19

windows.  And there was at least one accident in 

20

Worcester.  That's at JA19. 

21

 So there definitely was conduct that was a 

22

problem, and it wasn't even that there are a couple of 

23

lone protestors in Worcester or Springfield.  There are 

24

events in Worcester and Springfield.  There are regular 

25

protestors there every week, first of all.  And second

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

of all, the crowds get much larger at the semiannual 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I object to you 

3

calling these people protestors, which you've been doing 

4

here during the whole presentation.  That is not how 

5

they present themselves.  They do not say they want to 

6

make protests.  They say they want to talk quietly to 

7

the women who are going into these facilities.  Now how 

8

does that make them protestors? 

9

 MS. MILLER: 

Your Honor, the problem, of 

10

course, that the statute was looking to address was not 

11

with protestors, per se.  It was with people who had a 

12

desire to be as close to the facility doors and 

13

driveways as possible to communicate their message.  But 

14

the result of that was congestion around these doors and 

15

driveways. 

16

 So it wasn't a concern about the protest; it 

17

was a concern about people actually being able to use 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And I would think, 

19

Ms. Miller, that if you tried to do a statute that 

20

distinguished between protestors and counselors, that 

21

would be contentbased much more than this statute is. 

22

 MS. MILLER: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I would agree. 
I mean, but  you know, 

24

which is not to say that this statute doesn't have its 

25

problems, in my view.  I mean, so I guess I'm a little

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

bit hung up on why you need so much space. 
 MS. MILLER: 

Again, the experience.  We've 

3

had quite a long experience in Massachusetts, a long 

4

history of crowds around these doors or of even violence 

5

at the clinics.  And we've had law enforcement and 

6

others who have viewed that crowd on a regular basis and 

7

have described it, the activity around the doors and 

8

driveways, as being so frenetic. 

9

 You have so many people there, the bad 

10

actors and the good actors.  You have so many people 

11

congested in the same space from all points of view that 

12

it effectively blocks the door. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, before you sit down, 

14

can I ask you this question that's suggested by the 

15

AFLCIO briefs.  Suppose the State legislature has 

16

hearings, and they say there's a long history of 

17

violence and obstruction at sites where there is a 

18

strike and replacement workers have been called in. 

19

 Could the  could a State pass a statute 

20

that says there is a 35foot zone like this around every 

21

location in the State whenever there is a strike and 

22

there are replacement workers?  Could they do that? 

23

 MS. MILLER: 

Right.  Well, of course labor 

24

actions are protected by Federal law, so any State law 

25

couldn't directly conflict with the 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Could Federal 

law do that? 
 MS. MILLER: 

Well, this Court has repeatedly 

4

upheld restrictions on labor activity, if given the 

5

right record.  So there is  so the answer is yes, the 

6

First Amendment would permit regulation on the record 

7
8
9
10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In every case, in every 

case 
 MS. MILLER: 

No, no, no. 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 there could just be a 

11

flat rule.  Doesn't matter whether there is any history 

12

at that place, any indication there's going to be 

13

violence.  Maybe there will, maybe there won't.  Across 

14

the board, a zone around every place where there's a 

15

strike. 

16

 MS. MILLER: 

Right.  Well, certainly it 

17

would be an easier case to defend if there was a 

18

history, as we have here.  And you'd have to prove that 

19

the solution 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You don't think there's a 

21

history  you don't think there's a history of violence 

22

at places where there are strikes and replacement 

23

workers? 

24
25

 MS. MILLER: 

Well, I don't think there has 

been the kind of history and sustained violence that

46

Alderson Reporting Company

we've had  this almost unique record in Massachusetts 

2

with respect to facilities.  But Your Honor, I would

of the labor history.

 MS. MILLER:

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's not my understanding 

 does not have is 
Is there any abortion 

8

clinic that has not had  is there any abortion clinic 

9

that has not had a problem in Massachusetts? 

10

 MS. MILLER: 

In  there was, when the 

11

legislature was considering the statute, there was a 

12

survey submitted by NARAL that reviewed the experience 

13

of the ten facilities that were then in existence in 

14

Massachusetts. 

15

 And six of them said that they had 

16

significant problems outside of their facilities.  Eight 

17

of them said, at the very least, they had regular 

18

protestors.  There were two who did not report that 

19

there was a significant problem.

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court: 
 The Massachusetts statute here is simply a 

7

place regulation that does not ban speech, but instead 

8

effectively moves it from one part of a public forum to 

9

another, in this case away from the small areas 

10

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Which of our  which of 

our precedents do you think governs this case? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I think 

13

that there are a number of precedents that are helpful. 

14

Madsen, of course, upheld the 36foot buffer zone that 

15

had a nospeech zone very much like this. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That was an injunction. 

17

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

It was an injunction, Your 

18

Honor, but it was upheld under an even stricter standard 

19

that  that is applies here.  But even aside from that, 

20

I think a number of the pillars of Petitioners' 

21

arguments here are directly contradicted by this Court's 

22

precedents.  So, for example, the idea that  that 

23

unrestricted  that you have the right to choose the 

24

best mechanism of communication is contradicted by 

25

Hefernon and by Frisby.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

 In Hefernon, there was  the Petitioner 


2


said, "I need to be able to talk quietly to people to 


3


ask for money, and that's the only way I can get it." 


4


And this Court said you have ample communication 


5


channels  alternative channels over in that booth. 

6

 In Frisby, what the protestor wanted to do 

7

was target a house, and what this Court said in Frisby 

8

was you have alternative channels of communication.  You 

9

can go door to door.  You can mail things.  You can make 

10

calls.  So I think that that pillar of the  of the

argument

here?

Your Honor, the 

testimony 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Until you get to the area 

7

close to the clinic, you don't know whether passersby 

8

are going there or not. 

9

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, the testimony 

10

is actually to the contrary, that they get  that Ms. 

11

McCullen and others get quite good at identifying who is 

12

going and is not going into the clinic.  And actually 

13

so what we're talking about is the last four to five 

14

seconds before they go in.  And Justice Kagan 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is your concern that, 

16

absent this statute, there will be physical obstruction 

17

to the entrance?  Is that a major concern? 

18

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, let me 

19

address that.  The answer is  the answer is yes, but 

20

that's not all.  What the legislature had before it, and 

21

Justice Breyer 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let me ask, if that's 

23

if that's your concern, how many Federal prosecutions 

24

were brought in Massachusetts for physical obstruction 

25

under the Federal statute?

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I'm not aware 

2

of the number.  There are 45 FACE prosecutions 

3

nationwide.  But FACE is a very different statute.  The 

4

criminal prosecutions in FACE are for  are for murder, 

5

arson, and for chaining yourselves to doorways.  They 

6

are not for the kind of quiet counseling and  and 

7

picketing that's at issue here. 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But the Federal interest 

that you're the defending is you don't want this 
physical obstruction statute to be misinterpreted. 

11

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

That's right. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But what's wrong with the 

13

physical obstruction statute as an answer to many of the 

14

problems that Massachusetts is facing? 

15

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I don't think 

16

it's at all an answer to the problems Massachusetts is 

17

facing because, as Justice Scalia has repeatedly pointed 

18

out, these are not the type of defendants who are at 

19

issue in the FACE Act.  What FACE Act is talking about 

20

is murder, arson, and chaining to doorways. 

21

 What this statute is getting at is something 

22

quite different.  It is congestion in front of doorways. 

23

It is people  individuals handing out 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That's obstruction under 

the Federal statute.

dog knows the difference in being stumbled over and 

7

being kicked. 

8

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Can't  can't  you're 

10

saying Federal prosecutions can't tell when people are 

11

deliberately obstructing 

12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I'm saying 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

 this is beyond  this 

14
15

is beyond the realm of the law? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I'm saying what's at issue 

16

here, Your Honor, is not that kind of  of deliberative 

17

obstruction.  What the testimony before the legislature 

18

was, was that there was a congregation of people and the 

19

massing of people.  That indeed, there were Pro Choice 

20

protestors in the zone who have  certainly are not 

21

intending to obstruct. 

22

 And it was  so what they were dealing with 

23

was quiet counseling leading to  countercounseling 

24

leading to congestion in front of the doorways. 

25

 They also was testimony that there were

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

people handing literature to moving cars, accidents and 

2

near accidents, which are not intentional obstruction in 

3

the least.  The kinds of statutes that this Court 

4

that  that are at issue in the specific intent crime 

5

in Massachusetts and the FACE Act do not get at the kind 

6

of peaceful, quiet, yet congesting and disrupting 

7

conduct that is at issue here. 

8
9

 And, Justice Breyer, I would urge you to 
look at the Evans testimony at Joint Appendix 67 to 71. 

10

The Hefernon testimony at 79 to 80.  The Coakley 

11

testimony of JA51, and the Capone testimony at JA19. 

12

There are specific arguments as to why these did not 

13

work. 

14

 The argument Petitioners make here, Your 

15

Honors, is very, very broad.  The lower courts have 

16

upheld buffer zones around political conventions, around 

17

circuses, around funerals. 

18

 The idea that you could defeat those buffer 

19

zones by simply saying, I would like to have a quiet 

20

conversation with the delegates as they go into the 

21

political convention, would wipe out a number of court 

22

of appeals decisions and the kind of buffer zones that 

23

this Court, I submit, and that the lower courts have 

24

found are  are needed. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how far do you 

2

think  what do you think a State legislature or 

3

Congress needs to find in order to establish a zone 

4

around some category of facility at which there  they 

5

have some evidence that there have been some disruptions 

6

and some obstruction? 

7

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9

So, Your Honor 
Take the example of  I 

think it's  it's a real  real ordinance someplace 

10

you can't have, there's a buffer zone around fraternal 

11

lodges. 

12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I'm not 

13

aware of the history of fraternal lodges, but what's at 

14

issue here is really 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What would they have to 

16

find?  Or slaughterhouses.  Or labor  or sites where 

17

there are strikes. 

18

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So I think  I think, for 

19

example, in the slaughterhouse or what they found in 

20

around circuses and conventions is the idea that there 

21

is massing of people that prevents the orderly ingress 

22

and egress to and from the facilities. 

23

 What the State was dealing with here was not 

24

an isolated incident, but the State had 14, 15 years of 

25

history of the massing.  They had tried other things.

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

They had tried the statutes that Justice Scalia 

2

identified.  They had tried a narrower buffer zone, and 

3

the testimony was it wasn't working, and that the police 

4

were coming in and said, we can't enforce it.  Why is 

5

that?  Because they had a hard time measuring consent, 

6

evaluating what does 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What kind of a record do 

8

they need?  Could  could there be a State law that 

9

says no picketing around any  you can never have a 

10

picket around any store to try to prevent people  to 

11

tell people don't go  don't patronize this store. 

12

Could they do that?  Isn't that Thornhill v. Alabama? 

13
14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Right.  And what 

actually, in Thornhill, they struck that down. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

16

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Right. 
But it was very different 

17

from this statute.  Thornhill's was you can't go 

18

anywhere near the facility and it was  it was only one 

19

type of speech. 

20
21
22
23
24
25

 This is content neutral and it is  it is a 
narrow buffer zone. 
 Justice Kagan, I really urge you to 
because 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I mean, I understand. 

Stop.  I'll ask this one more time.

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
I think it's  I understand 

3

the  the desire to create a buffer zone around certain 

4

sensitive facilities.  What I'm asking is:  What 

5

requirements, if any, does Congress or a State 

6

legislature have to meet before they can do that?  If it 

7

is done, do we simply say they  they have a rational 

8

basis for it and that's it, so they can establish 

9

basically a buffer zone around any kind of a facility 

10

they want. 

11

 If not, then what needs to be established? 

12

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So, Your Honor, I think in 

13

the evidentiary realm, it's hard to have hardandfast 

14

rules.  I would say you would need a lengthy history of 

15

serious congestion and other problems and  and a 

16

some sort of showing that the alternatives weren't 

17

working, but that's what's here.  This problem has been 

18

going on in Massachusetts since 1994. 

19

 This is not something the legislature woke 

20

up one day and said in light of one incident, we're 

21

going to  to deal with this.  They tried other things. 

22

They  and the evidence, therefore, supported this. 

23

What would it take to support a broader statute?  It's 

24

hard for me to say, but I think this record shows. 

25

 Justice Kagan, can I 

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

One more thing.  What about 

2

the example of a strike?  There certainly is a long 

3

history of labor violence in places where there are 

4

replacement workers.  Could that  could it be done in 

5

that situation across the board? 

6

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

So I think that would be a 

7

very broad statute and hard  hard to defend.  But if 

8

there were before the legislature, as there is in this 

9

case, the kind of congestion  and the solution, I 

10

submit, is much narrower than the Petitioners are 

11

suggesting.  It is to clear out an area around the 

12

entrance. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

What kind of 
Justice Kagan, the 

15

testimony is 22 feet from the entrance in Boston, 

16

22 feet from the edge of the doorway to the edge of 

17

the  of the buffer zone.  It is from me to the 

18

marshal.  It is not to the back of the courtroom.  It 

19

is  it is an NBA 3point zone.  I don't  it is not 

20

the 

21
22

saying the reasonableness of it. 

23

 (Laughter.) 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

But I understand you're 

But go back to 

Justice Alito's first question.  Maybe we can make some

57

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

progress here. 
 The regulation of labor is up to the NLRB. 

3

All right.  Now, the NLRB does regulate picketing.  It 

4

does say what you can do and can't do, and the courts 

5

have reviewed that.  And you  what standard do courts 

6

use when the NLRB decides, in its wisdom and expertise, 

7

well, the pickets can go here, but they can't go there. 

8

You can do this, but you can't do that.  All of which 

9

have speech implications.  What standard of review do 

10
11
12
13

the courts use? 
 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

Your Honor, I am not aware 

of the standard they use, but it is a 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Are you aware of any 

14

case  I'm putting it  loading it because  only 

15

because to show my ignorance of it  where the standard 

16

has differed from the ordinary APA standard? 

17
18
19

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I'm not, Your Honor.  I'm 

not aware of cases one way or the other. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Should we create a new 

20

standard for reviewing this kind of regulation?  I think 

21

that's actually a serious question. 

22
23

 MR. GERSHENGORN: 

I don't think so, Your 

Honor.  Thank you. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 Mr. Rienzi, you have three minutes

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Thank you, counsel. 

Official

remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK L. RIENZI 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

4

 MR. RIENZI: 

5

 Several points. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
First, it's not impossible 

6

to draw a statute to deal with the problems.  49 other 

7

States deal with the alleged problems.  The next 

8

prosecution Massachusetts institutes for blocking a door 

9

will be its first in at least two decades. 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is that true, Mr. Rienzi? 

Is Massachusetts' statute the only one of this kind? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

It is the only State statute of 

13

its kind.  There are a few municipal statutes of  that 

14

are similar that are, frankly, based on the First 

15

Circuit decisions in this case. 

16

 Secondly, here, the police officers 

17

testified that they know all the regular players at the 

18

clinics.  That's their testimony.  They know them all. 

19

Well, if you know them all and if they're congregating 

20

in the doors and they need to get out of the doors, you 

21

should go to court and get an injunction and say, stay 

22

out of the doors. 

23

 Until they do that, the claim that they have 

24

to throw their hands up and put people in prison for 

25

peaceful speech is not a very persuasive claim.

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Secondly, all of the evidence that the 

2

United States cited  cited you to from the record, all 

3

of it, Boston, Saturday mornings.  The claim that the 

4

legislature can extrapolate from that to ban peaceful 

5

speech in Boston at other times when the sidewalk is 

6

empty, and at other clinics where the sidewalk is empty 

7

and say, well, there's abortion there, and where there's 

8

abortion, we expect certain speech problems, therefore, 

9

we're going to make it illegal to speak there. 

10

 That's the State's claim here. 

The evidence 

11

is Boston specific.  The First Amendment requires 

12

precision.  They need to regulate the problem where it 

13

happens and if that means police officers, if that means 

14

dispersal laws, if that means actually bringing a FACE 

15

prosecution, which the United States has never done, 

16

they ought to do that.  But they shouldn't imprison 

17

Mrs. McCullen for her speech. 

18

 Third, the United States mentions 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

24
25

Are you questioning the 

government's representation?  I haven't looked at FACE. 
 MR. RIENZI: 

I don't believe the 

government 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Is it limited to the 

three situations, to  to murder, arson and chaining? 
 MR. RIENZI: 

Thank you, Your Honor.

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 No, it is not. 

The statute is not remotely 

2

limited to that.  I direct the Court to Section C  I'm 

3

sorry, Section  it's the definitions section of the 

4

statute.  Definition 4, physical obstruction, includes 

5

even making entry unreasonably difficult.  It is not at 

6

all solely for violence.  It's for physical obstruction 

7

even making it unreasonably difficult. 

8
9

 Counsel said that they brought 45 cases 
across the country.  That's true.  Zero, zero in 

10

Massachusetts.  They shouldn't be able to restrict the 

11

peaceful speech. 

12

 Lastly, to the extent the Court feels the 

13

need to recognize that there are some situations that 

14

are so extraordinary that we should put people in prison 

15

for peaceful conversations on public streets, that ought 

16

to be the exceptional case where the statute passes 

17

strict scrutiny and the State actually has tried the 

18

solutions that it claims don't work.  That is not this 

19

case. 

20

 The government does not claim its 

21

restriction to pass strict scrutiny.  They didn't say it 

22

would be impossible.  They said it would be hard.  49 

23

other States do different things.  The Federal 

24

government protects peaceful speech in the FACE law. 

25

 FACE is a great example of something that

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deliberately gets at the problem and if somebody's in 

2

the doorway and they need to get out of the doorway, the 

3

answer is, sir, please get out of the doorway.  It is 

4

not dragging Mrs. McCullen off to prison because she has 

5

a consensual conversation 25 feet away from the doorway. 

6

 That's an extraordinary power for the 

7

government to ask to selectively control speech among 

8

willing participants on public sidewalks. 

9

 Thank you very much.
