ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. FEIGIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If Congress had intended to waive the

12

sovereign immunity of the United States to allow

13

uncapped emotional distress claims under the Privacy

14

Act, it would have and was required to state that waiver

15

clearly and unambiguously in the statutory text.

16

The substantive requirements of the Act

17

sweep far beyond any pre-existing common law protection

18

of privacy to impose a detailed set of new and pervasive

19

requirements on the collection, maintenance, use, and

20

dissemination of millions of Federal agency records.

21

The Act, for example, forbids agencies from keeping too

22

much information about an individual; compels agencies

23

to collect information about an individual, when

24

practicable, from the individual himself and not from

25

other sources; and can require agencies to safeguard

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

information about an individual even when that

2

information is otherwise already publicly available.

3

Congress would not have taken lightly the

4

question of whether to expose the United States to

5

expansive damages for intentional or willful violations

6

of these novel recordkeeping requirements.

7

way in which the district court believed that the Social

8

Security Administration violated the Privacy Act in this

9

case is something that never would have been actionable

Indeed, the

10

at common law and never would have resulted in emotional

11

distress recovery.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then maybe Congress

13

shouldn't have passed this statute.

14

invasion of privacy, that's not something where

15

pecuniary damages are -- are prime if they exist at all.

16

I mean, this is -- the -- the tort that this is

17

comparable to is intentional infliction of emotional

18

distress.

19

this embarrassment, this humiliation, doesn't have

20

out-of-pocket costs but is terribly distressed, nervous,

21

anxious, and all the rest.

22

But the injury, the

The -- the person who is subject to this, to

The -- the act that the Congress is

23

reaching, the impact of it is of that nature, not -- I

24

mean, pecuniary damages do not ordinarily attend conduct

25

that embarrasses, humiliates you, causes mental

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1
2

distress.
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first of all, Justice

3

Ginsburg, I'd like to respectfully disagree with the

4

premise of the question that the Privacy Act is

5

comparable to common law invasion of privacy.

6

requirements I just described that are under the Privacy

7

Act would not have existed at common law invasion of

8

privacy even though common law invasion of privacy was,

9

as you say, compensable with emotional distress awards.

All the

10

In fact, even if we focus just on the disclosure-related

11

provision of the Privacy Act, it itself is much broader

12

than common law invasion of privacy.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even if it is -- even if

14

it is, the damages are -- the damages are not of a

15

pecuniary kind.

16

much more generous than the common law was, but the

17

impact on the person who is suing is not going to be

18

out-of-pocket business loss, pecuniary loss; it's going

19

to be the embarrassment, the humiliation.

20

it's -- if Congress wanted to do something about the

21

impact on the person it has given a right, it's not

22

going to do something that has to do with pecuniary

23

damages which it's not likely the person in -- in this

24

plaintiff's situation is not likely to suffer.

25

So, you could say that Congress was

MR. FEIGIN:

So, it's --

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

there sometimes are, as there were at common law,

2

pecuniary damages resulting from either violations of

3

the Privacy Act or invasions of privacy; and the

4

government sometimes pays out very large pecuniary

5

judgments.

6

But to get to the core of your question

7

about why Congress might not in the Privacy Act have

8

provided an emotional distress award, I think the text

9

of the Act demonstrates that Congress thought about the

10

possibility of providing an emotional distress award,

11

but decided not to do that in the initial version of the

12

Act that it passed in 1974.

13

the Act in section 5(c)(2)(B)(iii) assigned to the

14

Privacy Protection Study Commission the task of making a

15

recommendation as to whether the Act should later be

16

expanded to provide for general damages.

17

Instead, that version of

The commission understood its mission to

18

determine -- was to determine whether the Act ought to

19

be expanded to provide for dignitary and reputational

20

harms, such as compensation for emotional distress.

21

the Privacy Commission further understood that the Act

22

as it had been enacted provided only for actual damages,

23

which it interpreted as synonymous with special damages.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

But that's the -- why --

is -- is a harm to a dignitary interest, is that an

Alderson Reporting Company

actual injury?

2

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You describe that

4

injury -- I mean, it is an injury, the emotional

5

distress, the humiliation.

6

MR. FEIGIN:

Is that an actual injury?

Your Honor, the term "actual

ambiguous terms.

MR. FEIGIN:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He did not -At least, did he allege

that he had suffered an actual injury?

15
16

Well, let's take this

Did the plaintiff suffer an actual injury?

12

14

And --

MR. FEIGIN:

He did not suffer actual

damages within the meaning of the Privacy Act.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I didn't -- I didn't ask

18

you that.

19

as opposed to someone who is complaining about

20

something -- an abstract right or an abstract theory?

21

Is there an actual injury here?

22

I asked you, did he suffer an actual injury,

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think my

23

difficulty with the question is that I don't think the

24

term "actual injury" has some plain meaning out of

25

context.

And the term that the Privacy Act uses is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

"actual damages."

I think in the context of the Privacy

2

Act, as well as in other contexts --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

injury first before you can get damages.

5

question is, was there an injury?

6

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, you have to have an
So, my

Well, if Your Honor's question

7

is whether he suffered an adverse effect within the

8

meaning of --

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
MR. FEIGIN:

Yes.

-- section (g)(1)(D) of the

11

Act, yes, we believe he did suffer an adverse effect

12

sufficient to confer standing.

13

described the adverse effect requirement as simply

14

codifying the Article III standing requirements and made

15

very clear that simply because a plaintiff may have

16

suffered an adverse effect, that doesn't mean that the

17

plaintiff suffered actual damages.

18

Justice Ginsburg --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But this Court in Doe

But,

I'm a little bit

20

confused by that because in your brief, the Solicitor

21

General's brief in Doe, it described the earlier version

22

of general damages in the following way -- and I'm

23

quoting from your brief there:

24

provision in the Senate bill likely derived from the

25

common law of tort of invasion of privacy where general

"The general damages

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

damages may be awarded as" -- quote -- "'presumed

2

damages,' without proof of harm."

3

So, I think there in Doe you argued that

4

general damages presumed injury.

5

different than, I think, the question Justice Ginsburg

6

was asking you.

7

arguments as sort of an -- an assumption that if you

8

suffer nonpecuniary harm, you haven't been injured.

9

But that's very

It's -- and I read your brief and your

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

between presumed damages and proven injury.

12

we reference the common law tort as requiring actual

13

proof of injury for emotional distress.

14

say you have to prove the emotional distress.

15

presuming the injury.

16

you, aren't you the one confusing what injury is from

17

presumed damage?

18

There's a big difference
In Gertz,

Most State laws
We're not

MR. FEIGIN:

So, I guess what I'm saying to

I hope not, Your Honor.

But

19

the -- the -- I think to get at your question, what we

20

said in the Doe brief is that general damages are a type

21

of presumed damages, and that's correct under the common

22

law, but that isn't all that general damages

23

encompasses.

24

in Doe, are always presumed in the sense that they're

25

always assumed -- this is the common law definition of

General damages, as the Court recognized

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

general damages -- are always presumed in the sense

2

they're always assumed to have taken place and an award

3

of general damages can be made even without specific

4

proof of harm.

5

in cases where a plaintiff did introduce evidence of the

6

extent of, for example, the emotional distress that he

7

had suffered -- so, if he wanted to say I'm not happy

8

with the presumed damages that you would give to just

9

anybody who had suffered this invasion of privacy, I

But in cases where a -- at common law,

10

have a particularly sterling reputation or I am

11

particularly sensitive to this sort of thing, I suffered

12

a -- an increased amount of harm from what you might

13

presume the average person would suffer, the award that

14

that person would receive is --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why is that

16

different from actual injury?

17

sleeping.

18

The typical things that juries look at to determine

19

whether you've proven emotional distress --

I have a nervous stomach.

20

MR. FEIGIN:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

I have -- I'm not
I'm not eating.

Well, Your Honor -Why is that not actual

injury?
MR. FEIGIN:

So, the award that person would

24

receive for the additional proof of emotional distress

25

would be classified as general damages.

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, to get to

Official

11
1

your question of why that's not actual damages.

2

Sometimes the terms "actual damages" or "actual injury"

3

can be used to include proven emotional distress, but

4

the term was ambiguous.

5

and 2 of our reply brief in which the term "actual

6

damages" or "actual damage" is used to mean exclusively

7

pecuniary harm.

8
9

We cite cases in footnotes 1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I've looked at those

cases, and in all of them except for two, where the

10

reference wasn't really precise, it was because the use

11

of "actual damages" in the particular statute were

12

limited to pecuniary harms or the nature of the harms at

13

issue were pecuniary by nature.

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, most of those

15

cases are cases out of the common law, and sometimes

16

they use "actual damages" in the same sentence with a

17

reference to emotional harm, making clear that they

18

think that the two types of harms are separate.

19

But, Your Honor, maybe I can try to explain

20

it this way:

I think actually Respondent implicitly

21

agrees with our definition of general damages as

22

including proven harm.

23

page 20 of the red brief and then again at page 22 of

24

the red brief, the definition of "actual damages" that

25

Respondent is offering he divides into two

If you look at footnote 2 on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

subcategories:

2

Everybody agrees that special damages are limited to

3

pecuniary harm.

4

special damages and general damages.

And Respondent makes no claim, nor could he,

5

that the type of damages he's seeking are special

6

damages.

7

to recovery under the Act, it's because he thinks that

8

the emotional distress harm that he wants to prove are

9

general damages.

So, to the extent he thinks that he's entitled

And if there's one thing we know about

10

the definition of "actual damages" in the Act, it's that

11

it doesn't include general damages, because, again,

12

Congress separately in the text of the Privacy Act

13

assigned the Privacy Protection Study Commission to make

14

a recommendation about whether the Act should later be

15

expanded to include general damages.

16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What does "actual

damages" mean under the Fair Credit Reporting Act?
MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, we don't have a

19

position on that at this point.

I can describe to you

20

how we think that the inquiry would work.

21

in some statutes actual damages might in context include

22

emotional distress awards.

23

damages" by itself in a waiver of sovereign immunity is

24

not a clear and unambiguous waiver of the United States'

25

sovereign immunity for claims of emotional distress.

We think that

But the term "actual

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

And as to statutes which do not allow claims

2

against the United States, it would be a question of

3

context and legislative history.

4

the same kind of workup of the Fair Credit Reporting Act

5

that we've done of the Privacy Act in this case.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we'd have to do

One --

But it can mean, and I

7

think it has been held to mean, damages to a dignitary

8

interest.

9

has been held to mean that under the Fair Credit

10
11

Mental distress has been held to -- the term

Reporting Act.
MR. FEIGIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Multiple

12

courts of appeals have held that, and we're not

13

questioning that conclusion for purposes of this case

14

with the caveat that we don't think the United States is

15

subject to suit under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

16

If the United States were subject to suit

17

under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, then because

18

there's ambiguity about the meaning of "actual damages,"

19

we think that the narrower interpretation as limited to

20

pecuniary harm would control.

21

One other distinction between the Fair

22

Credit Reporting Act and the Privacy Act is, again, as

23

I've said, the Privacy Act specifically carves out

24

general damages as a type of damages that aren't going

25

to be awarded, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act does

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

not.

2

The Fair Credit Reporting Act also has a

3

much more permissive remedial scheme, allowing in

4

certain cases for statutory damages and also allowing

5

for punitive damages.

6

Reporting Act, for the various reasons I've just

7

mentioned, is a particularly good analogue for the

8

Privacy Act.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11

I don't think the Fair Credit

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Under -Just to question what the

term means, what the term "actual damages" means.

12

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, again, as

13

we've demonstrated in our briefs, I think -- again, I'd

14

refer the Court to footnotes 1 and 2 for how this term

15

was used at the common law -- the term "actual damages"

16

can mean both things.

17

So, the fact that in the Privacy Act it

18

does include -- it may include emotional distress awards

19

doesn't mean that that's the sense in which Congress

20

used it in the Privacy Act -- I'm sorry; I may have said

21

that wrong.

22

Credit Reporting Act it may include emotional distress

23

doesn't mean that that's the way in which Congress used

24

it in the Privacy Act.

25

The fact that in the context of the Fair

And I think --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there -- are there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

instances where, if there's an invasion of privacy and

2

there's a documented trauma from psychosomatic illness

3

with medical expenses and lost wages, is that special --

4

is that actual damage?

5

MR. FEIGIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

If there are

6

documented medical expenses that were out-of-pocket

7

expenses, then we think, even if they arise from

8

emotional distress, then they would be pecuniary harm

9

and could be compensated under the Privacy Act.

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Are you

arguing that the emotional distress component can't be?

12

MR. FEIGIN:

The emotional distress

13

component itself cannot be, but medical expenses to

14

treat symptoms of emotional distress --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, you're -- under --

16

as I understand the definition of "special damages" in

17

common law, if you proved any pecuniary harm, you were

18

also entitled to the mental distress damages as well.

19

So, you want half of the common law award -- award?

20

MR. FEIGIN:

I don't think that's quite

21

correct about the definition of "special damages," Your

22

Honor.

23

"Special damages," the term in this context, is always

24

limited to pecuniary harm.

25

And I don't think there is any dispute on this.

Once --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We may have a difference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

of -- of history there because, yes, special damages

2

required pecuniary harm, but once you prove that, it

3

also permitted recovery of nonpecuniary losses as well.

4

MR. FEIGIN:

5

law suit for defamation per quod --

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's what your

brief said, actually.

8
9

Well, Your Honor, in a common

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, no, Your Honor.

What we

said in our brief is, in a common lawsuit for defamation

10

per quod, there are two types of damages that could be

11

recovered:

12

a -- special damages were limited to pecuniary harm.

13

Unless a plaintiff could prove at least some special

14

damages, they wouldn't be entitled to any recovery at

15

all.

16

they could recover not only special damages -- in other

17

words, pecuniary harm -- but could also recover general

18

damages; that is, damages for emotional distress or

19

other dignitary --

special damages and general damages.

If a plaintiff could prove some special damages,

20
21
22

Unless

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
differently.

We're not talking any

That's what I just said.
MR. FEIGIN:

If you --

Yes, Your Honor.

I think to

23

the extent I was perhaps disagreeing with you is I was

24

understanding you to say that the definition of "special

25

damages," the term, sometimes includes emotional

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

distress awards.

2

to pecuniary harm.

3

The term "special damages" is limited

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sort of odd for Congress

4

to borrow from the defamation context and with a defined

5

term of art, "special damages," and not use it in the

6

Privacy Act if that's what it intended.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9
10

Well, Your Honor -And to use a term,

"actual damages," which has a much broader meaning than
"special damages."

11

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, as the Court

12

recognized in Doe, there's a structural similarity

13

between the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act

14

and the remedial scheme for defamation per quod at

15

common law.

16

structural similarity is that defamation per quod at

17

common law solves the problem that Congress faced when

18

it was crafting the Privacy Act, which is trying to

19

figure out when a plaintiff's injuries are sufficiently

20

serious and concrete as to justify an award of damages.

21

And I think one reason there might be that

I think it makes sense if, as the Court

22

supposed in Doe, Congress were aware of how defamation

23

per quod had solved that problem, that Congress would

24

have adopted the same limitation -- in other words, a

25

requirement of showing of pecuniary harm -- as the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

threshold requirement under the Privacy Act.

2

Now, Congress had very good reason to be

3

cautious about extending the scope of liability under

4

the Privacy Act.

5

regulates a great deal of conduct that wouldn't have

6

been compensable at all in common law, let alone

7

resulted in any sort of emotional distress award.

8

As I've said, the Privacy Act

Now, Congress recognized, I think, some of

9

the concerns that Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor

10

have raised about why plaintiffs might in some instances

11

deserve recovery for emotional distress.

12

recognized that there are arguments on both sides -- on

13

both sides on that issue.

14

the Privacy Act was to defer that issue for later and

15

assign the Privacy Protection Study Commission to make a

16

recommendation about whether the scope of liability that

17

the Act --

18

But it

And what it decided to do in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the -- the Privacy

19

Study Commission coming after can't say what the statute

20

means.

21

I mean, the statute exists, and then we have a Study

22

Commission to see what amendments might be made.

23

the Study Commission can't decide what the -- what the

24

Act means.

25

I mean, that would be post-legislative history.

MR. FEIGIN:

But

Well, two points on that, Your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

Honor:

2

damages issue to the Privacy Protection Study Commission

3

is in the text of the Act that Congress enacted in 1974.

4

So, the exclusion of general damages doesn't depend at

5

all on anything the Privacy Protection Study Commission

6

said.

7

First of all, the reference of the general

As to the weight we think the Privacy

8

Protection Study Commission report should receive, first

9

of all we think it's very telling evidence that there is

10

at the very least ambiguity about what the term "actual

11

damages" could mean.

12

Commission interpreted the term "actual damages" in

13

precisely the same way that we do in our brief; that is,

14

as special damages, as that term was understood in

15

defamation torts at common law, which the Privacy

16

Protection Commission Study report makes very clear at

17

page 530 is limited to pecuniary harm.

18

The Privacy Protection Study

I think, if for no other reason than that

19

that's a reasonable reading, I think the sort of

20

judicial restraint that is embodied in the canon that

21

I think it would have been very unusual for

Honor, because they wanted, in the wake of Watergate, to

impose a set of detailed substantive requirements about

23

through the Act, which takes up maybe 30 pages of the

25

codification of common law invasion of privacy against

the Federal Government.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MR. FEIGIN:

4
5

But it's --

It does much, much more than

that.
Your Honor, even if we look just at the

6

disclosure-related provision, it's broader than common

7

law invasion of privacy in two very important ways.

8

for common law invasion of privacy, a plaintiff would

9

have to prove disclosure of very personal and private

So,

10

information to the public at large.

Under the Privacy

11

Act, however, a disclosure even to a single person would

12

constitute a violation of the Act, and the information

13

doesn't even have to be private.

14

Let me give a concrete example.

15

government has a record that contains information that

16

someone has a criminal conviction, it might be a

17

violation of the Privacy Act for the contents of that

18

record to be disclosed, even though someone could obtain

19

the same information by going to the court records or

20

potentially looking them up on the Internet.

21

So, if the

And particularly since violations of Federal

22

law are typically -- typically, the only type of relief

23

a plaintiff can seek for violation of Federal law is

24

equitable relief under the Administrative Procedure Act.

25

I don't think there's any reason to assume that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

ambiguously or, I think, really silently decided that it

2

was going to ratchet things up to a serious degree and

3

expose the United States to uncapped emotional distress

4

damages under the Privacy Act.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It did set a pretty high

6

bar for the plaintiff to meet, because the plaintiff

7

would have to prove intentional or willful conduct, not

8

negligence, but --

9
10
11

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, three points on that,

Your Honor.
First of all, I think if Congress had

12

thought that the limitation to intentional or willful

13

conduct was itself a sufficient limitation on the

14

liability of the United States, it wouldn't have been so

15

reluctant to provide for general damages or perhaps even

16

for punitive damages.

17

Second, the courts of appeals now generally

18

interpret the intentional or willful requirement to

19

require only something slightly less than recklessness

20

or slightly more than gross negligence, which in

21

practice provides district courts and courts of appeals

22

with a great deal of flexibility to find intentional or

23

willful violations in cases where the Federal Government

24

doesn't believe it should be liable.

25

Third, to the extent the intentional or

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

willful requirement does impose a limitation on a

2

plaintiff's recovery, what actually winds up happening

3

in practice is that plaintiffs or courts will look to

4

all the various technical provisions of the Privacy Act

5

to try to find some violation that can be classified as

6

intentional or willful.

7

about whom information has been disclosed can't show the

8

disclosure is intentional or willful, he may try to

9

prove that a violation of the -- of (e)(10), which

So, for example, if a plaintiff

10

requires the government to safeguard information, was

11

intentional or willful.

reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND A. CARDOZO

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19

MR. CARDOZO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

Embracing the Government's view of "actual

21

damages" would mean that the very individuals Congress

22

sought to protect in this Act would have no remedy at

23

all for the primary form of harm that was well

24

recognized at common law when this Act was passed.

25

To carry out the Act's protective purposes,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

this Court need only give the words "actual damages"

2

their common and ordinary meaning that appears in

3

Black's Law Dictionary:

4

liquidated, punitive, or other forms of damages that are

5

not tied to proof of harm.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

proven, not presumed,

Could I ask you this

7

question about the damages that your client is seeking

8

in this case?

9

would -- are you claiming all of the damages that -- all

10

of the emotional damages that resulted from his criminal

11

conviction, or are you claiming only the emotional

12

damages that would have been suffered by anybody else

13

whose records were turned over to the FAA under the

14

Operation Safe Pilot program?

15

If -- if we affirm the Ninth Circuit,

MR. CARDOZO:

If you affirm, there will be a

16

proximate causation question that arises on remand.

18

distress that followed from the prosecution.

20

The

So, he cannot recover for the emotional

But, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we're

21

talking today not just about Mr. Cooper; we're talking

22

about every single person to whom this Act applies:

23

whistleblower who the government chooses to silence by

24

embarrassing and humiliating them --

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you allege that Mr.

the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

Cooper suffered a severe emotional distress when he was

2

confronted with the fact that his records had been

3

turned over.

4

court -- that on remand, there would have to be a

5

separation of the degree of distress that he suffered as

6

a result of simply knowing that somebody in the FAA had

7

access to his Social Security records, but disregard the

8

distress that somebody in that situation would naturally

9

feel when confronted with the fact that a criminal

10
11

So, you're -- you're saying that the

violation that he had committed had been exposed?
MR. CARDOZO:

Yes.

And that's the kind of

12

thing judges routinely have to sort through.

13

example, someone suffers emotional distress and then

14

they lose their job thereafter, and the injury that

15

produces the emotional distress, the job -- the job loss

16

wasn't the proximate cause.

17

For

Judges -- in fact, we ask juries to do that.

18

In this case, it would be a judge sifting through that

19

and making that determination.

20

Petitioner Doe's case, the judge could find that the

21

emotional distress claim wasn't sufficient and reject it

22

altogether, but that's the nature of an emotional

23

distress remedy.

24
25

As happened in

One thing you didn't hear in that argument
almost at all was any discussion of the text of this

Alderson Reporting Company

27
1

Act, which tells you in at least four separate ways that

2

"actual damages" simply means proven, not presumed,

3

damages.

4

Beginning with the words themselves, that's,

5

of course, the most common meaning of "actual damages,"

6

the one that appears in Black's Law Dictionary.

7

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, the term of art for

8

economic loss in this arena is "special damages."

9

that's what Congress meant, presumably it would have

10

used that term.

11

category of damages only.

12

If

It's the more common way to express one
That's economic --

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you agree that the Act

13

does not allow recovery for what would have been

14

regarded at common law as general damages?

As

What would have been regarded

16

at common law as presumed -- the presumed damages, this

17

Act doesn't allow.

study.

19

That was peeled off for further

JUSTICE ALITO:

"General damages" -- that's

20

the term that they peeled off, right?

21

MR. CARDOZO:

Right.

But by keeping

22

"actual," the juxtaposition between actual and

23

general --

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But general damages is a

term from -- from the remedies in defamation cases,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

right?

2

MR. CARDOZO:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

And there are two types of

4

damages in defamation cases, special damages and general

5

damages?

And if you -- is that correct?

6

MR. CARDOZO:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

Correct.
So, you subtract general

damages, and what do you have left?

9

MR. CARDOZO:

But the interesting thing in

10

this case is they didn't take what you have left,

11

special damages, and they used a different term,

12

Congress did, "actual," a term that suggests we're going

13

to require proof of the damages.

14

presume them.

15

damages.

16

We're not going to

We're not going to allow speculative

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the problem is that --

17

that your definition of actual damages and the general

18

definition of actual damages includes some things that

19

fell within the rubric of general damages.

20

MR. CARDOZO:

That's true.

But several

21

other things in the text of the Act tell you, again,

22

that "actual" means simply proven, not presumed.

23

look at the section 2, where Congress recites findings

24

and the statement of purposes for the Act, the right

25

that's being described here is an individual and

ambiguity.

for this proposition in common law privacy cases."

13

Surely, Congress knew that very thing.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15
16

There is evidence

And by "pain and

suffering," they mean mental pain and suffering?
MR. CARDOZO:

Right.

Surely, Congress knew

that same thing.

not mean to cut out the primary form of harm.

11

Congress says "actual damages" in a privacy context,

12

it's fair to -- it's going to assume that people are

The common law background

The legislative history.

This Act, the Act that

scheme that authorized punitive damages, did not have

2

the intentional and willful requirement, had a

3

negligence standard, and a more measured version.

4

The Government's construction of this Act

5

throws that compromise out the window and rewrites the

6

Act as a one-sided in the Government's favor when what

7

clearly happened in the legislature was a balance was

8

struck.

9

Another thing about the legislative history,

10

both the House and Senate bills originally had the term

11

"actual damages" in there from the start, and they both

12

had "actual damages" simply as a counterpart to punitive

13

damages.

Again, another confirmation.

2

MR. CARDOZO:

They were referred for further

study, but what was authorized in the text, the

4

substantive provision, is actual damages, not special

5

damages.

6

If Congress had wanted to peel off the whole

7

piece and require only economic loss, the more common

8

and routine term of art that's used is "special

9

damages," which circles back to another important point.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but -- but elsewhere

11

in the statute, it's made very clear that Congress did

12

not think it was authorizing general damages, right?

13

Because it set up this commission to recommend whether

14

general damages should be included.

15

-- what would be the purpose of that commission if

when Justice Alito asked him this question, includes --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, you seem to be

13

arguing throughout that "general damages" meant actual

14

damages when "general damages," in my understanding,

15

meant two things:

16

illogical for Congress to look at what "general damages"

17

meant and pick the meaning that included proven damages,

18

actual?

19

presumed and actual.

MR. FEIGIN:

So, why is it

Well, Your Honor, I think if

20

you look at the sources cited in our brief, as well as

21

the sources cited in his brief -- in particular, I'd

22

refer you to the block quote on page 22 -- "general

23

damages," that term, most typically refers to a class or

24

a type of damages that could be presumed but could also

25

be proven.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

And when they are proven -- and I think

2

Respondent effectively conceded this -- they remain

3

general damages.

4

about general damages later, because that would have

5

been such a great expansion of the waiver of sovereign

6

immunity, I don't think the Act should be construed to

7

allow those type of emotional distress damages.

And because Congress decided to think

8

Now, Respondent would like to --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm still confused.

10

"General damages" meant presumed or actual?

11

says we don't want general damages because it includes

12

presumed.

13

How do you get from that, that Congress meant "only

14

pecuniary"?

15

just use that?

16

they just say "pecuniary damages," if that's what they

17

intended?

I mean, that has its -- why didn't they
Instead of "actual damages," why didn't

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

19

that's essentially Respondent's argument.

He wants to

20

fault Congress for not using the specific term "special

21

damages."

22

interpreting waivers of sovereign immunity on its head

23

and requires Congress to unambiguously not waive its

24

sovereign immunity when, in fact, what I think the Court

25

does is precisely the opposite.

in the legislative history that adopts our definition,

9

too, that's discussed in our brief.

10

It agreed with our reading, the reading

And -- and not

Now, I think what Respondent essentially

11

wants the Court to do here is to adopt the

12

recommendation of the Privacy Protection Study

13

Commission that the Act be expanded to allow both

special and general damages, in which case emotional

distress awards would be allowed.

16

some good policy arguments for that, as the Privacy
