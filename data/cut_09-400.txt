ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHNAPPER:

9
10

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The dismissal of an employee is often the

11
12

result of the interrelated actions and decisions of

13

several officials.

14

responsible for any particular official and his or her

15

actions and decisions turns on agency law.

16

legislates against a background of agency law and is

17

presumed to have intended agency principles to govern

18

that kind of question.

19

20

standard here.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before we jump to

24

agency law, shouldn't we take a look at the language of

25

the statute?

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the statute says that a

3

prima facie case is made out if it is shown that

4

military service, anti-military animus, was a motivating

5

factor in the employer's action.
The employer's action here was discharge,

6
7

right?

8

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's correct.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the word "motivate"

10

means to provide someone with a motive to do something,

11

right?

12

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes, sir.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the person who did

something here was the person who discharged, discharged

16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, that's not the -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

So why doesn't it follow

18

that the motivation that's relevant under the statute is

19

the motivation of the person who -- who performs the

20

action that is challenged?

21

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, there's a -- there are

22

a series of actions and decisions that yield this

23

result.

24

of the employer, not to any particular official.

5

under this statute; isn't that correct?

6

Not everything that's done, not -- just writing

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's correct.

But a

7

decision to -- the decision to dismiss an official is -­

8

can be, and is here, the result, the cumulative result,

9

of a series of decisions.

10

It's not unlike what occurs in -- in the

13

20

report to the supervisor who ultimately dismisses the

21

branches of agency law:

conduct by his or her official position.
And I think those principles would not

14

ordinarily apply to a coworker, but they would also not

15

apply invariably to a supervisor.

16

not advocating the supervisor versus non-supervisor

17

distinction in Ellerth, but -- but a return to just the

18

traditional agency doctrines.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do they stand in

3

different shoes from a co-employee who also contributes

4

to the ultimate decision to fire?

5

MR. SCHNAPPER:

But it's -- it's the core

6

responsibility of -- in terms of scope of employment,

7

it's the core responsibility of a supervisor of a

8

particular individual to be monitoring his or her

9

behavior, reporting on it, perhaps initiating

10
11

disciplinary matters -- measures.
That wouldn't be true of all supervisors.

12

It's only true of Mr. Staub's supervisors.

13

-- the kind of thing they did was the kind of work that

14

they were employed to engage in, and that distinguishes

15

them from, say, another supervisor who might slip a note

16

into a suggestion box.

17

So -- what

Second, the other branch, major branch, of

18

agency law is that an employer is liable for actions of

19

individuals when their conduct -- when they are aided in

20

their conduct by their official position, which would

21

not typically be true of a fellow worker.

22

could be true here.

error in the Seventh Circuit is the -- is the language

2

at page 47 of the Joint Appendix, where the court says:

3

Without regard to the jury verdict here, the employer is

off the hook if the decisionmaker did her own

That's an additional defense.

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

That isn't what the statute

says.

You -- you jump over the language of the statute.

12

It has to be a motivating factor in the decision to

13

discharge.

14

natural reading of that is that it looks at the

15

motivation of the person who actually makes the decision

to discharge.

And that speaks -- that looks natural -- the

Now, I'm not suggesting that's the right

that you have suggested is also a very unattractive

rule, one that I doubt the Congress intended to adopt.

Is there no reasonable middle position here?

23

That's a very unattractive rule.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

But the rule

It's all

Well, I think that the -­

24

the kind of circumstances that the Court has pointed to

25

would be relevant at the remedy stage.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

The remedies are

Official

1

-- are discretionary and, whereas 4311(c)(1) says

2

"shall," 4323 in describing all the remedies says "may."

3

And so a court could take those things into account in

4

framing a remedy.
And certainly the good faith efforts of

5
6

someone in Buck's position, for example, would be

7

relevant to a determination whether a violation was

8

willful.

9

this case, which is that the jury found that there was a

And that, in fact, reflects what happened in

10

violation -- found that the -- the motivations involved

11

here included an improper motivation, rejected the

12

4311(c)(1) defense, but then found the violation wasn't

13

willful.
So I think, given the structure of the

14
15

statute, the -- the play here, the ability to adjust to

16

those circumstances, is in the remedy provision, not in

17

the mandatory language of the 4311(c)(1).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't that -- isn't the

it seems that could possibly exist between a willful

willfulness as well.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

17

And

It's our view that the

language of the statute permits that distinction because

19

of the discretionary nature of the remedy provision as

12

MR. MILLER:

In our view, the "motivating

14

Something can be a motivating factor if it is one of

15

many factors, but, in our view, it does need to be more

16

than a trivial or de minimis factor, and if you have a

17

situation where the bias -- the action of the biased

18

supervisor leads through a long and improbable and

19

unforeseeable chain of causation to the adverse

employment action, you might have a but-for cause, but

What is that test that you proposed

The -- the discriminatorily

13

motivated actions in this case, on the evidence

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The parties to this case are in total

agreement with respect to two points.

The first point

is that Linda Buck made the decision to fire Vincent

Staub.

8

whatsoever that Linda Buck possessed animus toward Mr.

Staub on account of his service in the Reserve.

Applying ordinary tort-related vicarious

liability rules, Staub's case against Proctor Hospital

I think in that situation,

She just said:

MR. DAVIS:

Here's your pink slip;

that action.

Buck carefully investigated that, and, 5 days after it

argument that you were discharged on account of your

And that is absolutely -- Mr. Staub knew

that that works for him, because in 1998 he invoked the

similar reasons, and he was conditionally reinstated to

22

employment at Proctor Hospital.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did -- did I understand

25

"cat's paw" approach to this?
29
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. DAVIS:

I do agree with it.

The "cat's

2

paw" approach essentially gives Mr. Staub and others

demonstrate that the person who possessed animus

5

exercised so much control over the decisionmaker that

that person became the true decisionmaker.

7

8

reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

But he has to

And that

Well, before you -­

10

how is that consistent with the statutory language that

11

requires that this discrimination simply be a motivating

12

factor?
MR. DAVIS:

13

The answer to that is the

14

statute sets forth five factors, four or five factors,

15

and says that one of the four or five employment actions

16

has to be a motivating factor in arriving at the

17

decision.

the statutory factors.

Can we -- let's look at

It's 4311(a).

And it

says -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

are you reading it from?
MR. DAVIS:

From the third line -- well, I'm

sorry, I can't tell you what line it is.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. DAVIS:

Page 3 of the blue brief.

It says that there are five

3

actions that are prohibited:

denial of initial

4

employment, reemployment, retention in employment,

5

promotion, or any benefit of employment.
And it says that an employer cannot take

6
7

action, one of those actions, on the basis of four

8

factors:

9

performance, service -- or service of obligation in the

10

membership, application for membership,

uniformed services.
So there has to be something to connect one

11
12

of those factors to one of those five actions.

13

that's the literal meaning of the statute.

14

the Seventh Circuit's view is absolutely consistent with

15

that.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

And I think

Well, I'm sorry.

17

The statute says is a motivating -- one of those four

18

things, membership, application, et cetera, is a

19

motivating factor in the action.

20

MR. DAVIS:

Correct.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I understood

22

your position to be that the supervisor has to have such

23

dominant control that it's the "cat's paw."

25

MR. DAVIS:

That -- that -- the

subordinate's.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

MR. DAVIS:

Yes.

-- motivation is imputed

3

actually to the decisionmaker, and ultimately to the

4

employer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Well, I guess where

6

I'm having trouble following you is the total domination

7

motivating factor.

8

test that the Seventh Circuit has adopted.

It seems like a much more stringent

MR. DAVIS:

9

Well, I think in the context of

10

this case, Your Honor, it's not, because the definition

11

of "employer" here not only includes Proctor Hospital,

12

what you might call the ultimate employer, but it also

13

includes the person who made the adverse employment

14

decision.

And in this case, it's Linda Buck.
And this statute creates personal liability

15
16

for Ms. Buck or anybody else who makes a decision if

17

it's based on one of these factors contained in the

18

statute.

19

allowed to consider whether or not Ms. Buck is in

20

violation of the statute, because there's an absolute

21

dearth of evidence that any of these factors motivated

22

the decision she made.

23

I don't think there's any way a jury would be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that assumes that

24

the employment decision is solely hers.

25

based on her peccadilloes; it's hers based on
32
Alderson Reporting Company

It's hers, not

Official

1

information that she has gathered.

2

MR. DAVIS:

I agree.

It is hers to the

3

extent that she makes a good faith investigation into

4

the background facts.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

But -- but she's not

6

acting in a vacuum.

7

has been supplied to her by people who are authorized to

8

supply that to her in the employment context.
MR. DAVIS:

9
10

And -- and in this case, she's

acting on an awful lot of information.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

She's acting on information that

13

MR. DAVIS:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I am talking about just

15

the legal analysis, which is:

16

but there are multiple actors on behalf of the employer.

17

That's your adversary's position -­

18

MR. DAVIS:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

She's a decisionmaker,

I agree with that.
Or participating in the

process.
And they're saying if any of those actors in

22

the process has been delegated employment duties that

23

permit them to participate in this way, then if what

24

motivates them is bias of this kind, then the employer

25

is responsible, not just for Ms. Buck's activities, but
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for the two supervisors' discriminatory activities.
MR. DAVIS:

2

That would lead to a

3

never-ending chain of looking backwards all the time

4

over the course of perhaps a very long employment

5

history to scour the record to determine is there one

6

single or two single actions out there that may somehow

7

have come forward and caused this termination?

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, in most

9

situations, an employer comes in and says:

I fired X

10

for X, Y, and Z reasons.

11

of those inconsequential or immaterial reports, why

12

would a court rely on it at all?

13

factor.
MR. DAVIS:

14

And if they don't mention one

It's not a motivating

I'm not sure I thoroughly

15

understand the hypothetical, but if the true

16

decisionmaker there comes forward and says, I didn't

17

know about this, I didn't rely upon it -- I don't think

18

that the animus can be imputed to the decisionmaker.
JUSTICE BREYER:

19
20

Why is this so complicated?

I'm probably missing something.

21

MR. DAVIS:

I don't think -­

22

7

MR. DAVIS:

8

Now, why don't

we just stop there and just say we have a statute, the

statute says that if -- if a bad motive was a

12

discriminatory -- a discriminatory motivating factor in

13

the dismissal, then, unless you can prove an affirmative

defense, you lose.

15

Why do we have to have something special if

person who said the last words or happens to be somebody

18

who told somebody who said the last words or happens to

19

be somebody who told the somebody the

motivated by one of these factors, there has to be some

element of proximate causation -­

22

Well, fine.

You're

23

perfectly entitled to say that.

But what I don't see

24

that you're entitled to say are the words that the

25

Seventh Circuit used, which is:

of singular influence.

5

like it was a motivating cause.

6

something really special.

That sounds like it was

I -- I think that that is the

Seventh Circuit's way of saying proximate cause.
JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Ah, okay.

So why don't we

say:

Seventh Circuit, if that's your way of saying it

is just a normal thing like cause, we accept that, but

please don't use those words.

have used -- you might have used them meaning something

14

else, we will send this back so we're certain that what

you are doing is applying the same test to everything.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

I think -- I think that

23

you've misread -- I think that you've misread the "cat's

paw" principle of the court of appeals.

25

that it is, to them, a determination of proximate cause
37
Alderson Reporting Company

I don't think

Official

1

at all.
As I understand their opinion, they say that

2
3

the statute requires that the -- let me get the right

4

language here -- that the discriminatory -- prohibited

5

discriminatory factor must have been a motivating factor

6

in the employer's action.

7

must have motivated the person who took the employer's

8

action.

And they say that means it

It's not a motivating factor in the

9
10

employer's action unless the person who took the action

11

on behalf of the employer had that as its motive.
Then the court of appeals makes an

12
13

exception:

14

taking the action on behalf of the employer is really

15

not the person who took the action, but was totally

16

under the control of a subordinate who -- and the person

17

just swallowed that subordinate's determination, then we

18

will hold, even though the ultimate firing -- the person

19

who signed the pink slip, even though that person didn't

have the motive, if in fact the decision was effectively

21

the decision of a lower subordinate, we will hold the

22

employer.

23

However, if the person who appears to be
