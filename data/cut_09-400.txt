ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC SCHNAPPER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SCHNAPPER:

9
10

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The dismissal of an employee is often the

11
12

result of the interrelated actions and decisions of

13

several officials.

14

responsible for any particular official and his or her

15

actions and decisions turns on agency law.

16

legislates against a background of agency law and is

17

presumed to have intended agency principles to govern

18

that kind of question.

19

Circuit's "cat's paw" doctrine, is the controlling

20

standard here.

Congress

Agency law, not the Eleventh

There are two principal agency doctrines on

22

Whether an employer is legally

which liability can be based.
JUSTICE ALITO:

23

Well, before we jump to

24

agency law, shouldn't we take a look at the language of

25

the statute?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the statute says that a

3

prima facie case is made out if it is shown that

4

military service, anti-military animus, was a motivating

5

factor in the employer's action.
The employer's action here was discharge,

6
7

right?

8

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's correct.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the word "motivate"

10

means to provide someone with a motive to do something,

11

right?

12

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes, sir.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the person who did

14

something here was the person who discharged, discharged

15

Mr. Staub, right?

16

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, that's not the -

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

So why doesn't it follow

18

that the motivation that's relevant under the statute is

19

the motivation of the person who -- who performs the

20

action that is challenged?

21

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Well, there's a -- there are

22

a series of actions and decisions that yield this

23

result.

24

of the employer, not to any particular official.

25

so -

The reference in the statute is to the actions

And

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but the -- what is -

2

what is made illegal are certain employer actions,

3

right?

4

up a bad report for a biased reason is not actionable

5

under this statute; isn't that correct?

6

Not everything that's done, not -- just writing

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's correct.

But a

7

decision to -- the decision to dismiss an official is -

8

can be, and is here, the result, the cumulative result,

9

of a series of decisions.

10

It's not unlike what occurs in -- in the

11

criminal justice system.

12

send a defendant to prison, but that decision actually

13

is a result of a series of other decisions, all of which

14

are government action.

15

Only a sentencing judge can

We think -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but -- but you say

16

that those decisions that contribute have to be

17

decisions by supervisory personnel.

18

correct, I don't know why that is so.

19

a co-employee who has a hostile motivation and makes a

20

report to the supervisor who ultimately dismisses the

21

individual, why that -- that wouldn't qualify as well.

22

MR. SCHNAPPER:

If your theory is
I don't know why

Well, our standard is not

23

whether it's a supervisor, but whether it's an official

24

for whom the employer is liable under agency law.

25

would not be every supervisor.

That

If a -- if a supervisor

2

charge in a -- a suggestion box, that wouldn't be any

Ordinarily, a coworker wouldn't qualify

under agency principles as an agent of the employer when

6

engaging in that conduct.

7

8

standards.

You have to look at the

They are laid out, for example, in the

10

branches of agency law:

scope of employment, and action

11

which is aided in, where the actor was aided in the

12

conduct by his or her official position.
And I think those principles would not

13
14

ordinarily apply to a coworker, but they would also not

15

apply invariably to a supervisor.

16

not advocating the supervisor versus non-supervisor

17

distinction in Ellerth, but -- but a return to just the

18

traditional agency doctrines.

19

doctrines delineate who is the employer for the purpose

20

of the statute, which bans action by the employer.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

This isn't -- we're

doctrines.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do they stand in

3

different shoes from a co-employee who also contributes

4

to the ultimate decision to fire?

5

MR. SCHNAPPER:

But it's -- it's the core

6

responsibility of -- in terms of scope of employment,

7

it's the core responsibility of a supervisor of a

8

particular individual to be monitoring his or her

9

behavior, reporting on it, perhaps initiating

10
11

disciplinary matters -- measures.
That wouldn't be true of all supervisors.

12

It's only true of Mr. Staub's supervisors.

13

-- the kind of thing they did was the kind of work that

14

they were employed to engage in, and that distinguishes

15

them from, say, another supervisor who might slip a note

16

into a suggestion box.

17

So -- what

Second, the other branch, major branch, of

18

agency law is that an employer is liable for actions of

19

individuals when their conduct -- when they are aided in

20

their conduct by their official position, which would

21

not typically be true of a fellow worker.

22

could be true here.

23

But that

So -

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I just ask where -

6

could I ask where your argument leads?

7

an employer calls in an employee and says:

8

to decide who to lay off, and we've looked at your

9

record over the last 10 years, and here it is, all the

Let's say that
Now, we have

10

evaluations you've gotten over the past 10 years, and

11

based on all of that, we -- we've decided that you're

12

going to be the person to be laid off.

13

Now, if it turns out that one of those

14

evaluations was rendered by someone who had an

15

anti-military bias, would that make the employee -

16

would that be a prima facie case against the employer?

17

MR. SCHNAPPER:

It -- it would.

But -

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Even if the -

19

MR. SCHNAPPER:

But the affirmative -

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Even if the employer at that

21

time did every -- made every reasonable effort to

22

investigate the validity of all the prior evaluations,

23

still the employer would be on the hook?

25

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's a sweeping

Suppose the -- the officer who's in charge, charged with

That's sweeping.

That's

But there is -

But there is no -
There is a defense for

the employer that, no matter that there was this ill

will, there was enough else to warrant termination of

16

And so the -

MR. SCHNAPPER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

17

And it's the language of section 4311(c)(1) that's

18

critical here.

20

there's only one defense, and the defense is a showing

21

made out, the employer shall be considered to have

24

violated the statute.

25

The statute provides that if an improper

The

But the -- the clearest enunciation of the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

error in the Seventh Circuit is the -- is the language

2

at page 47 of the Joint Appendix, where the court says:

3

Without regard to the jury verdict here, the employer is

4

off the hook if the decisionmaker did her own

5

investigation.

That's an additional defense.

And it's simply inconsistent with the

6
7

language of the statute.

Now, that may not have been -

8

that may have been harsh, but it's what the statute

9

says.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10

That isn't what the statute

11

says.

You -- you jump over the language of the statute.

12

It has to be a motivating factor in the decision to

13

discharge.

14

natural reading of that is that it looks at the

15

motivation of the person who actually makes the decision

16

to discharge.

And that speaks -- that looks natural -- the

Now, I'm not suggesting that's the right

17
18

rule.

19

that you have suggested is also a very unattractive

20

rule, one that I doubt the Congress intended to adopt.

21

Is there no reasonable middle position here?

22

or nothing?

23

That's a very unattractive rule.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

But the rule

It's all

Well, I think that the -

24

the kind of circumstances that the Court has pointed to

25

would be relevant at the remedy stage.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

The remedies are

Official

1

-- are discretionary and, whereas 4311(c)(1) says

2

"shall," 4323 in describing all the remedies says "may."

3

And so a court could take those things into account in

4

framing a remedy.
And certainly the good faith efforts of

5
6

someone in Buck's position, for example, would be

7

relevant to a determination whether a violation was

8

willful.

9

this case, which is that the jury found that there was a

And that, in fact, reflects what happened in

10

violation -- found that the -- the motivations involved

11

here included an improper motivation, rejected the

12

4311(c)(1) defense, but then found the violation wasn't

13

willful.
So I think, given the structure of the

14
15

statute, the -- the play here, the ability to adjust to

16

those circumstances, is in the remedy provision, not in

17

the mandatory language of the 4311(c)(1).
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

Isn't that -- isn't the

19

Government's formulation that the discrimination has to

20

play a substantial role in the termination a limiting

21

principle?

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Schnapper, I guess this

difficult to grasp the distinction that you draw or what

14

it seems that could possibly exist between a willful

15

motivating factor and a non-willful motivating factor.

I mean, to say that it's motivating is -- is to say that

about a motivating factor.

6

15

seems to me you have to hold him liable for their

16

willfulness as well.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

17

And

It's our view that the

18

language of the statute permits that distinction because

19

of the discretionary nature of the remedy provision as

20

opposed to the mandatory nature of 4311(c)(1).

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you using proximate

cause in but-for, or are you suggesting a different

11

formulation of causation?

12

MR. MILLER:

In our view, the "motivating

13

factor" language captures the idea of proximate cause.

14

Something can be a motivating factor if it is one of

15

many factors, but, in our view, it does need to be more

16

than a trivial or de minimis factor, and if you have a

17

situation where the bias -- the action of the biased

18

supervisor leads through a long and improbable and

19

unforeseeable chain of causation to the adverse

20

employment action, you might have a but-for cause, but

21

12

What is that test that you proposed

MR. MILLER:

The -- the discriminatorily

13

motivated actions in this case, on the evidence

14

interpreted in the light most favorable to Petitioner,

15

were the decision of Mulally to write up Petitioner for

16

this January 27th incident, and that was motivated by

17

her hostility to him because of his status in the Army

18

Reserves; and then the decision of Korenchuk to report

19

that he had violated the terms of that January 27th

20

warning, and that was also motivated by his hostility to

21

Petitioner's membership in the -- in the Army Reserves.

MR. MILLER:

MR. MILLER:

Yes, and the employer -- when

it's -- the employer is a corporation, and it's -- so

18

you have to look at which individuals do you look at in

19

figuring out whether it was a motivating factor or not,

20

and the statute tells us that.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. DAVIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

agreement with respect to two points.

The first point

Staub.

whatsoever that Linda Buck possessed animus toward Mr.

Staub on account of his service in the Reserve.

Applying ordinary tort-related vicarious

liability rules, Staub's case against Proctor Hospital

I think in that situation,

consistent with the "cat's paw" analysis, with the facts

case goes to the jury.

2

therefore, under the Seventh Circuit's rule, no

liability attaches, and that's the right result.

pink slip.

What -- what point -- when Korenchuk takes

2

him into -- takes Staub into Buck's office, according to

3

his testimony, which the jury could credit, he wasn't

4

asked a thing.

5

you're fired.

She just said:

MR. DAVIS:

6

Here's your pink slip;

I think the record shows he did

7

give an explanation of his whereabouts.

8

shows that he filed a five-page grievance contesting

9

that action.

MR. DAVIS:

The record also

After he was fired.

And that

12

Buck carefully investigated that, and, 5 days after it

13

was filed, gave him a letter saying:

15

argument that you were discharged on account of your

16

military service, but I don't credit it.

17

therefore, I'm sustaining the discharge.

18

I have looked into

And,

And that is absolutely -- Mr. Staub knew

19

that that works for him, because in 1998 he invoked the

20

same procedure when he was discharged the first time for

21

similar reasons, and he was conditionally reinstated to

22

employment at Proctor Hospital.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did -- did I understand

24

25

"cat's paw" approach to this?
29
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. DAVIS:

I do agree with it.

The "cat's

2

paw" approach essentially gives Mr. Staub and others

3

4

demonstrate that the person who possessed animus

5

exercised so much control over the decisionmaker that

6

that person became the true decisionmaker.

7

simply doesn't work in this case for a number of

8

reasons.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

But he has to

And that

Well, before you -

10

how is that consistent with the statutory language that

11

requires that this discrimination simply be a motivating

12

factor?
MR. DAVIS:

13

The answer to that is the

14

statute sets forth five factors, four or five factors,

15

and says that one of the four or five employment actions

16

has to be a motivating factor in arriving at the

17

decision.

So -

19

the statutory factors.

20

MR. DAVIS:

21
22
23
24
25

Okay.

Can we -- let's look at

It's 4311(a).

And it

says -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, and where -- where

are you reading it from?
MR. DAVIS:

From the third line -- well, I'm

sorry, I can't tell you what line it is.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. DAVIS:

Page 3 of the blue brief.

It says that there are five

3

actions that are prohibited:

denial of initial

4

employment, reemployment, retention in employment,

5

promotion, or any benefit of employment.
And it says that an employer cannot take

6
7

action, one of those actions, on the basis of four

8

factors:

9

performance, service -- or service of obligation in the

10

membership, application for membership,

uniformed services.
So there has to be something to connect one

11
12

of those factors to one of those five actions.

13

that's the literal meaning of the statute.

14

the Seventh Circuit's view is absolutely consistent with

15

that.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

And I think

Well, I'm sorry.

17

The statute says is a motivating -- one of those four

18

things, membership, application, et cetera, is a

19

motivating factor in the action.

20

MR. DAVIS:

Correct.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I understood

22

your position to be that the supervisor has to have such

23

dominant control that it's the "cat's paw."

MR. DAVIS:

That -- that -- the

subordinate's.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

MR. DAVIS:

Yes.

-- motivation is imputed

3

actually to the decisionmaker, and ultimately to the

4

employer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Well, I guess where

6

I'm having trouble following you is the total domination

7

motivating factor.

8

test that the Seventh Circuit has adopted.

It seems like a much more stringent

MR. DAVIS:

9

Well, I think in the context of

10

this case, Your Honor, it's not, because the definition

11

of "employer" here not only includes Proctor Hospital,

12

what you might call the ultimate employer, but it also

13

includes the person who made the adverse employment

14

decision.

And in this case, it's Linda Buck.
And this statute creates personal liability

15
16

for Ms. Buck or anybody else who makes a decision if

17

it's based on one of these factors contained in the

18

statute.

19

allowed to consider whether or not Ms. Buck is in

20

violation of the statute, because there's an absolute

21

dearth of evidence that any of these factors motivated

22

the decision she made.

23

I don't think there's any way a jury would be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that assumes that

24

the employment decision is solely hers.

25

based on her peccadilloes; it's hers based on

It's hers, not

Official

1

information that she has gathered.

2

MR. DAVIS:

I agree.

It is hers to the

3

extent that she makes a good faith investigation into

4

the background facts.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

But -- but she's not

6

acting in a vacuum.

7

has been supplied to her by people who are authorized to

8

supply that to her in the employment context.
MR. DAVIS:

9
10

And -- and in this case, she's

acting on an awful lot of information.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11
12

She's acting on information that

They pick out -

We're now talking past

the individual case.

13

MR. DAVIS:

Okay.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I am talking about just

15

the legal analysis, which is:

16

but there are multiple actors on behalf of the employer.

17

That's your adversary's position -

18

MR. DAVIS:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

She's a decisionmaker,

I agree with that.
Or participating in the

process.
And they're saying if any of those actors in

22

the process has been delegated employment duties that

23

permit them to participate in this way, then if what

24

motivates them is bias of this kind, then the employer

25

is responsible, not just for Ms. Buck's activities, but
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for the two supervisors' discriminatory activities.
MR. DAVIS:

2

That would lead to a

3

never-ending chain of looking backwards all the time

4

over the course of perhaps a very long employment

5

history to scour the record to determine is there one

6

single or two single actions out there that may somehow

7

have come forward and caused this termination?

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, in most

9

situations, an employer comes in and says:

I fired X

10

for X, Y, and Z reasons.

11

of those inconsequential or immaterial reports, why

12

would a court rely on it at all?

13

factor.
MR. DAVIS:

14

And if they don't mention one

It's not a motivating

I'm not sure I thoroughly

15

understand the hypothetical, but if the true

16

decisionmaker there comes forward and says, I didn't

17

know about this, I didn't rely upon it -- I don't think

18

that the animus can be imputed to the decisionmaker.
JUSTICE BREYER:

19
20

Why is this so complicated?

I'm probably missing something.

21

MR. DAVIS:

I don't think -

22

discriminatory -- a discriminatory motivating factor in

motivated by one of these factors, there has to be some

element of proximate causation -

Well, fine.

You're

23

language here -- that the discriminatory -- prohibited

in the employer's action.

action.

And they say that means it

It's not a motivating factor in the

on behalf of the employer had that as its motive.
Then the court of appeals makes an

exception:

14

taking the action on behalf of the employer is really

15

not the person who took the action, but was totally
