            Mr. Zas.

7

             ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS

8

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

            MR. ZAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court:

11

            This case concerns the tenyear mandatory

12

minimum prison sentence that Section 2252(b)(2)

13

sometimes requires Federal judges to impose.

14

            The statutory language in dispute reserves

15

the severe punishment for a defendant with a prior State

16

conviction for an offense relating to any kind of sexual

17

abuse involving a minor or ward.  Because Petitioner's

18

prior offense did not involve a minor or ward, the

19

statute's mandatory minimum penalty does not apply to

20

him.

21

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Suppose the conviction

22

had been, under Federal law, the  the conviction for

23

sexual abuse of an adult and we have the same question:

24

Does the mandatory minimum apply?

25

            I take it if it had been under Federal law,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

then the mandatory minimum would apply.

2

            MR. ZAS:  That's correct.  If the conviction

3

had been under Chapter 109A of Title XVIII, which covers

4

sexual abuse offenses, then it would trigger the

5

mandatory penalty.  But Congress, in this statute, since

6

the time it was first enacted in 1978, has never sought

7

to create symmetry or parity between the Federal

8

predicates and the State predicates.

9

            This may be most clear now in

10

Subsection 2252(b)(1), where you can see that a prior

11

Federal conviction for sex trafficking of anyone, which

12

is a violation of Section 1591, the corresponding State

13

analogue, is textually limited to sex trafficking of

14

children.

15

            So this decision to treat prior State and

16

Federal predicates differently is inescapable, and it's

17

been true ever since the first statute.

18

            So from 1970 

19

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I don't  why  why

20

is it in this case  it  it does seem to me that

21

Congress, eight years later, when it wrote the  the

22

second statute, used the  the  the same style and

23

that this very much favors the government.  But then you

24

say that that's inapplicable, because?

25

            MR. ZAS:  Because when this language was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

first added  first, it was added in 1994.

2

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.

3

            MR. ZAS:  The Federal predicates.  At that

4

time there were still no State law predicates at all.

5

            In 1996, when the language was first

6

introduced, and it was then introduced in Section 

7

Subsection (b)(1), which applies to the distribution and

8

receipt offenses, even then the penalty for simple

9

possession of child pornography was the only Federal

10

predicate.

11

            So someone in Mr. Lockhart's position at

12

that time would not have faced the mandatory minimum

13

penalty even if people who  who committed the

14

distribution offenses would or even if  even if he had

15

a conviction for  under Chapter 109A.

16

            So  and then in 1998, when this language

17

in dispute was then added at the government's urging to

18

Subsection (b)(2), even at that time Congress clearly

19

wasn't aiming for parity because then they added a new

20

Federal predicate, Chapter 117 offenses, which are

21

violations of the Man Act:  Transportation for illegal

22

sexual activity.

23

            But at that time it didn't add any State

24

law  State offense analogue for that offense.

25

            This has continued up to the present day.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

So in 2003, there were amendments to add the obscenity

2

offenses, the Federal obscenity offenses in Chapter 71

3

to the list of Federal predicates, but no corresponding

4

State crime for obscenity offenses.

5

            The 

6

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do you say it works

7

now for the manufacturing and distribution offenses?  We

8

have your position on the possession  well, you said

9

there's a disparity between a Federal conviction and a

10

State conviction.  How about a conviction, either the

11

manufacturing or distribution?

12

            MR. ZAS:  Yes.  So  so that offense is

13

covered by the different provision of Section 2251(e).

14

That's the penalty provision for the much more serious

15

crime of actually using minors or children to produce

16

this material.

17

            The language in 2251(e) as amended in 2006

18

is  it does seem to track, to qualify the predicates

19

to include Statelaw abuse offenses that involve adults

20

as well as children.  But that's because there's an

21

important textual difference between Section 2251(e) and

22

the statute we're talking about.

23

            So if you go back to Section 2252(b)(2),

24

you'll see an important textual point here, which is the

25

word "or."  This may be easier to follow if you actually

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

look at the statute if you don't have it open in the

2

statutory appendix to the blue brief at pages  at

3

page 10A.  You'll see that the list is written as

4

aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abuse of

5

sexual  I'm sorry, or abusive sexual conduct involving

6

a minor or ward or a bunch of other offenses.

7

            The "or" before abusive sexual conduct would

8

not be there on the government's reading.  That is, if

9

abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward were an

10

independent standalone offense, the "or" does no work.

11

It's unnatural to be.  Then the list would just read,

12

aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual

13

conduct involving a minor or ward, or  and it would

14

continue.

15

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's another

16

possible explanation for that, because the last item in

17

the list itself involves a great many  itself involves

18

a list.  So the second "or" could be a substitute for a

19

semicolon.

20

            But let me ask you another question about

21

the language that you just read.  As I understand your

22

argument, this provision would apply to sexual abuse

23

involving a minor and also abusive sexual conduct

24

involving a minor.

25

            Is there any difference between those two

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

things?

2

            MR. ZAS:  No, Your Honor.  We 

3

            JUSTICE ALITO:  So why did Congress put them

4

both in?

5

            MR. ZAS:  Well, because I think the first

6

point here is it must be for the same reason it used

7

aggravated sexual abuse at the beginning of the list,

8

which  which I think both sides agree does no

9

independent work.  It's already covered.

10

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, there's something that

11

jumps out.  It's a strange list, aggravated sexual

12

abuse, sexual abuse.  Sexual abuse would include

13

aggravated sexual abuse.  So that seems to be  the

14

reference to aggravated sexual abuse seems to be

15

redundant.  And abusive sexual conduct, if understood in

16

ordinary  in the terms of ordinary language, does seem

17

to duplicate sexual abuse.

18

            But there's an explanation that jumps out,

19

and that is that this  almost this precise terminology

20

appears in Sections 2241, 2242, and 2243.  And in those

21

provisions, all those terms are defined so that they

22

mean something different.

23

            So it seems to jump out at the reader that

24

that's what Congress was doing in this list.

25

            Why is  what is wrong with that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

            MR. ZAS:  Well, first, if you go back to the

2

time this  this language we're talking about was first

3

added in 1996, that Congress not only knew how to  how

4

to do what Your Honor is suggesting, that is, to be

5

tracking the Federal predicates exactly.  Because in a

6

different provision, the provision that became 2241(c),

7

it did exactly that.  It  it describes State offenses

8

whose conduct would constitute a Federal crime if

9

committed within Federal jurisdiction.

10

            So they didn't do that here, and they didn't

11

do it again when they added the particular language in

12

1998 to (b)(2)again.

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, I don't

14

follow that.  I 

15

            MR. ZAS:  Yes.

16

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  As I see it, they

17

did, as Justice Alito said, track pretty much exactly

18

2241, 42, and 43 in developing the list that they 

19

they add  that's before us today.  I didn't understand

20

your response.

21

            MR. ZAS:  Mr. Chief Justice, there are

22

really two responses.  One, the one I gave to Justice

23

Alito is that this Congress, in 1996 and '98, knew how

24

to track when they wanted to track.  They did so

25

explicitly in other provisions of the same legislation.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

In 1996, the other provision was 2241(c).  In 1998, the

2

other provision was 2426(b).  So it knew  it knew how

3

to do it, and didn't do it, and has never done it.

4

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, it could have done it

5

more clearly.  That's certainly the answer to this whole

6

case.  They could have handled this issue a lot more

7

clearly.

8

            But that is the  the idea that they were

9

picking up the definitions in the Federal provisions is

10

one explanation for this rather strange  this list.

11

The other makes the list terribly redundant, and I

12

haven't heard your explanation as to why they would do

13

that.

14

            Why include both sexual abuse and aggravated

15

sexual abuse?  Why include sexual abuse and abusive

16

sexual conduct?

17

            MR. ZAS:  Two responses, Your Honor.

18

            First  and this goes to the Chief

19

Justice's question as well  this list does not track

20

the Federal predicates as precisely, I think, as some

21

have suggested.  The Federal list of predicates has four

22

crimes, sexual  aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse,

23

sexual abuse of a minor or ward, and abusive sexual

24

contact.  If Congress had meant to track those, they

25

surely would have used the same fourprong list.  They

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

didn't do that.  Instead, they used a different term,

2

"abusive sexual conduct."

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I don't understand how

4

that answers the redundancy question.  There's

5

redundancy in both interpretations, but much more in

6

yours than in the government's.

7

            MR. ZAS:  Well, I  I disagree with that.

8

I think the government reads the modifying clause out of

9

this statute in terms of doing any operative work at

10

all.  But  but let me respond 

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm not sure how your

12

answer was responsive to Justice Alito's redundancy

13

question.

14

            MR. ZAS:  It wasn't.  But that's the second

15

part of the answer.

16

            The redundancy here was meant to go very

17

broadly, to pick up, not the Federal predicates, but any

18

terms or crimes that the States might create.

19

            So we cited this in the yellow brief in

20

reply.  You'll see that the States call sexual abuse a

21

variety of different things, including aggravated sexual

22

abuse of a minor, sexual abuse of a minor, abusive

23

sexual misconduct.  So Congress is using these redundant

24

terms as it sometimes does to emphasize inclusiveness.

25

Whatever the label is, Congress wanted to protect

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

children by picking those up.

2

            But it limited.  It limited the reach of the

3

terms by setting a bright line floor.  And that floor

4

was at children.  The statute, after all, its principal

5

purpose as its title, as the title of Chapter 110

6

suggests, is about protecting against sexual

7

exploitation and other abuse of children.

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Zas, is it possible when

9

you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might

10

have meant to be just trying to pick up every

11

conceivable State statute it could think of.  But it's

12

possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual

13

abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the

14

medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is

15

actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words,

16

might include things that are not sexual abuse

17

themselves.  Let's say indecent exposure or something

18

like that.

19

            And if you understand the provisions in that

20

way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and

21

meant to pick up everything, then it would seem that the

22

involving a minor or ward really ought to refer to all

23

of them.  Right?  That there's no reason why the

24

involving a minor or ward would  would refer only to

25

the most minor offenses as the others.

Alderson Reporting Company

13

            MR. ZAS:  Well, I think  I think Your

2

Honor makes a good point.  We have not been able to 

3

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Maybe I said that wrong.  I

4

think I said the exact opposite of what I meant.

5

            (Laughter.)

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It makes sense to me,

7

though.

8

            (Laughter.)

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  What?

10

            If you read  if you read them going 

11

going down, right  well, what do you think would

12

follow?

13

            (Laughter.)

14

            What do you think would follow from that

15

understanding of this list?

16

            MR. ZAS:  Well, Your Honor, we have tried to

17

figure out what  what in the world the difference is

18

between sexual abuse and abusive sexual conduct when you

19

give these terms their ordinary meaning.  There is no

20

meaningful difference.  Sexual abuse, as ordinarily

21

defined, is just the misuse, physical or nonphysical, of

22

another 

23

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But just presume with me

24

that abusive sexual conduct is supposed to be  is

25

supposed to include some things that sexual abuse would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

not.

2

            What do you think follows from that?

3

            MR. ZAS:  Well, again, first, even with that

4

assumption, you have this prefatory language to the list

5

here, "relating to," which this Court has described 

6

has defined, has interpreted, to be very broad.  It only

7

means "to stand in some relation to."

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  When I think  what I

9

think you would say is that if it's in descending order

10

like that, you don't have to make the third one, which

11

is already less than the second, which is less than the

12

first.  You don't have to make the third one a teeny,

13

teeny, teeny third one by tagging on children only to

14

the third and not to the other two.

15

            It seems to me much more regular to assume,

16

as you do, that the limitation to children applies to

17

all three of these descending crimes.  And  and isn't

18

that the answer?

19

            MR. ZAS:  Yes, Your Honor.

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Your answer.

21

            MR. ZAS:  It  it is the answer.  And 

22

and it is essentially an instance of the principle that

23

has  that has come to be known as the series

24

qualifier.

25

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But  but the  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

problem with that is  maybe I'm wrong, but I think you

2

have conceded that there is no difference between the

3

last two, that it  it's  it's not descending.  I

4

mean, it's  it's Justice Kagan who's suggested that

5

abusive sexual conduct could mean exposure, for example,

6

indecent exposure, which would probably not fit the

7

second  the second term.  Haven't you conceded that

8

the two are the same?

9

            MR. ZAS:  Yes, we have, but we don't view

10

it 

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What did you do that for?

12

            MR. ZAS:  We do not view it as  we don't

13

view it as a concession.  We have allowed for the

14

possibility, as  as Justice Kagan, I think, is trying

15

to do, of trying to come up with some fine distinction

16

in meaning between the last two terms, but whether there

17

is or isn't a little bit of daylight between those

18

terms, it's all overcome by the terms "relating to."

19

Anything relating to one is going to relate to the

20

other.

21

            And pity the poor district judge who would

22

have to decide in cases around the country, does this

23

offense relate to sexual abuse, in which case on the

24

government's reading, it doesn't matter whether a minor

25

or ward was involved; or does it relate to this other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

category of abusive sexual conduct, which as far as we

2

can 

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But just to be

4

clear, it's abusive sexual contact, right?

5

            MR. ZAS:  Not in our list.  That's the

6

language from 

7

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  (e)?

8

            MR. ZAS:   the Federal predicates.  The

9

separate crime in 2244 is abusive sexual contact.

10

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I see.

11

            MR. ZAS:  Our list is abusive sexual

12

conduct.  As far as we can tell, no one has ever

13

explained what in the world the difference is.

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, we might be  when

15

did they write?  We're looking at, call it "your

16

section," which is (a)(4); is that right?  Or what is

17

it?  It's  for the three things in it.  The one you're

18

interested in is  let's  I don't want a name for it.

19

            MR. ZAS:  Yes.  It's 

20

21

            MR. ZAS:  It's the penalty provision.

            Then think of several other sections, which

2

are the one I hadn't thought about which Justice Alito

3

raised.  That's really suspicious the way that looks

4

there.  41, 42, 43.  Now, when you pull up 41, 42, 43,

5

law or written before the relevant parts of your section

6

were written.

7

            MR. ZAS:  They were, Federal predicates

8

prior to 

9

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  If that's so  and

10

I don't know if this helps you or hurts you, but it

11

seems to me that there is a readymade right there for a

12

drafter explanation of why he uses these words.  Because

13

we first look to 41, and that's aggravated.  And then we

14

look to 42, and that's sexual abuse without aggravated.

15

And conduct is just the same as contact, but the drafter

16

is thinking maybe we should go a little bit bigger.

17

Now, the difficulty is in each of the sections I've

18

mentioned, there is a special related section for

19

children.

20

            So the difference between the two for adults

21

is the nature of the force requiring a person to perform

22

a sexual act.  A threat of violence, et cetera.  That's

23

one.  Right?

24

            And then the next section, abuse, it can be

25

some other kind of threat.  Then we get to the way it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

deals with children, and it deals with children under

2

the 12  under 12.  That's one.  And it deals 12 to 16.

3

That's the next.  And then we have a section called

4

contact, and that has to do with sex acts basically that

5

really weren't sex acts but for a certain kind of

6

conduct which is defined.  All right.

7

            So I read this, I say, hey, that's what they

8

picked up.  They just  a drafter just picked it up and

9

changed a little bit, but that's what he had in mind.

10

Then the question is:  Your question.  And in your

11

favor, I think, is the fact that each of these earlier

12

sections does have a special section dealing with

13

children under the same number.

14

            Now, don't tell me I'm right if I'm not

15

right, but that's what I suddenly saw when Justice Alito

16

asked his question.  Just tell me your reaction.

17

            MR. ZAS:  Well 

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're not going to tell

19

him he's right.

20

            (Laughter.)

21

            MR. ZAS:  I wouldn't do that, Your Honor.

22

            The courts of appeals that have addressed

23

this precise question, just  just so it's clear, none

24

of them  they've all rejected the idea that I  that

25

I think starts the premise here, which is that Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

meant to  meant for courts to interpret these terms by

2

reference to the Federal predicates.  In fact, that's

3

the government's position here as well.

4

            So the parties are on common ground in

5

saying that these weren't meant to track the Federal

6

predicates.  And as I pointed out earlier, Congress not

7

only knew how to do it when they wanted to, they did it

8

in these two pieces of legislation in '96 and '98.

9

            Now, it's true that these terms existed in

10

the Federal predicates before they were added to this

11

section.  But they also exist all around the country in

12

the 50 States.  So Congress wasn't  wasn't trying to

13

track them.  It could have just said, any State offense

14

that would be a violation of Federal law if  if in

15

Federal jurisdiction.  It  it  it didn't do that.

16

            It was recognizing that States do all kinds

17

of things.  And it's using these terms to say, anything

18

relating to it.  It doesn't have to even be sexual

19

abuse; it just has to relate to sexual abuse.  But

20

because that could pick up misdemeanor sex offenses

21

around the country, committed only against an adult.

22

            Public lewdness would be an example.

23

That  that crime, we sited one statue in the briefs.

24

That's  the statutory maximum is 30 days in jail.  But

25

if that were picked up, suddenly someone who is in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

Federal court with their first offense, the first

2

Federal offense of possessing child pornography, is

3

suddenly going to have their sentence go 

4

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But your  your argument is

5

that it is just a coincidence that Congress came up with

6

this list of three terms that are redundant and that

7

just so happen to be almost exactly the same three terms

8

in the same order that appear in the Federal provisions.

9

            MR. ZAS:  No, I  I  I don't mean to say

10

that.  It's  it's not a coincidence.  Congress would

11

naturally use terms that it is familiar with, that are

12

in the Federal  the Federal  Federal chapter, but

13

that's very different.

14

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  They didn't use the same

15

terms.

16

            MR. ZAS:  That's  that's right.

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  The third term is

18

different.

19

            JUSTICE ALITO:  But they used  they

20

used 

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you think it was an

22

accident that the third term was different?

23

            MR. ZAS:  No.  I think the court presumes

24

that when Congress uses a different term, it  it acts

25

deliberately  and I  I think 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

            JUSTICE ALITO:  When they use "sexual abuse"

2

and "sexually abusive conduct," they were not  they 

3

they had in mind the Federal provisions, but they didn't

4

want those terms in this provision to mean the same

5

thing as they mean in the Federal provision, even

6

though, according to you, there is no generally accepted

7

understanding of the difference between sexual abuse and

8

abusive sexual conduct.

9

            MR. ZAS:  That's right.  That's right.

10

They  they didn't.

11

            Sex  I'm sorry.  Chapter 110, the chapter

12

that contains the statute, has its own definitional

13

section.  There is no definition there of any of these

14

terms.  The only potentially pertinent term that's

15

defined is the term "minor," which is defined

16

differently in this chapter than it's defined or used 

17

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Sexual abuse is defined, and

18

abusive sexual contact is defined, are they not?

19

            MR. ZAS:  They are  they are defined in

20

Chapter 109A.  But as Justice  as Justice Scalia

21

pointed out, they didn't use abusive sexual contact.

22

They used abusive sexual conduct.  So it  it could be

23

viewed as, that's going broader, but with a floor.  We

24

want to brightline it.  If you commit any kind of sexual

25

abuse, not  not only sexual abuse, but anything

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

relating to sexual abuse, you're going to face these

2

severe penalties, so long as it involves a minor or

3

ward.  That's the focus.  Congress was trying to protect

4

children, and to punish and deter those who would harm

5

them.

6

            There is nothing in the history or the

7

understanding of these provisions at the time of

8

enactment to suggest that they were also focused on

9

sexual abuse  State sexualabuse crimes against

10

adults.  Now, that's a serious crime.  No one disputes

11

that.  But it wasn't the focus of this legislation.

12

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But why would they be

13

focused on Federal sexual abuse involving adults but not

14

State sexual abuse involving adults?

15

            MR. ZAS:  Because the 1996 Congress was

16

focused on a very specific problem that they identify.

17

And that's the link, the connection between child

18

pornography and other sex offenses against children.

19

            So that was their focus.  And given that

20

focus and given that the other State law predicates in

21

this statute are also limited to  to crimes against

22

children, they naturally limited these offenses as well

23

to children.

24

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  No, but the  the Federal

25

predicate, the Section 109, I believe it is, does apply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

to adults as well.  So why would they be focused on

2

adults with respect to Federal offenses but not with

3

respect to State offenses?

4

            MR. ZAS:  Because, I think most importantly,

5

Congress controls the Federal  Federal crime.  It

6

creates them, it knows what they are, they're a finite

7

set, and it knows that those predicates are not going to

8

change without congressional action.

9

            Once the national legislature has to

10

consider 50 penal codes around the country which can

11

change at any time and can cover things that may relate

12

to sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct, Congress

13

reasonably may have decided that it didn't want to sweep

14

that broadly, so it, again, created this floor.

15

"Involving a minor or ward" was the key phrase.  And our

16

reading is the only one proposed that gives it some

17

operative work to do.

18

            I'd like to reserve the balance of my time

19

for rebuttal.

20

            Thank you.

23

             ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL

24

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

it please the Court:

2

            This case involves two competing canons of

3

statutory interpretation, and there are four basic

4

reasons why we think the government's interpretation is

5

correct.

6

            First, Petitioner's interpretation creates

7

an unexplained redundancy where the Court would have to

8

conclude that Congress created a list of three things,

9

two of which are the same.

10

            Second, our interpretation is consistent

11

with the only possible reading of Section 

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Excuse me.  Let's do them

13

one by one.

14

            On the first one, even under your

15

interpretation, two of the three are the same, aren't

16

they?

17

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Under our interpretation,

18

what  what we've said is that the first category and

19

the third category are logically subsets of the more

20

general category of sexual abuse.

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Right.

22

            MS. O'CONNELL:  But there's a couple of

23

explanations for why Congress may have done that.

24

            The first is that, when they added these

25

State law predicates to the Section 2252(b)(1) for the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

first time in 1996, there already were Federal

2

predicates on the list that included aggravated sexual

3

abuse, sexual abuse, and sexual abuse of a minor or

4

ward.  So even though it may be true that Congress could

5

have covered everything it wanted to cover in the State

6

law crimes by just saying "sexual abuse," it would have

7

opened itself up to arguments if it had just said all of

8

those Federal crimes and then any State law relating to

9

sexual abuse, that those other types of sexual abuse

10

under State law were not covered.

11

            Especially with respect to the third

12

category, sexual abuse or abusive sexual conduct

13

involving a minor or ward, Congress made clear when it

14

included that third category that it was picking up

15

State law offenses where a person is deemed incapable of

16

consenting to sexual contact or sexual conduct, because

17

of their status as either a minor or a ward.

18

            So our interpretation can be explained.

19

There is redundancy, and we're not asking for just an 

20

a straight invocation of the canon against surplusage.

21

Both interpretations contain surplusage.  But it's a

22

reason why it doesn't make sense to apply the

23

seriesqualifier canon here, because it 

24

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Why do you resist  why 

25

why do you resist the argument that what Congress was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

doing was picking up basically the definitions of the

2

Federal offenses that are worded almost identically?  If

3

that's what they are doing, then it's understandable

4

what is meant by all three terms.  If that's not what

5

they were doing, it's a strange coincidence.

6

            And not only is there redundancy, but

7

there's ambiguity about what is meant by sexual abuse as

8

opposed to abusive sexual conduct, and why they had to

9

put in aggravated sexual abuse in addition to sexual

10

abuse.

11

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Alito, we  we

12

don't think that Congress was trying to pick up the

13

exact definitions of the three Federal statutes.  And we

14

think that's most clear, as Petitioner pointed out, by

15

the fact that there are other provision in this chapter

16

where Congress used different language when it wanted to

17

do so.

18

            The most clear example is the recidivist

19

provision for the sexual abuse offenses.

20

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Yes, they could have done it

21

more clearly, of course.  The  the statute is  is

22

poorly drafted.  You know, we give them a "D" for their

23

drafting of this statute.

24

            But what is the difference between sexual

25

abuse and abusive sexual conduct?  Putting aside the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

definitions of those  of those terms or similar terms

2

in Chapter 109.

3

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I don't think there is any

4

difference between those two terms.

5

            And  and Petitioner agrees, which is

6

why 

7

            JUSTICE ALITO:  So why did they put  why

8

did they do that?

9

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I think because the 

10

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Just catchy phrases that

11

came to their mind?

12

            MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  I think the last

13

category, "sexual abusive conduct involving a minor or

14

ward," was meant to  to indicate and make clear that

15

Congress was picking up State offenses where a person is

16

deemed incapable of giving consent because they are a

17

minor or a ward.  They are deemed incapable by the law

18

even though, under a generic definition of "sexual

19

abuse" that may apply to everyone 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ward  a ward can't 

21

why  why would you say a  why would you add "ward"

22

if  if that was the reason for it?  Why wouldn't you

23

just say of "a minor"?

24

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Well, Congress added "ward."

25

And 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I know.  Why?  That's what

2

I'm asking.

3

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  Well, we think the

4

most 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  To achieve what  what you

6

say they were achieving, it would  it would have

7

sufficed to say "minor."

8

            MS. O'CONNELL:  No, I don't think so.

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  No?

10

            MS. O'CONNELL:  A minor  a ward is not

11

just a person who is a minor or a foster child, or a

12

person who's been placed under a guardianship because of

13

mental incompetence or something like that.  Those

14

people are all wards, but as we've explained in our

15

brief, a ward also very clearly includes a prisoner, and

16

Congress would have known that.

17

            And the  the

18

Federal sexual abuse of a ward provision refers

19

basically to 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But that  that's not

21

somebody who could not  who could not give consent.

22

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Under 

23

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're  you're saying the

24

reason for it was they wanted to pick up people who

25

could not consent to the thing.  But to do that, all

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

they had to say was "minor."

2

            MS. O'CONNELL:  No  no.  I think that a 

3

a ward is also basically deemed incapable of giving

4

consent 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Prisoners  prisoners are

6

deemed incapable of giving consent?

7

            MS. O'CONNELL:  The law has the same sort of

8

operation, yes.  It  it deems the conduct abusive even

9

if it's consensual.  The Section 2243 does that, the

10

Federal sexual abuse of a ward statute.  And we've cited

11

in footnote 14 a lot of State laws that prohibit the

12

same thing.

13

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  And "concrete" would mean

14

that, if it was a prison guard and a prisoner 

15

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.

16

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:   even if the prisoner

17

said, "Yes."

18

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Exactly.  That that would be

19

deemed abusive sexual conduct.  It would be 

20

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But a ward  a ward could

21

also be a 40yearold person who is incompetent.

22

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Correct.  A ward could

23

certainly be an adult.

24

            And I think this is a  a key point that

25

Petitioner has never really answered is that Petitioner

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

is trying to say that there is this clear pattern that

2

Congress had when it was creating the  these lists,

3

and that the Federal crimes can involve both adults and

4

minors, but it was always limiting the State law crimes

5

to crimes against children.  And it just isn't the case.

6

And even under his interpretation, because "wards" are

7

included, there is at least some adult sexualabuse

8

crimes against adults that are being swept up even if it

9

applies to all three categories.

10

            And also in Section 2251(e), the 

11

the enhancement for child pornography production

12

offenses, the only way that you could read that

13

provision is to include sexual abuse offenses against

14

adults.

15

            And so it's not the case that there is this

16

very clear pattern where Congress was only including

17

child victim counterparts to all of the Federal offenses

18

that it was putting on the list.

19

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. O'Connell 

20

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Is Petitioner right when

21

Petitioner says that it was the Department of Justice's

22

original view that involving a minor or ward, it

23

modified all three categories?  That that was  the

24

first position that the government took and then the

25

government changed?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

            MS. O'CONNELL:  No.  I  I  I don't think

2

that that is an official position that the government

3

took.  We never took that position in a brief.  Any time

4

we were confronted with actually interpreting the

5

statute as a legal matter, we have contended that

6

involving a minor or ward applies only to the last

7

category.

8

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Where did you get that idea

9

from, then?

10

            Where did he get that idea?  What  what

11

had the Department said that  that suggested the

12

opposite?

13

            MS. O'CONNELL:  There was the  this letter

14

submitted in 1998 that the Petitioner cites where, when

15

the  the author of the letter  the  the point of

16

the paragraph is to say, look, Congress, in the  the

17

sexual abuse provision or the recidivist provision

18

for  for receipt and distribution offenses in

19

2252(b)(1), you have all these State law crimes that you

20

didn't include on the  on the list of predicate

21

offenses for 2252(b)(2), the possession offenses, and we

22

think you should line them up.

23

            In summarizing that argument, the drafter of

24

the letter referred to them as "child molestation

25

crimes" or "child abuse crimes."  It was an  it was an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

underinclusive, inaccurate, short  it  it wasn't

2

inaccurate.  They do involve child molestation crimes.

3

But it was just a useful way of summarizing what was

4

there and what would have been most 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Surely it shows 

6

            MS. O'CONNELL:   for Congress.

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  that  that an

8

intelligent person could think that that's what this

9

involved.

10

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I 

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I assume that the person

12

read this and  and thought that that's what it meant.

13

            MS. O'CONNELL:  And  and, Justice Scalia,

14

I think that's why the canons of interpretation don't

15

get anybody a hundred percent of the way there.

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I agree.  And what I worry

17

about is the rule of lenity.  You have these dueling

18

canons, and you have a rule that when the government

19

sends somebody to jail for ten years, it has to turn

20

sharp corners.  It has to dot every I and cross every T.

21

It has to be clear.

22

            And, you know, I  we've been discussing

23

this dueling canons and so forth.  My goodness, I have

24

no  I have no assurance what the right answer is.  But

25

I know that somebody could read this and think that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

means what the petitioner says it means.  And if that's

2

the case, it seems to me the rule of lenity comes into

3

play.  That's  that's what concerns me most about this

4

case, not the dueling canons.

5

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Scalia, I think if

6

you read the text of the statute once, you may think, I

7

don't know what this means.  It could go either way.

8

But if you just read the rest of the list of things that

9

Congress included and take a look at it, we think

10

there's four things that jump out that make clear that

11

involving a minor or ward only is modifying the last

12

category.  The first is the  the redundancy problem

13

that Petitioner's interpretation creates.

14

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, could I ask about

15

your  your basic theory as to that, which, if I

16

understand it, says the reason why we shouldn't worry

17

about the redundancy you create is because Congress just

18

wanted to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse

19

was also sexual abuse involving somebody who couldn't

20

consent.  That's basically your theory.

21

            And there is a very easy way to do that, and

22

it would have completely made this  I mean, made this

23

a hundred percent clear.  Congress would just have said

24

aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse

25

involving a minor or ward.  And just by using the exact

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

same language, it would have been clear, but the

2

distinction was between sexual abuse and sexual abuse

3

involving a minor or ward.

4

            But Congress doesn't do that, right?

5

Congress changes the language of the third noun.  And

6

that's what creates the puzzlement.  And  and so it

7

seems to me that your theory doesn't really cohere with

8

the fact that this third term  although, nobody can

9

say exactly what it means that is different  the third

10

term is linguistically dissimilar from the second one.

11

            MS. O'CONNELL:  It is, but  but under a

12

generic interpretation of sexual abuse, any generic

13

definition that a court has come up with, I think one

14

that is a typical one is sexual conduct that uses or

15

misuses or injures a victim so as to cause harm or

16

damage.  They all include sexual conduct.  And so

17

regardless of whether sexual conduct is  you know,

18

under the Federal law, sexual conduct could be both a

19

sexual act or a sexual contact, anything that's defined

20

within the Federal provision.  But the term "sexual

21

abuse" was already broad enough to cover abusive sexual

22

conduct.

23

            I can't say that I know why Congress didn't

24

say "sexual abuse of a minor or ward" as opposed to

25

"abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward."  But

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

I think the key part of it to focus on is the fact that

2

they use the term "involving a minor or ward."  It's the

3

same category or category of people that they are trying

4

to pick up that's reflected in the prohibitions on

5

sexual 

6

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  Well, why not just say

7

 drop the "abusive"?  Just say "sexual conduct with a

8

minor or a ward"?  Because now you have to deal with the

9

adjective "abusive."  So how does that get you to

10

consent or no consent?

11

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I think Congress could have

12

done this without saying abusive, but, you know, the

13

Federal sexualabuse statute of  of a minor or ward is

14

called sexual abuse of a minor or ward.  They also

15

include the word "abusive."  I think it's just  the

16

ambiguity really is that abuse could mean different

17

things depending on who the victim is.  Something could

18

be abusive because it's done to or in front of a child

19

but not an adult.  And so that may be  it's not a

20

reason why Congress wouldn't  needed to use the word

21

"abusive," but there  there is a reason  it is a

22

reason why there could be some daylight between the two

23

categories.

24

            JUSTICE BREYER:  What were the  what were

25

the other three?  You said there were four reasons.  I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

started where I think Justice Scalia did.  Of course, I

2

might more often than he think that the canons don't

3

help us all that much.  And this  this is a poster

4

child, I think, for that proposition.

5

            And so you said, no, there are four things

6

here that show that this isn't ambiguous.  You shouldn't

7

end up that way.  Now, one was a redundancy, which I'm

8

not sure what it was, and then you didn't get to the

9

other three, which I'd like to hear.

10

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Okay.

11

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I apologize for that.  I

12

jumped in on it.

13

            MS. O'CONNELL:  No apology necessary.

14

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No, it wasn't.

15

            MS. O'CONNELL:  The second reason why we

16

think the Petitioner's interpretation doesn't make sense

17

is because in the penalty provision for production

18

offenses Section 2251(e), Petitioner agrees that the

19

only way you can read that penalty provision is to

20

include State sexual abuse offenses against adults,

21

because Congress worded it slightly differently.  They

22

included all the same crimes, but the way that provision

23

is  reads, it says, "State laws relating to aggravated

24

sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact

25

involving a minor or a ward or sex trafficking of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

children."

2

            So it's no longer  involving a minor or

3

ward is no longer a modifier that appears at the end of

4

a list.  This is at page 13A of the appendix to the gray

5

brief.

6

            And so there's only one possible

7

interpretation of the list of State sexualabuse

8

offenses in Section 2251(e), and there's two possible

9

interpretations of the  the same three crimes in the

10

next provision.  And so the Court would have a choice

11

between saying that those  the State sexual abuse

12

offenses have different scopes in the two provisions.

13

            Third is that it ignores  Petitioner's

14

interpretation ignores the clear parallel between the 

15

the three main categories of sexual abuse offenses in

16

Chapter 109A, the Federal offenses.

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yeah.  And the other?

18

            MS. O'CONNELL:  That's the  and the three

19

categories that it created for State sexual offenses.

20

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.  And the fourth.

21

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Which is not a parallel

22

if  if you read the word, right?

23

            MS. O'CONNELL:  It's not exactly parallel.

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Contact is not conduct.

25

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I  I think that's  that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

is debatable.  I mean, there's  there's sexual conduct

2



3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  It's debatable that contact

4

and conduct are different words?  That's not debatable.

5

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Not that they're different

6

words.  But I think even Petitioner points out that in

7

the abusive sexual contact provision, sexual contact

8

is  they start out by calling it sexual conduct in

9

circumstances where it didn't amount to a sexual act.

10

It's all 

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  You're not suggesting this

12

is just a scrivener's error, are you?  That it was meant

13

to be contact?

14

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I think the  they both do

15

the same job.  So I don't  I don't know why it was

16

changed, but I don't think there is a reason why it's 

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Fourth, fourth.

18

            MS. O'CONNELL:  The fourth is that

19

Petitioner's interpretation would frustrate the purpose

20

of the statute because under the categorical approach,

21

it would exclude as predicates any sexual abuse crimes

22

that were committed against children if the defendant

23

was convicted under a generally applicable sexualabuse

24

statute.

25

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Okay.  So he'll say "or" is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

in this one and it's not in the other one for a reason.

2

He'll say they're superfluous reading both ways.  He'll

3

say that  I can't remember the third  but the fourth

4

he's going to say, yeah, it's underinclusive versus

5

overinclusive.  Yours is it would be somewhat

6

underinclusive for the reason you say, and you take

7

your reading, it will be overinclusive for the reason he

8

says.

9

            So if we're at  this is the only place

10

that  if we are absolutely at equipoise, which I can't

11

say we are now, but I think it through  if we are

12

absolutely at equipoise, before turning to the rule of

13

lenity, I would like your comment on my temptation to

14

say at least here, the legislative history helps.  And

15

indeed 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I knew you were going to

17

say that.

18

            (Laughter.)

19

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Indeed 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I knew it.

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:   it isn't just a letter

22

from the Justice Department.  It is that the report, the

23

way these are actually written is that a general idea is

24

given to a person whose job it is to draft.  And that

25

drafter tries to put in words the general intention

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

that's been described, and the report is used to

2

describe what the general intention was.  I'm not saying

3

a hundred percent, but very often with technical

4

statutes, that's how it works.

5

            So I read that report, and what do I

6

discover?  A repeat offender with a prior conviction

7

under datada, or under any State child abuse law, or

8

law relating to the production receipt or distribution

9

of child pornography.  And it is only two years later

10

after they pass that that the Justice Department writes

11

its letter noting that the provision they just passed

12

involved individuals with prior convictions for child

13

abuse.  And recommending an enhanced penalty as well if

14

they had a prior conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.

15

            Okay.  So I read that and said, short, but

16

clear.  And that's what the drafter would have been

17

looking at when  the first one, anyway  working with

18

the staff of the committee when trying to translate

19

general intentions of senators and representatives into

20

actual language.  And I think it's not contrary to

21

popular belief to say that senators and representatives

22

do hire staff to do such things and do not sit there

23

with pen and pencil thinking, where does the "or" go?

24

            Okay?  So what is  what is the Justice

25

Department's response to that?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I think there are two

2

things.  The first is the response I gave before, which

3

is just that this may have been a useful shorthand way

4

to describe the conduct that Congress would have been

5

most concerned about, for the person writing the report

6

and for the Department of Justice trying to convince

7

Congress to add these State law crimes to the child

8

pornography possession recidivist enhancement.

9

            And I think the other response is just that,

10

even if you think the letter is against us, you look at

11

what Congress actually did.  And they created a  a

12

provision that basically parallels the three Federal

13

offenses.  They included many Federal offenses that can

14

involve adult victims.  And then eight years later, when

15

they added State law predicates to Section 2251(e), they

16

made very clear they understood the modifier to apply

17

only to the last category.

18

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Ms. O'Connell, you  you

19

don't think Congress can leave it to its staff to decide

20

what a statute means, do you?

21

            MS. O'CONNELL:  No.

22

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Isn't legislative power

23

nondelegable?

24

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Right.  We think the  the

25

most important thing here is to look at the text of the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

            JUSTICE BREYER:  You asked a really quite

3

broad  I don't know what the 4,000 people over there

4

are doing, if  if they're not entrusted by their

5

principals to write words on paper that would reflect

6

the general idea.

7

            You think they can't do that?

8

            MS. O'CONNELL:  Justice Breyer, I think

9

it  as we explained in the brief, it  it may have

10

just been a useful shorthand way to describe the most

11

serious conducts included in that provision.

12

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who is  who is the

13

author of this?

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I don't know what

15

the hundred people 

16

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Who is the author?

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   are doing over

18

there if they're delegating everything to the staff.

19

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  This  this  this

20

letter that so much discussion has revolved around, who

21

was it in the Department of Justice that wrote?

22

            MS. O'CONNELL:  It was the Acting Assistant

23

Attorney General Ann Harkins.

24

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Could you talk about the

25

rule of lenity?  Does the rule of lenity apply with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

same force when the question is the substantive

2

definition of a crime as distinct from the penalty

3

that's attached?

4

            MS. O'CONNELL:  The Court 

5

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It seems to me there's an

6

argument that it should apply equally, but have we

7

talked about that?

8

            MS. O'CONNELL:  I think the Court has

9

typically applied the samestrength rule of lenity to

10

both substantive provisions and penalty provisions.

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  That  that makes a great

12

deal of sense.  It  other than that rule of lenity to

13

the extent it's based on notice, it seems to have

14

somewhat more force when it applies to the substantive

15

definition of the offense as opposed to the punishment.

16

But I  you could argue it either  either way.

17

            But have we  have we talked about any

18

distinction?

19

            MS. O'CONNELL:  There has not been a

20

distinction in the Court's cases.  There have been a few

21

times where criminal defendants have tried to say that

22

there should be a supercharged rule of lenity in a case

23

that's talking about mandatory minimums or maximums or

24

consecutive sentence.  And the Court has resisted that.

25

            And I think this would be not a  not a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

good case for the Court to go down that path because

2

the  the guidelines range for this particular criminal

3

defendant was 78 to 97 months.  His minimum was 120.

4

It's not actually a huge difference.  And under  under

5

current law, the statutory maximum would have been the

6

same, regardless of  of whether this enhancement

7

applied.

8

            Justice Breyer has helpfully walked me

9

through all of my points; so if the Court has no further

10

questions.

11

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, can I go back to

12

the  to the language?  You know, it's confusing

13

language.  And I showed it to all my clerks and  and

14

basically said how would you read it.  And two came out

15

on one side, and two came out on the other side.  But 

16

but I'm sort of left with this feeling that it  we're

17

not in  in a situation where there are dueling canons.

18

We actually might be in a situation where one canon

19

trumps the other.

20

            I mean, you have this lastantecedent rule,

21

and it's an important rule.  But it gives way when a

22

certain  when there is a certain quality to all the

23

antecedents when they're all parallel and when the last

24

modifier equally sensibly refers to them all, right?

25

And that that's a situation, so that seriesqualifier

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

rule is in some sense a rule about when the

2

lastantecedent rule doesn't apply.

3

            So I guess I would ask you to comment on

4

that.

5

            MS. O'CONNELL:  There  I have a couple of

6

different responses.

7

            The first one is that the context is the

8

most important thing.  And it's not the case that the

9

Court hasn't applied the lastantecedent rule in cases

10

where the statute involves a list of parallel terms.

11

            I think the FTC v. Mandel Brothers is the

12

best example of that.  There's a list of a purchaser,

13

consignee, factor, bailee, correspondent or agent, or

14

any other person who is engaged in dealing commercially

15

in fur products or fur.

16

            And the Court said it didn't make sense to

17

only apply this to a purchaser who is also dealing in

18

the  in the fur products, and so we're going to apply

19

it only to the last antecedent.  The seriesqualifier

20

principle, you know, petitioner relies quite heavily on

21

the explanation in  in Justice Scalia's book that goes

22

through all of the canons.  And the book even says that

23

the series qualifier principle more so than others is

24

highly dependent on context and can be overcome if

25

something doesn't feel right about the way that it 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

the statute reads when you apply it.

2

            And we think the clearest indication here

3

that it doesn't make sense for the qualifier to apply to

4

all three of the categories is that it  it literally

5

renders categories B and C the same.

6

            I'll  I'll point out just one other thing.

7

            Justice Breyer, you mentioned during the

8

Petitioner's argument that you noticed that each of the

9

Federal predicates, 2241, 2242, 2243, have a provision

10

that applies to minors and wards.  Section 2242 does

11

not.

12

            JUSTICE BREYER:  No.  But it's followed by

13

what could be taken as.  They just gave it a different

14

number; isn't that right?  2243 does, in fact, deal with

15

minors?

16

            MS. O'CONNELL:  2243 is the sexual abuse of

17

a minor or ward provision.

18

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Right.

19

            MS. O'CONNELL:  2241, aggravated sexual

20

abuse, has a special subsection dealing with very young

21

children.  Section 2242, the general sexual abuse crime,

22

does not include any specific for minors or wards.

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  I  I

24

saw that.

25

            MS. O'CONNELL:  All right.  Thank you.

            Mr. Zas, you have four minutes.

3

           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD S. ZAS

4

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

            MR. ZAS:  Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, and

6

Justice Breyer I think all echoed the same theme, which

7

is, at the very least, this statute is not unambiguously

8

correct, which is the standard language this Court used

9

in Granderson for when the rule of lenity must apply.

10

            So under that rule 

11

            JUSTICE ALITO:  I don't think I actually

12

said anything about the rule of lenity.

13

            MR. ZAS:  No, no.  Your  Your Honor did

14

say 

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I don't think he ever

16

mentioned the rule of lenity.

17

            MR. ZAS:  But he did say  he did use the

18

word "ambiguity," and he did say that the statute was

19

poorly drafted.  And I think  I think we certainly

20

would agree that this is  this is not a model of the

21

drafter's art, by any means.  But 

22

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Well, you  you are making

23

an argument that an awful lot of this big book is  is

24

subject to the rule of lenity because a lot of it is

25

very poorly drafted.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

            MR. ZAS:  Well, this is  this is  this

2

is not just poorly drafted.  We  both sides have gone

3

through all the canons, all the tools, legislative

4

history.  And at the end of the day, as Justice Kagan

5

pointed out, you can read it reasonably both ways.  But

6

we think as a matter of text we actually have the better

7

reading.

8

            My colleague from the Solicitor General's

9

office conceded when she was up here that there is no

10

difference between sexual abuse and abusive sexual

11

conduct.  So the parties agree on that, and yet we draw

12

radically different conclusions.

13

            The government says the solution is to just

14

limit the modifier to the second term, but that doesn't

15

eliminate surplusage.  It causes the entire modifying

16

phrase, the entire category, abusive sexual conduct

17

involving a minor or ward, to effectively drop out of

18

the statute.

19

            Our solution is to say, give the

20

nonredundant portion of the statute involving a minor or

21

ward some meaning.  Congress used those words for a

22

reason.  And the reason was the problem they were

23

focused on, which is the danger to children.

24

            So the way to preserve effect for the 

25

that modifying phrase is to apply it to all three terms,

which makes perfect sense.  If two of them mean exactly

2

the same thing, why in the world would Congress limit

3

only one to minors and children?  They're synonyms.  It

makes sense

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  My problem is, why would

6

they include adults as a predicate for the minimum in

7

Federal crimes but not in straight State crimes.

8

            MR. ZAS:  Because 

9

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I know they have done it

10

in other situations.

11

            MR. ZAS:  Yes.

12

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  But why here?  If

13

they're worried about the abuse of children, why would

14

they not capture every conceivable person or every

15

conceivable abusive act towards kids?

16

            MR. ZAS:  Well, in  in addition to the

17

fairness and administrability problems we've identified,

18

Congress reasonably could have determined that people

19

who commit abuse offenses against adults, as bad as that

20

is, don't pose the same level of danger to children.

21

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Well, she's saying why 

22

but they  they do include the sexual abuse adult when

23

you're talking about prior conviction of a Federal

24

crime.

25

            MR. ZAS:  Yes.

            JUSTICE BREYER:  And the answer, I guess,

2

has to be that you  the drafters know what they're

3

getting into with the Federal crimes, and they have no

4

idea what they're getting into when they're dealing with

5

50 State crimes.  Is that your response?

6

            MR. ZAS:  That's 

7

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm not trying to put words

8

in your mouth.  I want to know what  that's what I

9

read in the 

10

            MR. ZAS:  Your Honor, that's one answer.

11

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Let's take a  an offense

12

as to which there isn't much ambiguity:  Rape.  All

13

right?  Under the  the ordinary meaning, why would

14

rape in a Federal enclave qualify; rape a few yards

15

away, perhaps, in State territory, not  not qualify?

16

            MR. ZAS:  Because Congress was not focused

17

on symmetry in that way.  The  the Federal predicates

18

were added by the 1994 Congress.  They were  they

19

were  yes.  They were made Federal predicates.  The

20

later Congress, 1996 Congress, was the one that added

21

the State law predicates.

22

            So it's not as if the same legislators are

23

making this decision at the same time:  Should we cover

24

Federal and  and 

25

            Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.  I see my
