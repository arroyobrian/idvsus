CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument next in Case 08-1314, Williamson v. Mazda.

5

Mr. Buchanan.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN N. BUCHANAN,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BUCHANAN:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue here is whether a common law claim

10
11

that Mazda should have equipped Mrs. Williamson's

12

seating position with a lap/shoulder belt is impliedly

13

preempted under the rationale of Geier v. American

14

Honda.

15

perfectly consistent with and would not frustrate the

16

objectives of the operative 1989 version of Standard 208

17

governing Type 2 seatbelts in rear seats.

The claim is not preempted, because it is

One point that is clear from this Court's

18
19

express preemption holding in Geier is that Congress

20

intended common law to play a complementary role in

21

achieving the objectives of the Motor Vehicle Safety

22

Act.

23

Based on the savings clause, the Court

24

decided that Congress intended to preserve a significant

25

role for State tort law to operate in compensating

1

accident victims and promoting greater safety in vehicle

2

design.

3

preemption, the majority also agreed with the dissent

4

that State common law will not be preempted unless there

5

is clear evidence of a conflict with Federal objectives.

And, on the issue of implied obstacle

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would -- why would the

7

Federal Government do that?

8

supplement whatever -- whatever the Federal rules are,

9

but not permit State agencies who -- who studied the

I mean, trust juries to

10

matter with experts, to supplement what the Federal

11

rules are?

12

MR. BUCHANAN:

Justice Scalia -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why does that make any

14

sense, to just say, oh, you know, we -- we don't want

15

the State mucking around in this area, but of course

16

juries can do so?

Why does that make any sense?

MR. BUCHANAN:

17

Justice Scalia, I think the

18

Court answered the question in Sprietsma when it said

19

common law has an important role to play in providing

20

compensation to victims.

21

it rational in Sprietsma to make that distinction; and

22

ultimately it's a -- it's a judgment call for Congress

23

to make.

24
25

And therefore the Court found

JUSTICE SCALIA:
they made it.

I don't -- I don't doubt

I'm just curious as to why it could
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possibly have been?

2

MR. BUCHANAN:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4
5

Well -
Unless I -- unless lawyers

bring suits before -- before juries, maybe.
MR. BUCHANAN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

6

believe common law has an important role to play, not

7

only in compensating victims but also in providing

8

manufacturers with an incentive to develop safer

9

vehicles, even safer than the Federal minimum standards.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought the reason

11

that the Solicitor General gives for not -- that NHTSA

12

did not immediately require the type 2 seatbelt is

13

because the costs would have been higher.

14

understanding?

15

MR. BUCHANAN:

Is that your

Mr. Chief Justice, for the

16

aisle seating position that we are talking about in this

17

case, the reason NHTSA decided not to mandate it

18

immediately was, A, a concern about obstructing the

19

aisleway with the shoulder belt; and B, a concern, yes,

20

about the cost of a possible alternative design.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How come allowing -

22

or why doesn't allowing the relief you seek under State

23

law impose those same costs, contrary to NHTSA's

24

objective in not making those mandatory?

25

MR. BUCHANAN:

Well, Your Honor, any time
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

NHTSA creates a safety standard it necessarily takes

2

into account costs and benefits and the safety

3

attributes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4
5

So -
And a State tort

action does not?
MR. BUCHANAN:

6

A State tort action does.

7

What I'm trying to -- the point I'm trying to make,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, is that if that were sufficient to

9

preempt, then any minimum standard that NHTSA creates

10

would therefore preempt State law and it would nullify

11

the savings clause.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

I suppose -- I

13

understand the argument.

I'm not sure it's right,

14

though, in the sense that NHTSA may decide not to make

15

particular standards mandatory for reasons other than

16

cost.

17

adequately developed.

18

think there are adequate, you know, mechanics prepared

19

or involved.

It may decide it doesn't think the technology is
It may decide that it doesn't

20

But here it's because of the cost, and the

21

relief you are seeking it seems to me directly imposes

22

the costs that NHTSA decided not to require.

23

MR. BUCHANAN:

Well, NHTSA made a decision

24

as of 1989 that the technology -- it obviously had

25

concerns about the technology and costs.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

But any type

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of -- of consideration of technology and costs is as of

2

that moment in time, and the agency specifically

3

encouraged manufacturers to install Type 2 lap/shoulder

4

belts in these types of seating positions.

5

lawsuit is perfectly consistent with the agency's

6

objective of encouraging lap/shoulder belts in these

7

seating positions.

9

By 1993 -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

And our

Well, every -- there

is no objective that the government pursues regardless

10

of cost.

I understand that their objective was to

11

encourage this, but it was clearly not to impose it,

12

because it thought at that time that the costs were too

13

great.

14

these in ignores the other side of the cost/benefit

15

analysis.

So to simply say their objective was to get

MR. BUCHANAN:

16

Well, I think what the agency

17

did with respect to these seating positions in 1989 is

18

it, A, it recognized that there were tremendous safety

19

benefits for Type 2 lap/shoulder belts.

20

found enough countervailing considerations in terms of

21

cost and feasibility not to mandate that as part of the

22

Federal minimum standard.

23

Government's perspective, for these seating positions,

24

the government was neutral as between Type 1 and Type 2

25

belts.

And yes, it

And so from the Federal

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Either one of those belts would have

2

sufficed to satisfy the Federal agency's objectives.

3

And therefore a State law claim that eliminates

4

effectively one of those options does not in any way

5

frustrate the agency's objectives.

6

explained in its brief that its objectives would have

7

been fully satisfied if all car manufacturers had

8

installed Type 2 lap/shoulder belts immediately.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

The government has

Why is that different from

10

Geier?

11

wasn't -- weren't the manufacturers similarly left to

12

do, choose for themselves whether to have one type of

13

constraint or another?

14

Didn't the automobile manufacturer in Geier -

MR. BUCHANAN:

They were, Justice Scalia,

15

but the Court's decision in Geier did not turn on the

16

mere fact that the manufacturers had a choice, and Mazda

17

is not asserting that claim here either.

18

determinative agency policy at issue in Geier was that

19

the agency deliberately sought a variety of different

20

passive restraint types.

21

public backlash against airbags, and it wanted to

22

encourage the development of alternative passive

23

restraint systems.

24
25

The

It was concerned about a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you are saying that

once the government gives the manufacturer a choice,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

then the jury -- the -- the tort system can second-guess

2

it; and that is not consistent with a likely government

3

intent to allow the manufacturers a choice based on the

4

technical advances to that date.
MR. BUCHANAN:

5

Justice Kennedy, I don't

6

think that the government gave manufacturers a choice.

7

It gave them two different options for complying with a

8

minimum standard; but it didn't suggest that foreclosing

9

one of those options would in any way frustrate its

10

objectives.

It didn't suggest that it thought State -

11

that there should be some -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose the

13

government says you have a choice and the State of Iowa

14

passes a law and says you don't have a choice.

15

frustration of the governmental purpose there?
MR. BUCHANAN:

16
17

No

It depends what the reason

for the choice is, Justice Kennedy.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

No, there's just -- just

19

the statutes as I have given them to you.

20

is there preemption just on the face of the statute?
MR. BUCHANAN:

21

Not if it's a -- not if it's

22

just simply creating a minimum standard.

23

That there -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is no

That's what the statute

calls for, minimum.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BUCHANAN:

Yes, that's -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That the agency is to set

3

minimum standards.

4

Geier says it wasn't -- it wasn't a minimum standard,

5

because if a State deviated from it, it would detract;

6

it would be an obstacle to the realization of the

7

Federal standard.
But here the -- a minimum standard was

And then I take it that the Court in

adopted, minimal standard, and I think the agency is

10

telling us just the opposite of what it said in Geier;

11

right?
MR. BUCHANAN:

12

Exactly correct, Justice

13

Ginsberg.

In Geier the agency was the entity putting

14

forward the theory of exemption, that this claim by

15

Geier that all Honda vehicles should have been equipped

16

with airbags, frustrated its intent to accomplish a

17

whole variety or mix of passive restraint devices.
It was a direct conflict with the agency's

objectives.

opposite.

21

variety.

Its objective was to obtain the greater safety benefits

24

of Type 2 seatbelts.

25

Here, the agency is telling us the exact

It was not trying to maintain a diversity of

The agency found that Type 2 seatbelts were
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

more effective in preventing fatalities and serious

2

injuries, that they offered greater overall protection

3

for children, and, most fundamentally, that they

4

actually increased seatbelt usage in rear seating

5

positions.
Our common law theory seeks to obtain all

those exact same safety benefits for aisle seating

positions.

And we know by 1993, when this vehicle was

in fact installing Type 2 lap/shoulder belts in aisle

11

seating positions.

12

perfectly feasible for Mazda to do so in 1993 when it

13

manufactured this vehicle, and that it was unreasonable

14

not to do so, and that's the important -

15

Our complaint alleges that it was

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, your theory is,

16

if I understand your case -- correct me if I am wrong -

17

if GM had installed Type 2, they could have been sued on

18

the theory that Type 1 was better and there would have

19

been no preemption.

20

22
23
24

MR. BUCHANAN:

I think that would be a much

more difficult case, Justice Kennedy, but -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But under the theory of

MR. BUCHANAN:

That's correct.

Theoretically, that suit could move forward.

You can have Type 2 -

12

MR. BUCHANAN:

Cannot?

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can have Type 2,

14

right?

But we are not requiring Type 2, because we

15

think the costs on manufacturers would be too great.

16

may require it in the future, but not now.

17

Is it the same?

18

MR. BUCHANAN:

My position would be the

There is no preemption there.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

Well, doesn't the -

21

doesn't the increased costs that are imposed by the tort

22

liability conflict with NHTSA's determination in my

23

hypothetical that they're not requiring Type 2 because

24

of the cost?

25

MR. BUCHANAN:

Your Honor, any time the
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agency considers costs, it is at a particular moment in

2

time.

3

all the future, this should never be done and no State

4

law should ever mandate that it be done.

It is not necessarily a determination that for

And that's -- what we have here is not only

5
6

a determination that there were cost issues, but an

7

affirmative encouragement to manufacturers to do what

8

our State -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then, if the

10

regulation comes out July 1, you say there is a

11

preemption until midnight July 1, but as of July 2 there

12

could be a suit?

13
14
15

MR. BUCHANAN:

I think there was never

preemption under this regulation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think what you are

16

saying -- the statute says "minimal standards" and the

17

agency says "no obstacle," and that's it, that if there

18

is a preemptive force to the -- to the safety standards,

19

that it is for the government to say that.

20

MR. BUCHANAN:

Correct, Justice Ginsburg.

21

And not only does it say "minimum standards," it

22

explicitly says in the savings clause that mere

23

compliance with a motor vehicle safety standard shall

24

not exempt the manufacturer from common law liability.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, it said all

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

those thing in Geier, too, didn't it?

2

MR. BUCHANAN:

It did.

But again, the key

3

dispositive fact in Geier was the agency's desire to

4

achieve a variety of different passive restraint

5

devices, and a claim that the entire Honda fleet should

6

have had airbags would directly conflict with that.

7

That was the dispositive fact in this Court's decision

8

in Geier, and that is what is lacking here.

9

have here is much more -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

And what we

Your judgment here doesn't

11

apply to the entire Mazda fleet, supposedly, right?

12

Just to the car that caused harm to the plaintiff?
MR. BUCHANAN:

13

No, that's not correct,

14

Justice Scalia.

15

entire fleet or not.

16

common law claim conflicts with the Federal objective.

17

And in Geier, it conflicted, because the objective was

18

variety.

19

It's not a matter of whether it's the
It's a matter of whether the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about the next case?

20

Let's assume a similar case.

21

out the same way as to whether there should have been a

22

shoulder constraint or not?

23

MR. BUCHANAN:

Is that jury bound to come

No, Justice Scalia, and

24

that's something that the Court in Geier contemplated

25

and discussed.

The Court in Geier acknowledged that -
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Geier came out against you.

Why are you appealing to Geier?
MR. BUCHANAN:

3

It came out -- I don't -- I

4

think Geier fully supports us, Justice Scalia.

5

certainly on the express preemption issue, the Court

6

acknowledged the possibility that there could be

7

conflicting results, inconsistent jury verdicts, which

8

is always -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

And

Why are we looking to

10

Geier when you have a statute that says common law

11

remedies are safe?

12

maybe it didn't make a whole lot of sense, but they did

13

it.

I mean, as long as it says that -

MR. BUCHANAN:

14

I agree with you, Justice

15

Ginsburg.

But I think Geier also says that.

16

relies on the savings clause to say that there's a

17

significant role for common law actions to play.

18

specifically with regard to the possibility of

19

inconsistent jury verdicts, the Court in Geier said the

20

possible -- the possibility of nonuniformity, the

21

Savings Clause reflects a congressional determination

22

that that's a small price to pay for a system where

23

juries create and enforce safety standards and

24

simultaneously provide compensation to victims.

25

think that's something the Court considered in Geier.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

7

MR. JAY:

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Respondents chose to comply with the Federal

11

minimum safety standard by installing a Type 1 seatbelt,

12

but the savings clause makes clear that they are not

13

exempted from the consequences of that choice under

14

State common law when that choice results in injury.

15

They must show that, as Geier makes clear, that the

16

State law rule of decision would pose a conflict with an

17

articulable Federal policy.

18

here.

19

They haven't shown that

I would like to go first to the question the

20

Chief Justice asked my friend Mr. Buchanan about cost

21

benefit analysis and the Federal judgment that at the

22

time the imposition of a national uniform Federal

23

minimum standard of Type 2 seatbelts wasn't warranted at

24

these seating positions.

25

Simply saying that, and I -- simply saying
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that is not enough to establish that the Federal agency

2

wished for the adoption of Type 2 seatbelts not to

3

happen.

4

rulemaker -- certainly every NHTSA safety standard

5

adoption must include -

6

As Mr. Buchanan said, every Federal

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No -- I agree with

7

you, it doesn't require.

8

inference that they did not want Type 2 seatbelts to

9

happen, to be used.

10

It doesn't support the

It does, in my hypothetical view, support

11

the inference that it didn't want to mandate Type 2

12

seatbelts because it was worried, as you said in your

13

brief at page 9, about the cost.

14

about the cost, it seems to me, are overridden by the

15

position that State tort suits can go on for the absence

16

of Type 2 seatbelts.

17

MR. JAY:

And yet its worries

Well, of course the baseline is

18

that State tort suits can always go forward.

19

this case, the agency decided not to impose this

20

nationwide mandate because of the tradeoff between costs

21

and benefits.

22

The benefits were significant.

And in

Everyone

23

recognizes that.

Everyone recognizes that Type 2

24

seatbelts were better for -- better or at least

25

equivalent for all categories of passengers, and I will
17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

come back to that.

2

costs go, NHTSA decided that it was not worth it at that

3

time for NHTSA to require that.

4

NHTSA wanted to adopt the policy of freeing

5

manufacturers of -- of any obligation to incur those

6

costs, let alone that it wanted -- for example, if NHTSA

7

had thought that it would harm safety for manufacturers

8

to spend that money on Type 2 seatbelts instead of

9

something else, it could have said that.

What you're -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. JAY:

The contrast between this case and

options as it sees fit.

25

Second, on the more general question, why
doesn't NHTSA participate in these cases, NHTSA as a

matter of course does not usually participate in private

2

party litigation under State common law, even when that

3

litigation might touch on a State -- the interpretation

4

of a Federal safety standard.

5

for NHTSA's views, NHTSA generally responds, as this

6

Court asks for the government's views in this case and

7

the government responded.

8

to look back to the first brief in a string of briefs

9

that the government has filed about these issues under

And when the courts asked

And I think if the Court were

10

this act, the brief in Wood versus General Motors filed

11

in 1990, you could predict the position that the

12

government would take in this case from that brief.

13

government said in that case that options don't preempt,

14

merely because they are options.

15

will be no federal policy that presents a conflict.

The

In most cases there

That case presented the case of the passive

16
17

restraint phase-in and there it was the rare

18

circumstance, as the Court later held in Geier, where

19

there was frustration of the Federal policy, but that's

20

because the Federal policy was to encourage variety, not

21

just for its own sake, but because variety would serve

22

safety.

23

airbags were rushed into service.

25

The roads would be measurably less safe if

2

there was no conflict.

So

As far as the child safety concern to which

3
4

Justice Sotomayor alluded, it is referred to in the 1984

5

denial of a request to impose the rule that later was

6

imposed in 1989.

7

about how particular child seats, which at the time were

8

anchored with a form of tether.

The agency said that it had concerns

And it said that it

10

something that it chose to encourage rather than

11

anchoring them with Type 2 seats.
The agency did not speak at all to whether

12
13

Type 2 versus Type 1 was better for child safety and the

14

agency then answered that in the 1989 rulemaking.

15

for adults Type 2 seatbelts are safer and they encourage

16

seatbelt use because they are more popular.

17

infants, the agency specifically asked whether Type 2

18

seatbelts could be as efficacious as Type 1 seatbelts in

19

holding an infant car seat in place.

20

they could.

21

And for toddlers, children who are too small to sit in a

22

Type 2 seatbelt without assistance, the agency

23

recommended booster seats.

24

seat the agency recommended that they not use the

25

shoulder belt.

So

For

It concluded that

That's set out at page 25 of our brief.

And if there was no booster

If the child were injured by

a Type 2 belt, would a suit based on that be preempted?
MR. JAY:

If the child were injured by the

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. JAY:

10

Yes.

At the time, no, that lawsuit

11

would not have been preempted.

12

that would be harder case and I think he said that

13

14

seatbelts, and in this case Respondents can't show

15

anything suggesting that the agency was encouraging Type

16

1 seatbelts.

17

reason, but at that time there were two ways of

18

complying with the Federal minimum standard and the

19

savings clause provides that simply complying with the

20

Federal standard does not preempt the operation of State

21

common law.

22

Mr. Buchanan said that

So it might be a harder case for that

So we discussed the child safety, the

23

alleged child safety rationale.

I want to say a word

24

about the idea that aisle seats were unsafe for the

25

installation of these seatbelts.

As Mr. Buchanan

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mentioned, the agency specifically encouraged the

2

installation of those seats where it was feasible.

3

was found to be feasible in 1991 by General Motors,

4

which installed them.

5

because Respondents have suggested that the chief

6

counsel of NHTSA has said in 1994 in a letter something

7

favorable to their position, and that letter is

8

reproduced in the appendix to the Petitioner's reply

9

brief.

14

that manufacturers were installing Type 2 seatbelts and

15

they said, the complainant said that makes these

16

minivans unsafe because people will be trapped in the

17

back seat.

18

could go under the safety belt, that they could detach

19

the safety belt, that the safety benefits of a Type 2

20

seatbelt outweighed any convenience concern about access

21

to or egress from the rear seat.

Because what the agency

to the lights in a car.

18

you know, there are so many designs of cars; in some

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

Geier says

How is this different

14

from the hypothetical where the agency said there could

15

be an obstruction with the entry, but manufacturers who

16

can design it without the obstruction should really do

17

it.

18

hypothetical?

19

How is this, this case, different than the one

MR. GARRE:

This case is different because

20

the agency specifically recognized in 1984 and 1989 that

21

there were serious safety and practicability tradeoffs

22

between these two different design options and

23

specifically gave manufacturers the option of installing

24

one type of seatbelt or the other.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Nothing in the agency that

26

2

options.

But in Geier which I think all of this could be just

avoided.

I mean, they said it's up to the manufacturer.

5

MR. GARRE:

I think -

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the agency would simply

say, do they want to have this to be a maximum or just

I don't know why.

MR. GARRE:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

for a manufacturer to put the light into a sedan or to

safety risk?

8
9

If it's preempted, there is no inducement.
MR. GARRE:

The agency recognized here that

Type 1 seatbelts, the lap-only seatbelts, themselves

10

posed unique safety risks.

It did so to children.

11

you look at the 1984 rulemaking, the agency couldn't

have been more clear that we are not going to impose a

Type 2 mandate for rear seats, because that's going to

be harmful to children.

I would agree with you for virtually all of them, except

can manufacture this car with this design or that

Well, that's just not true.

telling parents:

MR. GARRE:

This was an area that NHTSA was

carefully monitoring.

You had rulemakings in '84 and

'89 and it adopted a very unique approach to resolving

9

the safety issue, which was to expressly give

10

manufacturers this option to advance Federal safety and

practicability objectives.

12

about the practicability objectives, but that is one of

13

the statutory objectives of the act.

We haven't talked as much

Congress couldn't have been more clear on

that and the agency in 1989 couldn't have been more

clear in the final notice, saying we are not going to

require manufacturers to install Type 2 belts in the

18

rear center and aisle seats because that's just too

19

costly.

20

well knew based on its history that imposing this sort

21

of overly costly safety measures that the Type 2 belt

22

would have been for these seats at that time could have

23

proved counterproductive with the agency's long-term

24

safety mission.

25

It's substantially expensive and the agency

The agency said that in the rulemaking in

This is something that Congress gave the

agency the expert judgment to make on these matters and

the practicability objectives, which was just as much a

statutory objective as a safety objective, would have

been directly frustrated if, as could have happened

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN N. BUCHANAN

If

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BUCHANAN:

First of all, I would like to

9

clear up the child safety issue and I know Mr. Jay has

10

addressed this to some extent, but let me be perfectly

11

clear, there is absolutely nothing in the '87 to '89

12

regulatory history that mentions anything about child

13

safety being a consideration in the agency's decision

14

not to mandate Type 2 shoulder belts for aisle and

15

center seating positions.

16

Specifically, Justice Ginsberg asked Mr.

17

Garre about whether there is anything about the rear

18

center seat being the safest place for children in that

19

regulatory history.

20

that regulatory history about that issue, and the reason

21

for that is this:

22

considered safer for children had nothing to do with the

23

type of seatbelt that was installed in that seat.

24
25

There is no mention whatsoever in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

When you talk about

3

safety to children, are you also addressing the strap

4

going across the aisle or the strap interfering with

5

vision?

6

children, but it affects what type of belt might be the

7

safest overall.

8

I know that is not directly related to

MR. BUCHANAN:

You are right,

Mr. Chief Justice, that was not expressed in any way in

10

terms of a child safety concern.

11

correction, the interference with rear vision was a

12

comment that a commenter made in the regulatory history

13

and the agency never really expressed an opinion one way

14

or the other about whether that was a concern.

15

I would also, minor

I think what's really important here is that

16

state tort law provides an incentive for manufacturers

17

to exercise their options reasonably.

18

option is to exceed a minimum standard that doesn't have

19

options, or to choose between two different options that

20

a minimum standard provides, state tort law ensures that

21

manufacturers act reasonably.

22

And whether that

Our contention -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But state tort law

23

doesn't, juries typically don't take into account the

24

fleet costs of avoiding liability, which as I understand

25

from the SG's brief in this case was the reason that
50

rejected that argument in Wyeth, and as the dissent
