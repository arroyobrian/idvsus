CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 09-893, AT&T

5

Mobility v. Concepcion.

6

Mr. Pincus.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

8
9
10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit concluded in this case

12

that a State law may mandate the use of a particular

13

procedure in arbitration as long as the law also

14

requires the use of that same procedure in litigation.

15

That interpretation of section 2 of the Federal

16

Arbitration Act would permit a State to oppose in

17

arbitration any procedure employed in court and thereby

18

require arbitration to be a carbon copy of litigation,

19

precisely what the Act was designed to prevent.

20

Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act

21

provides that an arbitration agreement may be held

22

unenforceable under State law only if the State law rule

23

being invoked to invalidate the agreement qualifies as a

24

ground that exists in law or equity for the revocation

25

of any contract.

Respondent argues that, because
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

California's Discover Bank rule does not facially

2

discriminate against arbitration, it falls within the

3

savings clause.

4

clause makes clear that it is not limited to statutes

5

that discriminates facially against arbitration.

But the plain language of the savings

6

By referring to "any contract," it makes

7

clear that, as this Court has said, the rule must be

8

applicable to contracts generally.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

What if -- what if a State

10

finds it unconscionable to have an arbitration clause in

11

an adhesion contract which requires the arbitration to

12

be held at a great distance from -- from where the other

13

party is and requires that party to pay the cost of the

14

arbitration?

15

unconscionable?

Can a State not find that to be

16

MR. PINCUS:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19

It can, Your Honor, and -­
Well, that wouldn't apply

to other -- to other contracts.
MR. PINCUS:

But the legal doctrine that the

20

State is applying there, as States have and as we

21

discuss in our brief, is a doctrine that applies a

22

general principle of unconscionability with principles

23

elucidating how it applies that apply evenhandedly

24

across the board.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are we going to sit in

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judgment?

2

say -- you say it has to shock the conscience, but if a

3

State wants to apply a lesser standard of

4

unconscionability, can we strike that down?

5

Are we going to sit in judgment?

MR. PINCUS:

I know you

If it wants to apply a lesser

6

standard to arbitration clauses, yes, absolutely you

7

can, because that would -- that would violate what is at

8

the core of the provision, which is discrimination

9

against State law.

10

If a State -- if a State enacted -- if the

11

legislature enacted a statute and it was headed

12

arbitration -- unconscionability, rather, and section 1

13

of that statute had general principles to be applied to

14

all contractual provisions to determine

15

unconscionability:

16

question is addressed with respect to the party before

17

the court against whom the contract is going to be

18

applied, and the third principle is unconscionability is

19

decided ex ante.

20

It must shock the conscience, the

And then section B said -- I'm sorry?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the difference,

21

then, with the act that you are positing?

A State comes

22

in -- or I should ask:

23

State saying these terms in a contract are

24

unconscionable, making the petitioner always pay the

25

fees and making him or her arbitrate in a different

Is there no difference between a

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State -- that is unconscionable -- or a general rule of

2

State law that says in a contract of adhesion the

3

stronger party can't impose undue cost or expenses on

4

the other side to vindicate their rights, whether it's

5

in litigation and/or arbitration.
In your mind, there is no difference between

6
7

those two things, between these two approaches to the

8

issue?
MR. PINCUS:

9

I don't think so, Justice

10

Sotomayor.

Maybe if I could finish with my example, it

11

may elucidate the distinction that I'm trying to draw.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

So how do you address

13

Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no

14

difference between those two things, then how can a

15

State find those terms unconscionable?

16

theory, general theory of law, would they be -­
MR. PINCUS:

17

Under what

I think the critical question

18

is:

Is the State applying the same principles to

19

arbitration, of unconscionability to arbitration

20

agreements, as to other agreements?

21

was positing a first provision that laid out three

22

principles that would be applied.

And in my example I

23

If part B of that section, or part 2 of that

24

section, said with respect to arbitration agreements, on

25

the other hand, we are going to require that the
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

procedures be equivalent to what is in court, we are

2

going to look at the time the dispute arises rather than

3

ex ante, and we are going to look at the effect on

4

everyone, then I think it would be quite clear that that

5

would be discrimination.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is bad, absolutely,

7

but that's not what the State is going to do.

8

is simply going to say:

9

unconscionable.

And you say it's not unconscionable;

10

it's very fair.

And the State says:

11

unconscionable.

12
13
14

The State

We find this to be

Eh, we think it is

Are we going to tell the State of California
what it has to consider unconscionable?
MR. PINCUS:

Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I

15

don't think that's what the State is doing here.

I

16

think what the State is doing here is saying -- is not

17

saying, under the same principles we apply elsewhere,

18

this is unconscionable.

19

clear that it's -­

They're just saying, it's quite

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. PINCUS:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's nothing -­

I'm sorry.
There is nothing that

23

indicates that California's laws are applying a

24

different concept of unconscionability.

25

come up and said, oh, look what they did here.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

You haven't
And in

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

another case they said it has to shock the conscience.
Maybe across the board, California is

saying:

We think that unconscionability should have a

broader meaning.

7

of unconscionability.

Is there really no genuine agreement

And if that is so, that will fit our definition

You don't have anything that says -- the

8
9

Is it unfair to the weaker party

California court hasn't said:

We are applying a special

10

definition of unconscionability to arbitration

11

agreements.
MR. PINCUS:

12

Well, they haven't said that,

13

Your Honor, but their opinion makes clear that they do.

14

For example, the statute in California that defines

15

unconscionability specifically says unconscionability

16

shall be assessed at the time of contracting.
Here, the decision holding the Discover Bank

17
18

rule is specifically based on a determination of

19

unconscionability, not ex ante, when there would be a

20

variety of situations to consider, but it is explicitly

21

based at the time the dispute arose.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

22
23

I was under the impression

--

24

MR. PINCUS:

25

applying a different -­

So it's clear that they are

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I was under the impression,

2

Mr. Pincus, that Discover Bank specifically cites a case

3

which arose not in the arbitration context, but instead

4

in the general litigation context, which is this America

5

Online case, and thereby made clear that its rule,

6

however different it may seem to you from normal

7

contract provisions, its rule applied both in the

8

arbitration sphere and in the litigation sphere.

9

MR. PINCUS:

Justice Kagan, I think that

10

question goes to -- to a separate question.

11

Respondent has two arguments.

12

applies to all dispute resolution provisions, it is a

13

general -- it applies to any contract that qualifies

14

under section 2.

15

the case, for several reasons.

16

I think

One is, because this rule

We think that that clearly can't be

First of all, section 2 says "any contract,"

17

and that, the Court has said, means principles that

18

apply to contracts generally, not principles that are

19

limited to dispute resolution contracts.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22
23

Well, this -­
Well, any contract that

would have an arbitration clause.
MR. PINCUS:

True, Your Honor.

But if the

24

provision meant that, then as long as -- as long as a

25

State law banning arbitration said, we are banning
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration in any contract, then the State could say it

2

applied to any contract.

3

juries are required to resolve every dispute, whether in

4

arbitration or not.

5

Or a provision that said

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we criticize one

6

feature of this?

You are not claiming that, vis à vis

7

litigation, arbitration is being disfavored, which was

8

the original concern about arbitration agreements and

9

what prompted the Federal Arbitration Act.

The courts

10

didn't like to have their business taken away, and so

11

they were disfavoring arbitration contracts.

12

That is no part of the picture here, as far

13

as I can see, because the rule is the same whether it's

14

litigation or arbitration.

15

MR. PINCUS:

Well, we -- we do make an

16

argument, Your Honor, that the impact of this rule is

17

much more significant on arbitration than it is on

18

litigation, because it basically -- with respect to

19

litigation, it is reaffirming the default rule, but with

20

respect to arbitration, it has a quite significant

21

different effect, which is really to transform

22

arbitration in the ways that the Court described in

23

Stolt-Nielsen.

24
25

And so we do argue that it does have a
disproportionate burden, but our principal argument here
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is that the "any contract" requirement means that the

2

State law rule being applied has to be a rule that

3

applies generally to contractual provisions, as the

4

Court has said.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

Yes, but some -- some

6

elements of unconscionability can only arise in a

7

litigation or an arbitration context, such as requiring

8

the complaining party to litigate or arbitrate at a

9

distant location.

How could that possibly apply in -­

10

to any other contracts?

11

MR. PINCUS:

Well, that -- that now turns to

12

the second argument that Respondents make, which is,

13

even if the mere fact that it applies to litigation and

14

arbitration satisfied section 2, the rule satisfied -­

15

satisfies section 2 because it is merely a specific

16

application of California's general unconscionability

17

rule.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

And -- and our response to that

20

is:

It is quite clear that in three critical respects,

21

it is the principles that were applied -- not the

22

result, but the principles that were applied in order to

23

find unconscionability here -- are different than the

24

principles applied in every other context.

25

-11
Alderson Reporting Company

By example

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. PINCUS:

Three?

What are the three?

The three are, first of all,

3

looking to the effect on people other than the parties

4

to the dispute.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5
6

In every other case -­

about that.

Right.
MR. PINCUS:

7

I was going to ask you

-- the question is:

Is it fair

8

to the person before the court to apply the contract to

9

them?

10

Here, the district court found it was quite fair

to apply to that person; the problem was third parties.
The second issue:

11

When is the

12

unconscionability decision made?

13

says ex ante.

14

are going to look at it at the time the dispute arises.

Here, the decisions explicitly say:

Third question:

15

As I said, the statute
We

The general standard is

16

shock the -- so unfair as to shock the conscience.

17

the standard is:

18

to a judicial class action?

Here

Is there a deterrent effect equivalent

Three critical differences, three

19
20

differences that are not differences in result, but are

21

differences in the legal principles that are being

22

applied to determine unconscionability.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought that Discover

24

Bank is the California case that sets it out; is that

25

correct?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that's California law.

3

And what they say in Discover Bank is -- they are

4

talking about class waivers in both arbitration

5

contracts and not arbitration contracts.

6

they are void when it's a consumer contract of adhesion,

7

when they predictably involve small amounts of damages,

8

when it is claimed that the party with the superior

9

bargaining power has carried out a scheme deliberately

And they say

10

to cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually

11

small sums of money, and the waiver becomes in practice

12

the exemption of the party from responsibility for its

13

own fraud.
Now, seems to -- those seem to be the

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would guess it's

like Switzerland having a law saying, we only buy milk

But to say we want cows that have passed the
So I guess we have to look at

And here, my impression is -- correct me if
I am wrong -- the class arbitration exists.

It's not

10

11

it in arbitration.

12

where is the 9,000-foot cow, or whatever it is?

13

is the discrimination?

14

You could have

You can have it in litigation.

MR. PINCUS:

So

Where

Well, I think this is exactly

15

the 9,000-foot meadow, Your Honor, because I think the

16

problem here is there is -- it is not possible, based on

17

the language of section 2 or any other basis that we can

18

think of, to say a statute that requires the full use of

19

discovery procedures in court and in arbitration or

20

factual determinations by a panel of six individuals

21

selected at random -­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Pincus, are they

23

necessarily saying that?

As I read it, the plaintiff

24

brought a case to court, not to arbitration, and then

25

there was a motion to stay the State court litigation.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Why isn't it a proper reading of this case

2

to say:

You want -- if you are in the arbitration

3

forum, it's bilateral, but you can't dupe these

4

plaintiffs out of a class action?

5

a class action in arbitration, you can have it in court.

6

That is, the class action is preserved, not necessarily

7

in the arbitration forum, but in the court.
MR. PINCUS:

8
9

So if you don't have

Well, I think the problem,

Justice Ginsberg, is both prongs of that requirement are

10

independently problematic.

11

that I was just saying and I think for the reasons that

12

the Court explained in Stolt-Nielsen, requiring class

13

arbitration is just the same as requiring discovery or a

14

jury trial or all of the other judicial processes in

15

arbitration.

16

say, well, if you don't do that you must exclude these

17

claims from arbitration -­

requiring arbitration -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

But they're not

Go ahead, Justice

Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They are not saying you

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have to arbitration -- class actions in all arbitration

2

proceedings.

3

which they pursue the State, who's their own sovereign,

4

and the savings clause in the FAA permits them in law or

5

equity to set forth rules to say in this subset of cases

6

there is a substantive right being affected.

7

different than rules that are looking at procedures and

8

setting uniform procedures in both.

9

They are identifying a class of cases in

That is

How do we draw the line between a law that

10

says discovery has to happen in arbitration, and one

11

that says a -- in a contract of adhesion, if the

12

superior party retains the right to do discovery but

13

tells the inferior party, you can't?

14

that's unconscionable.

15

MR. PINCUS:

And a State says,

Your Honor, I think that's the

16

precise difference between the two issues that are -­

17

that are in this case.

18

discussing, we think there is a very strong argument

19

that a rule cannot qualify to be saved under section 2

20

simply because it applies even-handedly to arbitration

21

and litigation because of the fact that that would sweep

22

in all of these other rules that we are talking about.

23

For the reason we have been

And an additional reason, to respond to

24

Justice Breyer's question, is that at the time that the

25

FAA was enacted the ouster doctrine did apply to
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arbitration litigation.

2

which courts said:

3

contractual provision that deprives us of jurisdiction

4

whether it directs the claim to arbitration or it

5

directs the claim to some other court.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

MR. PINCUS:

8
9

It was a broad doctrine in

We are going to invalidate any

But Mr. Pincus -­

And so the very same argument

being made here could have been made then.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Pincus, I'm not

10

understanding what test you are asking us to formulate.

11

Justice Scalia started this by saying, how about a

12

provision prohibiting certain kinds of attorney's fees?

13

How about a provision prohibiting certain kinds of -- a

14

law prohibiting certain kinds of discovery provisions?

15

And you said that would be fine, for the State courts to

16

hold those things unconscionable, but it's not fine for

17

the State court to hold a class arbitration prohibition

18

unconscionable.

19

So what separates the two?

How do we know

20

when something is on one side of the line and something

21

is on the other?

22

fine, to say that those procedures are unconscionable,

23

but other procedures if you held them unconscionable

24

that would not be sufficient.

25

Both procedures, but you say some are

MR. PINCUS:

What separates the two is, is

the State in the particular case in which the

2

determination is made applying principles that apply to

doctrine across the board.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. PINCUS:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

is.

9

about that.

10

The State says yes.

Well, but I think -­
The State says it absolutely

Now, who are we to say that the State is wrong

MR. PINCUS:

Well, let me answer that in two

11

ways, Justice Kagan.

12

the hypotheticals that you posit and that Justice Scalia

13

posited and that Justice Sotomayor posited have been

14

addressed under the traditional unconscionability

15

doctrine that we described.

16

courts have said is this provision -- we are measuring

17

whether it is unconscionable at the time of contracting;

18

we are looking at the effect on the party before the

19

court; can this person get to arbitration, is the fee

20

too high, is it too far away.

21

looking at the effect on this particular person and we

22

are deciding whether it shocks the conscience or

23

whatever their across-the-board State standard is.

24
25

First of all, let me explain why

In all of those cases, what

What about -- we are

And in all of those cases, that's what those
courts do, and that's why those provisions have been

handed application of the unconscionability provisions

3

that courts apply when they assess -­

4
5

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought that -- I don't

want to interrupt your complete answer.

6

MR. PINCUS:

Sure.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I thought that was the

8

gist of your argument, the heart of your argument, that

9

traditional unconscionability in California and

10

elsewhere focuses on unfairness to the party who is

11

before the tribunal.

12

the Concepcions, rather than unfairness to other members

13

of the class who are not before the court.

14
15
16

So here it would be unfairness to

MR. PINCUS:

That's exactly right,

Justice Alito.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Pincus, the State

17

says, well, our unconscionability doctrine may not have

18

done that in the past, but now in the year 2010 it

19

actually applies to more things than it did in the past,

20

and we do take into account third parties and that's our

21

new unconscionability doctrine.

22

unconscionability doctrine or it may be a bad

23

unconscionability doctrine, but it's the State's

24

unconscionability doctrine.

25

MR. PINCUS:

Now, it may be a good

But it is not the State's
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

general unconscionability doctrine, Justice Kagan.

It

2

is a doctrine that applies only in the context of class

3

waivers and that's the problem.

4

adopt a general statute that said, for unconscionability

5

purposes henceforward we will look in assessing the

6

unconscionability of every provision at third parties,

7

at the impact on third parties and whether it's fair to

8

them, perhaps they could do that.

If the State were to

I think there might be some reasons why a

9
10

State wouldn't do that, because that would upset a lot

11

of things in the judicial system that we think of as

12

routine, such as confidential settlements and the fact

13

that arbitration doesn't require publication or estoppel

14

and all kinds of rules could be invalidated on that

15

ground.

16

that the State applied across the board, and it would

17

also apply to things like the level of rent in rent

18

contracts and statutes of limitations and all sorts of

19

things.

But at least it would be an even-handed rule

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. PINCUS:

22
23

Why, why, why?

But here, that's not -- I'm

sorry.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

That's I think what

24

Justice Kagan is getting at.

If a State wants to have a

25

doctrine which says, you have to have a seal of a
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certain kind on certain kinds of contracts, they've

2

never done it before, but now they do it, and on that

3

kind you have to have a seal both on the arbitration

4

contract and on the other.

5

is they have listed the four characteristics from

6

Discover Bank, and they've said all contracts to do with

7

litigation have to satisfy those four.

8
9

And here what they've done

At which point I think Justice Kagan said,
so what if they've never done this before?

They sure

10

have done it now.

And what's the basis for saying that

11

the Arbitration Act or any other part of Federal law

12

forbids California from doing that?

13

MR. PINCUS:

Two answers to that,

14

Justice Breyer.

15

generally with respect to contracts.

16

a special rule that is targeted on a special kind of

17

contract and that carries -- to the extent one is

18

worried about discrimination -- nonfacial discrimination

19

designing the category of contracts relating to

20

litigation or dispute resolution is precisely the kind

21

of category that most presents the risk of

22

discrimination that isn't facial.

23

First of all, they haven't done it
They have made up

And again, whatever any contract means, we

24

think it has to mean that the category of dispute

25

resolution contracts can't be one that satisfies any
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contract, because at the time the law was enacted the

2

ouster doctrine did just that and it was the doctrine

3

that was being targeted.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

But it seems to me that

5

all State -- most State statutes pertaining to contracts

6

pertain to a class that is not entirely universal.

7

Suppose the State had a statute referring to banks,

8

contracts with banks.

9

contracts.

That doesn't apply to all

It doesn't apply to railroads.

But we know

10

that it applies to a class that generally includes both

11

arbitration and non-arbitration.

12

because there can be class action rule with respect to

13

litigation and class action rules with respect to

14

arbitration.

15

recognizes that you don't have to have the entire

16

universe of contracts.

So you have to have some rule that

17

MR. PINCUS:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

what your test is.

20

brief.

21

And that's this case,

Well, Your Honor -­
And I'm not quite sure

You have a few of them in your

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think the "any

22

contract" language of the statute shows that Congress

23

was not enacting -- was not providing that everything

24

other than facial discrimination qualifies for the

25

savings clause, because it could have said any
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

nondiscriminatory rule.

2

any contract.

3

because of the ouster doctrine it was confronted with,

4

which did apply to both arbitration and litigation

5

contracts, and because of the risk generally that a

6

contract rule could be devised that maybe didn't

7

facially discriminate against arbitration, but had the

8

effect of targeting arbitration disproportionately and

9

that's what is going on.

And the reason for that we think is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

It said a rule that applies to

So how do you have special

rules applicable to banks?

12

MR. PINCUS:

Well, most -- most -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Contracts by banks, can't a

14

State say, you know, certain bank contracts have to have

15

this or that?
MR. PINCUS:

16

In most of the examples that we

17

have looked at of situations like that, the contract

18

principles that are being applied are general

19

principles, and perhaps they are being applied -- they

20

are being specified for four particular categories of

21

contracts, like the UCC, but they are tied to general

22

principles.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They claim that here.

They

claim it's the general principle of unconscionability.
MR. PINCUS:

But -- but I think, as I have
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discussed, the problem here it has the label

2

"unconscionability" on it, but the test that is applied

3

has nothing to do with the test that is applied in every

4

other context.

5

back to my statutory example, this is an

6

unconscionability -- this is a test that may have the

7

label on it, but everything that the court looks at to

8

find unconscionability or to find this impermissible are

9

things that are not looked at in the other context.

So it's an easy case to decide.

Going

And

10

in the other context, indeed as the district court said,

11

this contract is more than fair under our general

12

unconscionability standard, because it -- the people

13

before the court are better off than they would be in a

14

class action.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. PINCUS:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20

So then we have -- we

I -­
We have to look at what

the States are doing in -- to interpret their own laws?
MR. PINCUS:

I think what the Court has to

21

do, as it does in the independent and adequate State

22

ground context and other contexts, is to determine

23

whether the State is -- is applying a rule that is -­

24

that discriminates, because the core protection of

25

section 2 is discrimination.

And so, if the -- if the

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State has devised a rule that clearly discriminates, but

2

has simply put the label on -- of unconscionability,

3

surely the FAA permits the Court to look at that.

4

Otherwise it's -- the protection will be reduced to

5

nothing.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

So if we look at the

7

California law and we find other instances of

8

unconscionability that are applying a standard less

9

stringent than "shock the conscience," then we would say

10

okay?
MR. PINCUS:

11

No, Your Honor.

I think that

12

the critical question here -- are there other cases that

13

look to the effect on the party before the court?

14

found none and -- and Respondents have found none.

15

there other case that assess the -- whether it's

16

unconscionability at the time of the dispute rather than

17

at the time of contracting?

18

statute specifically requires it to be done at the time

19

of contracting.

20

going to look at whether something is -- not whether

21

something is so unfair as to shock the conscience, but

22

at whether it is the equivalent to some statutory

23

procedure?

There are none.

Are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEEPAK GUPTA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10
11

MR. GUPTA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As I think several of the questions this

12

morning have brought out, the question here is not what

13

this Court would decide if it were sitting as the

14

Supreme Court of California and applying the State's

15

common law in the first instance.

16

is whether the State law at issue falls within a

17

statutory savings clause that expressly preserves

18

contract defenses available at law or in equity.

19

Rather, the question

The State law at issue here is not

20

preemptive, for three reasons.

21

with the equal footing principle or nondiscrimination

22

principle that this Court has consistently recognized is

23

embodied in section 2.

24
25

First, it is consistent

Second, it's consistent with two key
purposes that the savings clause fulfills under the FAA:
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ensuring that arbitration is a matter of consent and not

2

coercion; and that it represents merely a choice of

3

forum, but not an exemption from the law.
And third, the State law at issue is a

4
5

correct and legitimate application of the State's common

6

law to which this Court should defer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

If I could just go

8

to your -- your second reason seemed to be focused

9

particularly on arbitration as opposed to a principle

10

that applies to every other contract.
MR. GUPTA:

11

Well, let me be clear about what

12

I mean by the second reason.

I think that the savings

13

clause in the FAA serves two critical purposes, and that

14

is that the -- the contract law doctrines ensure

15

consent.

16

consensual agreement between both parties, and you look

17

to State contract law to determine whether there is

18

consent.

You don't have arbitration unless you have a

And also, I think as this Court has

19
20

repeatedly said about arbitration under the FAA, it

21

represents a choice of forum, but it doesn't withdraw

22

the parties from the substantive liability rules of the

23

State.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, but the

substantive State liability rule on the issue you are
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

addressing is that you consider the issue of consent ex

2

ante, and with respect to arbitration you are

3

considering it at the time the dispute arose.

4

that a discrimination against arbitration agreements?

5

MR. GUPTA:

Isn't

Well, first of all, I think it

6

is a -- it's a question of State law whether the

7

determination is ex ante or ex post.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But we actually -­
Well, sure.

That's

true in all of these cases.

10

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a question of

12

what the State law provides; then you consider whether

13

it's consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act.

14

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

And the Discover Bank

15

application of State unconscionability law we believe is

16

an ex ante analysis.

17

is fair or exculpatory at the time that the contract is

18

made; and indeed there is -- the two arguments that Mr.

19

Pincus made about California unconscionability law are

20

somewhat at war with themselves.

21

the doctrine looks to third parties and that that's

22

illegitimate; and he said that the doctrine is ex post

23

and that's illegitimate.

24

perspective of a consumer that's entering into this

25

contract, from the perspective of any AT&T consumer,

It looks at whether the contract

He said that the -­

But in fact, from the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they don't know whether they are going to be among the

2

very few consumers who detect fraud, recognize a legal

3

claim, or hire a lawyer to do so, and come forward and

4

seek compensation.

5

just like any other AT&T customer, and that is the point

6

at which fairness is assessed.

And so the Concepcions are situated

So from the perspective of California

7
8

unconscionability doctrine, the Concepcions and -- and

9

all the other AT&T customers are not differently

10

situated.

It's not a question of whether the

11

Concepcions, once they have chosen to make a claim,

12

whether the contract is then fair to them; it's whether

13

it's fair to any AT&T customer.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Well, what other

15

area of contract law does the court consider

16

unconscionability not with respect to the parties before

17

the court, but with respect to third parties?
MR. GUPTA:

18

Well, I think, first of all, the

19

California State law is applying an exculpatory clause

20

prohibition that has been on the books since 1872 in

21

California.

22

we've cited in our brief today -­

23

And if you look at the cases, many of which

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But isn't that -­

24

doesn't that look to the parties before the court rather

25

than third parties?
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GUPTA:

No.

In fact, the -- the

2

California courts have developed a test that says, we'll

3

-- we'll enforce exculpatory clauses, or what would

4

otherwise be exculpatory clauses, if they don't have

5

significant public effects.
So the test under that statute is actually

6
7

to look to the public effects, the effects of similarly

8

situated people that are parties to the contract.

9

for example, there was a case in the early 20th century

And

10

under that statute where the question was whether a

11

banking contract was unfair; and what the court said is

12

that -- that parties to the contract are not the only

13

people that matter here; what matters is the interests

14

of the banking public.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

Well, it's a general

16

rule of contract law that contracts contrary to public

17

policy could be unenforceable.

18

quite different than saying we're worried about third

19

parties that are in the same position as these

20

particular parties.

21

adverse public consequences, but it's a different mode

22

of analysis than I'm familiar with under basic contract

23

law.

24
25

It seems to me that's

In other words, it's not simply

MR. GUPTA:

Well, again, I want to try to

explain why I don't think that the Concepcions are -­
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are any different from the -- what Mr. Pincus is

2

describing as third parties.

3

entered into the contract, the question is whether the

4

contract ex ante is unconscionable as to them.

5

they're just like anyone else.

6

they will detect this fraud and be able to come forward.

7

And so the question is -- is that -- is that

8

unconscionable as to them?

9

effects on third parties.

At the time that they

And

They don't know whether

It's not looking only to the

But there is also an exculpatory clause

10
11

prohibition that has always taken into account the

12

effects on the public.

13

Discover Bank.

And both of those are at work in

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

Well, maybe you can explain

15

it this way.

Compare what the Concepcions have

16

available to them under the contract with what going

17

through the arbitration, all the procedures leading up

18

to arbitration and arbitration, against what they would

19

get at best if this were allowed to proceed on a class

20

basis.

21

MR. GUPTA:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23
24
25

Right.

The California -­

Why is -- why are they

better off with a -- with a class adjudication?
MR. GUPTA:

Because from an ex ante

perspective, again when they enter into the contract,
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they have -- there -- it's not reasonable to be -- to

2

expect that they will be among the very few people who

3

will recognize that there's fraud, recognize a legal

4

claim, and come forward.

5

it -- it is not reasonable them -- for them to give up

6

the benefits that they would get from a class action.

And so from that perspective,

A class action incentivizes lawyers and

7
8

others to detect for this fraud.

9

makes it economically justifiable to come forward with

10

It makes it -- it

these kinds of claims.
JUSTICE ALITO:

11

And -- and isn't that what

12

distinguishes this from the ordinary unconscionability

13

analysis?

14

If the district court correctly understood

15

the way the AT&T Mobility scheme works and --and the

16

district court said that under the revised arbitration

17

provision nearly all consumers who purchase the

18

informal -- who pursue, I'm sorry, the informal claims

19

process, are very likely to be compensated promptly and

20

in full, etcetera, etcetera.

21

understood that correctly, the scheme here was -- is

22

found to be unconscionable because it doesn't allow the

23

enlistment of basically private attorneys general to

24

enforce -- to enforce the law.

25

different from ordinary unconscionability analysis?

If the district court

And isn't that quite

5

unreasonably shortened statutes of limitations, where

the California courts for over 100 years have found that

limits on deference to State law, those are the kinds of

standards the Court has used.

If it's not a credible

2

rule of State law, if the State is not really doing what

its saying, and the result is the deprivation of

that there's a limit on deference to State law.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what's your answer to

2

his specific effort to assimilate the issue in this

3

case, which is the class action, to the made-up issue,

4

which you concede is a discrimination?
MR. GUPTA:

5

Right.

I think there are two

6

limiting principles in addition to the discrimination

7

inquiry.

8

then ask, is the rule tantamount to a rule of

9

non-enforceability of arbitration agreements.

Discrimination doesn't get you there.

You can

What about -- what about a

rule that says what you have to have in any contract is

17

a rule that all the rules of the Federal Civil Procedure

18

apply to discovery, not necessarily in a courtroom, but

19

you have to follow exactly those procedures?

20

MR. GUPTA:

I think that would bring into

21

play the second limiting principle, because parties

22

could contract, obviously, to agree to certain

23

procedural rules like that.

24

bring into play a principle of obstacle preemption.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I think that that would

Okay.

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, why isn't this

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obstacle preemption?
MR. GUPTA:

2

Right.

I think one of the

3

purposes -- we agree with Petitioners about this.

4

of the purposes of the Federal Arbitration Act is to

5

allow parties to contract their procedures, to tailor

6

their procedures; and in general the courts ought not to

7

be interfering with those kinds of consensual decisions.
But there are two other important purposes

8
9

One

at play, and no statute pursues its purposes at all

10

costs.

One of those purposes is to ensure that there's

11

not coercion, that you have a consensual agreement; and

12

another, just as important, is to ensure that

13

arbitration merely represents a change of forum, but

14

isn't an exemption from the law.

15

that's at work in the examples that Petitioner concedes.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

So that's -- I think

Mr. Gupta, is -- I'd like

you to focus on Stolt-Nielsen.

arbitration agreement was that you would be in

4

MR. GUPTA:

So why isn't

I think Stolt-Nielsen is

5

properly read as -- the questions there was a question

of contract interpretation.

whether the agreement is valid in the first place,

whether you have a contract.

The question here is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But here you have an

unwilling defendant who doesn't want class arbitration.
MR. GUPTA:

Well, the defendant here has

14

specified in its arbitration agreement that if the

15

class-action ban is invalidated, it would prefer to face

16

any class-wide proceedings in court, and that choice is

17

up to the defendant.

18

class-wide proceedings in arbitration, they could do so

19

under -- under the California rule, or they could elect

20

to do so in court, and they could do so under whatever

21

procedures they specified in the agreement or that were

22

specified in a subsequent agreement between the parties.

23

California law doesn't impose any particular

MR. GUPTA:

7

That's really the

I mean, one could say the same

8

thing about many of the procedural limitations that both

9

parties agree are subject to the unconscionability

10

doctrine.

If a defendant said:

Well, we don't want to

11

face arbitration unless we can ban punitive damages or

12

other important remedies, unless we can insist on

13

certain kinds of discovery limitations that the State

14

courts deem unconscionable because they don't allow the

15

parties to vindicate their rights individually, the same

16

argument would hold true.

to say:

all.

The defendant would be able

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

That's true, as long as

4

those impediments are removed on an -- on an equal

5

footing with all contracts.
MR. GUPTA:

6

That's right.

That's right,

7

Your Honor, and I think -- you know, we concede that if

8

the California courts were discriminating against

9

arbitration agreements, if they were applying one rule

10

to class-action bans or other kinds of procedural

11

limitations in arbitration and another outside of

12

arbitration, that would not fall within the savings

clause.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I take you back to a

15

question that was asked a few minutes ago, because I'm

16

not sure I understood your answer.

17

What is the difference between a State rule

18

that says that the rules of civil procedure must be

19

followed in any adjudication and a rule that says that

20

class adjudication must always be available?

21

MR. GUPTA:

I think in the first instance, I

22

don't think that -- I'm assuming that you're describing

23

a rule that purports to apply general contract law,

24

let's say unconscionability; right?

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, uh-huh.

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GUPTA:

I don't think -- I think it

2

would be hard for a State to credibly claim that the

3

absence of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure

4

systematically exculpate one party from -- from

5

liability.

That just -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

6

No, I just -- I'm not

7

putting this under an unconscionability label.

8

are just general rules, and the question is whether

9

they -- whether they can be applied, whether they

10

constitute discrimination against -- against

11

arbitration.
MR. GUPTA:

12

These

Well, whether or not they

13

constitute discrimination against arbitration, I think

14

your first hypothetical would be preempted, because a

15

State could not credibly be serving the purposes that

16

the savings clause serves in insisting on the Federal

17

Rules of Civil Procedure.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. GUPTA:

Why?

Because -- because I don't think

20

that a credible argument can be made that that

21

systematically serves and functions as an exculpatory

22

clause.

23

There are going to be questions of degree

24

here, but take, for example, discovery.

25

both parties would agree that if an employer said:

I think that

2

for your fact-bound discrimination -­

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but I really would

4

appreciate it if you would answer my hypothetical on one

5

that was posed before.

6

What is the difference -- let me change it

7

slightly -- between a rule that says you must follow the

8

rules of evidence in every adjudication and a rule that

9

says that class adjudication must always be available?

10

I think your answer comes down to the

11

proposition that the former is inconsistent with the

12

idea of arbitration, and therefore, that's why it's not

13

allowed, and the latter is not inconsistent with the

14

idea of arbitration, and therefore, it is allowed.

15

that correct or not?

16

MR. GUPTA:

Is

No, I think -- I think -- I

17

think a better way to analyze that is under the rubric

18

of obstacle preemption, because there are important

19

purposes that are served by the savings clause in

20

invalidating certain procedural procedures that have an

21

exculpatory effect, a substantively unfair effect, but

22

at the same time the act, to be able to function, has to

23

allow parties to contract for -­

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:
the same thing.

Well, okay.

It amounts to

Insisting on compliance with the

obstacle to arbitration, but allowing -- insisting on

the availability of class adjudication is not an

obstacle to arbitration.

But in the end -­

5

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- we have to make a value

7

judgment about whether these things, one thing or the

8

other, fits with arbitration.

9

to.
MR. GUPTA:

10

That's what it comes down

No, I think -- I think that's

11

not right.

12

defer to what the State court says it is doing, and what

13

the State says it is doing -- and there is no reason to

14

doubt this -- is that it is preventing a procedural

15

limitation that systematically favors one party, tilts

16

the playing field to a degree that parties cannot

17

feasibly vindicate their claims through arbitration.

18

I mean, I think in the first instance you

JUSTICE ALITO:

And when it -- when it

19

imposes the rule that the -- the rules of evidence apply

20

across the board, it says it feels that these are

21

necessary in order for parties to be treated fairly in

22

every method of adjudication.

23

MR. GUPTA:

Right.

And, I mean, obviously,

24

the application of the Federal Rules of Evidence don't

25

have a systematic effect that favors one party or the
47

MR. GUPTA:

It's a question of where should

I think you have to look first

at what the State law is trying to do, and the -- the

25

hypotheticals about the insistence on jury trials,
48
Alderson Reporting Company

are required.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is your test a purpose test

or an effects test?

Is it a test that says the State is

doing this in order to kill arbitration, or is it a test

that says the State is doing something that will kill

arbitration?
MR. GUPTA:

10

I think you can look to both.

11

think you would have to look to both.

14

statute or whether it had the effect of destroying

I

But all of these hypotheticals describe

18

rules that don't exist under any State's laws and are

19

unlikely to exist, because they -- they can't -- they

wouldn't really be able to be reconciled with

21

traditional notions of contract law, and then you really

22

would have obvious subterfuge.

23

rule that is not true State law.

24
25

You really would have a

But -- but I think if you look, for example,
at discovery, a State could not insist on plenary
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discovery, full discovery, to the same degree available

2

in courts, but a State can certainly insist on

3

invalidating one-sided discovery limitations.

4

could certainly say to someone who seeks to vindicate a

5

fact-bound employment discrimination claim has to have

6

some opportunity to develop the facts.

7

that -- that is exculpatory.

I think you are right

Justice Kennedy, and I think the difficulty of

ascertaining what is sort of at the essential core of

arbitration means that the -- that the test of what's

tantamount to a rule of non-enforceability is going to

20

be -- it's going to be a very small category.

21

It's going to describe the ouster doctrine,

22

the jury trial waiver of prohibition; and I think that's

23

why you have got to resort to some principle of obstacle

24

preemption to figure out whether the State is -- is

25

legitimately fulfilling the purposes, the important
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

purposes that the savings clause serves, or whether it's

2

just insisting on full-scale procedures for the sake of

it, in ways that have nothing to do with the -- the

substantive rules of liability and ensuring that parties

can adequately vindicate their claims.

is doing that, I think that kind of rule -­

even though I've committed a wrong, that's exculpatory.

But the State here says, you have to not only be liable

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. PINCUS:

8

Although we believe we win under the

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

principle of obstacle preemption that was just being

10

discussed for the reasons that were enunciated in

11

Stolt-Nielsen, we think there is a much easier way for

12

this Court to decide this case.

13

section 2 used the phrase "any contract."

14

clearly did that for a reason, and the reason was it

15

wasn't -- it recognized, as Justice Sotomayor said, that

16

there could be attempts through nondiscriminatory

17

provisions to injure arbitration; and the protection

18

Congress adopted was a prophylactic rule.

19

the State law rule that the State is trying to apply to

20

an arbitration clause applies broadly to a large set of

21

clauses, that's the best protection against

22

discrimination and that's why the "any contract"

23

language is there.

24
25

Congress when it wrote
And it

It said if

And so, in answer to your question, Justice
Sotomayor, about where to look for, for what "any
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contract" means, we think it means very broad; and the

2

Court has said that, and the doctrines that the court

3

has identified as qualifying -- duress, fraud and

4

unconscionability -- are doctrines that apply broadly

5

across the entire range of contract.
But one thing that is very clear, we think,

6
7

is that it can't mean -- "any contract" can't mean any

8

dispute resolution contract, because that is the

9

gerrymandered category that most presents the risk of

10

discrimination.

And if the Court holds that that

11

category is impermissible to justify a rule, it deals

12

with all of the hypotheticals that are being discussed

13

because they are all jury waivers, discovery, evidence;

14

those are all rules that, as the Court has propagated as

15

hypotheticals, are rules that apply to all dispute

16

resolution clauses, and they are focused on dispute

17

resolution clauses.
So we think that disposes of the argument

18
19

that Discover Bank can be applied, simply because it

20

applies to litigation contracts and arbitration

21

contracts.

22

The next question is Respondents' second

23

argument, which is okay, if that is not a reason it

24

falls within the savings clause, it falls within the

25

savings clause because it's simply an application of
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

California's general unconscionability doctrine.

And

2

that is where we turn to the first part of the issues I

3

was discussing in the issues that -- that I was

4

discussing in the first part of the argument with the

5

Court, which is it isn't, because in the three

6

particulars that I listed, it is clearly a totally

7

different legal rule that simply has the

8

unconscionability label on it.

9

And just to drill down on my colleague's

10

discussion that this was really an ex ante analysis.

11

couldn't be an ex ante analysis, because that would have

12

to take into account that the vast majority of claims

13

that anyone will ever have under a contract are

14

nonclassable claims.

15

it's clear that the arbitration process is infinitely

16

better than the court process, because for most small

17

consumer claims there is no real court process.

18

if one were to make an ex ante assessment of the

19

fairness for the parties of the court, it wouldn't just

20

be about classable claims; it would have to include

21

nonclassable claims; and as to those claims it is clear

22

that there is a tremendous benefit to those people from

23

the arbitration clause.

24
25

It

And as to nonclassable claims,

class arbitrations.

To our knowledge all of those class

10

arbitrations were arbitrations that were conducted

11

before this Court's decision in Stolt-Nielsen where a

12

party had a silent agreement and therefore it was held

13

by some lower courts to mean that class arbitration was

14

permissible.
