 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Marketing Association v. Brohl, Executive Director, 

6

Colorado Department of Revenue.

 Mr. Isaacson. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. ISAACSON 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The matter before the Court today concerns 

13

the scope and application of the Tax Injunction Act, a 

14

law passed by Congress in 1937 for the purpose of 

15

preventing State taxpayers from circumventing 

16

Stateestablished and available procedures for 

17

challenging State tax assessments and instead, going 

18

directly to Federal court seeking to invoke the equity 

19

powers of Federal courts to enjoin the assessment and 

20

enforcement of State tax laws. 

21

 The matter before the Court is one of 

22

statutory construction.  In 2010, the State of Colorado 

23

passed legislation that had three components to it.  It 

24

was directed at exclusively outofState retailers and 

25

required those retailers who made sales to Colorado

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

residents and did not collect Colorado use tax to first 

2

provide a transaction notice in connection with each 

3

sale to a Colorado customer informing them of their 

4

obligation to selfreport the use tax to the Colorado 

5

Department of Revenue; and then on an annual basis to 

6

send a mailing to Colorado customers informing them of 

7

all purchases that they made during the past year and, 

8

again, reiterating the requirement that they inform the 

9

Department of Revenue of their tax obligations; and 

10

third, for those outofState retailers affected by the 

11

law, to report to the Colorado Department of Revenue all 

12

of the customer transaction information that occurred 

13

during the past year for each Colorado customer. 

14

 The case has an interesting procedural 

15

history which I think is of relevance both to the Tax 

16

Injunction Act and also to the issue of comity.  The 

17

executive director did not raise the Tax Injunction Act 

18

at the district court level and did not challenge the 

19

jurisdiction of the district court. 

20

 When the district court entered a permanent 

21

injunction enjoining enforcement of the Colorado statute 

22

and it was appealed by the executive director, the 

23

executive director, in her briefing to the Tenth 

24

Circuit, expressly informed the court that the Tax 

25

Injunction Act and comity did not apply and were not a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

bar to the Federal appellate court proceeding to hear 

2

the case. 

3

 When the appeal was made on a petition for 

4

certiorari to this Court, in her brief in opposition to 

5

the petition for certiorari, the executive director 

6

explained that the reason that she did not raise the 

7

jurisdictional issue below was because she favored 

8

having an expedited hearing on this matter so that 

9

the 

10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it often happens. 

It's a jurisdictional issue.  So what's the point? 

12

 MR. ISAACSON: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well 
I mean, the fact that she 

14

didn't raise it is irrelevant.  In fact, even  even if 

15

she didn't raise it here, we would have to raise it 

16

here, wouldn't we? 

17

 MR. ISAACSON: 

I believe that certainly for 

18

purposes of comity, Your Honor, the decision on the part 

19

of the government to seek the resolution of the matter 

20

in  in a court is  constitutes effectively a waiver 

21

of  of the comity question. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, the comity, okay.  And 

23

you  you agree it has nothing to do with the  with 

24

the principal question? 

25

 MR. ISAACSON: 

No.  I believe that under the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

Tax Injunction Act, if the State affirmatively seeks the 

2

relief from the Court, that it  it can  it can 

3

proceed.  And in  in this case, I think that it's 

4

especially 

5
6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

the  would the State be seeking the relief? 

7

 MR. ISAACSON: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

Excuse  if the  if 

Yes.  In this case 
The State would be seeking 

to enjoin its own tax? 

10

 MR. ISAACSON: 

What  what the State 

11

State sought was a summary judgment.  They affirmatively 

12

moved for summary judgment at the district court level. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, but that  that just 

14

means the district court should throw it out.  I mean, 

15

I 

16

 MR. ISAACSON: 

But that wasn't the request 

17

on summary judgment.  The summary judgement was a 

18

request for the court to address the merits of the case, 

19

not to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Actually, you have 

21

raised the very question I started with, which is the 

22

waiver question.  Is it your position that the T  that 

23

the TIA is a waivable protection?  Is that what you're 

24

arguing? 

25

 MR. ISAACSON: 

I think  I think the issue

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

may not be expressly one of waiver, but may be one of 

2

consent to agreeing to

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Either way consent or 

4

it probably is consent.  If it is consensual, what 

5

you're suggesting is that the reason for the TIA is not 

6

jurisdictional in its traditional sense, but one based 

7

on comity that can be  that can be consented to. 

8
9

 MR. ISAACSON: 

That's correct.  And I 

believe, Justice Sotomayor, that the Court has made 

10

clear, including in the  in the Fair Assessment case, 

11

Fair Assessment v. McNary, that the Tax Injunction Act 

12

is really a codified subset of the law of comity.  So 

13

that the TIA did not supplant or replace comity, but 

14

instead codified a certain element of comity. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But the statute's addressed 

16

to the courts.  And the statute says the courts will not 

17

enjoin State  State taxes.  Now, how  how can that 

18

mandate to the court be altered by  by private 

19

parties? 

20

 MR. ISAACSON: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well 
It seems to me it says that 

22

we just don't have the power, period.  But you say the 

23

States can give us the power? 

24

 MR. ISAACSON: 

25

 But in addition to that, Justice Scalia, I

I believe they can. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

think what is significant about the fact that the 

2

executive director took the position both before the 

3

appellate court and before this Court in the opposition 

4

to the petition for certiorari of saying that this 

5

Court  that the reason why they decided to proceed was 

6

they wanted an expedited hearing. 

7

 What I think it is remarkably reflective of 

8

is the opinion or the view of the executive director 

9

that the Tax Injunction Act does not apply to this 

10
11

situation. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that's  that's 

12

fine.  I  I can understand that.  You say they used to 

13

think that it didn't apply, now they're saying it 

14

applies.  I agree, that's a good argument. 

15

 But you're arguing much beyond that. 

You're 

16

arguing that it doesn't matter any more because they 

17

once said that they wanted the Court to decide it, even 

18

though the Court had no power to decide it, right?  I 

19

mean, that's a different argument.  It's that one that I 

20

criticize.  If you want to say the State's argument 

21

seems weaker because they've changed their mind, that's 

22

fair enough. 

23

 MR. ISAACSON: 

Well, I  I think the 

24

State's argument is weaker not merely because they 

25

changed their mind, but because I think they made a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

studied decision that the Tax Injunction Act, by its 

2

terms, and what the Court is presented with is an issue 

3

of statutory construction as construed by the executive 

4

director to the point of informing both the appellate 

5

court and  and this Court that the Tax Injunction Act 

6

was not a jurisdictional bar.  I think that that was 

7

reflective of the fact that  that the position of the 

8

State, especially in the absence of any precedent 

9

supporting the very broad position that the Tenth 

10
11

Circuit assumed on its own, that 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Isaacson, can we get 

12

to the nub of this question?  We have your petition, the 

13

fact it is a restriction on the Court's jurisdiction. 

14

 But you recognize that the TIA does cover 

15

regulations that require an employer to report an 

16

employer's  an employee's taxable income.  That's a 

17

straight reporting requirement, and you recognize that 

18

that's covered by the TIA.  So this is another 

19

information reporting that will enable or facilitate the 

20

State's collection of its tax.  So what's the 

21

difference?  Why  why is it that the one comes under 

22

the TIA and not the other? 

23

 MR. ISAACSON: 

So I believe, Justice 

24

Ginsburg, those cases that you're referring to, like the 

25

Blangeres case and the Sipe's case, are situations in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

which it was the taxpayer that was seeking to prevent 

2

that informationreporting from taking place.  And it is 

3

clear that in those cases it was doing so for the 

4

purposes of anticipating a tax assessment, and 

5

attempting to prevent the issuance of that  that 

6

assessment by depriving the director of  of necessary 

7

information. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But suppose it weren't the 

taxpayer.  I mean, suppose a State has a form that's 

10

equivalent to the Federal W2, requiring employers to 

11

say how much wages have been paid.  And suppose the 

12

employer itself challenges the use of that form, what do 

13

you think the result is in that case? 

14

 MR. ISAACSON: 

In that case, I believe that 

15

the Tax Injunction Act would bar  the Tax Injunction 

16

Act would not bar Federal court jurisdiction.  I think 

17

that that would be the classic situation that was 

18

described by the Court in Levin v. Commerce Energy 

19

where 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so you say the words 

21

"assessment" and "levy" in the statute apply only to 

22

taxpayers. 

23

 MR. ISAACSON: 

No.  There are situations in 

24

which there may be proxies that are acting on behalf of 

25

the taxpayer so that you could have a situation, for 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

for example, where you have a successor in interest to a 

2

taxpayer that may be bringing the claim.  But in all of 

3

those situations, they are ones in which  and this is 

4

the case law regarding the Tax Injunction Act  that 

5

they are all situations in which the taxpayer or the 

6

person acting on behalf of the taxpayer is bringing an 

7

action 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm sorry. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

My very point.  So what? 

11

 Go ahead. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But 

The question is whether the 

13

word "collection" includes an injunction that makes it 

14

more difficult for the State to collect the tax.  And in 

15

the case that Justice Ginsburg brought up, the 

16

injunction, because it would stop the  the employer 

17

from telling the State how much has been earned, would 

18

make it more difficult to collect the tax. 

19

 In this case, the injunction, by stopping 

20

sellers from telling the State how much the Colorado 

21

citizen has bought, would make it more difficult for 

22

them to collect the tax.  So if collection includes in 

23

the one case an injunction that makes it more difficult 

24

to collect an income tax, why doesn't it in this case 

25

include an injunction that makes it more difficult to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

collect a use tax?  The point was they are identical 

2

conceptually. 

3

 Now, I don't care whether it's  who 

4

who brings the suit.  In terms of the word "collection," 

5

they seem identical.  Now, what is your response to that 

6

question, which is what I think was being asked? 

7

 MR. ISAACSON: 

So, Justice Breyer, I think 

8

you have to read the word "injunction," which is the 

9

first set of operative words 

10
11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It doesn't say anywhere 

"injunction." 

12

 MR. ISAACSON: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Enjoin. 
What the word is, "enjoin," 

14

"suspend" or "restrain."  And I get  I'm totally with 

15

you on those, but what you are enjoining, suspend  you 

16

are enjoining something.  There is an injunction that 

17

says the State cannot enforce its provision requiring 

18

outofState sellers to report what Colorado customers 

19

buy.  I don't see how you can deny that's an injunction. 

20

I think you could deny that it enjoins the collection of 

21

a tax.  But to do that, you will have to go right back 

22

to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked, and tell me 

23

how to distinguish the two cases she mentioned.  This 

24

one and the case where it's reporting income by an 

25

inState citizen.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

 MR. ISAACSON: 

So the words "enjoin" and 

2

"suspend" operate on the words "assessment," "levy" and 

3

"collection." 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MR. ISAACSON: 

Yes. 
And as this Court ruled in 

6

the  in the Hibbs case, in which even though the Court 

7

was divided on the issue of the meaning of the term 

8

"assessment," which was the key issue in  in that 

9

case, that the assessment is the recording of liability. 

10

 And this Court also ruled in  in  in the 

11

Hibbs case that assessment triggers collection.  So in 

12

the Tax Injunction Act, the word "collection" is 

13

referring to actions of government officials following 

14

the assessment of the tax.  And the injunction that 

15

that Your Honor is referring to is one which is relating 

16

to the actions of third parties, private parties, not 

17

government officials. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So your point is that if, 

19

in fact, there is in Colorado a law somewhat like 

20

Federal law that says all employers must report to the 

21

State the wages that in this Boulder area, or Denver, we 

22

pay our employees and someone tries to enjoin that law 

23

in Federal court, you are saying they can do it.  Right? 

24

It doesn't matter whether it's use, out of the State or 

25

employment within the State, and we simply have to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1
2

accept that consequence because of Hibbs. 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

Well, in the W2 concept, 

3

what Justice Kagan was referring to, there's a tax 

4

liability responsibility that the employer themselves 

5

have, so that I think that a court might well conclude 

6

that because of the obligation 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8

 MR. ISAACSON: 

9

1099s. 
In that situation, I think if 

it's a third party, that third party is an outsider as 

10

this Court defined outsider, an individual whose own tax 

11

liability is not of relevance.  And I think in the 

12

context of the Tax Injunction Act, it's been 

13

consistently been interpreted that  that way, that all 

14

of the cases that have been cited by the executive 

15

director, whether those cases address specifically the 

16

tax assessment or some liability, are all cases that 

17

were brought by a taxpayer and the issue related to what 

18

that taxpayer's liabilities 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What about the Alexander v. 

20

Americans United case under the AntiInjunction Act? 

21

That was not  that was a thirdparty suit, wasn't it? 

22

An organization was  wanted  wanted a determination 

23

that contributions would be tax deductible. 

24
25

 MR. ISAACSON: 

Right.  I think in Americans 

United, the  the plaintiff in that case was, one,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

determining its own 50(c) status and so it was 

2

interested in what its own status was.  But I think 

3

in  in addition to that, you had a  an underlying 

4

tax statute that was at issue.  The issue concerned the 

5

question of eligibility for taxexempt status. 

6

 What I think is significant in this case is 

7

not only the fact that you have an obligation that is 

8

not borne by taxpayers but is imposed exclusively on 

9

nontaxpayers, but it also is not a tax statute.  It's a 

10
11

statute that's 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But where  where do you 

12

get, Mr. Isaacson, this idea that the  the plaintiff 

13

has to be the taxpayer?  Because certainly the text of 

14

the statute does not say that.  The text of the statute 

15

speaks to what kinds of remedies a court can give.  It 

16

does not speak to what kind of plaintiffs have to bring 

17

the lawsuit. 

18

 MR. ISAACSON: 

I think the discussion of the 

19

Tax Injunction Act in the Levin case, Levin v. Commerce 

20

Energy, where a group is identified as outsiders, 

21

individuals or entities whose own tax liability is not 

22

of relevance to the  to the case, is the source of 

23

of that authority. 

24
25

 And in this case, that's exactly the 
situation that you have, that we're not talking about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

the tax liability of outofState retailers.  Their tax 

2

liability is irrelevant.  Furthermore, those 

3

outofState retailers are not challenging anyone's tax 

4

liability, which I think is also a distinction from the 

5

American United's case where they were  they were 

6

concerned about the tax liabilities of contributors to 

7

their organization. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I don't  what I 

don't understand about your statutory argument, I mean, 

10

it seems a kind of natural thing for somebody to say 

11

suppose it's like we're going to all have pizza tonight, 

12

and we're going to take up a collection to buy the 

13

pizza.  And I assign one of my clerks, go collect the 

14

money for the pizza. 

15

 So what that clerk is going to do is he's 

16

going to figure out who it is that's going to owe the 

17

money, right?  Who's going to partake of the pizza, so 

18

who owes the money.  And then, you know, maybe he's 

19

going to send an email to those people and he's going 

20

to say you owe this money for pizza.  And then if no 

21

if somebody doesn't pay, he's going to identify the 

22

delinquent and  and say, really, you owe this money 

23

for pizza. 

24
25

 So that's all part of the collection 
process, isn't it?  I mean, basically, identifying 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

informing the  the people who have to pay, informing 

2

the people who have to pay and identifying the people 

3

who don't pay, and  and the amounts that they owe. 

4

 MR. ISAACSON: 

I think two responses, 

5

Justice Kagan.  One, the terms "collection," 

6

"assessment," "levy," and "collection" are terms of art 

7

that have particular relevance in tax parlance, just as 

8

the terms "enjoin," "suspend" have particular relevance 

9

in regard to the Court's equity powers. 

10

 So in this situation, what collection is 

11

referring to, and it's consistent with how the Internal 

12

Revenue Code treats the term "collection," it's the 

13

action that is taken by tax authorities, by government 

14

officials, after a determination of tax liability has 

15

been made, after notice has been given to the taxpayer 

16

of their obligation, and it's the efforts of the 

17

government to then recover the amount of money which is 

18

owed. 

19

 The fact that there may be information which 

20

is of use, of relevance that may precede the collection 

21

activity of the government doesn't convert those 

22

preliminary activities into collection itself.  So I 

23

think what  what is  is really critical on this 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you're saying that 

collection is only as the money changes hands, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1
2

that's the only thing that constitutes collection? 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

No.  What I'm saying is that 

3

collection follows assessment, and after the assessment 

4

has occurred, it is the activities of government 

5

officials in order to recover money from taxpayers. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So  so you're 

7

saying it's just like garnishment or things like that? 

8

It has to be focused on a specific amount that's already 

9

been calculated and the taxpayer has not turned over? 

10

 MR. ISAACSON: 

It  it certainly goes far 

11

beyond garnishment and would include any activities on 

12

the part of government officials once the taxpayer's 

13

liability has been determined. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you've got to 

15

know that he or she owes $1,482 because they've done the 

16

calculations and they haven't paid that over. 

17

 MR. ISAACSON: 

Yes.  As  as this Court 

18

decided in the  in the Hibbs case, the decision 

19

written by Justice Ginsburg, it's assessment that 

20

triggers collection, so that they  they fall in 

21

sequence to each other. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I'm not sure what 

23

what you have conceded.  Do you acknowledge that if 

24

there were a State law which required inState sellers 

25

not to collect the tax, but just to advise the  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

State revenue service that someone has purchased an item 

2

on which tax is due, would you acknowledge that that 

3

could be enjoined?  That someone could bring a suit 

4

saying, I'm not the taxpayer, this is not the assessment 

5

or collection of a tax, and therefore you  a suit will 

6

lie for me to say that this is an unconstitutional 

7

assessment or imposition upon me.  Would that suit lie 

8

or not? 

9

 MR. ISAACSON: 

Well, I'm not sure what the 

10

basis, the underlying basis for Federal jurisdiction 

11

would be in  in the hypothetical that  that you 

12

have 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it's  it's a 

Federal constitutional violation. 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

I think if it's a Federal 

16

constitutional violation, the Tax Injunction Act would 

17

not be a bar to it.  Now, I think in that situation, you 

18

may have comity concerns that are significantly 

19

different than the potential comity concerns in  in 

20

this circumstance. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So the only thing that 

22

would make the States able to do  to get information 

23

about tax liability without being sued in Federal court 

24

is the fact that the person from whom the information is 

25

sought is liable for the tax, if the seller has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1
2

retain the sales tax. 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

Well, as I  as I pointed 

3

out, there may be circumstances in which you have a 

4

third party that is effectively acting in regard to a 

5

taxpayer's liability.  So I think you have  you have 

6

two convergences, Justice Scalia, that I think are 

7

important to the resolution of this case. 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know what you mean 

by a third party acting in regard to 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

It could be a successor in 

interest, for example. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 MR. ISAACSON: 

Oh, of course. 
But I think you have two 

14

convergences here that would  would not necessarily be 

15

present in the hypothetical that you present.  One is 

16

you have a nontaxpayer that  that is one of the 

17

elements of it.  But also, that that nontaxpayer is not 

18

disputing anyone's liability.  So, you know, I think one 

19

of the issues that was present in  in the Hibbs v. 

20

Winn case, and I think it was part of the concern that 

21

Justice Kennedy had in his dissent in that case, is that 

22

you were still having a socalled outsider that was 

23

interested in the tax liability of another party. 

24
25

 In the current case, the issue of tax 
liability of the customers of the outofState retailers

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

is not being contested.  The  the outofState 

2

retailers normally are not disputing any issue relating 

3

to their own tax liability  there is none  but they 

4

are also not claiming that their customers are not 

5

subject to use tax.  They are not challenge 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But the  the State's not 

7

interested in just liability.  It's interested in 

8

collecting, and the statute talks about collection. 

9
10
11
12

 MR. ISAACSON: 

Absolutely.  And 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So it seems to me that 

that  that's just not responsive to the issue. 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

No, I  I agree with you, 

13

Justice Kennedy, that the  in this case the Direct 

14

Marketing Association members are not challenging the 

15

authority of the State to pursue collection of tax 

16

revenues from customers.  They're not contesting 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

We're talking not about 

18

what you're challenging, we're talking about what the 

19

State's interest is. 

20

 MR. ISAACSON: 

The fact that the State has 

21

an interest in this information and much of the briefing 

22

that the State has presented emphasizes the importance 

23

of this  of this information to  to their tax 

24

system.  But the fact that 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But it's importance for a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

 reason.  It's importance to enable them to collect. 

2

 Essentially the State is saying we're not going to be 

3

 able to collect this tax unless we do these things, 

4

 unless we tell people that they, in fact, owe the tax 

5

 and unless we have a mechanism to make sure that people 

6

 who don't pay the tax are identified.  And that's what 

7

 all these forms are all about.  It's about collecting a 

8

 tax that most people do not pay. 

9

 MR. ISAACSON: 

I'm not sure that the State 

10

 is saying they're not able to collect the tax absent 

11

 this information.  In fact, the anticipated revenue on 

12

 the revenue note that went with this was twelve and a half million 

13

dollars, it was less than 2/10ths of 1 percent of the 

14

 total State  State revenues. 

15

 But assuming for the moment that the State 

16

 does believe that this is important information, 

17

 valuable information, that doesn't mean that it fits 

18

 within the language of what was excluded by the Tax 

19

 Injunction Act from Federal court jurisdiction. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But wouldn't you agree that 

21

 in any case in which a  a government goes about 

22

 collecting the tax it has to say how are we going to 

23

 collect this tax.  And this is just this State's answer 

24

 to the how are we going to collect this tax.  Well, what 

25

 we're going to do is that we're going to inform people

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

 that they owe the tax and then we're going to get 

2

 information that enables us to make sure that the 

3

 delinquents pay up.  That's how we're going to collect 

4

 it. 

5

 MR. ISAACSON: 

I believe the  I believe 

6

 the issue that the Court is confronted with is in the 

7

 construction of this statute in regard to what the 

8

 meaning of the word "collection" means in the context of 

9

 being associated with assessment, levy, and collection. 

10

 What is the act of collection?  Not what is the interest 

11

 of the State in being able to pursue collection, but 

12

 what is the act of collection that is enjoined.  And I 

13

 think that is what is determinative of whether there's 

14

 a  a Federal forum to be able to address that issue. 

15

 If there are no further questions, 

16

 Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the remainder of 

17

 my time. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19

 Mr. Domenico.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL D. DOMENICO 
 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court: 

24

 Justice Kagan, this injunction has deprived 

25

 Colorado of the tool provided by the State legislature

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

 under State law for the assessment and collection of 

2

 these taxes. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Am I correct that Colorado 

4

 is the only State that seeks to do this with respect to 

5

 outofState sellers? 

6
7
8
9

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Colorado is the only State 

 with this precise combination 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That  that's amazing.  If 

 indeed this is a, you know, a proper operation, why 

10

 wouldn't all 50  in my experience, you know, if it 

11

 moves, you tax it.  And I 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I cannot imagine that the 

14

 other States have not piled on with this thing if it 

15

 is  if it is so essential to the tax system and if 

16

 there are no problems with  with doing it.  My 

17

 goodness. 

18

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, of course, the question 

19

 on the merits is whether there are, in fact, problems 

20

 with it. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

 MR. DOMENICO: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  I understand. 
And 
But the fact that it's 

24

 it's a one of a kind gives me some pause.  This is 

25

 certainly a  a very important case because I have no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

 doubt that if we come out agreeing with you, every one 

2

 of the States is going to pass laws like this. 

3
4
5
6
7

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, I would agree with 

 that. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And all sellers will also 

 have to be providing this information. 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

Certainly, I think if we 

8

 ultimately prevail on the merits, that's true.  The 

9

 question is whether that challenge on the merits goes 

10
11

 through Federal or State courts. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let's assume I am a not 

12

 notforprofit  an unpopular notforprofit 

13

 corporation that has members who don't  who don't want 

14

 their identity known because hurtful things will be done 

15

 to them.  And I make a sale which would  would be 

16

 exempt from Colorado's laws if indeed it was made by a 

17

 notforprofit organization to one of its members.  And 

18

 Colorado demands from this organization the names of its 

19

 members.  And you tell me that cannot get into  I'm 

20

 claiming a First Amendment objection to turning over the 

21

 names of my members, and you tell me that cannot get 

22

 into Federal court. 

23

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Justice Scalia, I'm telling 

24

 you that cannot get into Federal court.  That is a 

25

 part  a central part of the State's tax system, it may

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1
2
3

 very well be unconstitutional on the merits. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It can't be that central if 

 no other State has it. 

4

 MR. DOMENICO: 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

6

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Justice 
How central can it be? 
Well, Justice Scalia, the use 

7

 tax is obviously a large and growing portion of  of 

8

 the tax base that States should be able to collect.  And 

9

 Colorado has been unable, except in per  in a 

10

 minuscule percentage, 0 to 5 percent are the estimates, 

11

 of who actually pays this tax, are paying it. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm  I'm a little bit 

13

 confused.  In the normal tax situation, meaning my 

14

 employer, the U.S. Courts, removes taxes from whatever 

15

 area I declare is  is my residency. 

16

 MR. DOMENICO: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's right. 
All right.  Is my 

18

 employer required to send that information to the State 

19

 government?  I don't think it is.  I think I'm required 

20

 to send my W2. 

21

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, it comes indirectly, 

22

 that the States typically get that information from the 

23

 IRS.  So it is an obligation.  It's just sort of, I 

24

 think, indirect.  So we do 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So there is no  okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1
2
3

 Is  that's what I thought. 
 Now, the  some employers have to withhold 
 taxes 

4

 MR. DOMENICO: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

6

 MR. DOMENICO: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right. 
And so that's because of 

 jurisdictional powers. 

10

 MR. DOMENICO: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 for certain entities 

 in which they're resident or working. 

7

9

Correct. 

That's right. 
The State can control 

 someone who is within their jurisdiction. 

13

 MR. DOMENICO: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right. 
So that makes sense to 

15

 me.  What doesn't is how can we apply the TIA to an 

16

 entity that has no direct responsibility to you? 

17

 When  and you have no jurisdictional control over 

18

 them.  I mean, there is a presumption in the TIA that 

19

 collection, assessment, et cetera, is going to be 

20

 against an entity that owes you something. 

21

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, the  I don't think 

22

 that the TIA says that.  The TIA talks first about 

23

 enjoining, restraining or suspending.  Then it talks 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How are  how are they 

 enjoined?  You can collect everything you want against

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

 your taxpayer over you have  over your having 

2

 jurisdiction.  So how are we restraining you from 

3

 we're not giving you information, but this injunction is 

4

 not stopping you from collecting that tax. 

5

 MR. DOMENICO: 

It is stopping us from using 

6

 the tool  the means provided under Colorado law for 

7

 assessing and collecting that tax.  There may  I'm 

8

 sorry.  Go ahead. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let's  let's assume a 

10

 State law that gives the State taxing authority a lot of 

11

 money for new computers, and somebody challenges that 

12

 law on some State ground, whatever it is.  Would that 

13

 challenge  on some Federal ground.  Would that 

14

 challenge not be able to be brought in Federal court 

15

 because the computers are going to help the tax service 

16

 to get more delinquent taxpayers and, therefore, you are 

17

 restraining the collection of taxes? 

18

 MR. DOMENICO: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. DOMENICO: 

I don't think so, Your Honor. 
Why not? 
The circuit courts have 

21

 have addressed these types of questions much more often 

22

 than this Court have, and they've uniformly  at least 

23

 eight of them that have addressed that kind of question 

24

 have drawn essentially the same line.  It's the one 

25

 expressed in cases like Kemlon and Judicial Watch, and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

 the question they ask is, is the action you're 

2

 attacking, is the purpose of that action, the State 

3

 action, is the purpose  is it intended to culminate in 

4

 assessment or collection of taxes and is the likely 

5

 effect to culminate 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That isn't a very narrowing 

7

 thing.  I mean, Henry Friendly, some years ago, said of 

8

 course you can use the term collection to refer to any 

9

 method of helping to secure payment.  But Congress was 

10

 referring to methods similar to assessing and levy that 

11

 would produce money or other property directly rather 

12

 than indirectly.  The reason being, once we start down 

13

 your road, there is no stopping place. 

14

 MR. DOMENICO: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't think 
GDP consists of about 

16

 $16 trillion.  It's very hard to think of even one of 

17

 those trillion dollars that you couldn't figure out 

18

 passed through somebody's hands who owed a tax and then 

19

 later went into somebody else's hands and it would help 

20

 the State or the Federal government to know from that 

21

 second or third person how it got the money from the 

22

 first person's hands.  That's true of houses.  It's true 

23

 of food.  It's true of  in States that tax food.  It's 

24

 true of this desk.  It's true of everything you can 

25

 think of.  And therefore, there will be  I mean, ruled

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

 out, unless you are going to start line drawing, and I 

2

 don't know what lines to draw. 

3

 Therefore, said Henry Friendly, let's not. 

4

 Let us read collection to mean what it means in context, 

5

 namely what Hibbs suggests the three phrases mean.  Read 

6

 them together.  That, I think, is the strongest argument 

7

 against you and, therefore, I would like to hear your 

8

 response. 

9

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Justice Breyer, I agree with 

10

 you, that's the strongest argument against us.  This 

11

 injunction makes it impossible for Colorado, under the 

12

 State law that the legislature has enacted, to do any 

13

 form of assessment, any form of collection on hundreds 

14

 of

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Really, you can't ask your 

16

 citizens the same way that the Federal government asks 

17

 us?  "Pay," that's their polite way of saying it.  And 

18

 by the way, if you fill out your form incorrectly, 

19

 depending upon your state of mind, you may discover you 

20

 are in prison. 

21

 Now, that seems to be a notperfect way of 

22

 doing it, but it does tend to encourage people to pay 

23

 the taxes that they believe they owe. 

24
25

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Justice Breyer, indirectly, 

 at least, Colorado makes the same statement to its

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

 citizens about this tax, but it can't determine who owes 

2

 the tax and it can't determine how much they owe, and 

3

 it therefore 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

MR. DOMENICO: 

6

JUSTICE BREYER: 

7

That would be nice. 

This is the west.  I 


 understand.  I don't  I'm from the west. 

8

(Laughter.) 

9

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

If they tell you the truth. 


Can it make the  the 

 foreign seller collect the tax? 

11

 MR. DOMENICO: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Not under Quill. 
Well, that is sort of 

13

 strange.  It can't make them collect it, but it  it 

14

 has the power to compel them, non  nonState citizens, 

15

 outofState people, provide the information, assist in 

16

 the State's collection of the tax?  I don't know why 

17

 MR. DOMENICO: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 and not the other. 

20

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, this is exactly 
I don't know why the one 

This is exactly their 

21

 argument on the merits.  But that is exactly why this 

22

 violates the Tax Injunction Act  because 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

Couldn't we 
Can I ask a question about 

 where your argument might lead?  I think you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

 acknowledged earlier that if we hold that your statute 

2

 cannot be challenged under the Tax Injunction Act and 

3

 it's ultimately determined to be constitutional, this 

4

 would be very attractive for all the other States to 

5

 copy. 

6

 So let's  let's suppose that that happens 

7

 and so now every State has a law like this, and every 

8

 State  and there are many different variations in the 

9

 forms.  Maybe there are 50 forms that have to be 

10

 submitted to State tax authorities.  And let's say I 

11

 start up a small business and I'm selling a few thousand 

12

 dollars worth of goods via the internet to people from 

13

 all over the country. 

14

 Now I will have to submit potentially 50 

15

 different forms to all of these States reporting that 

16

 somebody in South Carolina purchased something from me 

17

 that cost 23.99.  Now, I know you have a  you have a 

18

 requirement that it has to reach a certain threshold, 

19

 but I don't see it and that's just something that you've 

20

 chosen to do.  But that's where this all could lead, 

21

 couldn't it? 

22

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Justice Alito, that is where 

23

 this could lead and that's a slightly more detailed 

24

 version of their argument on the merits.  But the point 

25

 of the Tax Injunction Act, of course, is that that's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

 challenge that has to be brought in State court.  For 

2

 example, Quill itself, the case that, kind of, the 

3

 merits turn on, was a State court case that proceeded 

4

 through, I believe, North Dakota's States.  This Court, 

5

 to the extent it believes that's a constitutional 

6

 problem that you just identified, would have the right 

7

 to  would  would have the power to hold it to be an 

8

 unconstitutional violation.  In fact, it's worth noting 

9

 that the Plaintiffs have availed themselves of Colorado 

10

 courts to make just this challenge and already have an 

11

 injunction for those, based on 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But you know that we accept 

13

 minuscule, minuscule percentage of appeals from State 

14

 supreme courts.  And as a practical matter, these 

15

 challenges in State supreme courts, if they're  if 

16

 they're ruled in a manner that  that violates Federal 

17

 law, they're not going to come up here  90 percent of 

18

 them aren't going to come up  more than 90 percent. 

19

 So it is important that it begin in Federal court 

20

 when  especially when what is at issue is the selfish 

21

 State's assessment and collection of taxes.  I mean, 

22

 there is a real incentive on the part of the State 

23

 government which includes the State courts to, you know, 

24

 to find the tax not paid. 

25

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Justice Scalia, that's an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

 argument that Congress has rejected in enacting the Tax 

2

 Injunction Act. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MR. DOMENICO: 

5
6

Well, for collection, yes. 
Assessment and collection of 

 the tax. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Domenico, you don't 

7

 dispute that what Congress had in mind when it passed 

8

 the Tax Injunction Act was the proposition that States 

9

 that have a system, taxpayer, you pay now, you sue for a 

10

 refund later.  It was that scheme that the Tax 

11

 Injunction Act was meant to shield so the taxpayer 

12

 couldn't say I'd rather pay later. 

13

 You pay up front, and then you sue for a 

14

 refund.  That's  that was what was in the front of 

15

 Congress's mind.  You don't doubt that, do you? 

16

 MR. DOMENICO: 

That was the Paradigm case, I 

17

 think, is an accurate way to describe that.  That's 

18

 most  going to be the most common form of a case that 

19

 would raise these issues.  But what Congress wrote was a 

20

 statute that by its terms is broader than that. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Congress wrote a 

22

 statute with terms that seem most naturally read to have 

23

 a technical meaning, restrain, suspend, enjoin, assess, 

24

 levy, and collect.  Those are not  those are not the 

25

 terms that one might use if one were speaking

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1
2

 colloquially. 
 Let me come back to Justice Kagan's pizza 

3

 example.  So her clerks are collecting money for pizza 

4

 to be had at night and let's say the Chief Justice says 

5

 this is fine, but you  you may not use court email to 

6

 try to collect this.  Now, would you say that the Chief 

7

 Justice has restrained, suspended or enjoined the 

8

 collection of the pizza money?  You might say he's made 

9

 it a little bit harder, maybe he's interfered with it. 

10

 But would  would anybody naturally use those technical 

11

 terms. 

12

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, in the pizza context, I 

13

 think it would be unlikely to use those technical terms. 

14

 But I think in  in the tax context, if someone told 

15

 the Department of Revenue you may not assess or collect 

16

 these taxes, I would be very nervous about advising them 

17

 nonetheless to proceed with enforcing these laws. 

18

 Because by their natural terms the way they're used, 

19

 this is part of the assessment process.  This is a means 

20

  its only purpose as everybody agreed, the district 

21

 court, the Plaintiffs, everyone agreed the sole purpose 

22

 of this law was to  to reach the point where we could 

23

 assess and collect the taxes. 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let's say we're back 

 in  we're in the preinternet era and I order

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

 something over the phone from an outofState vendor. 

2

 So this vendor is going to mail it to me across State 

3

 lines.  And let's say this particular vendor is somebody 

4

 who feels very strongly that everybody ought to pay 

5

 taxes that are due.  So this vendor voluntarily, once my 

6

 order has been placed, says to me, now, I'm going to 

7

 ship this to you in your State and I'm not going to 

8

 charge you  say I'm not going to make you pay sales 

9

 tax in my State.  I just want to remind you that you are 

10

 obligated under the law of your State to pay use tax. 

11

 Would you say that that vendor has assessed the use tax? 

12
13

 MR. DOMENICO: 

 simply by informing them that they have to pay the tax? 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15

 MR. DOMENICO: 

16
17
18

The vendor has assessed it 

Yes.  Yes.  Yes. 
I wouldn't say they've 

 assessed the tax, no. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's  that's what 

 you're arguing here, isn't it? 

19

 MR. DOMENICO: 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

21

 MR. DOMENICO: 

I don't think so. 
That's exactly what happens. 
The State's law is the means 

22

 by which it can assess the tax.  If it doesn't get that 

23

  I would say this:  If the vendor said do not pay this 

24

 tax, do not tell Colorado, they're the opposite version, 

25

 they're someone who objects to the tax, and they said

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

 precisely the opposite, then I would say that they have 

2

 interfered with  they have restrained, suspended the 

3

 assessment and collection of that tax.  And that's 

4

 what's going on here. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You would say that by saying 

6

 that, making that illegal statement, they've enjoined 

7

 the  the payment of the tax? 

8
9

 MR. DOMENICO: 

No, I wouldn't say it.  But 

 I'd say they have restrained 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

They have restrained it? 

11

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Yes.  But individuals don't 

12

 have  obviously, the company doesn't have the power of 

13

 an injunction. 

14

JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

MR. DOMENICO: 

16
17

Restrain means impede? 
Well, what the Court has 

 said 
JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Isn't restrained a synonym 

18

 for impede?  I  I thought restrain means to stop.  You 

19

 restrain somebody, you prevent that person from doing 

20

 what he wants to do.  But you're using it to mean, you 

21

 know, whatever impedes the collection of the tax.  It 

22

 doesn't make it impossible, it doesn't stop it.  It 

23

 just  it just impedes it. 

24
25

 MR. DOMENICO: 

The Court has used the words 

 interrupt the assessment or collection of the tax to 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 the practical effect of suspending it during the 

2

 litigation.  I don't think there can be any doubt about 

3

 that. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, so let's say 

5

 the law says not only do you have to notify the people 

6

 at the point of sale on the internet, but it must be in 

7

 inchhigh type so they're sure to see it.  Is that okay? 

8

 Because that makes it  impedes the collection. 

9

 Because where, presumably, they can't just put it in the 

10
11

 tiniest little type at the bottom of the page. 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

If the challenge is only to 

12

 the size of the font requirement? 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I mean, you 

14

 you can make light of it if you like, but they're more 

15

 likely to notice it if it's there glaring them in the 

16

 face as opposed to a little footnote at the bottom along 

17

 with the all the other 

18

 MR. DOMENICO: 

19
20
21
22

Well  and there are 

 regulations of that sort with this law and that's 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And that restrains 

 the collection of the tax? 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

If you don't  it restrains 

23

 the means of assessment and collection of the tax under 

24

 State law.  This Court has referred repeatedly to the 

25

 means, the methods, the modes, the system of assessment

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

 and collection dating back before the existence of the 

2

 Tax Injunction Act.  The Court referred to the modes, it 

3

 was of the utmost importance, the Court said in Dow v. 

4

 Chicago that this  that Federal courts would be 

5

 restrained from interfering with the modes of collection 

6

 of a tax.  That would restrain the mode under State law, 

7

 the method, the means under State law of collecting the 

8

 tax. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Your argument is at least 

10

 intentioned with this Court's decision in Hibbs.  So 

11

 what is your best argument for why Hibbs doesn't 

12

 control?  Hibbs says this statute is about stopping 

13

 taxpayers from avoiding the obligation to paying the 

14

 government, and here we have a third party not a 

15

 taxpayer. 

16

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I 

17

 think what Hibbs was about was that that case did not 

18

 interfere with the collection  the State's revenue 

19

 collection mechanisms.  The text of the Act, as this 

20

 Court recognized, Justice Alito pointed out, the text of 

21

 the Act on this point is identical essentially to the 

22

 AIA.  The Court in Americans United flatly rejected the 

23

 argument that the AIA only applied to taxpayers and it 

24

 would  it would be contrary to the history of the Act 

25

 as well and how this Court has applied it and how the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

 lower courts have applied it. 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I'm not quite sure 

3

 that you're addressing the essence of Hibbs.  Hibbs 

4

 defined the terms "collection," "assessment," et cetera 

5

 very narrowly.  Much more narrowly than you are right 

6

 now.  The difference that Justice Breyer was pointing to 

7

 is the important one.  You haven't answered how you can 

8

 get to where you're going unless we disavow the narrow 

9

 definitional reading that Hibbs gave to those three 

10
11

 issues. 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

I don't agree with that, 

12

 Justice Sotomayor.  The Court can simply recognize that 

13

 suspending, restraining, enjoining the methods of 

14

 reaching  getting to the point of being able to plug 

15

 in the numbers into the calculation.  The State right 

16

 now, when it makes the calculation that is an 

17

 assessment, has nothing to put into two of the three 

18

 variables.  It can't put in the identity of the taxpayer 

19

 and it can't put in whatever the base is to apply to 

20

 State tax law.  This law will directly provide that 

21

 information.  It's the means of doing an assessment. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's the means of what 

23

 let's posit a State law that requires all taxpayers to 

24

 use only a single bank because it will be  one bank 

25

 named by the State because it will be easier to levy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 upon all  upon all accounts.  It makes it a lot easier 

2

 for the State.  They just go to that bank and take your 

3

 bank account.  Okay? 

4

 This is challenged as being a taking, okay, 

5

 and the party tries to get into Federal court with that 

6

 Federal challenge.  Not possible, right?  Because this 

7

 facilitates the collection of the State tax and 

8

 therefore to prevent that facilitation is to restrain 

9

 the collection of the State tax and therefore the suit 

10
11

 has to be brought in State court; is that right? 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, I think the  that the 

12

 test that's been developed and has proven workable for 

13

 decades in the circuit courts, none of them have 

14

 rejected, is the question would be is the purpose of 

15

 that law, the assessment or collection of taxes 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, it is.  That's the 

 whole reason 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

 and is the likely 

19

 effect  if the whole reason that that law was passed 

20

 was to improve the assessment or collection of the tax, 

21

 then it would  then the Tax Injunction Act would allow 

22

 that challenge to be brought in State court that the 

23

 State courts have proven themselves able to. 

24

 I mean, the worst case scenarios under any 

25

 of the parade of horribles that the Plaintiffs have 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 have brought forward is that the cases go to State 

2

 court.  This Court has recognized 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, you're disavowing 

4

 then our pointing to in Hibbs the Second Circuit case. 

5

 You're saying if the purpose of the law, a law that says 

6

 if you don't pay your taxes we're going to imprison you, 

7

 that can't be brought to Federal Court, if the purpose 

8

 is to ensure that you pay your taxes or to encourage you 

9

 to pay your taxes. 

10

 MR. DOMENICO: 

I think the Court  I think 

11

 the Court, looking at Wells, can make a distinction 

12

 based on the fact that in that case the State had given 

13

 up on assessing or collecting the taxes.  The facts of 

14

 that case were that the State was no longer trying to 

15

 assess or collect taxes from Mr. Wells.  It was 

16

 instead  had given up and was punishing him for 

17

 failing to comply with the law. 

18
19
20

 I think the Court can separate penalties 
 when a case like that comes up 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't want to miss the 

21

 question that we started at the beginning of your 

22

 brother's argument, which was the consents below issue. 

23

 MR. DOMENICO: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Right. 
Why was it that until 

 your briefing here you have been arguing that the TIA

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 did not apply or were not challenging the analysis by 

2

 your adversary? 

3

 MR. DOMENICO: 

It was just  it was a 

4

 mistake.  Knowing what we know now, we should have 

5

 argued it.  That's all I can say. 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I guess Federal law is the 

7

 same because we have the, what is it, the AIA, the 

8

 AntiInjunction Act.  So if Congress tomorrow passes a 

9

 law  I'm not saying they would  but that anyone who 

10

 hears of anyone paying anyone else any money for any 

11

 service or good shall immediately report it to the 

12

 nearest  nearest IRS office, and if they fail to do 

13

 so, it's a crime or we'll seize all his assets. 

14

 You wouldn't be able to bring that suit for 

15

 an injunction in Federal Court on the ground that it's a 

16

 bit extreme.  You'd have to wait and pay this whatever 

17

 you're supposed  you're not even supposed to pay, you 

18

 just have to do it and then hope somebody challenges it. 

19

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, Justice Breyer, under 

20

 the AIA, the challenge provisions are fairly 

21

 complicated.  But if a State were to pass that 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, I'm not interested 

23

 in State now.  I'm just interested in why it might be 

24

 that it is wise for Henry Friendly to narrow this word 

25

 "collection" because we knew not where we go when, in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1
2

 fact, it gets too broad. 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, Congress has used the 

3

 word "collection"  "assessment," "levy" and 

4

 "collection."  This Court has always interpreted them 

5

 very broadly in the context of the Tax Injunction Act, 

6

 at least as broadly as in the context of the 

7

 AntiInjunction Act.  And that Congress's determination is 

8

 that the collection of taxes is so important that that's 

9

 the process that has to be followed. 

10

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me that you 

11

 have to distinguish some of the hypotheticals, say, from 

12

 Justice Scalia about the computer being used to expedite 

13

 tax collection or the bank by saying that what we have 

14

 here is an information device that's so closely linked 

15

 in the ordinary course to the collection of taxes that 

16

 it's collect  but I  I 

17

 MR. DOMENICO: 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You could certainly 
I don't know how you would 

19

 formulate that test and I'm not quite sure how you'd get 

20

 it out of the statute. 

21

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, so the  the lower 

22

 courts again have  have had more experience with this, 

23

 particularly under the AIA.  The D.C. Circuit, for 

24

 example, used the word "inextricably linked" to the 

25

 assessment and collection process, I think, in the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

 SevenSky decision.  You can certainly adopt some sort 

2

 of an attenuation principle where 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But don't you have to do 

4

 that in order to distinguish those hypotheticals? 

5

 That's my question. 

6

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, certainly yes.  I mean, 

7

 in this case though it's very easy.  This is a very 

8

 common form of information reporting.  It's simply been 

9

 imported from where it's more familiar, the income tax 

10

 forum, into this use tax forum.  It's a very common 

11

 they are the party to the transaction.  They typically, 

12

 if they are inState, would actually be collecting the 

13

 tax themselves 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Before your time expires, 

15

 what's your best formulation of the connection that you 

16

 think is required? 

17

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, I think the lower 

18

 courts have said two things:  One, the purpose again has 

19

 to be assessment and collection.  It can't just be 

20

 incidental or a collateral effect.  And the likely 

21

 effect has to culminate in assessment or collection. 

22

 That's the language most of the circuit courts use, 

23

 and  and 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The likely effect 

 culminating in collection just seems to me that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1
2

 benefits collection in some way. 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, so there is a  a case 

3

 cited, Bell South, that  that addresses this and says 

4

 if the law is something that doesn't interfere between 

5

 the relationship between the taxing authority and the 

6

 taxed individual or entity, that then the link may have 

7

 been broken.  This law clearly  this injunction 

8

 interferes with the relationship between Colorado and 

9

 the tax because it prohibits us from getting the 

10
11
12
13
14
15

 information about who they are and how much they owe. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, it doesn't 

 prohibit you from doing that at all. 
 MR. DOMENICO: 

It prohibits us from using 

 the tool provided under State law. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, yes, it 

16

 prohibits you from doing what you want to do but the 

17

 whole question is whether you can do it.  It doesn't 

18

 prohibit you  the relationship between the State and 

19

 the taxpayer is between, you know, John Q. Public and 

20

 the State.  And John Q. Public owes this money and the 

21

 way you get it from him is the same way you get other 

22

 taxes that are due from him or you  you can.  You just 

23

 want to have a more efficient way.  But it doesn't 

24

 interfere with that relationship. 

25

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, it does  I would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

 dispute that it  that it doesn't interfere with the 

2

 relationship.  Certainly if the Court is going to say 

3

 that Federal Courts are the proper forum for telling 

4

 States which tools or means they can use to assess or 

5

 collect the tax, then  then we shouldn't prevail.  But 

6

 if the Tax Injunction Act is about anything, it's about 

7

 leaving it out of Federal COURTS 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that  the 

 question  this is just a forum question; right? 

10

 MR. DOMENICO: 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's right. 
You can sue in Federal 

12

 court.  The question wouldn't be the one you posed.  The 

13

 question would be the one on the merits:  Does this 

14

 violate the Commerce Clause? 

15

 MR. DOMENICO: 

Well, that question, under 

16

 the AIA or under the TIA, has to be in State court where 

17

 it is right now being litigated by the same parties, the 

18

 same claims.  So yes, that question has to be decided in 

19

 State court.

 remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. ISAACSON 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

Thank you, Your Honor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

 I would like to address three issues that 

2

 have been raised by Mr. Domenico.  One of the, I think 

3

 primary concerns is the boundless nature of the test 

4

 that has been suggested by the executive secretary, and 

5

 I believe that it's boundless in two regards:  One, it 

6

 could reach any third party.  It can reach common 

7

 carriers, it could reach internet service providers, it 

8

 could reach credit card companies, it could reach any 

9

 any party that the State maintains has some information 

10

 that would be relevant to assist it, to facilitate it in 

11

 the collection of  of taxes.  There is  there is no 

12

 limitation on what that scope may be, even though that 

13

 third party itself may not have its tax liability at 

14

 issue, nor may it have any interest in any other party's 

15

 tax liability. 

16

 The  in addition to that, the definition 

17

 of collection as presented by my brother would reach any 

18

 activity that might facilitate, not only any person but 

19

 any activity that might  might facilitate.  So there 

20

 really is, again, no limitation on what the kind of 

21

 request for information might be that could be imposed 

22

 by the standard that's been suggested.  The Tax 

23

 Injunction Act simply was not intended to provide for 

24

 that kind of expansive, unbounded reach. 

25

 Much to the contrary, as Justice Ginsburg

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

 has pointed out, the purpose was to require taxpayers 

2

 who want to challenge their tax assessments to have to 

3

 go through State procedures that have been established, 

4

 which usually were the payment of the tax and bringing a 

5

 suit for refund, and not to employ Federal court equity 

6

 jurisdiction. 

7

 The  the difference between the original 

8

 purpose of the Tax Injunction Act and its proposed use 

9

 by the State of Colorado is immense. 

10

 Second, Mr. Domenico said that he believed 

11

 that absent this information, it effectively would make 

12

 it impossible for the State of Colorado to be able to 

13

 pursue use tax collection. 

14

 But I believe it's interesting to note that 

15

 the State of Colorado has not employed many of the 

16

 measures that other States have employed to collect use 

17

 taxes.  So, for example, most States have a line on 

18

 their income tax return that allows for the voluntary 

19

 reporting of  of State taxes, or you can have 

20

 electronic reporting of State taxes which, in Colorado, 

21

 80 percent of Colorado taxpayers use electronic 

22

 reporting in which you can have a screen that requires 

23

 that there be reporting of the tax before the screen 

24

 proceeds to the next  to the next entry line. 

25

 The State of Colorado is the only State in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

 the country that is not participating in the streamlined 

2

 sales tax project that is intended to simplify sales tax 

3

 reporting and collection, so that these alternative 

4

 measures certainly are available, have not been tried by 

5

 Colorado, but instead what Colorado has selected 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How successful are any of 

7

 those methods?  You can have as much notice as you want 

8

 to the taxpayer, but most people are not going to pay 

9

 the use tax if they don't think the government could 

10
11

 find out that they bought something in another State. 
 MR. ISAACSON: 

In regard to what the State 

12

 of Colorado does with its own taxpayers, its own 

13

 residents, it's free to do so.  For example, there have 

14

 been other States that have employed a default 

15

 percentage, that the default percentage applies unless 

16

 there's affirmative reporting of an  of an alternative 

17

 number.  My home State of Maine previously had that 

18

 that arrangement. 

19

 So that it is not as if the State is bereft 

20

 of any opportunity to enhance it.  The  the use of the 

21

 term "impossible" by Mr. Domenico, I think, is  is 

22

 really a  a gross overstatement. 

23

 I also want to point out that many of the 

24

 cases that have been cited by Mr. Domenico are 

25

 AntiInjunction Act cases, Federal  Federal cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

 For example, the case law that relates to anything that 

2

 is intended to culminate in collection.  The language of 

3

 the AntiInjunction Act and the Tax Injunction Act is 

4

 not the same.  The language of the AntiInjunction Act 

5

 refers to for the purpose of restraining and is not the 

6

 same as enjoined, suspend or restrained. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could I just ask you to 

8

 clarify your position on the State's alleged consent to 

9

 this suit?  Is it your argument that the Tax Injunction 

10

 Act allows a Federal court to consider  to entertain a 

11

 case that would be otherwise barred by that Act if the 

12

 State consents?  If that's your position, do you have 

13

 authority for it and have you raised this argument in 

14

 your  in your petition and in your brief? 

15

 MR. ISAACSON: 

I believe we have.  The 

16

 the  for example, if the State brings a collection 

17

 action in  in Federal court, those cases have been 

18

 have been allowed to continue in Federal court even 

19

 though it's an act of collection.  Citation for that 

20

 case is Jefferson v. Acre.  Jefferson County v. Acre. 

21

 I think it is most telling, though, Justice 

22

 Alito, in regard to the comity issue. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

24
