Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In 1986, Congress converted what had been

12

before that time a merely peripheral concern of

13

immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker

14

authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of

15

immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the

16

Immigration Reform and Control Act.

17

This Court has characterized that change in

18

legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for

19

dealing with those issues, and that characterization is

20

obviously apt because Congress provided for an

21

exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to

22

the attention of Federal authorities problems in worker

23

authorization, the method by which those matters should

24

be investigated, the method by which they should be

25

adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of

1

Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the

2

ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal

3

courts of appeals.

4

The sanctioning provisions are very explicit

5

and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and

6

for a good reason.

7

that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if

8

you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers -­

9

you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err

Congress realized in this context

10

on the side of not hiring others who are in fact

11

authorized but who may fall into protected classes.

12

so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on

13

both sides so that the employer essentially would play

14

it straight down the middle and hire the best people for

15

the job under these circumstances, while, of course,

16

complying if at all possible with the Federal

17

requirements.

18

And so it's against that backdrop -­

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Why -- why is that a

20

problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and

21

the State statutes require, you have to show an intent

22

to hire an unauthorized worker?

23

what the State statutes here require?

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

two components to it.

Isn't -- isn't that

Well, the State statute has

One is knowing and one is intent.

But I don't see how that -­
So -- so why is that a

5

problem for -- for the business?

6

long as he doesn't intentionally hire an unauthorized

7

worker.
MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

I mean he's safe so

Well, I think part of the

problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear

10

precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker.

11

And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to

12

deal with this problem in the kind of granular way

13

you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is

14

specifically at each of the individual employment

15

decisions.

16

situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one

17

side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is

18

to say you can -- you can essentially have the death

19

penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the

20

business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the

21

scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty

22

remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to

23

hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and,

24

instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of

25

Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.

I'm going to look at the generality of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think what Arizona

2

would answer to that is:

3

the Federal Government left us.
MR. PHILLIPS:

4
5

Well, that's the only option

Well, I'm quite sure that

that's what Arizona will say.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

They excluded everything

7

else.

We might have used reticulated penalties or, you

8

know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they

9

forbade that.

But they did allow us to enforce the law,

10

immigration laws, through licensing, right?

11

essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue,

12

doesn't it?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

So it all

It does ultimately

14

does come down to the "through licensing" laws and -­

15

the -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem,

16

obviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is

17

not a licensing law.

19

This is a worker authorization

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, when I picked up

20

this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought:

21

Oh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in

22

Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something.

23

really isn't.

24

dictionaries, fair enough.

25

licensing laws are.

But it

But I see no limitation on what the
6

1

State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential

2

principle that you've cited.
MR. PHILLIPS:

3

Right.

Justice Kennedy, I

4

think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the

5

meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be

6

construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to

7

engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly

8

in order to say that what really ought to happen in this

9

context is, if you deal with a situation where the

10

Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has

11

enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the

12

Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the

13

State does in fact have the authority to add something

14

over and above what it -- what the Federal Government

15

has done.

16

But it seems to me quite remarkable to think

17

that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring

18

to "through licensing laws" to allow the State to adopt

19

an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a

20

non-administrative decision-making process, completely a

21

State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction

22

is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the -­

23

by any regulating entity.

24

court.

25

It is ordered by a State

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be possible only

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because nobody would think that, with this scheme in

2

place, the Federal Government would not enforce it.

3

course, no one would have expected that.

4

Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in

5

place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other

6

States are in serious trouble financially and for other

7

reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration.

8

therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree

9

this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it

But what

10

to occur under this statute, but expectations change

11

when the Federal Government has -- has simply not

12

enforced the immigration restrictions.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Of

And,

Justice Scalia, I -- I

14

understand the point, and I understand the motivation

15

for why Arizona did what it did.

16

is the statute was enacted in 1986, and that's when the

17

pre-emption standards were put in place.

18

again, the notion -- if you look at the way the

19

structure of the statute -- and this also responds in

20

some ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should

21

you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining

22

concept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said

23

very specifically that the immigration laws should be

24

enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be

25

40,000 different localities offering up their view of

But the -- the problem

licensing and -- and the additional 50 States.

2

Second of all, and this part I think is

3

particularly telling in terms of this massive State

4

scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section

5

1324a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix,

6

Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form.

7

And in some ways this goes to your question,

8

Justice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that

9

the State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional

10

decision making without having access to the I-9 form,

11

because that's -­

2

would that cease to be a licensing law?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I think the answer

4

to that specific hypothetical is that's still not a

5

licensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the

6

license to the revocation powers.

7

think Congress means for the States to adopt something

more specific than that, although I do think

very nice job of explaining the -- the particular focus

of Congress, obviously, on the -- on the Agricultural

know, has tremendous significance in terms of narrowing

How would any of this have

anything to do with the immigration laws?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think what it -- what

15

Congress actually had in mind and what's the most

16

natural reading of a licensing law is the fairly common

17

situation where somebody violates Federal law, usually

18

on the criminal side, and a State licensing entity finds

19

out about a conviction of a Federal crime, and says:

20

Oh, wait a second, we don't want people to have licenses

21

under these circumstances, and, therefore, they -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PHILLIPS:

We -- we have -­

Well, no, no.

But,

Justice Scalia, there's a vast difference between that
12

and what they're saying.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

I think it's very common to

3

talk about authority to do business within a State as -­

5

many States.

You say "licensed to do business in" so
It's a common expression.

Now, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me

6
7

otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law

8

limits the authority to do business within the State, it

9

is a -- it is a licensing law.

It's a little harder

10

extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but

11

when you issue a corporation charter you really do two

12

things.

limitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you

authorize that new creature to do business within your

19

the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress

20

intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at

21

least intended that if someone violated the Federal law

22

and hired illegal aliens and was -- undocumented aliens

23

and was found to have violated it, that the State can

revoke their license, correct?

conflict you're talking about is not the power to stop

15

them from doing business, because you accept that this

I think there are

three pieces of evidence that respond directly to what
you asked, Justice Sotomayor.
First is Congress, in section 115 of the

statute, specifically says enforcement should be

uniform, which suggests to me that this ought to be

GENERAL KATYAL:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Congress

18

declared Federal employer sanctions central, not

19

peripheral, to the policy of immigration law.

20

broadly swept away State and local laws, pre-empting any

sanction upon those who employ unauthorized aliens, with

the sole exception being a mere parenthetical for

licensing and similar laws.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Congress

Just to pose there,

we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws

are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two

words, "and similar laws."

wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether

that raises the question:

What does it make -- why does

it make any difference if the revocation provision is

contained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a

general State law which says all licenses that -- that

At the time the statute

adjudicated revocation of licenses.

had addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens,

adjudicated revocations.

16

the Federal -- State adjudication, and I think the

answer to that is no, because to read the statute that

way is to permit all of those States to have their own

to sweep away the De Canas-style State statutes that

problem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a

answer depends on what Congress was trying to get at.

13

In 1986, we know what Congress was trying to get at with

Well, I think it makes sense,

provides some accountability, because we are the

entities that establish policy for our licensees, and we

So maybe Congress wasn't

worried about it because it seemed very unlikely that

anything like that would occur.
MS. O'GRADY:

12

Perhaps.

But I think also

13

Congress was recognizing what this Court recognized in

15

significant local consequences, so they did not want to

fully pre-empt State law.

The main -- the main

If you're a businessman, every incentive

under that law is to call close questions against hiring

17

to look at it carefully.

18

MS. O'GRADY:

Under the Federal law, every incentive is

Your Honor, a couple of

19

points.

First, in terms of how our law works, we do

20

have a prohibition against investigating any complaint

21

that's based solely on race.

22

that says those people all look Mexican or Hispanic,

23

that does not get investigated under Arizona law, first.

24

We also have criminal penalties if frivolous complaints

25

are filed.

So if we get a complaint

33
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Beyond that, we have the use of E-Verify,

2

which is an added protection for employers to prevent

3

the hiring of unauthorized aliens.

4

E-Verify, if they're in good-faith compliance with the

5

I-9 process, they have no risk of exposure under Arizona

6

law, just as true under Federal law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

So if they use

I'm -- doesn't it

8

frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law

9

says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than

10

the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has

11

occurred or not?

12

the States raise a defense that depends on forcing

13

someone to disclose something that the Federal law

14

protects?

15

Doesn't it frustrate that law to have

I mean, this is a vicious circle.

Federal

16

law says you can't do the I-9 for -- you can't use it

17

for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication.

18

Now you're creating a defense that says you have to

19

supply us with something that Federal law otherwise

20

protects from disclosure.

21

MS. O'GRADY:

Your Honor, we don't think

22

that the Federal law prohibits the use of an I-9 -- of

23

the I-9 -- an employer's use of the I-9 in a State

proceeding, that these can be used under the Federal

not enough time to explain it, but I thought Federal law

16

requires this E-9 business or whatever that E review is.

17

And I was worried about the E review which it seemed to

require because it seemed to me in 20 percent of the

percent of those are wrong, and he is authorized to

we don't impose a sanction on that employer if they

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, in answer to

13

Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on

14

the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under

15

the E-Verify system, you can't just rely on the I-9

16

forms and statutes; you have to rely on the E-Verify.

17

MS. O'GRADY:

Well, Your Honor, we have the

18

same -- it's modeled after the Federal law.

19

Federal law has a defense for employers who in good

20

faith follow I-9, so does the State law.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, just as

I -­

The Federal law and the

22

State law do seem to be exactly the same on this point,

23

but I have -- I don't understand how these two

24

provisions fit together when E-Verify is used.

25

Suppose an employer -- the first thing the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

employer does is receive the forms from the employee,

2

from the I-9 process.

3

they reasonably seem to be authentic.

5

by the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State

He looks at the forms.

Well,

So that employer

But, under both Federal law and State law,

8

the employee -- employer either must or may also use the

9

e-verification system.

The employer gets back a notice

10

of non-authorization.

11

supposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems

12

that the employee is not authorized to work.

13

But what -- and that creates,

How does that fit together?

If you have a

14

complete defense for having used the I-9 process in good

15

faith, the whole e-verification process seems to be

16

irrelevant under both Federal law and State law.

17

don't understand how they fit together.

18

MS. O'GRADY:

I

And, Justice Alito, we haven't

19

wrestled that in practical application, and I'm not

20

aware of them reaching that point under the Federal

21

system, either, but -- because it does seem at some

22

point, if you -- that the system should work, that if

23

you have used I-9 and you get back a final

How would that work?

If we determine this

14

MS. O'GRADY:

I think, Your Honor, perhaps

15

if we -- perhaps in terms of what are the outer limits

16

of our definition of "license" and their saying that we

17

are outside the definition of licensing and similar laws

18

in a particular case, perhaps that would be an

19

as-applied-type challenge.

20

I think some of the I-9 concerns are perhaps

21

more appropriately resolved in a -- in a direct case

22

where that issue has arisen on an as-applied basis, and

I think she was concerned about some of the real

that we can proceed in implementation, but -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

I hope

Well, let -- then let me

4

ask the question directly.

If Arizona's system does not

5

permit a employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the

6

I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on -­

7

the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those.

8

Is that pre-empted or not?
You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system

9
10

says -- on the I-9 documents.

11

says you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved

12

under the e-verification system.
MS. O'GRADY:

13

Or the Arizona system

Is that pre-empted?

I think those would both be

14

problems.

I think we need to be consistent with the -­

15

the structure and the obligations that are imposed under

16

Federal law in terms of our sanctions provisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

So, are you -- are you

18

conceding that any variation from the Federal standards

19

for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically

20

precluded?
I mean, as I read the exception, it's an

21
22

exception for State licensing and similar laws.

23

doesn't say "so long as those licensing and similar laws

24

go no further than what the Federal Government has

25

done."

I mean, we often allow States to impose
45
Alderson Reporting Company

And it

Official

1

regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory

2

requirements that the Federal Government has imposed,

3

and that is not automatically considered to be

4

pre-empted.

5

Arizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal

6

Government says?

So why -- why are you conceding that

MS. O'GRADY:

7

Because I think what Congress

8

preserved for us was our ability to impose sanctions,

9

including the suspension and revocation of State laws.

10

But I do think they established a uniform national

11

standard.

12

And also I wanted to address more on the

5

farm labor contractors and the amendments.

And what we

6

think that they were doing in those amendments was

7

simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level

8

between the Department of Labor and their processes that

9

pre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in

10

IRCA, and said we're not going to have these

11

determinations of whether they -- the farm labor

12

contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a

13

Department of Labor process; we're going to instead use

14

the IRCA-established process.

15

But, importantly, what Congress did not

16

change in the agricultural worker regulations was the

17

provision that addresses State law.

18

IRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal

19

laws only supplement the authority of the States and

20

that means that they preserved all of the State

21

authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and, once again, may it please the Court:
I want to begin frankly where Justice

22

Sotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of

23

whether or not there really is a basis for allowing the

24

States to independently investigate and to independently

25

adjudicate these matters.

And what is the evidence that
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress did not intend that?

2

Justice Breyer quoted from the House report,

3

recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem

4

to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that

5

says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the

6

first instance, and once you've got that, then the State

7

is allowed to add that sanction.
That -- that principle, it seems to me, is

8
9

reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9

11

does seem to me quite clear that what Congress

12

envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going

13

to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme

14

including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in

15

that context that you are allowed to use the I-9.

16

the notion that the State could adopt a standard of

17

intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the

18

I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with

19

each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress

20

intended under those circumstances to allow these

21

matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion.

22

Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

What can -- Mr. Phillips,

23

what can the State do that would be complementary rather

24

than conflicting?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- it seems to me the

easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with

2

what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an

3

employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a

4

criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and

5

the State licensing law says if you're convicted of a -­

6

of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is

7

available to the State under those circumstances -- and

8

I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to

9

issue a notice to show cause why that particular person

10

shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from

11

there.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Convicted by -- by a

13

Federal Government that hasn't gone after many

14

convictions.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Scalia -­

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's the whole problem.
Well, no.

But,

18

Justice Scalia, it seems to me the whole question here

19

-- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a

20

moving target.

21

of what Congress had in front of it in 1986.

22

remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very

23

difficult problems:

24

employers, minimizing discrimination against people who

25

are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people

I think you have to decide it on a basis
But

minimizing burdens on the

1

who are not permitted to do so.
And how you properly reconcile that is very

2
3

difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is

4

that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself

5

and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to

6

give the States the opportunity to come in where they

7

did.

8

And to say one last word about E-Verify -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, except -­

10

well, you're just kind of blinking over the savings

11

clause:

12

that's not a real reservation by Congress of this power

13

to itself.

14

except through licensing and similar laws.

MR. PHILLIPS:

So

Well, if you -- if you

15

interpret the savings clause as I do, which means truly

16

as a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then

17

it is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at

18

that point you've already invoked the entirety of the

19

Federal scheme, and it doesn't modify the balance on

20

those broader legal issues, Your Honor.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

The case is submitted.
