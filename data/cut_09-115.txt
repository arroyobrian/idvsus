Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In 1986, Congress converted what had been

12

before that time a merely peripheral concern of

13

immigration policy -- that is, how to regulate worker

14

authorization -- and converted it into a core concern of

15

immigration policy by the passage of the -- of the

16

Immigration Reform and Control Act.

17

This Court has characterized that change in

18

legislation as providing a comprehensive scheme for

19

dealing with those issues, and that characterization is

20

obviously apt because Congress provided for an

21

exhaustive and exclusively Federal method of bringing to

22

the attention of Federal authorities problems in worker

23

authorization, the method by which those matters should

24

be investigated, the method by which they should be

25

adjudicated, all of which are controlled as a matter of
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal -- exclusive Federal activity; and, indeed, the

2

ultimate judicial review goes exclusively to the Federal

3

courts of appeals.

4

The sanctioning provisions are very explicit

5

and they're very clear and they are very balanced; and

6

for a good reason.

7

that if you over-enforce in one direction -- that is, if

8

you try to deter the hiring of unauthorized workers -

9

you run a very serious risk of causing employers to err

Congress realized in this context

10

on the side of not hiring others who are in fact

11

authorized but who may fall into protected classes.

12

so Congress very carefully calibrated the penalties on

13

both sides so that the employer essentially would play

14

it straight down the middle and hire the best people for

15

the job under these circumstances, while, of course,

16

complying if at all possible with the Federal

17

requirements.

18

And so it's against that backdrop -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Why -- why is that a

20

problem if, as -- as the Federal statute requires and

21

the State statutes require, you have to show an intent

22

to hire an unauthorized worker?

23

what the State statutes here require?

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

two components to it.

Isn't -- isn't that

Well, the State statute has

One is knowing and one is intent.

But -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
But I don't see how that -
So -- so why is that a

5

problem for -- for the business?

6

long as he doesn't intentionally hire an unauthorized

7

worker.
MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

I mean he's safe so

Well, I think part of the

problem is that there -- it is never 100 percent clear

10

precisely who is and who is not an authorized worker.

11

And I think what Congress said was -- I'm not going to

12

deal with this problem in the kind of granular way

13

you're looking at it, Justice Scalia, which is

14

specifically at each of the individual employment

15

decisions.

16

situations, and realize that if you put in -- on one

17

side of the scale what Arizona has done here, which is

18

to say you can -- you can essentially have the death

19

penalty to the business, that is, complete eliminate the

20

business's right to exist, and, on the other side of the

21

scale, a $250 fine, it would -- it would be pretty

22

remarkable to say, well, I -- you know, I'm going to

23

hide behind the intent and knowing requirements and,

24

instead, simply avoid if at all possible the risk of

25

Arizona's sanctions being imposed upon me.

I'm going to look at the generality of

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think what Arizona

2

would answer to that is:

3

the Federal Government left us.
MR. PHILLIPS:

4
5

Well, that's the only option

Well, I'm quite sure that

that's what Arizona will say.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

They excluded everything

7

else.

We might have used reticulated penalties or, you

8

know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they

9

forbade that.

But they did allow us to enforce the law,

10

immigration laws, through licensing, right?

11

essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue,

12

doesn't it?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

So it all

It does ultimately

14

does come down to the "through licensing" laws and -

15

the -- the part of the -- and the fundamental problem,

16

obviously, with Arizona's scheme here is that this is

17

not a licensing law.

18

sanctioning law.

19

This is a worker authorization

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, when I picked up

20

this -- this brief and looked at this case, I thought:

21

Oh, well, licensing, that's a defined term; I'll look in

22

Corpus Juris Secundum or ALR or something.

23

really isn't.

24

dictionaries, fair enough.

25

licensing laws are.

But it

Your brief indicates you start with

But I see no limitation on what the
6

Official

1

State can decide is a license in any jurisprudential

2

principle that you've cited.
MR. PHILLIPS:

3

Right.

Justice Kennedy, I

4

think the better way to try to -- to grapple with the

5

meaning of the licensing law or whether it ought to be

6

construed broadly to allow the State wide authority to

7

engage in supplemental enforcement in this, or narrowly

8

in order to say that what really ought to happen in this

9

context is, if you deal with a situation where the

10

Federal Government has enacted -- I'm sorry -- has

11

enforced a provision and imposed a penalty through the

12

Federal scheme, that then as a supplement to that the

13

State does in fact have the authority to add something

14

over and above what it -- what the Federal Government

15

has done.

16

But it seems to me quite remarkable to think

17

that Congress intended through a parenthetical referring

18

to "through licensing laws" to allow the State to adopt

19

an entire alternative shadow enforcement mechanism, a

20

non-administrative decision-making process, completely a

21

State-run operation; and even at the end, the sanction

22

is not -- is not imposed ultimately in effect by the -

23

by any regulating entity.

24

court.

25

It is ordered by a State

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be possible only

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because nobody would think that, with this scheme in

2

place, the Federal Government would not enforce it.

3

course, no one would have expected that.

4

Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in

5

place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other

6

States are in serious trouble financially and for other

7

reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration.

8

therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree

9

this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it

But what

10

to occur under this statute, but expectations change

11

when the Federal Government has -- has simply not

12

enforced the immigration restrictions.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Of

And,

Justice Scalia, I -- I

14

understand the point, and I understand the motivation

15

for why Arizona did what it did.

16

is the statute was enacted in 1986, and that's when the

17

pre-emption standards were put in place.

18

again, the notion -- if you look at the way the

19

structure of the statute -- and this also responds in

20

some ways to Justice Kennedy's question about how should

21

you read licensing, since it's not a self-defining

22

concept -- is if you -- is that, first, Congress said

23

very specifically that the immigration laws should be

24

enforced uniformly, which says that there shouldn't be

25

40,000 different localities offering up their view of

But the -- the problem

8
Alderson Reporting Company

And the -

Official

1

licensing and -- and the additional 50 States.

2

Second of all, and this part I think is

3

particularly telling in terms of this massive State

4

scheme that's been adopted, which is that under section

5

1324a(b)(5), which is in 134a of the -- of the appendix,

6

Congress specifically outlaws the use of the I-9 form.

7

And in some ways this goes to your question,

8

Justice Scalia, because it would be inconceivable that

9

the State can in fact enforce knowing and intentional

10

decision making without having access to the I-9 form,

11

because that's -
JUSTICE ALITO:

12
13

Could I ask you this

question to get back -

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- to the issue of whether

16

this is a licensing law?

"Licensing" is not an unknown

17

term.

19

Columbia every business has to have a general business

20

license; isn't that right?

States and municipalities issue all sorts of
For example, I think here in the District of

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

That is true, Justice Alito.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, if the District of

23

Columbia were -- after having enacted this requirement

24

some years ago, were to pass a new ordinance saying "and

25

if you knowingly hire an illegal alien, your general
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

business license can be forfeited," would that not -

2

would that cease to be a licensing law?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I think the answer

4

to that specific hypothetical is that's still not a

5

licensing law, because it doesn't tie the grant of the

6

license to the revocation powers.

7

think Congress means for the States to adopt something

8

more specific than that, although I do think

9

eventually -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think Congress -- I

Well, why is it -- this is

11

the same question you're answering.

12

not a license because the -- because the State imposes

13

an additional condition, where it was a license before?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Why is it suddenly

Well, I -
And I -

I think the question is

17

whether it is a licensing law within the meaning of what

18

Congress intended.

19

Justice Alito, there -- there is no common definition of

20

"license," and various States and local -

21

I mean -- the -- the reality is,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Actually, there is.

I

22

mean, it seemed to me when I read this, it sounded a

23

little familiar, and I think whoever wrote it in Arizona

24

copied it out of the Administrative Procedure Act.

25

mean, you read the definition of "license" in the
10

I

Administrative Procedure Act -

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4
5

But -
-- and this is awfully

close.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

I understand that,

6

Justice Breyer, and I agree with that.

7

is, is that the -- the Federal law, it doesn't talk

8

about actions with -- with respect to licenses.

9

talks about licensing laws and -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the problem

That's right.

It

It might

11

have meant something different; Congress might have.

12

But what is, then -- I read the SEIU brief.

13

that was pretty interesting.

14

adopt as what the Congress did mean?

15

you think Congress did mean, and what evidence is

16

there -- if it didn't mean the APA definition, what

17

evidence is there for that?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

I thought

Is that something you
I mean, what do

Well, the SEIU brief does a

19

very nice job of explaining the -- the particular focus

20

of Congress, obviously, on the -- on the Agricultural

21

Workers Protection Act, and in particular -- which, you

22

know, has tremendous significance in terms of narrowing

23

the State's authority here, because, obviously, in their

24

conforming amendments in that context -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It could have named that,

11
Alderson Reporting Company

1

if that's all it meant.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It could have named that,

4

that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it

5

meant.

6

generally.

But it didn't name it; it said licensing

What did it intend to add to that?

7
8
9

licenses?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I think what -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13
14

Barbers'

Beauticians' licenses?
Of course.
How would any of this have

anything to do with the immigration laws?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think what it -- what

15

Congress actually had in mind and what's the most

16

natural reading of a licensing law is the fairly common

17

situation where somebody violates Federal law, usually

18

on the criminal side, and a State licensing entity finds

19

out about a conviction of a Federal crime, and says:

20

Oh, wait a second, we don't want people to have licenses

21

under these circumstances, and, therefore, they -

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they're saying -

that's exactly what they are saying.
MR. PHILLIPS:

We -- we have -

Well, no, no.

But,

Justice Scalia, there's a vast difference between that
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and what they're saying.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

I think it's very common to

3

talk about authority to do business within a State as -

4

as a license.

5

many States.

You say "licensed to do business in" so
It's a common expression.

Now, I have -- maybe you'll persuade me

6
7

otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law

8

limits the authority to do business within the State, it

9

is a -- it is a licensing law.

It's a little harder

10

extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but

11

when you issue a corporation charter you really do two

12

things.

13

limitation of liability that creates, and secondly, you

14

authorize that new creature to do business within your

15

State.

16

licensing, it seems to me.

You create the corporation and enable the

So at least half of that corporation law is

17

Now, if that's what I think, what -

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

Actually, Justice Scalia, can

I stop you there?

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Go on.

Because I think, actually, if

22

you just -- if you just receive the articles of

23

incorporation, that doesn't actually in all States

24

necessarily give you the opportunity to do business.

25

just simply gives you the right to exist, and you may

1

very well need to get a separate document in order to

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

You -- but you do not need

the kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation

needs -

corporation.
Mr. PHILLIPS:

That's true.

That's true.

10

But the -- but the reality is that nobody, I think -

11

and common sense and common use of the term, thinks of

12

articles of incorporation or the charter of a

13

partnership or any of those as -- documents as

14

licensing, which suggests that the State -

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I -- could I -

I'm sorry?
-- just -- just focus

18

the questioning?

19

the APA-type definition of licensing is what Congress

20

intended or not, but you don't disagree that Congress at

21

least intended that if someone violated the Federal law

22

and hired illegal aliens and was -- undocumented aliens

23

and was found to have violated it, that the State can

24

revoke their license, correct?

25

Because we keep talking about whether

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Yes.

I don't disagree with

that, Justice Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

So it really doesn't

matter whether they're revoking their right to do

And they can only revoke their

Right.

They wouldn't have

They can't do it -

they can't do it to Delaware, right.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

All right.

So it's

13

stopping them from doing business.

14

conflict you're talking about is not the power to stop

15

them from doing business, because you accept that this

16

saving clause gives them the power to do that, to revoke

17

the right to do business; what you're talking about is a

18

conflict in the adjudication of that issue.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

So really the only

And -
Is that correct?

Right, and the enforcement

and investigation.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

All right.

So I'm -

24

you know, how they define "license" or not is irrelevant

25

to me.

Walk me through whether -- what expressly
15
Alderson Reporting Company

pre-empts that adjudication right -

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

Right.

pre-empts that adjudication right.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

10

Right.
Because that is, for me,

what the center of this question is.
MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

-- or what implicitly

Right.

I think there are

three pieces of evidence that respond directly to what
you asked, Justice Sotomayor.
First is Congress, in section 115 of the

11
12

statute, specifically says enforcement should be

13

uniform, which suggests to me that this ought to be

14

exclusively a Federal investigation and -- and

15

adjudication process.
Two, the point I was making earlier about

16
17

the I-9 form.

18

Those forms cannot be used in any

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Don't depart

What does that mean, "enforcement shall be

24

Excuse me.

I'm sorry?
What does that mean,

"enforcement shall be uniform"?
MR. PHILLIPS:

The enforcement of the

1

immigration laws shall be uniform.

2

as a -- as an overarching principle -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

3
4

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- from what is the assumed

situation with respect to all Federal laws?
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

Well, not necessarily.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

-- when it enacted section

115.

7
8

Is that any different

from -

5
6

Congress stated that

Are Federal laws not to be

applied uniformly.
MR. PHILLIPS:

12

Well, no, I -- I mean, I

13

think it depends on the circumstances.

14

lot of -- I mean, this is -- remember, we're talking

15

about immigration policy and immigration law here, and

16

in general, you would expect that to be pretty much

17

uniform.

18

there are some elements of it that were not, and

19

Congress is simply reinforcing the basic notion that

20

enforcement of it ought to be uniform to -

But this Court in De Canas had decided that

JUSTICE ALITO:

21

I can imagine a

Doesn't the exception for

22

licensing mean that this isn't going to be completely

23

uniform?

24

that a restaurant that employs illegal aliens may lose

25

its restaurant -- its license to operate.

One -- one jurisdiction may take the position

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Another one

may take the different position.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

Right.
So it's not going to be the

same.
MR. PHILLIPS:

5

But -- but, Justice Alito, I

6

think that's why it's terribly important to limit, to

7

narrow as much as possible -- and it's fully consistent

8

with congressional intent -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9
10

Well, they say that

these -
MR. PHILLIPS:

11

-- the need to get a full

12

sanction done by the Federal Government and then just an

13

add-on on the licensing side, rather than an entire

14

regime to enforce State law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

But this is -- it can't

16

be uniformity of sanction, because the court permitted

17

licensing sanctions.
MR. PHILLIPS:

18
19
20

Right, there -- but only at

that point.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So let's go back to my

21

question of adjudication.

What you're saying is what's

22

specifically pre-empted is the right to adjudicate -

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Investigate -
-- whether someone has

hired undocumented aliens, correct?
18
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

2

And -- and the last thing I would say with respect to

3

that was the conforming amendments with respect to the

4

Agricultural Workers Protection Act, there's a situation

5

where the Department of Labor, which used to engage in

6

adjudication as well, was divested of that authority.

7

It seems quite unlikely Congress meant to give that

8

authority to the States and take it from the Department

9

of Labor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL KUMAR KATYAL
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING PETITIONERS
GENERAL KATYAL:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Congress

18

declared Federal employer sanctions central, not

19

peripheral, to the policy of immigration law.

20

broadly swept away State and local laws, pre-empting any

21

sanction upon those who employ unauthorized aliens, with

22

the sole exception being a mere parenthetical for

23

licensing and similar laws.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Congress

Just to pose there,

we've had a little discussion about what licensing laws

are, but we haven't talked at all about those last two

2

words, "and similar laws."

3

wiggle room or ambiguity there may be in saying whether

4

this is a license or not, Congress swept pretty broadly.

5

It said, not just licensing laws, but licensing and

6

similar laws.

GENERAL KATYAL:

It seems to me that whatever

First let me tell you,

8

Mr. Chief Justice, what we think a licensing law is and

9

then deal with the "similar" question.

in those laws.

contractor ones, for a number of reasons.

2

licensing laws issue licenses.

3

the issuance of licenses, not simply ones in which

4

licenses are revoked.

5

the issuance of the license, the criteria for issuance,

6

is the same as the criteria for revocation, because

7

they're -

They're generally about

Second, they are ones in which

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

The first is

Excuse me.

You -- are you

9

saying, and I think the Petitioner here may have been

10

saying as well, that if you have a licensing law that

11

permits the revocation of the license, the revocation is

12

not a licensing law?

13
14

GENERAL KATYAL:

No.

What I'm saying is,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose I have a licensing

is that a -

15
16

law which says if you do this, your license will be

17

revoked.

Does that remain a licensing law?
GENERAL KATYAL:

18

In general, that itself is

19

not a licensing law.

The licensing laws share a number

20

of characteristics.

21

subtracting one or another of those characteristics -

Now, we can debate about whether

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

Why make exception for

23

licensing laws therefore if you can't revoke a license

24

under it?

25

GENERAL KATYAL:

Because -- because,

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Justice Scalia, Congress wanted to preserve the States'

2

traditional power for licensing laws, which were about

3

fitness to do business.

And what Arizona has done -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Once you're in, you can do

5

whatever you like.

6

meant?

7

you issue the license, but once its issued, they can do

8

whatever they like; is that right?

You can -- you can pass upon their fitness when

GENERAL KATYAL:

9
10

Do you think that is what Congress

No.

I think that the

criteria would be the same for issuance and revocation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

And revocation.

Okay.

So

12

that raises the question:

What does it make -- why does

13

it make any difference if the revocation provision is

14

contained in the narrow licensing law or if there's a

15

general State law which says all licenses that -- that

16

are issued may be revoked for certain reasons?
GENERAL KATYAL:

17

Because, Justice Scalia,

18

what Congress was trying to do was preserve the States'

19

and localities' traditional power for fitness to do

20

business.

21

business is not was what at issue in the particular law

22

is that they will let businesses operate, they will

23

license them without any care whatsoever as to whether

24

they have a history of violating the particular

25

provisions -

And one good indicia that fitness to do

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So they should just --

2

Arizona should just amend all its licensing laws to

3

require what they now require when the license is

4

issued, and to say, in each specific licensing law, that

5

it can be revoked for the same -- on the same grounds -
GENERAL KATYAL:

6

Justice Scalia, that would

solve that problem.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would solve the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even if they said

15

"and you have to renew your license every year or every

16

6 months"?

17

GENERAL KATYAL:

That is correct.

That

18

itself, I don't think, is relevant to whether the

19

licensing law is -- the other hallmarks are that they

20

have discretionary adjudication by an expert body, that

21

it's not mandatory, that it is genuinely aimed at

22

qualifications to do business.

23

It -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't disagree

24

that whether or not a company hires illegal workers is

25

related to quality or -- or ability to do business or
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

qualification?
GENERAL KATYAL:

2

A State could certainly

3

make that part of its genuine fitness to do business

4

law.

5

that because the criteria for issuance of the license

6

are entirely divorced from the criteria for revocation

7

of the license.

it's relevant to the -- the violation is relevant to

pre-empted?

16

GENERAL KATYAL:

Absolutely.

The Federal

17

adjudication is expressly -- State adjudication of a

18

Federal violation is expressly pre-empted as well as

19

impliedly so for three reasons.

20

Congress, in developing IRCA and the comprehensive

21

scheme, set out a series of procedures, Federal

22

adjudication with an ALJ, all sorts of different

23

regulations to the jot and tittle.

25

this law is upheld, which is have -

The first is that

26
Alderson Reporting Company

And what Arizona

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

At the time the statute

2

was passed, there were many, many State laws that

3

adjudicated revocation of licenses.

4

had addressed the issue of hiring undocumented aliens,

5

but many State laws existed that independently

6

adjudicated revocations.

7

history or in the words of the statute show that

8

Congress intended in any way to limit those

9

adjudications?

What in the legislative

GENERAL KATYAL:

10

Perhaps not many

Well, it's undoubtedly the

11

case that without the parenthetical, the mere

12

parenthetical savings clause, that Arizona-like laws

13

would be swept away as sanctions, that these are

14

sanctions imposed.

15

licensing law phrase saves that.

16

the Federal -- State adjudication, and I think the

17

answer to that is no, because to read the statute that

18

way is to permit all of those States to have their own

19

laws, and it's undoubtedly the case that Congress wanted

20

to sweep away the De Canas-style State statutes that

21

were in place that imposed sanctions on employers.

22

so the -

23

So the question is whether the
And I think it saves

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Counsel, just so I

24

get -- make sure I understand your approach.

25

saying that Arizona had a law saying you have to have a
27
Alderson Reporting Company

You're

Official

1

license to do business, and then it became aware of a

2

problem it wasn't aware of before -- it found out that a

3

lot of employers were employing child labor, and they

4

didn't know they would do that -- and they say we can

5

revoke your license if you're determined to have

6

employed child labor; that that would not be okay?

7

GENERAL KATYAL:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10
11

Well -
But it would be okay

if, in the original licensing thing, they said "and you
can't employ child labor"?
GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I think that the

12

answer depends on what Congress was trying to get at.

13

In 1986, we know what Congress was trying to get at with

14

respect to State enforcement of immigration laws.

15

broadly swept away the De Canas-style laws, and they

16

said, for the I-9 provision, which President Reagan

17

described as the keystone of the Act, that I-9 documents

18

can't be used in any procedure besides IRCA procedures.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They

But the Chief Justice -

20

the Chief Justice can insist on the answer to his own

21

question, but it seems to me his question is why isn't

22

that still a licensing law?

23

GENERAL KATYAL:

If it has independent

24

adjudication, it is swept away by the first parts of the

25

(h)(2) statute which say -- which say the provisions of
28
Alderson Reporting Company

1

this section pre-empt any State or local law imposing

2

civil or criminal sanctions.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then, what -
But in the child labor

5

example, why isn't that a -- an addition to a regulatory

6

licensing scheme so that it's a licensing law?
GENERAL KATYAL:

7

Because if I understand --

8

I may not understand the hypothetical, but the word

9

"provisions" refers to the entire subset -- the entire

10

statute in IRCA, including the procedural protections -

MS. O'GRADY:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Through their police powers, States

18

traditionally have the authority to regulate the conduct

of employers within their jurisdiction to determine what

20

conduct warrants issuance of a State license and to

21

determine what conduct justifies suspending or revoking

sanctions through licensing and similar laws.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you answer the -

the anomaly that Arizona cannot impose a fine even in a

4

modest amount, but it can revoke someone's license to do

5

business?
MS. O'GRADY:

6

Your Honor, we think that

7

looking at the savings clause -- we don't view it as an

8

anomaly.

9

that the State's authority is determined by the nature

The structure that Congress established is one

10

of the sanction that we choose to impose.

But underlying Justice

16

Ginsburg's question is why would Congress want to do

17

that?
MS. O'GRADY:

18

Well, I think it makes sense,

19

Your Honor, because in terms of licensing, it -- it

20

provides some accountability, because we are the

21

entities that establish policy for our licensees, and we

22

are the ones accountable for whether that business

23

remains in business or whether we're taking it away from

24

them.

25

So it -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Perhaps Congress never

31
Alderson Reporting Company

expected that the States would have to resort to such

2

massive measures, and they probably wouldn't have if -

3

if the law had been uniformly enforced and vigorously

4

enforced, right?
You -- you didn't -- didn't have any notion

5

of doing this sort of thing in 1986, did you?
MS. O'GRADY:

7
8

Your Honor, certainly we

waited until 2007.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

So maybe Congress wasn't

10

worried about it because it seemed very unlikely that

11

anything like that would occur.
MS. O'GRADY:

12

Perhaps.

But I think also

13

Congress was recognizing what this Court recognized in

14

De Canas, was that unauthorized employment has

15

significant local consequences, so they did not want to

16

fully pre-empt State law.

17

authority -

18

They wanted to preserve State

JUSTICE BREYER:

The main -- the main

19

anomaly seemed to me to be this, that in the Federal

Act, as -- that was the first point that the Chamber

21

made, that it's a fairly careful balance.

22

group of people in Arizona, they may look as if they

23

come from Mexico or speak with an Hispanic accent, and

24

you're not certain whether they in fact are illegals or

25

that they're legal.

There are a

Now, think of that category.
32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Congress has passed a statute that gives the

2

employer just as much incentive to verify, so there's no

3

discrimination, as to dismiss, so there's no illegal

4

hiring.

5

the one, a $1,000 fine for the other.

It's absolutely balanced.

A $1,000 fine for

So Arizona comes along and says:

6

I'll tell

7

you what, if you discriminate, you know what happens to

8

you?

9

your business is dead.

Nothing.

But if you hire an illegal immigrant,

That's just one thing they do.

10

Now, how can

11

you reconcile that intent to prevent discrimination

12

against people because of their appearance or accent -

13

how do you reconcile that with Arizona's law?
If you're a businessman, every incentive

14
15

under that law is to call close questions against hiring

16

this person.

17

to look at it carefully.

18

MS. O'GRADY:

Under the Federal law, every incentive is

Your Honor, a couple of

19

points.

First, in terms of how our law works, we do

20

have a prohibition against investigating any complaint

21

that's based solely on race.

22

that says those people all look Mexican or Hispanic,

23

that does not get investigated under Arizona law, first.

24

We also have criminal penalties if frivolous complaints

25

are filed.

So if we get a complaint

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Beyond that, we have the use of E-Verify,

2

which is an added protection for employers to prevent

3

the hiring of unauthorized aliens.

4

E-Verify, if they're in good-faith compliance with the

5

I-9 process, they have no risk of exposure under Arizona

6

law, just as true under Federal law.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

So if they use

I'm -- doesn't it

8

frustrate the congressional intent when the Federal law

9

says that the I-9 can be used for no purpose other than

10

the Federal adjudication of whether a violation has

11

occurred or not?

12

the States raise a defense that depends on forcing

13

someone to disclose something that the Federal law

14

protects?

15

Doesn't it frustrate that law to have

I mean, this is a vicious circle.

Federal

16

law says you can't do the I-9 for -- you can't use it

17

for any purpose other than the Federal adjudication.

18

Now you're creating a defense that says you have to

19

supply us with something that Federal law otherwise

20

protects from disclosure.

21

MS. O'GRADY:

Your Honor, we don't think

22

that the Federal law prohibits the use of an I-9 -- of

23

the I-9 -- an employer's use of the I-9 in a State

24

proceeding, that these can be used under the Federal

25

proceeding or under the State.
34
Alderson Reporting Company

But, beyond that, if at some point in an

defense available to them.

know, prove it up in a different way other than use the

form.

They would just have to, you

7

That doesn't answer my

point.

question on the I-9.

Federal law that if the employee -- the employer isn't

certain, but the employee says here's my Social Security

to address those points, as you wish.
MS. O'GRADY:

2

Okay.

And let me walk through

3

how our law works to see if this addresses the concern.

4

So the -- Arizona doesn't change anything in terms of

5

the use of the I-9.

6

in the Federal law for good-faith compliance with the

7

I-9.

8

we don't impose a sanction on that employer if they

9

don't use E-Verify.

We retain the same defense that's

We do require employers to use E-Verify, although

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Can you explain that,

11

E-Verify, because this is a Federal resource, and the

12

Federal Government has said we want this to be

13

voluntary.

14

which the Federal Government says is voluntary except in

15

certain circumstances, and turn it into something that's

16

mandatory?

How can Arizona take a Federal resource,

MS. O'GRADY:

17

We think the -- that question

18

is answered by looking at -- into the conflict

19

pre-emption analysis, because Congress didn't address

20

the role of the States with regard to E-Verify.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we

I don't -- I don't get

And the Fed makes it

How can -- how can Arizona set the

MS. O'GRADY:

Your Honor, we can -- as long

as it's not a burden to the objectives of Congress, we

25

doing something that is inconsistent with the Federal

requirement.
MS. O'GRADY:

2

Well, again, we look at the

3

test for conflict pre-emption in terms of, does this

4

make it impossible to comply with Federal law?

5

really a question of are we interfering with

6

Congress's -- excuse me -- the Federal Government's

7

8

developing E-Verify is to have a more effective

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. O'GRADY:

14
15

That's what -- and that was

added after this lawsuit was filed.
JUSTICE BREYER:

16

All right.

I would think

17

then the answer to Justice Scalia's question is, yes,

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. O'GRADY:

12

That's right.

That's right,

Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, in answer to

13

Justice Breyer's earlier question, in fact, relying on

14

the I-9 does not provide a safe harbor, because under

15

the E-Verify system, you can't just rely on the I-9

16

forms and statutes; you have to rely on the E-Verify.

17

MS. O'GRADY:

Well, Your Honor, we have the

18

same -- it's modeled after the Federal law.

19

Federal law has a defense for employers who in good

20

faith follow I-9, so does the State law.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, just as

I -

The Federal law and the

22

State law do seem to be exactly the same on this point,

23

but I have -- I don't understand how these two

24

provisions fit together when E-Verify is used.

25

Suppose an employer -- the first thing the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employer does is receive the forms from the employee,

2

from the I-9 process.

3

they reasonably seem to be authentic.

4

now has the good-faith defense that's provided under -

5

by the I-9 process, under both Federal law and State

6

law.

7

He looks at the forms.

Well,

So that employer

But, under both Federal law and State law,

8

the employee -- employer either must or may also use the

9

e-verification system.

The employer gets back a notice

10

of non-authorization.

11

supposedly, a rebuttable presumption under both systems

12

that the employee is not authorized to work.

13

But what -- and that creates,

How does that fit together?

If you have a

14

complete defense for having used the I-9 process in good

15

faith, the whole e-verification process seems to be

16

irrelevant under both Federal law and State law.

17

don't understand how they fit together.

18

MS. O'GRADY:

I

And, Justice Alito, we haven't

19

wrestled that in practical application, and I'm not

20

aware of them reaching that point under the Federal

21

system, either, but -- because it does seem at some

22

point, if you -- that the system should work, that if

23

you have used I-9 and you get back a final

24

non-confirmation, not a tentative non-confirmation, that

25

that employee is unauthorized, that that, you know,

seems like it should carry greater weight in an

4

actual enforcement action.

But as a -- as an -- on an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Could you -- I

6

8

was being evaluated on its -- on its face and that -

9

she said in as-applied, particular challenges might

arise.
How would that work?

If we determine this

12

is not pre-empted, how would -- on its face, how would

13

an as-applied challenge come about?

14

MS. O'GRADY:

I think, Your Honor, perhaps

15

if we -- perhaps in terms of what are the outer limits

16

of our definition of "license" and their saying that we

17

are outside the definition of licensing and similar laws

18

in a particular case, perhaps that would be an

19

as-applied-type challenge.

20

I think some of the I-9 concerns are perhaps

21

more appropriately resolved in a -- in a direct case

22

where that issue has arisen on an as-applied basis, and

23

I think she was concerned about some of the real

24

implementation questions that were wrapped into the

25

we get sufficient guidance -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

be easier, if that's Justice Scalia's concern, to take

the Solicitor General's position, that if you're

18

adjudicating good faith or intent differently in any way

19

from the Federal Government, that it's pre-empted?

20

Isn't that what waiting for an as-applied challenge

21

means, whether or not you are putting different

22

requirements on proving good faith?

23

MS. O'GRADY:

No, Your Honor, and -- because

24

I was trying to give some examples of the kinds of

25

things that may come up as a practical matter, but I
44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

think we can get the guidance from this Court.

2

that we can proceed in implementation, but -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

I hope

Well, let -- then let me

4

ask the question directly.

If Arizona's system does not

5

permit a employer to rely on non-suspect documents, the

6

I-9 documents that are permitted employers to rely on -

7

the Arizona system says, no, you can't rely on those.

8

Is that pre-empted or not?
You can't rely on I-9, or the Arizona system

9
10

says -- on the I-9 documents.

11

says you can't hire someone who hasn't been approved

12

under the e-verification system.
MS. O'GRADY:

13

Or the Arizona system

Is that pre-empted?

I think those would both be

14

problems.

I think we need to be consistent with the -

15

the structure and the obligations that are imposed under

16

Federal law in terms of our sanctions provisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

So, are you -- are you

18

conceding that any variation from the Federal standards

19

for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically

20

precluded?
I mean, as I read the exception, it's an

21
22

exception for State licensing and similar laws.

23

doesn't say "so long as those licensing and similar laws

24

go no further than what the Federal Government has

25

done."

I mean, we often allow States to impose
45
Alderson Reporting Company

And it

Official

1

regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory

2

requirements that the Federal Government has imposed,

3

and that is not automatically considered to be

4

pre-empted.

5

Arizona cannot go a whit beyond what the Federal

6

Government says?

So why -- why are you conceding that

MS. O'GRADY:

7

Because I think what Congress

8

preserved for us was our ability to impose sanctions,

9

including the suspension and revocation of State laws.

10

But I do think they established a uniform national

11

standard.

12

establish a -- a strict liability offense in Arizona.

13

We'd have to have a scienter requirement as they have in

14

Federal law.

15

I don't think we could, for example,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, what I was trying to

16

get is -- what I was looking at specifically is Federal

17

law says, if you look at the driver's license and Social

18

Security card -- those are I-9 docs -- then the employer

19

has established an affirmative defense and has not

20

violated the law.

22

That's what it says.
Okay?

You know the

That's the Federal law.

Arizona law that I was reading -- maybe

23

there's another place I should read -- is it says, on

determining whether he's an unauthorized alien, the

It creates a rebuttable

That means it might be rebutted.
So I see a difference there.

Okay?

And the reason

4

that that's relevant is because, my first question, if

6

better verify because if I'm discriminating, you know,

contractor is simply an example, and I think it says

And also I wanted to address more on the

5

farm labor contractors and the amendments.

And what we

6

think that they were doing in those amendments was

7

simply dividing responsibility at the Federal level

8

between the Department of Labor and their processes that

9

pre-existed IRCA, and what they were establishing in

10

IRCA, and said we're not going to have these

11

determinations of whether they -- the farm labor

12

contractor has employed an unauthorized alien through a

13

Department of Labor process; we're going to instead use

14

the IRCA-established process.

15

But, importantly, what Congress did not

16

change in the agricultural worker regulations was the

17

provision that addresses State law.

18

IRCA and after IRCA, that those laws -- those Federal

19

laws only supplement the authority of the States and

20

that means that they preserved all of the State

authority that they had before IRCA in the area of farm

labor contractors.

acknowledge that Congress does have the authority to

similar laws, and we are doing so by establishing this

scheme that provides for the suspension and revocation

7

of State licenses.
It's an important part of the balance that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and, once again, may it please the Court:
I want to begin frankly where Justice

22

Sotomayor pointed me to before, which is the question of

23

whether or not there really is a basis for allowing the

24

States to independently investigate and to independently

25

adjudicate these matters.

And what is the evidence that
55

1

Congress did not intend that?

2

Justice Breyer quoted from the House report,

3

recognizing not everybody accepts that, but it does seem

4

to me to articulate a very commonsense limitation that

5

says you have to have a Federal adjudication in the

6

first instance, and once you've got that, then the State

7

is allowed to add that sanction.
That -- that principle, it seems to me, is

8
9

reinforced by the limitation on what you can use the I-9

10

for.

11

does seem to me quite clear that what Congress

12

envisioned in 1986 when it adopted this is you're going

13

to have an exclusively Federal enforcement scheme

14

including the adjudicatory process, and it is only in

15

that context that you are allowed to use the I-9.

16

the notion that the State could adopt a standard of

17

intentional or knowingly, and not be able to have the

18

I-9 materials available, seems to me flatly at odds with

19

each other, and, therefore, it cannot be that Congress

20

intended under those circumstances to allow these

21

matters to be adjudicated in that particular fashion.

22

Justice Alito, you asked that question, but it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

What can -- Mr. Phillips,

23

what can the State do that would be complementary rather

24

than conflicting?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- it seems to me the
56

1

easiest -- and of course, this has nothing to do with

2

what Arizona does -- but the easiest is, if a -- an

3

employer is convicted of -- of violating IRCA and a

4

criminal sanction, and he happens to be a barber, and

5

the State licensing law says if you're convicted of a -

6

of a Federal crime you will lose your license, it is

7

available to the State under those circumstances -- and

8

I think this is exactly what Congress had in mind -- to

9

issue a notice to show cause why that particular person

10

shouldn't have the license revoked and then go from

11

there.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Convicted by -- by a

13

Federal Government that hasn't gone after many

14

convictions.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Scalia -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's the whole problem.
Well, no.

But,

18

Justice Scalia, it seems to me the whole question here

19

-- and first of all, I don't think pre-emption can be a

20

moving target.

21

of what Congress had in front of it in 1986.

22

remember, Congress was balancing three, at least, very

23

difficult problems:

24

employers, minimizing discrimination against people who

25

are permitted to be hired, and avoiding hiring people

I think you have to decide it on a basis
But

minimizing burdens on the

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who are not permitted to do so.
And how you properly reconcile that is very

2
3

difficult, but the one thing that seems to me clear is

4

that that was a choice Congress meant to leave to itself

5

and to the Federal Government to sort out and not to

6

give the States the opportunity to come in where they

7

did.

8

And to say one last word about E-Verify -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, except -

10

well, you're just kind of blinking over the savings

11

clause:

12

that's not a real reservation by Congress of this power

13

to itself.

14

except through licensing and similar laws.

MR. PHILLIPS:

So

Well, if you -- if you

15

interpret the savings clause as I do, which means truly

16

as a supplement to Federal -- Federal adjudication, then

17

it is a very narrow limitation on that basis, because at

18

that point you've already invoked the entirety of the

19

Federal scheme, and it doesn't modify the balance on

20

those broader legal issues, Your Honor.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

The case is submitted.

23

(Whereupon, at 12:02 p.m., the case in the

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
