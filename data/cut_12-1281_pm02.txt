 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning.

 General Verrilli? 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and 

may it please the Court: 
 The interpretation of the Recess 

12

Appointments Clause that Respondent urges would 

13

repudiate the constitutional legitimacy of thousands of 

14

appointments by presidents going back to George 

15

Washington, and going forward, it would diminish 

16

presidential authority in a way that is flatly at odds 

17

with the constitutional structure the Framers 

18

established. 

19

 Respondent simply has not advanced the 

20

compelling case that would be needed to strip Presidents 

21

of their traditional authority to make appointments 

22

during intrasession recesses and to fill preexisting 

23

vacancies. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You say  you say 

that it would repudiate the constitutionality of

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appointments.  You don't suggest that those  the 

2

actions of those appointees would be invalid going back 

3

however far you want to go back, do you? 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, but they  no, I 

5

don't, Mr. Chief Justice, but it certainly would 

6

repudiate the legitimacy of those appointments. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

9

Why not? 
How did it  how did it 

affect the  how many board decisions will have to be 

10

redone, or how did  how is the board coping with that 

11

problem? 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, there are many 

13

dozens of board decisions and, perhaps, many hundreds of 

14

board decisions that are under a cloud as a result of 

15

the D.C. Circuit's ruling in this case.  And so the 

16

board will have a considerable amount of work to do 

17

in  if the D.C. Circuit's decision were to be 

18

affirmed. 

19

 Now, there would be issues about waiver, 

20

there'll be issues about whether there  there is 

21

authority sufficient to justify what the board did under 

22

other circumstances or apparent authority arguments.  So 

23

that would all have to be sorted out with respect to the 

24

board's ruling 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What would happen if 

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under the reasoning of this case, what would happen to 

2

the decisions of recessappointed judges? 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5
6

Well, I think that 
Of which there's been 

quite a few. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think that would be a 

7

very serious question, Justice Sotomayor, and I think it 

8

does point up the  the difficulty with the position 

9

Respondent is urging. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

11

Well, surely, you would 

you would argue the de facto officer doctrine. 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, we would. 
Of course, you would. 
Yes, we would. 
And we've applied that in 

16

innumerable cases.  You don't really think we're going 

17

to go back and rip out every decision made. 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I would certainly 

19

hope not, Your Honor, but it certainly casts a serious 

20

cloud over the legitimacy of all of those actions.  And 

21

it does point up the fact that the recess power, 

22

including appointments during intrasession recesses and 

23

to fill preexisting vacancies has been used to fill 

24

offices of great importance. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You started off by

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying  you know, it would  it would repudiate so 

2

many actions that have been taken.  I have a very, very 

3

stark question:  Suppose I agree with the court of 

4

appeals that the only  the only interpretation of 

5

of the Constitution is that the vacancy must have arisen 

6

during the recess, just by hypothesis.  I agree with 

7

that, okay? 

8
9
10
11
12
13
14

 What do you do when there is a practice 
that  that flatly contradicts a clear text of the 
Constitution?  Which  which of the two prevails? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

has to prevail, Your Honor, but I do  and I 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

So if you ignore the 

Constitution 

15

17

Now, I think the practice 

But I don't think 
 often enough, its 

meaning changes? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But, Your Honor, of 

19

course, in this situation, the meaning of the clause 

20

with respect to the timing of  of the vacancy has been 

21

a matter of contention since the first days of the 

22

Republic. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Now, you're  you're 

24

questioning my hypothesis.  You have to accept my 

25

hypothesis.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think I've 

2

answered the question accepting your hypothesis, but I 

3

think 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let's assume that the text 

5

is clearly against you.  Should I say, oh, yes, it  it 

6

says something else, but the practice for over 200 years 

7

has been something different, and it's the practice that 

8

must prevail. 

9

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

The practice has 

10

started with George Washington, and it has worked 

11

through the 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

14

I think  I think I've 

already answered that. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

over the clear text 

17

Yes or no? 

Does the practice prevail 

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

The practice gives 

18

meaning to the  the practice gives meaning to the 

19

Constitution 

20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You're questioning my  my 

hypothesis again. 

22

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No 
I am assuming a clear text 

24

of the Constitution and a practice that is  is 

25

contrary to it.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It's extremely unlikely 

2

that would arise if the text were so free of doubt.  But 

3

if 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You do not want to answer 

my hypothesis. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, I am  I am 

7

answering.  I think I already answered it once, 

8

Justice Scalia, but I'll answer it again.  The answer is 

9

I think, given this  a practice going back to the 

10

founding of the Republic, the practice should be  the 

11

practice should govern, but we don't have that here. 

12

 This provision has been subject to 

13

contention as to its meaning since the first days of the 

14

Republic. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, let me ask you about 

16

the premise.  A vacancy is something that begins at a 

17

particular point in time, and then it continues for some 

18

period.  And I was trying to think of some other things 

19

that might fall into the same category.  One would be an 

20

appointment to a Federal office. 

21

 So you were appointed as Solicitor General 

22

at a particular point in time, and the appointment 

23

continues.  Another example might be a marriage.  It 

24

happens at a particular point in time, and it continues 

25

for a  a period of time.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, would we say that your appointment as 

2

Solicitor General is happening today and will happen 

3

again tomorrow and happened yesterday?  Is that the way 

4

the English language is used? 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But the word "happens" 

6

may not always be an apt phrase, the phrase "may 

7

happen," the constitutional phrase, but it is a natural 

8

use.  And if I may, Justice Alito, I'll give you a 

9

counterexample. 

10

 If Congress had enacted a statute in the 

11

summer of 2008 that said the Federal Reserve is invested 

12

with all powers necessary to deal with any financial 

13

emergency that may happen in 2009, if that emergency 

14

first arose in November of 2008, I don't think anybody 

15

would interpret that statute as denying the Federal 

16

Reserve the authority that Congress conferred. 

17

 And that's because "may happen"  "may 

18

happen" won't cover every situation of a persisting 

19

state, but it's certainly a natural reading of it that 

20

covers some.  And as Jefferson said, it's certain  in 

21

this context, it's certainly susceptible of being 

22

interpreted to mean 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

General Verrilli, we've 

24

taken you off your starting point.  Your starting point 

25

was what is it  what constitutes a recess.  And your

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position is that it can be an intrasession recess.  But 

2

if we look back historically, Congress met, and they met 

3

continuously.  And then they went on horseback back 

4

home, and they were away for 6 months, even 9 months. 

5

 Today, there's nothing like that. 

The 

6

intersession  the intersession recess could be 

7

could be an hour.  So what do we do with that?  There 

8

was the vision of a long recess running for months, and 

9

today, the intersession recess might be momentary. 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So I think I have two 

11

points to make in response to the question of what to 

12

do.  The first one is that, with respect to the original 

13

understanding, we do think that the term "recess" and 

14

the phrase "the recess" certainly, at the time of the 

15

founding, did encompass recesses that occurred during a 

16

session of Congress, during a session of a 

17

legislature, and not just in between sessions of the 

18

legislature. 

19

 I would point the Court to Jefferson's 

20

Manual of Parliamentary Procedure, which describes a 

21

recess by adjournment as occurring within a session.  I 

22

would point to the Adjournment Clause itself, which says 

23

if the  one house of Congress wants to take a break of 

24

longer than 3 days during the session, it needs the 

25

consent of the other house, which indicates that the

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Framers contemplated the possibility of a break longer 

2

than 3 days. 

3

 I would point the Court to the parliamentary 

4

practice of the House of Commons, where the speaker of 

5

the House of Commons had authority to call elections 

6

when a member died during the recess. 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, of course, Justice 

8

Ginsburg's question points out that your argument is, it 

9

seems to me, in search of a limiting principle.  A lunch 

10

break, a oneday break  you've  you've thought about 

11

this  a 3day break, a 1week break, a 1month break; 

12

how do you resolve that problem for us? 

13

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think the  the way we 

14

resolve that problem is by looking to the Adjournment 

15

Clause.  We think, if it's a break that is sufficiently 

16

short, that it wouldn't require the  wouldn't require 

17

the one House to get the consent of the other, but 

18

that's a de minimis recess, and that's not a recess in 

19

which the President would have authority 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is that 3 days? 
And what about the pro 

22

forma sessions, then?  They don't  or correct me if 

23

I'm wrong.  They don't require the consent of the other 

24

house. 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, but the problem

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with the pro forma sessions, I think, Justice Kennedy, 

2

is in thinking about the length of the recess.  The 

3

recess, we would submit  and this is based on the 

4

formal dictionary definition of "recess" at the time of 

5

the founding and now, which is "a suspension of 

6

business," the recess was from January 3 when the 

7

session started until January 23. 

8

 And the reason I think that 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

10
11

So  so you think there's 

no recess during pro forma sessions? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

There is a recess.  And 

12

the reason is because the Senate has issued a formal 

13

order that no business shall be conducted and that's a 

14

formal 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, let's just 

16

talk  let's focus on that.  What, instead of 

17

saying, "No business shall be conducted," the order 

18

said, "It is not anticipated that any business will be 

19

conducted."  Does that suffice to eliminate that period 

20

as a recess? 

21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think that it's a 

22

that's a different case, and I think, concededly, a 

23

significantly harder case for the Executive because 

24

here 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Yeah.  Well, it's

Official

1

difficult and harder, but it also suggests that you're 

2

just talking about a couple of magic words that the 

3

Senate can just change at the drop of a hat, so maybe 

4

the point is not that significant. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think it is 

6

significant, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's a formal action by 

7

the Senate by rule saying that no business shall be 

8

conducted. 

9

 And then in addition, there are other formal 

10

actions that the Senate took during this period that are 

11

confirming indicia.  The Senate passed  the Senate 

12

passed a resolution that gave committees the authority 

13

to submit reports and report bills.  They passed a 

14

resolution giving the  the President Pro Tempore the 

15

power to sign enrolled bills.  It passed 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But General, I think you're 

17

you're not answering the real thrust of the Chief 

18

Justice's question, which is that we could just be back 

19

here if we  if we said, well, they didn't phrase this 

20

in the right way. 

21

 Well, they'll phrase it differently, and we 

22

would be back here with the same essential problem, that 

23

you're asking us to peg this on a formality that the 

24

Senate could easily evade, and that suggests that it 

25

really is the Senate's job to determine whether they're

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in recess or whether they're not. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think there has to be a 

3

limit to that point, Justice Kagan, because, after all, 

4

what we're talking about here is a power that the 

5

Constitution gives to the President, the power in 

6

Article II, and the President has got to make the 

7

determination of when there's a recess. 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But why?  You're making 

9

an assumption, which is that the Senate has to take a 

10

recess, but the Senate could choose, if it wanted to, 

11

and I think there might be some citizens that would 

12

encourage it to, to never recess. 

13
14
15
16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 
could. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And  and to work every 

day, which 

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

20

Sure.  Of course, it 

That's true. 
 lots of people do. 
That's true.  They 

could  they could decide not to take a recess. 

21

 (Laughter.) 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So 
That's absolutely true. 

24

But  but it seems to me that that is the choice that 

25

the Constitution puts 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So what do you say about 

2

the Twentieth Amendment, which says that that 

3

January 3rd was a meeting?  Are you saying they violated 

4

the Twentieth Amendment?  January 3rd.  This says the 

5

Congress of the United States shall meet on January 3rd 

6

every year, unless they appoint a different day. 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

Yes. 
And they haven't.  And, 

therefore, they met in pro forma session.  Or do you 

10

think it wasn't a meeting?  And what do you think about 

11

the other part of the Constitution, which says they 

12

can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the approval 

13

of the House, which they didn't have. 

14

 So are you saying that the Senate violated 

15

those other two amendments of  the two parts of the 

16

Constitution, or are you saying that they have different 

17

meanings in the three parts? 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think our view is that 

19

it's hard to see how the  what the  what the Senate 

20

did with pro forma sessions complies with either and 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  So you're saying 

22

they violated, if that  if they have pro forma 

23

sessions on January 3rd, they violate the Twentieth 

24

Amendment to the Constitution.  You are saying that if 

25

they had a pro forma session on January 3rd, that since

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

their meeting  their recess was still on and lasted 

2

more than 3 days, it was a violation of that Adjournment 

3

Clause of the Constitution. 

4

 Now, that's one way to interpret it. 

Over a 

5

long period of time, they have apparently met pro forma 

6

on those days.  Or we could try to make them mean the 

7

same thing, which would mean it was up to the Senate. 

8

They consider that a meeting, it's a meeting.  What do 

9

we do? 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

11

option, Justice Breyer. 

12

Or there is another 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Would you write that 

13

opinion, saying the Senate of the United States has 

14

violated two  two provisions of the Constitution? 

15

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, no.  I don't 

16

think you need  I don't think you need to write that 

17

opinion. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

All right.  Why not? 
Because you might, 

20

perhaps, give the Senate some deference with respect to 

21

requirements that apply only internally to the Congress. 

22

But when what you're talking about is the Senate's use 

23

of pro forma sessions in a manner that deprives the 

24

President of authority that Article II would otherwise 

25

give to the President 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Would it  would it  I 

2

mean, that's my basic question, really.  Why is this an 

3

important case?  I see what you're saying on this one. 

4

That's fine for an answer.  Thank you. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So why 
What my really basic 

7

question is why is this an important case, in your 

8

opinion?  Now, you've said, oh, because there are 

9

thousands of recess appointments, not on the happen 

10
11

clause. 
 You've listed 7600 or so, really, on the 

12

recess part, but on the happen clause, you've only been 

13

able to find 102.  And moreover, we've had an example 

14

of  where this Court, for better or for worse, said 

15

that two members of the board is not a quorum, and we 

16

got some more members, they dealt with the problem. 

17

They ratified all those opinions, they dealt with it. 

18

It didn't take them too much time. 

19

 So  and we have different political 

20

parties taking absolutely opposite sides, it seems to 

21

me, or some members thereof, depending on the political 

22

party of the President.  And we have a clause that had 

23

to do with the Constitution and the problem of intra 

24

intersession recesses when they were 7 months and 

25

nobody could meet.  Okay.  That isn't true anymore.

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So explain to me. 

I'm not saying you're 

2

wrong.  I just want to hear from your mouth why this is 

3

an important case. 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So it's important for 

5

multiple reasons, with respect to practicalities and 

6

fundamental questions of constitutional structure. 

7

 Let me start with practicalities and with 

8

the happens point, the "may happen" point, that our 

9

appendix doesn't purport to be comprehensive or anything 

10

like comprehensive.  Part of the reason why it can't be 

11

comprehensive is that there really aren't records of 

12

when the vacancy first arose with respect to huge 

13

numbers of recess appointments, and that's because, I 

14

submit, it wasn't considered material. 

15

 But second, I can  there are  there are 

16

numerous practical examples in our history of when it 

17

made a very great deal of difference that the President 

18

had the authority to make an appointment to a vacancy 

19

that preexisted the recess. 

20

 We have mentioned the 1948 example; the 

21

Secretary of Labor dies on the verge of a very extended 

22

intrasession recess by the  by the Senate.  They're 

23

going to be out for a month, back for 12 days, and then 

24

out all the way from June  they go out in June, 

25

they're out for a month, they are back for 12 days, and

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

then they're out all the way until December 31st. 

2

 The Secretary of Labor dies just in advance 

3

of them going out in June, and this is  remember, 1948 

4

is a period of significant labor unrest.  They needed a 

5

Secretary of Labor in place. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

General, would you agree 

7

that this clause now is not mostly used to deal with 

8

emergencies arising from congressional absence?  That 

9

most modern Presidents  and I say this sort of 

10

going  going back to President Reagan, Presidents of 

11

both parties, essentially, have used this clause as a 

12

way to deal  not with congressional absence, but with 

13

congressional intransigence, with a Congress that simply 

14

does not want to approve appointments that the President 

15

thinks ought to be approved? 

16

 You know, absence in this day and age 

17

this is not the horseandbuggy era anymore.  There's no 

18

real  there's no such thing, truly, as congressional 

19

absence anymore.  And that makes me wonder whether we're 

20

dealing here with what's essentially a historic relic, 

21

something whose original purpose has disappeared and has 

22

assumed a new purpose that nobody ever intended it to 

23

have. 

24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, two answers.  I 

don't think its original purpose has disappeared.  I

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mean, the NLRB was going to go dark.  It was going to 

2

lose its quorum. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, as a result of 

4

congressional refusal, not as a result of congressional 

5

absence. 

6

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And that gets to the 

7

second point, which is that it may be true, as a matter 

8

of raw power, that the Senate has the ability to sit on 

9

nominations for months and years at a time, but that is 

10
11

100 miles from what the Framers would have expected. 
 If you look at what Hamilton said in 

12

Federalist 76 about the advice and consent role of the 

13

Senate, he said he thought it would be a power that was 

14

rarely exercised and would operate, if at all, invisibly 

15

or silently.  And in the early days of the Republic, it 

16

was  advice and consent was a matter of days, not months and years. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But you are making a very, 

18

very aggressive argument in favor of executive power 

19

now, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with whether 

20

the Senate is in session or not.  You're just saying, 

21

when the Senate acts, in your view, irresponsibly and 

22

refuses to confirm nominations, then the President must 

23

be able to fill those  fill those positions. 

24
25

 That's what you're arguing. 

I don't see 

what that has to do with whether the Senate is in

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

session. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I do  I think 

3

this  I think the recess power may now act as a safety 

4

valve given that intransigence, and that is actually 

5

quite consistent 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it isn't  it isn't 

7

tied then to the availability of Congress, 

8

availability of the Senate.  I think you said throughout 

9

your brief that the rationale for the recess power is 

10

the President must be able to have the government 

11

functioning and staffed even though  although the 

12

Senate isn't  isn't around.  But now the  you seem, 

13

in your answers, to be departing from the Senate not 

14

available and making quite another justification for 

15

this. 

16

 The Senate  I think, to be candid, the 

17

Senate is always available.  They can be called back on 

18

very short notice.  So what is it that's the 

19

constitutional flaw here?  It isn't  it isn't that the 

20

Senate isn't available.  The Senate is available.  It 

21

can easily be convened. 

22

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So let me take a half a 

23

step back, if I could, Justice Ginsburg, and answer that 

24

question in this way  you know, perhaps it sounds like 

25

this is an aggressive assertion of executive authority,

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

but I'd ask the Court to think back to Federalist 51. 

2

 And what the Framers were most concerned 

3

about was that Congress, in the separation of powers 

4

calculus, was going to amass authority and drain 

5

authority and energy from the Executive, and therefore, 

6

the Executive needed to be fortified against those 

7

actions by Congress. 

8
9

 And one specific way in which the Framers 
decided to fortify the Executive was by rejecting the 

10

notion that the appointment power should reside with the 

11

Senate.  The Framers considered that, and they rejected 

12

it. 

13

 And the reason they rejected it, as this 

14

Court noted in its Edmund opinion, was  was to protect 

15

the Executive against encroachment by the legislature. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the compromise 

17

they settled on in moving away from that is that the 

18

President will nominate and the Senate, if it so 

19

chooses, can confirm a nominee.  You spoke of the 

20

intransigence of the Senate.  Well, they have an 

21

absolute right not to confirm nominees that the 

22

President submits. 

23

 And it seems to me, following up on Justice 

24

Kagan's point, you're latching on to the Recess 

25

Appointment Clause as a way to combat that

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intransigence, rather than to deal with the happenstance 

2

that the Senate is not in session when a vacancy becomes 

3

open. 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, but those things 

5

there are often situations in which the Senate is not in 

6

session when a vacancy becomes open or needs to be 

7

filled, I guess would be the more accurate way to say 

8

it.  The examples  I'll give you another example, if I 

9

could, from the 1940s.  TaftHartley gets enacted in 

10
11

1947 in the summer. 
 One requirement of TaftHartley is that the 

12

general counsel of the NLRB must enforce the ban on 

13

secondary boycotts within a fixed period of time, 30 or 

14

60 days.  Well, it turns out there is no general counsel 

15

of the NLRB at that time, so President Truman 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the Senate 

17

has  the Congress and the Executive have come together 

18

to address those sorts of problems in a vast number of 

19

cases by providing that there can be an acting general 

20

counsel of the NLRB to deal with that situation. 

21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, actually, 

22

Mr. Chief Justice, with respect to multimember boards, 

23

the Vacancy Act doesn't cover them.  That's one reason 

24

we have the problem here.  But beyond that, the Framers 

25

made a judgment that this wasn't going to be left to

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

congressional largesse.  That's why there is a Recess 

2

Appointment Clause, and it's not left to the Congress. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, let's  let's talk about your 

4

1948 emergencyof the Secretary of Labor.  There was 

5

a vacancy in  in that post.  The President has the 

6

authority to convene Congress.  And whatever was the 

7

case in 1948 or  or in 1789, Congress can be back here 

8

in one day. 

9
10

 Article II, Section 3 says, "He may, on 
extraordinary occasions, convene both houses." 

11

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

12

Justice Scalia.  But the 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's true, 

So what's the problem?  If 

14

there is indeed this  you know, this terrible 

15

emergency you're talking about, the President has the 

16

power to call them back. 

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think it seems to 

18

me the Framers made a different judgment because they 

19

gave the President both the power to call back in 

20

extraordinary circumstances and the recess appointment 

21

power.  And if the Framers had intended the power to 

22

call back to be the way to deal with vacancies during 

23

absences of the Senate, then 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but my only point is 

what  what the recess appointment power consists of

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cannot be determined on the basis that, well, there are 

2

going to be terrible emergencies, so it must enable the 

3

President to do this or that.  Extraordinary emergencies 

4

are handled in the Constitution.  You don't have to 

5

expand the  the vacancy appointment power in order to 

6

handle those. 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So what I would say about 

8

this, and also to your point, Mr. Chief Justice, is we 

9

have, I would submit, a stable equilibrium that has 

10

emerged over the course of this country's history 

11

between the two branches.  After all, what we are 

12

advocating for here is the status quo.  It is the 

13

equilibrium that has emerged since Congress  since the 

14

Senate started taking lengthy intrasession recesses, 

15

Presidents started making recess appointments during 

16

those recesses. 

17
18
19

 That began in the Civil War days. 

It's 

continued to the present.  The President 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

General, I think that's a 

20

really strong argument, but I have to say I'm not sure 

21

it applies consistently throughout each of the three 

22

claims that you make.  Because if you are going to rely 

23

on history and on the development of an equilibrium with 

24

respect to what "happens" means, and if you are going to 

25

do that again with respect to whether intrasession

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

recesses are included, then it seems to me you also have 

2

to look to history and the development of an equilibrium 

3

with respect to Congress's definition of its own power 

4

to determine whether they are in recess or not. 

5

 In other words, your third argument about 

6

pro forma sessions, the history is entirely on the 

7

Senate's side, not on your side.  And if we're going to 

8

take a kind of continuing practice and the development 

9

of equilibrium seriously, you might win on questions 1 

10
11

and 2 and then lose on question 3. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, winning on 

12

questions 1 and 2 would be of great importance to the 

13

Executive, but we also should win on question 3, and 

14

here's why:  There isn't a long history reflecting the 

15

equilibrium with respect to the use of pro forma 

16

sessions in order to restrict the President's ability to 

17

use the recess appointment power. 

18

 There really is no history before 2007 of 

19

this daisy chaining of one pro forma session after 

20

another after another in conjunction with an order that 

21

no business shall be conducted. 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, there's no practice 

23

there is no long practice of doing it.  There is also no 

24

long practice of rejecting it. 

25

 But if I could take you back to that, you

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said that the pro forma sessions may violate the 

2

Adjournment Clause in the Twentieth Amendment.  Would 

3

you also say that they violate the Presentment Clause, 

4

because the Senate has passed legislation during these 

5

pro forma sessions and the President has signed that 

6

legislation. 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, we don't.  I think 

8

the right way to think about that is the same way that 

9

you would think about if the Senate declares that it's 

10

in recess from August 1st until September 15th and then 

11

comes back early because an emergency has happened, for 

12

example, with Hurricane Katrina.  Once they are back in 

13

doing business, they are doing business. 

14

 Now, what the Senate did with respect to the 

15

legislation Your Honor identified was they came out of 

16

pro forma session, they passed legislation, and then 

17

went back in to  they went back in under the order of 

18

pro forma session.  So they take that action 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it seems  it seems 

20

to me that we're searching here for a proper 

21

interpretation of the word "session," which, after all, 

22

is in the provision that we are looking at.  It talks 

23

about "next session."  And we have a long tradition of 

24

Congress defining what that session is. 

25

 They have the first  this is, what, the

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

113th Congress?  I think something like that.  And they 

2

have the first and second session.  That's how their 

3

records are based. 

4

 This is a considered judgment by both houses 

5

of the Legislative Branch as to what "session" means, 

6

and it seems to me that that has very powerful bearing 

7

on the question of inter and intrasession appointments 

8

that we are arguing, forget the  when the vacancy 

9

happens to arise. 

10

 And so why don't  why don't we defer to 

11

Congress as to what the term "session" means and say 

12

that this gives us guidance as to when the  there is a 

13

recess.  There is a recess between those sessions. 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I don't think that that's 

15

an interpretation that really could be squared with the 

16

body of contemporaneous evidence from the time of the 

17

framing.  And I would start with the text of the 

18

Constitution itself and the Adjournment Clause, which is 

19

at page 91a of the appendix to our brief. 

20

 And it  one thing it says is that, 

21

"Neither house during the session of the Congress shall, 

22

without consent of the other, adjourn for more than 3 

23

days."  It seems clear from that language that "the 

24

session of the Congress" is referring to the period that 

25

commences on the constitutionally prescribed date and

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

continues until the Congress adjourns sine die because, 

2

otherwise, these recesses wouldn't be during the session 

3

of the Congress. 

4

 It's also clear from this language that the 

5

framers at least contemplated the possibility of breaks 

6

longer than 3 days within sessions because they provided 

7

a mechanism to get permission to do it. 

8
9
10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But where does this 3day 

rule 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But you are relying on 

11

adjournment.  That  that  that does not have the 

12

word "recess" in 

13

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, that's right.  But 

14

I'm going back now to think about what "session" means 

15

in the Recess Appointment Clause where "the session" is 

16

also used.  I would submit, Your Honor, that it means 

17

the same thing as it means here, which is the full 

18

session of the Congress. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If it means the same 

20

thing, then what you are tying the two together, which 

21

actually might have some validity, but wouldn't that 

22

require the definition of a recess to be a period in 

23

which both houses have chosen to consent to an 

24

adjournment? 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, I don't think so

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because the dictionary definition then and now of recess 

2

is a suspension of business.  And you could have 

3

recesses of that kind, suspensions of business within 

4

sessions.  That's  Jefferson's parliamentary manual 

5

refers to recess by adjournment 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can you have an 

7

adjournment without a suspension of business?  Aren't 

8

the two the same? 

9

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I'm just talking 

10

now, Justice Sotomayor, if I may, about the 

11

intrasession recess point. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

tying the two together. 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But I'm talking about 

Right, but with respect 

15

to  putting the pro forma issue aside for a second, 

16

with respect to intrasession recesses, the meaning of 

17

the "session," it seems to me, is the session, the full 

18

session, because you can have  you can have recesses 

19

by adjournment, as Jefferson's parliamentary manual 

20

said. 

21

 And as I think I said earlier, there is 

22

quite substantial evidence that the term "the recess" at 

23

the time of the framing could refer to a break during a 

24

session and not just breaks between sessions.  So I just 

25

don't think there is contemporaneous evidence from the

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

framing generation that would lead you to conclude that 

2

intrasession recesses are not within the meaning of the 

3

word "recess." 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

the most surprising thing 

6

to me that you have said, and it's important, is not 

7

just the view of language at the time of the framing, 

8

but what the purpose of this clause was.  I mean, this 

9

is a very wellbriefed case, and I have looked at them. 

10

What, where is this 

I have read them, actually. 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay. 
And I'll tell you, I cannot find anything, so 

14

far, and I may have missed it  I'm asking  I can't 

15

find anything that says the purpose of this clause has 

16

anything at all to do with political fights between 

17

Congress and the President.  To the contrary, Hamilton 

18

says that the way we're going to appoint people in this 

19

country is Congress and the President have to agree. 

20

 Now, that's a political problem, not a 

21

constitutional problem, that agreement.  And it was just 

22

as much true of President George Bush, who made six 

23

appointments that happened previously, as it is with 

24

President Obama, who's made four.  All right? 

25

 So  so where  and he says this clause is

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a supplement, a supplement, to the basic clause to take 

2

care of the timing problem.  So, what have I missed? 

3

Where is it in the history of this clause, in its 

4

origination, that it has as a purpose to allow the 

5

President to try to overcome political disagreement? 

6

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I don't  I don't think 

7

that that's  I don't think that that  I don't think 

8

that's its purpose, but it is in the Constitution.  The 

9

President has the authority to make appointments 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, if it isn't a 

11

purpose, can you give me an example where the language, 

12

particularly that word "happen"  I mean, your example 

13

was a good one but I don't think it applies, but that's a 

14

different matter.  I can't  the language is over here. 

15

The number of appointments on "happen" is few.  If you 

16

are worried about James Tobin, Congress has passed a law 

17

that can be taken as looking at a vacancy occurring when 

18

it occurs within 30 days of the beginning of the recess, 

19

which would have taken care of Tobin. 

20

 So look at the language difficulty. 

Look at 

21

the comparatively small practice in that area.  Look at 

22

the other ways to get around the problem, and then give 

23

me another example in the Constitution where you have 

24

both language and purpose pointing one place and yet 

25

this Court because of practice has come to the opposite

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

conclusion. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I don't think that 

language points unambiguously in one direction. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

"Happen?"  Of course, 

5

battles happen.  That's because battles occur over time. 

6

Give me an example with the word "vacancy," where that 

7

word "vacancy" is used with the word "is," but not 

8

"occurred." 

9
10
11
12
13

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

A vacancy is an enduring 

state, and from the perspective of the 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But just give me an English 

example where it's natural to say 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I tried with my statutory 

14

example before, but from 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16
17

Your statutory example has 

to do with a battle, not a vacancy. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, it was an 

18

emergency.  It was the statutory example about a 

19

financial emergency that may happen, which is a state, 

20

just like the vacancy. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

A financial emergency, 

22

correct.  I'm sorry.  I'm asking you for an example with 

23

the word "vacancy."  That's what I am having trouble 

24

with. 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, a vacancy is an

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

enduring state.  From the perspective of the 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not talking about  I 

3

just say, could you find an example, and I'm gathering, 

4

from my answer, you couldn't. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7
8
9

Well, I think 
And  and I couldn't 

either. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Your Honor, maybe this 

statutory  maybe the language in the Constitution 

10

looks unambiguous to you now, but it has been the 

11

subject of contention, it has been thought to be 

12

ambiguous from the time of George Washington to the 

13

President  to the present. 

14

 And with respect to the question of the 

15

practice and there being  I don't think it's correct 

16

to assume that because there are a certain number of 

17

identified examples of preexisting vacancies being 

18

filled in our appendix, that that's a sum total.  I 

19

think this is far, far less than the sum total. It represents 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's been assumed 

21

to be  it's been assumed to be ambiguous by 

22

selfinterested Presidents. 

23

 (Laughter.) 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Of course.  Death is an 

enduring state.  But if someone dies in 1941, you don't

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say he died in 1945.  He's still dead. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

4
5
6
7

The fact  the fact 

that  the fact it happens 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But his death happened in 

1941. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But the fact that "may 

8

happen" is a phrase that isn't always apt to describe an 

9

enduring state doesn't mean it's never apt to 

10

describe an enduring state.  It's what Jefferson 

11

thought.  It's what  it's  it has been the 

12

understanding, since the framing, that there is 

13

ambiguity here and there 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Your  it's your 

15

argument  your friend on the other side says one flaw 

16

with your argument is that it makes the words "it may 

17

happen" or "happen during" superfluous, that the clause 

18

would mean exactly what you say it means if you took 

19

those words out. 

20

 And your response  the only one I could 

21

see on the reply  your reply brief, page 13, is that 

22

those words were put in there to quote, "confine the 

23

President to filling vacancies that actually exist at 

24

the time of appointment." 

25

 Now, is that  do you really think that

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they put that language in there because they were afraid 

2

the President would fill appointments that don't exist? 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I don't know why they put 

4

the language in there, Mr. Chief Justice, but it 

5

doesn't  it isn't superfluous because it does serve 

6

that function, whatever their intent. 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

One reason they could have 

8

put the language in is because they were afraid, 

9

otherwise, the President would have the power, simply, 

10

when somebody died two or three years before, and 

11

they've had a big fight in Congress to save up all the 

12

controversial nominations and then put them through as 

13

recess appointments.  That could be one thing they 

14

didn't want to happen.  I don't know.  You see, it's the 

15

same problem.  Same problem. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You do have  you do 

17

have the one that you relied on in your brief, and this 

18

understanding goes back at least to 1823, and the  the 

19

Wirt letter, Attorney General Wirt said, on the 

20

wording  maybe on the wording, the case is not strong. 

21

But the purpose, he said, you would be honoring the 

22

letter and defying the spirit.  That was the  on the 

23

question of the  when the vacancy 

24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And we don't disagree 

with that.  We think it's just what Wirt said.  It's 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

does no violence to the language and is consistent with 

2

the purpose of the  of the clause.  And from the 

3

from the perspective of the purpose of the clause, the 

4

office is equally vacant, whether that vacancy arose the 

5

day before or the day after the Senate went into recess. 

6

 The Senate is equally unavailable to act 

7

because they're dispersed, whether the vacancy arose the 

8

day before or the day after.  And the public's need that 

9

the office be filled so that the laws can be faithfully 

10

executed is the same whether the vacancy arose the day 

11

before or the day after. 

12
13
14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Before you  before 

you 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And so you do have that 

15

very established practice that is completely in accord 

16

with the purpose and the structure. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The  we sort of drifted 

18

away from the new  the new practice, the pro forma 

19

session.  And you were asked, suppose there was nothing 

20

in the resolution about they would conduct no business. 

21

It was an informal understanding that they wouldn't. 

22

But there is no express agreement that they're not going 

23

to conduct business.  Then do you lose on that part of 

24

the case? 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I think that's a way

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

harder case for us.  I would agree with that, Justice 

2

Ginsburg, and  but they're two things.  One is that 

3

formalities do matter; and two, going back to the point 

4

you made earlier, Justice Kagan, I think it's not an 

5

accident that there's a nobusiness order in place. 

6

 It's because that's what gives the Senators 

7

the protection to know that they can leave town without 

8

somebody else going to the 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Suppose it was  suppose it 

10

was the exact same nobusiness order, but the single 

11

senator who was there got up and asked for unanimous 

12

consent to name a post office, and every three days, he 

13

got up and said unanimous consent to name a post office. 

14

The post office is named. 

15

 So they can do  you know, trivial business 

16

in each of these sessions.  Would that make a 

17

constitutional difference? 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think if they did 

19

business each of the three days, then you wouldn't have 

20

a situation in which no business was conducted and you 

21

wouldn't meet the definition of a recess.  But that's a 

22

different case than this one. 

23
24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that, again, suggests 

that the rule that you're asking us to establish is 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is so easy to evade that why bother establishing it at 

2

all.  The fact that it's so easy to evade suggests that 

3

this really is  the question of how to define a recess 

4

really does belong to the Senate. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, I think the problem 

6

with looking at it that way, Justice Kagan, is that 

7

that's the end of the recess appointment power.  You 

8

write it out of the Constitution, if you look at it that 

9

way, because all the Senate needs to do is stay in pro 

10

forma session until 11:59 a.m., on January 3rd when that 

11

term ends and the next term starts, and then there are 

12

no intersession recesses 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I totally take your point on 

14

that.  But what I'm suggesting is they could just come 

15

back, and by naming post offices, have the same effect, 

16

that they would write it out of the  of the 

17

Constitution as much as you say this does. 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, this does.  This 

19

does.  And whether something else might or might not, I 

20

guess we could try to fight that out if the Senate were 

21

ever to do it.  But I assume, if this Court were to hold 

22

that pro forma sessions of this kind are not real and 

23

they don't defeat the President's recess appointment 

24

power, that maybe the Senate would think twice 

25

before doing something like that.

39

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what is significant is 

2

whether they're available to confirm nominees; isn't 

3

that right? 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
So suppose they say, instead 

6

of no business will be conducted, no nominations will be 

7

considered. 

8

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

9

case because they would be 

10
11
12

That would be a different 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I know it would be a 

different case, but 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

 they would be there 

13

they would be here.  You know, they're not  they're in 

14

business for something. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So what?  The point of the 

16

question is whether they're available to consider 

17

nominations.  So if they say, we'll do other business, 

18

but no nominations will be considered, why isn't it 

19

exactly the same for purposes of the Recess Appointments 

20

Clause? 

21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It's not because the 

22

recess  or the definition of recess is when no 

23

business shall be conducted.  And that's exactly what 

24

the Senate said.  If I may reserve the balance of my 

25

time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO 

4

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

5

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

6

it please the Court: 

7

Thank you, General. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 The Advice and Consent Clause imposes an 

8

important check on executive power.  Each of our three 

9

arguments preserves that check, and provides a separate 

10

and independent basis for affirming the court below. 

11

 The government's position, in contrast, 

12

would eviscerate that check, creating a unilateral 

13

appointment power available for every vacancy at 

14

virtually any time with advice and consent to be used 

15

only when convenient to the President. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But your argument would 

17

destroy the recess clause.  There would be  under your 

18

argument, it is totally  totally within the hands of 

19

the Senate to abolish any and all recess appointments. 

20

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And that 

21

reflects the fact that the recess appointment power is a 

22

contingent one.  It arises only when the Senate chooses 

23

to trigger it by ending its session and beginning its 

24

recess.  So the Senate always has the power to prevent 

25

recess appointments.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The Constitution, however, gives the 

2

President corresponding powers.  If the President thinks 

3

that the Senate is being derelict in its duties, he can 

4

convene an emergency session, and he can force the 

5

Senate to consider his nominees. 

6

 And if they refuse, he can subject them to 

7

withering criticism for being derelict in their 

8

responsibilities.  But one  the one thing that the 

9

President may not do is force the Senate to act against 

10

its will, nor should the President be permitted to do 

11

and run around the Senate's refusal to act, because that 

12

conception of the Recess Appointments Clause is at war 

13

with advice and consent itself. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I ask you a variant of 

15

the question that Justice Scalia asked General Verrilli? 

16

Suppose we think that the language in the Constitution 

17

is perfectly clear in some respect, but that there is a 

18

200yearold consistent practice, agreement by the 

19

President, going back to Washington and by the Senate 

20

that the language actually means something else.  What 

21

would we do in that situation? 

22

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Your Honor, I think that the 

23

language has to govern.  And I would like to address the 

24

issue about the consequences of a ruling in our favor in 

25

this case.  Of course, if you were to rule on the third

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question presented, it wouldn't call into question any 

2

past recess appointments at all, given the unprecedented 

3

nature of the appointments at issue in this case. 

4

 But, frankly, if you ruled on the first two 

5

questions, I don't think it would be particularly 

6

disruptive in terms of calling into question the 

7

decisions of past appointees. 

8

 Justice Sotomayor, to take the Article III 

9

courts, for example, since 1960, there have only been 

10

four potentially improper appointments to the Article 

11

III court's recess appointments.  Each of them served 

12

approximately a year or less.  Three were to the court 

13

of appeals, one to a Federal district court judge in 

14

1981. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Francisco, I'm sorry, 

16

but could we go back to Justice Alito's question? 

17

Because I really have the same issue with your argument. 

18

 You know, suppose that on one  let's say 

19

the "happens" argument, that yours is at least the most 

20

natural reading of the statute, at least the way we 

21

understand the word "happen" today, and maybe a 

22

compelled reading, but the history points so much in the 

23

other direction; and that that history brings with it a 

24

whole set of practices and traditions and ways of 

25

dealing with each other that has grown around a certain

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

interpretation of what "happens" means, right? 
 The idea that we would wake up one fine 

3

morning and chuck all of that because all of a sudden we 

4

happened to read the clause, I mean, that at least needs 

5

to be defended. 

6

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor, and I 

7

believe that the relevant history actually supports us, 

8

that is the history at the time of the founding. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I know, but now, you're 

10

you're again  I mean, assume that there is a 

11

200yearold established practice, everybody has agreed 

12

to it, but the text, when you really look at it, points 

13

the other way. 

14

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor.  I would 

15

dispute the premises, but I will accept the premises for 

16

the purposes of the question.  The political branches of 

17

the government have no authority to give or take away 

18

the structural protections of the Constitution.  They 

19

don't exist to protect the Senate from the President or 

20

the President from the Senate. 

21

 These are libertyprotecting provisions that 

22

protect the people from the government as a whole.  So 

23

if the Constitution is quite clear as to what those 

24

structural protections are, but the political branches, 

25

assuming for the sake of argument, have conspired to

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deplete them, that is illegitimate, and it should be 

2

rejected by this Court. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

assumes something, which is 

5

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that  but that 

Yes, Your Honor. 
 let's go back to the 

7

"happenings" words  that is so unambiguous, that they 

8

knew it was unambiguous, but 200year history, starting 

9

with President Washington, who filled two vacancies that 

10

occurred before the Senate broke, to every  almost 

11

every President thereafter has done the same. 

12

 So why should we conclude that today's 

13

understanding is the same as the understanding of the 

14

Founding Fathers?  Why don't we take their unbroken 

15

practice as giving us that definition? 

16

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor, a couple of 

17

different responses.  First of all, we dispute the 

18

government's historical account of President 

19

Washington's and the first four Presidents' position 

20

actions.  But even putting that aside here, everyone who 

21

actually spoke to and addressed the issue at the time 

22

agreed that the text means precisely what it says, 

23

including President Madison, who refused to make a 

24

recess appointment to Andrew Jackson, the hero of the 

25

War of 1812, precisely because the vacancy had arisen

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

during the Senate's session and in its recess. 
 Second, we also don't have an unbroken and 

3

nevercontested practice.  Indeed, the Senate has 

4

regularly resisted.  In 1863, the Senate passed the Pay 

5

Act, which prohibited pay to any appointee to a 

6

preexisting vacancy.  So you don't have a kind of 

7

uniform  uniformlyheld practice. 

8

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Let me ask you this: 

9

Suppose that we were to conclude that the history is 

10

simply too overwhelming to rule in your favor on the 

11

"happens" problem.  Could we still use history to say 

12

that  or overlook history to rule for you on the 

13

inter/intrasession point? 

14

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

17
18
19
20

Yes, Your Honor. 
How do we do that? 
From the time of the 

founding 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is it because of the 

80 years or 
 MR. FRANCISCO: 

I think it's longer than 

21

that.  From the time of the founding until, I would say, 

22

1948, there was a uniform understanding that the recess 

23

and the session as used in the clause were interchanging 

24

periods.  You were either in recess or you were in 

25

session.  And so an appointment made during the recess

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

lasted until the end of the next session. 
 Now, in 1921, Attorney General Doherty's 

3

opinion kind of muddled things a bit because he assumed 

4

that, if you took a long break in the midst of a long 

5

session, it broke that break into two recesses for the 

6

purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause.  But you 

7

still had that dichotomous view subject to the arguable 

8

and quite ambiguous exception of President Andrew 

9

Johnson. 

10

 So what you see is from the time of the 

11

founding until 1921 there were some 63 midsession 

12

breaks, all longer than 3 days, so all recesses under 

13

the government's definition.  Yet during that entire 

14

period, with the arguable exception of Andrew Johnson, 

15

no President ever attempted to make a recess 

16

appointment. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Francisco, tell me if I 

18

am wrong about this, but it seems to me that 

19

intrasession recesses really only arose in the 1940s or 

20

so, right?  There is the period with Andrew Johnson and 

21

Andrew Johnson used intrarecess  intrasession 

22

recesses to make a lot of appointments.  Other than 

23

that, intrasession recesses of more than 3 days that 

24

are not Christmas simply do not exist. 

25

 So that assume that as intrasession

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

recesses came to be, Presidents started making 

2

appointments in them. 

3

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Let me address it this way. 

4

I'm not sure I agree with the factual understanding, 

5

Your Honor.  There were intrasession recesses longer 

6

than 3 days prior to 1867.  I think there were some 10 

7

of them prior to 1867, including 7 that were longer than 

8

10 days.  And bear in mind, yes, they were Christmas 

9

recesses, but so were the ones at issue in this case. 

10

They were Christmas recess appointments. 

11

 But I do take your point that intrasession 

12

recess appointments did not become very common  or I 

13

should say it this way:  Intrasession recess 

14

appointments did not become very common until the  really 

15

they started with Truman, but then they broke off for a 

16

long time with three Presidents, Johnson, Kennedy, and 

17

Ford, making no midsession recess appointments. 

18

 Then beginning in the Carter and the Reagan 

19

Administrations is when they became very common and 

20

particularly a very common way to do an endrun around 

21

advice and consent. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What happened in that 

23

period at around 1970 is that's about the first time 

24

that you have intrasession  an intrasession recess 

25

that's longer than an intersession recess.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And so now if we look from 1970 on, that's 

2

fairly common.  And so all that's happening is that the 

3

Presidents are appointing recess appointees during 

4

periods where they are out for a longer time.  Now, how 

5

are we supposed to go and say that this thing 

6

thousands of people on the recess part  is 

7

unconstitutional? 

8
9
10

 I mean, it isn't unheard of. 

What about the 

Due Process Clause?  Does that easily cover the 
language?  Substantive due process. 

11

 What about the Interstate Commerce Clause 

12

and the doctrine of  you know, the implicit clause 

13

there?  I mean, it isn't unheard of that over time 

14

language in the Constitution takes on a somewhat 

15

different meaning. 

16

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
How do we  I mean, 

18

probably different judges have different approaches. 

19

But if I'm concerned about the basic practicality and 

20

the basic objective here, why would I agree with you? 

21

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor.  I 

22

certainly am not going to attempt to purport to resolve 

23

this Court's differences on those issues, but on 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

 unless you are not going

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

to let me off the hook, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The two examples that 

3

Justice Breyer gives are examples where we gave it a 

4

meaning that was different from what it said. 

5

 (Laughter.) 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7
8
9

We don't have a case 

involving this particular issue yet. 
 MR. FRANCISCO: 

That's precisely correct, 

Your Honor.  And it reflects the fact that the Recess 

10

Appointments Clause and the Appointments Clause and all 

11

of the structural protections, again, are not meant to 

12

protect the branches against one another. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If I do place more 

14

weight on this, should we  I mean, I do believe and 

15

agree with you to this point that this is basically a 

16

matter of politics for other branches basically.  That 

17

doesn't help me resolve this.  But it does lead over to 

18

this possibility.  Congress did pass the No Pay Act. 

19

And then they passed the Pay Act.  And in that Pay Act on this 

20

"happen" part, which I think is the strongest  very 

21

strong for your side, but it defines the vacancy in 

22

terms of 30 days prior to the recess. 

23

 And that would take care of most of these. 

24

see, if vacancy could be defined as something that 

25

stretches, because Congress says it stretches in terms

50

Alderson Reporting Company

You 

Official

1

of pay for 30 days. 

2

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

4
5

Right. 
What do you think of that? 

And I would love to know what the SG thinks of it. 
 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor.  A couple 

6

of different responses.  First, of course, the third 

7

question calls into question no past recess appointees, 

8

the third question. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The third question, by the 

10

way, just put in your mind, if you digress in your 

11

answer, put in your mind what would have happened in 

12

1830 if someone, when they had a 9month recess, close 

13

to 10 months, someone had the bright idea, well, you 

14

live near Washington; go show up at wherever we are 

15

holding our sessions and sit there for 5 minutes, and 

16

we'll stop President Andrew Jackson from making recess 

17

appointments.  What would we be saying then? 

18

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Sure.  Well, I will put my 

19

finger on that question and answer your first question 

20

first as to the Pay Act in 1940.  The Pay Act of 1940, 

21

in our view, clearly repudiates the government's 

22

intersession view for the reason you put your finger 

23

on.  It ties pay to appointments being made either right 

24

before or after the session ends. 

25

 So most midsession recess appointees can't

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

get paid under the Pay Act. 
 With respect to the second question 

3

presented, at best it creates three exceptions to the 

4

general rule against any pay to any preexisting 

5

appointees, so you have got somewhat of a compromise.  I 

6

would say that is no more Senate acquiescence in the 

7

President's position than the President's acquiescence 

8

in the Senate's position when he signed that law.  So to 

9

me that's a jump ball. 

10

 Coming back to your historical example, I 

11

think it reflects the fact that the Recess Appointments 

12

Clause is not about timing, it's not a temporal issue; 

13

it's about procedure.  What it does is it creates a 

14

contingent power that arises when the Senate decides to 

15

trigger it. 

16

 Back at the time of the founding, the 

17

senators wanted to trigger that power.  It was important 

18

to trigger that power, because when they were gone, the 

19

President needed to be able to act unilaterally, unless 

20

they wanted to be subject to a recall in emergency 

21

sessions every time he needed to confirm nominees.  They 

22

obviously didn't want that. 

23

 Today, the situation has changed; not the 

24

principle, but the historical context.  And today, the 

25

Senators can get back to Washington, D.C. very easily.

They are there for much less 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Suppose  suppose we 

3

have an intersession break.  It's three days.  On your 

4

reading of the Recess Clause, in that three days, the 

5

President can fill up vacancies. 

6

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor, because 

7

under the second question presented, there would not be 

8

very many vacancies in that context, because the vacancy 

9

would have to 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, leave out the 

11

second question.  Just on  the first question, 

12

because it seems to me that if the rationale was when 

13

Congress was out of town for 6, 9 months, of course, the 

14

President has to be able to make the government work. 

15

 But now you're saying that in that time, 

16

it's only three days, they are going to be there 

17

available very soon to confirm.  And let's say 

18

somebody  somebody dies on day 1.  The President puts 

19

in  makes an appointment on day 2.  You would say 

20

that's okay? 

21

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor, but I 

22

first of all, I'd say I don't think you can really 

23

separate it from the second question presented because 

24

that's why  it explains why it wouldn't have been much 

25

of a problem.  Very few vacancies would arise during a

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3day break, and so there wouldn't be that much of an 

2

opportunity to make those kinds of appointments. 

3

 Let's put that aside. 

Let me assume you 

4

reject my argument on the second question presented. 

5

Then you're really in the world of the 1905 Senate 

6

report when they were dealing with President Roosevelt's 

7

midnight recess appointments, where he made them 

8

in between gavel drops. 

9

 If you reject our argument on the second 

10

question, then I do think that you may need to confront 

11

the notion that an intersession recess is too short to 

12

make recess appointments.  Not at issue in this case, 

13

because here the appointments came on January 4th, the 

14

day after Congress commenced the second session.  So by 

15

anyone's definition, this was an intrasession recess 

16

appointment, not an intersession recess appointment. 

17

 And all of this really reflects the fact 

18

that the Recess Appointments Clause is a contingent 

19

power that arises only when the Senate triggers it, 

20

which is what gives the Senate the power to prevent the 

21

President from making recess appointments. 

22

 If I could turn back to the consequences 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, before you do 

24

so, I mean, is the Senate's power, in your view, so 

25

comprehensive that if they passed an order saying, we're

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

actually never in recess, people can be reached  you 

2

know, we can call people back.  So for purposes of the 

3

Recess Clause, we are never in recess. 

4

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Your Honor, under the first 

5

question presented, I think the answer is, yes, they 

6

could do that, because it really is the Senate's ability 

7

to trigger the power. 

8
9

 It's  in a sense, the Recess Appointments 
Clause is of a piece with the Inferior Officer's Clause. 

10

The Senate always has the power of advice and consent, 

11

but what the President can do  what the Senate can do 

12

is authorize the President to act unilaterally in 

13

certain circumstances. 

14

 It can authorize the President to act 

15

unilaterally with respect to inferior officers and it 

16

can authorize the President to act unilaterally in 

17

certain time periods where it ends its session and 

18

begins its recess.  So it's always within the Senate's 

19

power.  And that's precisely why advice and consent 

20

serves as an important check. 

21

 On the third question presented, I think 

22

where you're deciding whether or not a session is a real 

23

session, then, no, I don't think the Senate could do 

24

that.  I think that it's for the Court to look at the 

25

Senate's journal to see what the facts are, and those

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

facts must be taken by this Court as undisputed. 
 So if those facts show that there was a 

3

Senator who actually gaveled them into session each day, 

4

and that during that period they were capable of 

5

conducting business, as they were here at every session 

6

that they held every three days, then this Court would 

7

have to take those facts as a given. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could you  could you 

tell  let's go back to this.  What's your definition 

10

of a recess?  When the Senate actually says we're taking 

11

a recess 

12

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14

consent of the House or not? 

15

Yes, Your Honor. 
 whether it got the 

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

It's when the Senate 

16

again, it depends on which question you're talking 

17

about.  On the first question presented, the recess of 

18

the Senate is the period between when the Senate says 

19

that it is ending its session through an adjournment 

20

sine die, and the period when it begins its next 

21

session, as the clause says. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

Does it have to do that? 

By what command does it have to do that? 

24

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sine die? 
Yes.

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

It does not 
No.  Sine die or any 
It does not have to adjourn 

4

sine die.  That, though, in this country, is the way 

5

that the Senate has traditionally signaled to the 

6

President that it was ending its session.  And I think 

7

that's what it would have to do. 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

of the House to do that? 

10

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12
13

Does it need the consent 

Yes, Your Honor, it does. 
So  so does it have to 

do that in between the two congressional sessions? 
 MR. FRANCISCO: 

I don't  I think  no, I 

14

don't think it has to.  I think the Senate can adopt its 

15

own rules for determining how it ends its session and 

16

how it begins a new one.  I think the important point, 

17

though, is it has to communicate that to the President. 

18

 So, for example, during President Madison's 

19

time, the tradition was the Senate would dispatch a 

20

committee to the President to inform this President that 

21

it had ended its session.  So the President now knew 

22

that it was in recess and the powers that imbue upon the 

23

President during that recess had been triggered, the 

24

recess appointment power. 

25

 Here, ruling on our  in our favor on the

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

third question would, of course, call in the question no 

2

past appointees.  But I would like to 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

On the first question, does 

4

your argument depend on the fact that  on the 

5

assumption that the  the possibility of a lengthy 

6

intrasession break was never even contemplated by those 

7

who framed and  and ratified the Constitution? 

8

Because if they had thought about that, there's a real 

9

chance the Senate may take a twomonth break 

10

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Right. 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 over Christmas.  Would 

12

there be any reason why they wouldn't have wanted the 

13

recess appointment power to apply there as well as at 

14

the end of the session? 

15

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Your Honor, our argument 

16

does not turn on that because to us, it is not a 

17

temporal question; it's a procedural one.  Back then, 

18

the Senate had the power not to trigger the recess; just 

19

like today, it has the power not to trigger the recess 

20

appointments power. 

21

 The difference is not in principle; it's in 

22

historical context.  At the time of the framing, they 

23

wanted to trigger the recess appointments power because 

24

when they left during long periods of time, they wanted 

25

the President to be able to act unilaterally since it

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was very difficult for them to get back.  And if they 

2

didn't trigger the power, the only way the President 

3

could act unilaterally would  the only way the 

4

President could confirm nominees would be by convening 

5

an emergency session.  Highly inconvenient. 

6

 The historical facts today have changed. 

7

Not the principle, but the surrounding facts.  And 

8

today, it is very easy for the senators to get back to 

9

Washington, D.C., and so they don't want to trigger a 

10

unilateral power.  They're perfectly willing to be 

11

hailed back if necessary. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I'm  I'm not sure I 

13

understand the answer.  If the purpose is to permit the 

14

President to fill vacancies when the Senate is 

15

unavailable to consider nominations and the country 

16

would be harmed by having these offices vacant for a 

17

period of time, why would that not apply to any lengthy 

18

break, whether it's at the end of the session or in the 

19

middle of the session? 

20

 And so if you're arguing that it only 

21

applies at the end of the session, doesn't that depend 

22

on the assumption that they never thought about the 

23

possibility that there would be a lengthy break in the 

24

middle of the session? 

25

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Your Honor, it is possible

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that they never thought about it.  But even if they had, 

2

I don't think it would matter, because I think that 

3

that the purpose that you've laid out is not quite the 

4

full purpose of the clause.  The purpose was also to 

5

ensure that the President could not easily do an endrun 

6

around advice and consent, which after all is the 

7

principal method of appointment. 

8
9

 And so what they did, as they did with 
respect to inferior officers, is they vested with the 

10

Senate the power in certain circumstances to authorize 

11

the President to act unilaterally.  With respect to 

12

recesses, that authority was triggered when the Senate 

13

decided to end its session.  The Senate did, for 

14

example, take 7 midsession breaks of longer than 10 

15

days prior to 1867.  It is inconceivable to me that the 

16

senators at that time believed that they were entering 

17

into a recess that would have empowered the President to 

18

make unilateral appointments during those 10, 11, or 

19

12day periods.  And that reflects the fact that the 

20

Recess Appointments Clause is a  is a contingent one 

21

that arises when the Senate triggers it. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Francisco, can I ask a 

23

question about the second question presented, the 

24

"happens" question? 

25

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Yes, Your Honor.

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And if you put aside all the 

2

history and you look only at the language and you look 

3

only at our own modern view of what happens, that surely 

4

seems to favor your position. 

5

 But  you know, given all the statements 

6

in the founding period itself about how this is 

7

ambiguous and it might have two meanings, if you look at 

8

the dictionaries of that time  so I went back and I 

9

looked at the Oxford English Dictionary, and one of the 

10

definitions of "happens" there is "chance to be," 

11

essentially the exact same definition that Thomas 

12

Jefferson said made this ambiguous. 

13

 And we would never use "happens" in that way 

14

now.  If you look at the examples that the Oxford 

15

English gives, they're laughable.  Nobody would ever say 

16

that now.  But it just suggested to me that maybe what 

17

we think is pretty clear is only pretty clear because 

18

one meaning of "happens" has  you know, over 

19

200 years 

20

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Sure. 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 lapsed. 

22

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

Well, Your Honor, I actually 

23

think the word "happens" had the same meaning then as it 

24

does now, which is why at the time of the framing 

25

everyone who actually studied the issue  Madison,

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Hamilton, both of the first two attorneys general, 

2

Edmund Randolph and Charles Lee  agreed that it meant 

3

what it said, as did even 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, I don't think so, right. 

5

Essentially, Thomas Jefferson says it could mean one 

6

thing or the other, and the other thing that he said, 

7

which is "happens to exist," is sort of exactly this old 

8

definition, which is "happens" means "chance to be." 

9

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

And then Jefferson in his 

10

other letters conceded that the Recess Appointments 

11

Clause as it stood was going to frustrate his ability to 

12

make appointments.  And he therefore described 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I  I think "happens" 

14

continues to mean "chances to be."  We still use it that 

15

way.  But we only use it that way when it is followed by 

16

an infinitive.  "I happened to see him," it means a 

17

chance that I saw him.  Or  you know, 9/11, the 

18

destruction of the Twin Towers happened to occur on 

19

9/11.  But you wouldn't say  you wouldn't say it 

20

happened on  on 9/13, simply because it continued to 

21

be destroyed. 

22

 I don't know what the OED examples that 

23

Justice Kagan referred to were, but I bet they  they 

24

used "happen" followed by an infinitive, and I think we 

25

still use it that way.

62

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You know, I don't remember 

2

them exactly.  I just remember kind of laughing at them, 

3

as things that 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

remember what they were 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9
10

 and they were 1483 and 

"obsolete." 
 (Laughter.) 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

 nobody would say 

1490something, and then there was an asterisk that said 

11

13

Actually, I think I 

And in fact  in fact, I 

couldn't figure out what they were talking about. 
 MR. FRANCISCO: 

And, yes, Your Honor, but in 

15

addition, though, there  there is not just the word 

16

"happen."  It's preceded by three other words, that 

17

"vacancies that may happen."  And the only purpose that 

18

those words serve is to constrain the universe of 

19

vacancies that are eligible for a recess appointment. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, the Constitution as 

21

it  as it first was has now been amended and it is no 

22

longer a part of the Constitution, with reference to 

23

appointment of Senate, uses the word "vacancy" in much 

24

the same way as the clause we're discussing here, and I 

25

think favors your position, because if a vacancy happens

63

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

by resignation during the recess of the legislature then 

2

the governor can make the appointment.  And you 

3

certainly wouldn't think that that could happen over 3 

4

days 

5

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

7

say occur over 3 days. 

8
9

Exactly, Your Honor 
 occur over  I should 

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

And  and it's even better 

than that because at the time of the framing, a 

10

legislator  a governor tried to appoint somebody to 

11

the Senate pursuant to that clause that had arisen 

12

where the vacancy had arisen during the legislative 

13

session rather than during the legislative recess, and 

14

the Senators actually refused to seat that individual. 

15

 So, yes, that further supports our position 

16
17

on that. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Do you want to say anything 

18

before the  about the  the language on the "happen," 

19

I support you. 

20

 But the  the practice, and in particular, 

21

the practicalities, because you say, well, the President 

22

can make an acting appointment, make a recess 

23

appointment even.  I mean  you know, they have much 

24

less authority, somebody appointed in that way, much 

25

less than a person who's been confirmed by the Senate.

64

Alderson Reporting Company

1

So if the government won't grind to a halt, it still 

2

faces a problem. 

3

 MR. FRANCISCO: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5
6

And Your Honor 
What do you want to say 

about that? 
 MR. FRANCISCO: 

That's a consequence of 

7

advice and consent.  That problem arises not just when 

8

the Senate takes breaks, but when the Senate is in 

9

session.  The Senate could show up every day for an 

10

hour, sit at their desks, and announce to the President: 

11

We're not going to do anything, no nominations, no 

12

legislation, because we don't like what you're doing. 

13

And by the way, the only reason we're showing up here at 

14

our desks and sitting here for one hour a day is because 

15

we don't want you to be able to make recess 

16

appointments. 

17

 Nobody would claim that the Senate was in 

18

recess during those sessions.  Well, that is effectively 

19

what it was doing here. 

20

 I would, though, like to address the 

21

practicality issue.  I talked about how there have only 

22

been four recess appointments to the Article III courts 

23

that are potentially invalid since 1960.  I likewise 

24

don't think, if you were to rule in our favor on the 

25

first two questions, that it would be particularly

65

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

disruptive to the Executive Branch either. 
 If you look at the government's appendix, I 

3

would hazard to say that most of those officials 

4

probably don't exercise much, if any, agency rulemaking 

5

or adjudicatory power at all.  But as to those who do, 

6

going forward the government can solve the problem 

7

through agency ratification of past decisions.  Going 

8

backward, there are a variety of doctrines that would 

9

limit anybody's ability to actually challenge those past 

10

actions, including, for example, the APA's 6year 

11

statute of limitations on challenging final agency 

12

action, various finality rules that would prohibit a 

13

party from raising an issue that they could have but 

14

failed to raise in an earlier proceeding, and various 

15

justiciability doctrines, like mootness, standing, and, 

16

Your Honor, the de facto officer doctrine, at least 

17

outside of the context of direct appeal. 

18

 I think this constellation of issues 

19

probably explains why this is the first time this issue 

20

has reached this Court in 225 years.  This is not to say 

21

that a ruling in our favor on the first two questions 

22

wouldn't have any past impact.  It would undoubtedly 

23

have some.  But as this Court's decisions in cases like 

24

Chadha and Booker and Blakely make clear, this Court has 

25

never shied away from enforcing the strictures of the

66

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Constitution simply because it could have some impact on 

2

prior cases. 

3

 Here the structural protections of the 

4

Constitution exist to protect the liberty of the people. 

5

They were clearly transgressed with these unprecedented 

6

appointments, and therefore we believe that the court 

7

below should be affirmed.

9

 I am happy to answer any additional 
questions that Your Honors may have.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

11

 Mr. Estrada. 

12

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA, 

13
14
15
16
17

Thank you, counsel. 

 FOR SENATE REPUBLICAN LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL, ET AL., 
 AS AMICI CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. ESTRADA: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 As Justice Kagan recognized earlier in the 

18

argument, this case fundamentally is about who gets to 

19

decide whether the Senate is in recess, the Senate or 

20

the President?  Our submission today is that the Senate 

21

gets to decide whether the Senate is in recess. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Estrada, you said in 

23

your brief that that was true within wide limits.  What 

24

are the wide limits? 

25

 MR. ESTRADA: 

This is  this is all about

67

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

how the Senate chooses to arrange its affairs, Justice 

2

Kagan, under the Rules of Proceedings Act. 

3

 And what the Court said in the Ballin case 

4

was that the exercise of rulemaking authority by 

5

Congress was almost absolute and beyond the challenge of 

6

any body or tribunal unless it usurped some independent 

7

constitutional authority. 

8
9

 The only possible offer here that the 
Solicitor General has as to how the Constitution could 

10

have been violated by the actions of the Senate in 

11

arranging its own affairs is the notion that this has 

12

invaded the purported recess appointments power of the 

13

President. 

14

 And the reason, as we say in our brief, why 

15

that is completely insubstantial is because, as the 

16

Solicitor General recognizes in the closing two pages of 

17

its brief, the Senate by the design of the Constitution, 

18

the Appointments Clause, the primary method of 

19

appointment, has an absolute veto over nominations. 

20

 The Framers could not have been more clear 

21

that the standard power of appointment was a joint power 

22

of appointment.  And therefore, the Solicitor General is 

23

forced to concede that this appointment power, this 

24

right that the President is asserting here as a stop on 

25

the exercise of the rulemaking authority, is a

68

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

subsidiary power that only arises if the government 

2

if the Senate, excuse me, chooses to recess. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is the Chief Justice's 

4

example before, if the Senate just said, we're  we're 

5

never in recess for purposes of appointments, would that 

6

be permissible? 

7

 MR. ESTRADA: 

If the Senate says, we're 

8

never in recess, and the Senate then is not in recess so 

9

that it can exercise the duties of its office as it 

10

does here, yes, it would be.  If the Senate says, we're 

11

checking out and going to Hawaii, we'll never again be 

12

in Washington, Kona is very nice this time of year, that 

13

would not be permissible, because, A, the Adjournment 

14

Clause requires the consent of the House for the Senate 

15

to be not only gone for 3 days but to be in a different 

16

place. 

17

 And  and second  you know, the Senate 

18

cannot leave  you know, the chamber, and  other than 

19

with the  with the consent of the House.  And maybe if 

20

the Senate has effectively given up  you know, the 

21

business of legislating, in that case, maybe the 

22

President could say that it is, quote, a "recess." 

23

 Now, the fundamental problem with the 

24

President's position here is twofold.  We have Senate 

25

records.  There is  the Journal Clause of the

69

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Constitution directs each house of the Congress to have 

2

a journal of its proceedings.  The Journal of the 

3

Senate, which is in relevant part printed in our 

4

appendix, shows that on each of the disputed dates the 

5

Senate was called to order and then adjourned.  It is an 

6

official record of the Senate.  It says the Senate was 

7

called to order and then adjourned. 

8
9

 It doesn't say two guys who happened to be 
Senators met at a bar and had a beer.  The official 

10

records of the Senate say the Senate was called to order 

11

and adjourned.  And under the Rules of Proceedings 

12

Clause, that ought to be conclusive, full stop. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's the end of it, 

14

exactly the same, if this all took place during the 

15

9month intersession recess in 1835. 

16
17
18
19

 MR. ESTRADA: 

It would be the same, unless 

the Senate chooses to recess. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, no.  Exactly, same 

facts.  Same facts. 

20

 MR. ESTRADA: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right. 
And, therefore, in your 

22

view, the clause, even if they were all scattered to the 

23

winds in 1835, there would have been not possible for 

24

President Andrew Jackson, if I have that right, to make 

25

the recess appointments.

70

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. ESTRADA: 

Justice Breyer, the executive 

2

at the time could have attempted to construct the same 

3

type of argument that the executive is trying to 

4

construct here 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  But your view would 

be the Court should reject it. 
 MR. ESTRADA: 

Yes.  But  but here, it is 

8

even a weaker argument because one of the oddities of 

9

the case is that as the Senate has  and the country 

10

have all moved into the modern age, the rules of the 

11

Senate tend to provide for the Senate to be available at 

12

the drop of a hat. 

13

 If you look, for example, at Rule 9, you can 

14

always get  you know, the communications from 

15

Houses  from the House or from the executive.  If you 

16

look at Rule 26 of the Senate, committees can meet 

17

whether or not the chamber is actually in session. 

18

 You know, the business of the Senate is 

19

ongoing; and therefore, in the modern world, it is even 

20

much, much, much different than even the hypothetical 

21

that you posited. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You say anything that 

23

would  on this, if you want to, that would turn it 

24

back to the practicalities.  Imagine, hypothetically, 

25

that I would have thought President Theodore Roosevelt

71

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

acted unconstitutionally when he tried to make all of 

2

his appointments, dozens and dozens, during a 

3

twosecond 

4

 MR. ESTRADA: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

Yes, yes 

intersession 

7

 MR. ESTRADA: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 MR. ESTRADA: 

10

In 1903. 

Yes, constructive recess. 
Yes, yes. 
Well 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And by converse reasoning, 

11

the Congress would not have been able, in 1835, to 

12

prevent recess appointments simply by having a nearby 

13

senator show up for a  for one second, once every 3 

14

days, over a 9month period. 

15
16
17

 It seems to me what goes around comes around 
in this  in this 
 MR. ESTRADA: 

Well, let me  let me take 

18

that as an opportunity because I think it does 

19

raise  you know, the question to speak to the 

20

implication that the Solicitor General makes in his 

21

brief, that the Senate, as a body, doesn't have a view 

22

on whether it was in recess or in session. 

23

 For the reason that I started out by 

24

outlouding  by outlining  excuse me  the Senate's 

25

official records do show that the Senate was in session

72

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on each date, and therefore, the Senate does have an 

2

official view. 

3

 But from the practical point of view, we do 

4

know that the Senate has a view on these things.  And 

5

how do we know?  The President's party controls the 

6

Senate.  If the Senate wanted to recess, Rule 22nd of 

7

the Senate says that's not a debatable proposition. 

8
9

 If a majority of the Senate wants to recess, 
even before the evolution of the filibuster, 

10

nondebatable proposition.  So the Senate says, which is 

11

controlled by the President's party, says, we want to 

12

recess, we want to go away, we don't care if the 

13

President has this power.  They vote for that.  House 

14

says no.  What happens then? 

15

 Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution, 

16

the fight goes to the President, and it is in that event 

17

that the President gets to adjourn them until such date 

18

as he shall see proper. 

19

 So if the Senate had any view that it wanted 

20

to recess, they could have had a vote, and the issue 

21

would have ended up in the White House, in the lap of 

22

the President.  He had plenary constitutional power to 

23

give himself an intersession recess by terminating the 

24

session and have a real recess appointment power if he 

25

could find somebody whose vacancy had actually arisen at

73

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the time. 
 But this is the cockeyed way of going about 

3

the instruments of the Constitution.  There is no power 

4

in the Constitution to use the Recess Appointments 

5

Clause to overcome the opposition of the Senate to the 

6

President's nominees.  And for all that we hear about 

7

today, which has to do with how the heaven will fall, 

8

and the parade of horribles, there is no parade, and 

9

there is no horrible. 

10

 The only thing that will happen is that the 

11

President, heaven help us, will be forced to comply with 

12

the advice and consent that the appointments power 

13

excuse me  the Appointments Clause actually calls for. 

14

That was not viewed as an evil by the Framers.  That was 

15

what the Framers unanimously agreed was going to be the 

16

principal means for appointments for the principal 

17

officers of the union. 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Estrada 
If there is a 3day 

20

recess between sessions, then your argument is that is 

21

that is a recess and the President can make  can make 

22

appointments in that time. 

23

 MR. ESTRADA: 

Justice Ginsburg, that is a 

24

very interesting and somewhat difficult question.  On 

25

the facts of this case, there is a substantial question,

74

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which no one really has litigated, as to whether there 

2

was, in fact, an intersession recess, whether the first 

3

session of the 112th Congress ended on the morning of 

4

January 3rd and therefore, we have the same Teddy 

5

Roosevelt situation, or whether by adjourning on 

6

December 30th and contemplating no further meetings 

7

until January 3rd, whether that in effect  in effect 

8

was a sine die adjournment that ended the first session 

9

of the Congress. 

10

 If the President had the same view about the 

11

nature of the pro forma sessions, he could have taken 

12

the view about the sessions between December 17th and 

13

January 3rd and could have had a better legal argument 

14

in attempting to claim that between December 30th and 

15

January 3rd, there was at least an arguable 

16

intersession recess.  And he did not do that. 

17

 Why didn't he? 

Because by waiting until the 

18

convening of the first session  of the second session 

19

of the 112th Congress, by making an appointment on 

20

January 4th instead of the morning of January 3rd, he 

21

gives an extra year to his appointees to serve.  That 

22

shows that this is, indeed, the bottom of the slippery 

23

slope on the Recess Appointments Clause. 

24
25

 It is a complete abuse of the process. 

It 

is being used for no other purpose than to overcome the

75

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Senate opposition or the Senate disinclination to agree 

2

with the President's nominations. 

3

 What the Framers contemplated in coming up 

4

with a joint power of appointment was you have to act 

5

jointly.  You have to play nice.  And in a country of 

6

300 million people, when the President wants a nominee 

7

and the Senate does not agree, it is always possible for 

8

the President to come up with another nominee who is 

9

even more qualified and acceptable to the Senate. 

10

 The key here is acceptable to the Senate. 

11

He has to be able to proffer someone to the Senate that 

12

the Senate is willing to engage in a joint power of 

13

appointment. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Mr. Estrada, in your 

15

earlier example, you said that if the Senate decides to 

16

recess and the House doesn't approve, that the President 

17

can then do it. 

18

 Is it your belief that a recess is only 

19

something that both Houses have agreed to?  A break in 

20

business that both Houses have agreed to? 

21

 MR. ESTRADA: 

I don't think so.  It is 

22

usually the case, Justice Sotomayor, but not 

23

necessarily.  The example I would give 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what do you need 

why does the President have to adjourn the House in your

76

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

example? 

2

 MR. ESTRADA: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4

No, I think 
If the Senate votes 

tomorrow to recess 

5

 MR. ESTRADA: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
 can the President 

7

appoint, at least in your view, any vacancy that occurs 

8

during that recess? 

9

 MR. ESTRADA: 

If the Senate has been 

10

recessed without date so that the session of the Senate 

11

is over, even if the President, under Article II, 

12

chooses to leave the House in session 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why do you need a date? 

14

What  what  in what rule makes a recess defined as 

15

something without date? 

16

 MR. ESTRADA: 

This takes us back to the 

17

first argument, and I think the contemplation was that 

18

the recess would be the period of time that intervened 

19

between the ending of a session of the Congress and the 

20

beginning of the next.  Here 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It always had a date, 

because we knew January 3rd was a new session. 
 MR. ESTRADA: 

Well, that wasn't true until 

24

the 20th Amendment.  You know, the date was a much 

25

different date in the original Constitution.

77

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But to answer your earlier question, it is 

2

usually the case that a recess is going to be longer 

3

than 3 days, but it needn't be.  If the Senate finished 

4

all of its legislative business, for example, in this 

5

year on December 30, 2011, and then voted to adjourn 

6

sine die, and did not again meet until the beginning of 

7

the second session of the Congress on January 3rd, that 

8

would be an intersession recess even though it would 

9

not be one that would require consent of the House. 

10

 But in the usual case in which a recess is 

11

taken for an extended period of time, it would be the 

12

type of break that the Framers contemplated would need 

13

the consent of the House. 

14

 And the reason for that should be obvious. 

15

We have a system of a bicameral legislature.  The houses 

16

too are supposed to work together to accomplish the 

17

business of the people.  If the House is working on 

18

something and the Senate wants to go away, or 

19

viceversa, they need the consent of each other because 

20

they may need each other to frame out ongoing 

21

legislative projects. 

22

 And if the House in its own judgment thinks 

23

that the Senate is sufficiently available to the House 

24

in our bicameral system so that it  so that it has been 

25

full compliance with the Adjournments Clause, it is

78

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

very difficult to see how in the agreement of both 

2

houses of Congress that the Senate is in fact 

3

effectively available, that is there with its full power 

4

of unanimous consent every third day.  If the House 

5

thinks that that is adequate for the discharge of its 

6

constitutional functions and the constitutional 

7

functions of the Senate, it's very difficult to see how 

8

the President gets to secondguess that. 

9

 One final point that has to do with the 

10

Solicitor General's insistence on the nobusiness 

11

language.  Rule 5.1 of the Senate  may I finish? 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 MR. ESTRADA: 

Yes. 

 makes very clear  it's 

14

also in our appendix  that any business may 

15

conducted  may be conducted at any time, without notice, 

16

by unanimous consent. 

17

 And so that effectively, what we have here 

18

is merely an announcement by the Senate that between 

19

December 17th and January 23rd, only unanimous consent 

20

business would be agreed to. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 General Verrilli, 6 minutes.

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR., 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Thank you,

79

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Mr. Chief Justice. 
 Let me begin with a couple of points on 

3

intrasession recesses.  With respect to the question 

4

that Justice Alito raised, it would have been perfectly 

5

familiar to the Framers that a legislative body could 

6

take an intrasession recess.  Jefferson's parliamentary 

7

manual written while he was Vice President and presiding 

8

over the Senate specifically refers to recesses by 

9

adjournment that occur within a session and the session 

10
11

resumes when they are over. 
 The adjournment clause itself contemplates 

12

the need for approval by the other branch for a period 

13

longer than three days during the session. 

14

 I think it's difficult to imagine that if, 

15

as Justice Alito's hypothetical suggested, that the 

16

Senate had in the first years under President Washington 

17

decided to take a twomonth, intrasession break, that 

18

President Washington wouldn't have been able to staff 

19

the offices of the fledgling republic using the recess 

20

appointment power. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if we agree with you 

22

on the first question, then there needs to either 

23

be a number or a functional test.  And I don't know 

24

where the number would come from and I don't know how 

25

the functional test would play out, so maybe you could

80

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

say just a word about that. 

2

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

We think the number 

3

should  should be the number in the Adjournments 

4

Clause, 3 days or less.  Now, Presidents have exercised 

5

restraint and there haven't been recess appointments in 

6

periods below 10 days, but we think that would be the 

7

line.  Now 

8
9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The presence 

of that in the Adjournments Clause but the absence of 

10

any number in the Recess Appointments Clause, how do you 

11

explain that? 

12

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think that there 

13

isn't really a need for explanation.  A recess is a 

14

suspension of business, and what the Adjournment Clause 

15

says is if you are gone for 3 days or less you are not 

16

really suspending your business, but if you are gone for 

17

more than 3 days you are.  And I think that is quite 

18

consistent with the argument that my friends on the 

19

other side are making. 

20

 Now, with respect to the history on 

21

intrasession recess appointments, really if you look at 

22

the congressional directory, which is a document that we 

23

cite in our brief, and you just look at the column that says 

24

intrasession recesses, you will see page after page of 

25

blank space until you get to the Civil War era when

81

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

intrasession recesses become more frequent. 
 And intrasession recess appointments really 

3

just precisely parallel the increasing use by the Senate 

4

of intrasession recesses. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And you argue that 

6

the Senate sort of acquiesced in that and everybody's 

7

come together, but what would you expect a Senator to do? 

8

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, if they 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You know, the 

10

President appoints somebody during a recess contrary to 

11

the Respondent's view, what's the Senator who objects to 

12

that supposed to do? 

13

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, a couple of things 

14

about that, Mr. Chief Justice.  The Pay Act, of course, 

15

was first enacted in this period, in the 1860s, when the 

16

first intrasession recess appointments occurred. The Pay Act, 

17

even in its original form never said  and since, 

18

never said anything about trying to restrict 

19

intrasession appointments. 

20

 If the Congress felt that these were 

21

improper, they could have done what they did in the 

22

Tenure of Office Act and passed a statute of making it a 

23

crime for somebody to take one of these appointments. 

24

But they didn't do anything like that. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you would

82

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

object to that, wouldn't you? 

2

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

4

that you're objecting here. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

6
7
8
9
10
11
12

Of course. 
On the same grounds 

Well, we would.  But in 

terms of 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, then that's 

not something that is effective for the Senate to do if 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But in terms of 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 you think it's 

unconstitutional. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But in terms of an expression 

13

of their disagreement as opposed to acquiescence it 

14

would certainly be a question of disagreement, and it 

15

didn't happen. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that'll show them. The Senate 

17

says we don't agree with your recess appointment, and you 

18

say, well, that's too bad, the appointee is still in 

19

office. 

20
21
22
23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But they didn't, I guess, 

would be, or the point being 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, some of the Senators did 

Senator Byrd 

24

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

 senators 
 famously objected

83

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

to the President's assertion of that power. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Yeah, but he famously 

3

objected to it, Mr. Chief Justice, by saying that the 

4

intrasession recess ought to be 30 days or longer, not 

5

that intrasession recesses are inappropriate as a 

6

matter of constitutional power. 

7

 So I actually think that is just haggling 

8

about the length of the recess, not about the existence 

9

of the power. 

10

 Now, if I can move to the question of 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, I just want to 

12

make sure I understand.  Your idea is the Senator who 

13

objects should do what? 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, the Senator who 

15

objects can say whatever the Senator wants, but we don't 

16

have a historical record of objection.  We have a 

17

historical record of acquiescence. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But suppose the 

19

Senator says, look, I object to that, I think it's 

20

unconstitutional, but I'm not going to  what can I do? 

21

The only think you do is impeach the President, 

22

right, for violating the Constitution.  And he says it's 

23

not worth it for the  one of the officers on the NLRB 

24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, if the Congress as 

a body thought that these were inappropriate they could

84

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

take legislative action to try to limit the President's 

2

authority, and they just, they never have. 

3
4
5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but you say 

that action would be totally ineffective? 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, we agree on 

6

the  we certainly agree on the criminalizing point, 

7

but in terms of the Pay Act, for example, they just 

8

never in all their  in their original consideration of 

9

the Pay Act and subsequent, they never tried to 

10

address this. 

11

 Now if I could turn to the 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But people object all the 

13

time to things that in fact they can't do anything 

14

about, right? 

15

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And, yes, Your Honor, and 

16

of course  and that's an individual objecting and it's 

17

not the Senate objecting. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The question of reports. 

19

There were reports, remember?  Sorry, I didn't mean 

20

to  your six minutes couldn't be up already. 

21
22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
minutes. 

23

 (Laughter.) 

24

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

25

Take a few more 

I was thinking the same 

thing, Your Honor.

85

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 There were a couple of committee reports but 

2

I believe those were on the "happen" issue, and let me 

3

turn to that, if I could.  Now Your Honor had pointed 

4

out the number of  on happens, the number of appointments.  As 

5

I said, don't take that chart as comprehensive.  As we said 

6

in our brief, it's not; we think there are many more, 

7

and of course 39 Presidents have made those 

8

appointments. 

9

 Now, the purposes of the clause as we 

10

discussed earlier, I think, are far better served by our 

11

reading than the other side's.  Jefferson gave a 

12

reasonable textual reading, and then Your Honor asked 

13

about the Pay Act.  The Pay Act of course says if the 

14

nomination  if the vacancy arose within 30 days, but 

15

it says something else, too, which is if a nomination is 

16

pending 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yeah, but I'm focusing on 

18

30 days and the reason I'm doing that is this seems to 

19

me, hypothetically at least, a real matter for the 

20

political branches to resolve among themselves. 

21

 Now, we have to decide this, so I thought, 

22

well, why not look and see what Congress objects to the 

23

least?  And I got that 30day thing from the Pay Act by 

24

analogy. 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

I guess what I 

86

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So I want to get your view 

on that. 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

4

 And what I would point out by analogy also 

Yes, of course. 

5

is that there is another provision in the Pay Act, the 

6

very same statute, that says so long as a nomination is 

7

pending, even if the vacancy arose more than 30 days, 

8

that's the same expression of Congress's views about 

9

what's appropriate.  What they care about is the chance 

10
11

to exercise their advice against the 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that was that Senate. 

12

I mean, that's not the Senate that is sitting now.  You 

13

are attributing the views of one Senate to the Senate 

14

over  over time. 

15

17

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

That is an expression of 

the law of the United States that the Congress enacted. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm really interested in 

18

how you think the 30day idea, if practical, plays out 

19

in terms of your concerns. 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think it, as I 

21

said, I think there is an equilibrium here and the 

22

30 days doesn't fully capture it. 

23
24
25

 And let me just talk about that if I could. 
             
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

2

Mr. Chief Justice, briefly. 

3

Yes, thank you, 

 The vast majority of appointees are 

4

submitted for advice and consent.  That was true 

5

historically; it's true now.  The vast majority of 

6

recess appointees are subsequently confirmed.  So it's 

7

just not the case that this is an endrun around the 

8

advice and consent role of the Senate. 

9

 And there are powerful reasons, of course, 

10

why Presidents do that.  They don't want to have 

11

temporary appointments that they have got to then deal 

12

with vacancies again, and they don't want to 

13

unnecessarily create interbranch friction. 

14

 The real problem, I would submit here, is 

15

that if you go with Respondents on the pro forma issue 

16

or under the  on the two underlying issuesthat the D.C. 

17

Circuit ruled on, you really are writing the recess 

18

appointment power out of the Constitution, and that's 

19

antithetical to the libertyenhancing properties of 

20

separation of powers that Madison described in Federalist 

21

51, because ambitions should counteract ambitions. They 

22

shouldn't disarm one side. 

23

 Thank you. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 The case is submitted.
