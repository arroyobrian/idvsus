ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE S. ROBBINS


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10

MR. ROBBINS:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and


may it please the Court:


11

The Ninth Circuit held in this case that


12

petitioner Ben Chavez could not assert a qualified


13

immunity defense to a section 1983 lawsuit alleging that


14

his interrogation of respondent violated the Fifth and


15

Fourteenth Amendments. 
 We believe that ruling to be

16

mistaken. 


17

First, there was no constitutional violation at


18

all on these facts.

19

constitutional right implicated, that right was not


20

clearly established in the particularized sense required


21

by this Court's qualified immunity cases.

22

could not reasonably have known that what he was doing


23

violated that right, and the judgment of the Ninth Circuit


24

should, therefore, be reversed. 


25

QUESTION:

But second, if there was a


Officer Chavez


May I ask this question on that point


3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that you addressed before you get through?

2

thought at the time of the questioning that the


3

material -- the answers would be used in evidence later


4

on, and he knew that it would have been a violation of the


5

Constitution to use those answers later on.

6

entitled to qualified immunity then? 


7

MR. ROBBINS:

Supposing he


Would he be


Yes, because the Constitution --


8

well, because the first inquiry would be has the


9

Constitution been violated.

10

QUESTION:

Whether he thought --


But your -- I'm just directing my


11

question at -- you sort of said even assuming a


12

constitutional violation, he nevertheless is entitled to


13

good faith immunity.

14

the facts I've just granted, including an assumption that


15

the -- it would have been a constitutional violation to

16

use the evidence. 


17

And I'm saying, well, assume the --


MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I think -- I think the --


18

the answer is that while -- while he might have believed


19

that the Constitution would in time be violated, because


20

he could not himself violate it, he couldn't -- he


21

couldn't be liable under section 1983 for committing a


22

Fifth Amendment violation.

23

get to the question of clearly established if there's no


24

established constitutional violation at all. 


25

QUESTION:

So the point is you don't even


But we -- we do somehow extend the


4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Fifth Amendment protection to the period before the actual


2

introduction of the evidence in a criminal trial.

3

to say, we -- we permit a witness to refuse to answer


4

unless the witness is given -- is given immunity from


5

prosecution.

6

the Fifth Amendment has some antecedent application before


7

the evidence is actually --


Now, how do you explain that, unless somehow


8

MR. ROBBINS:

9

QUESTION:

Well --


-- introduced at trial?


MR. ROBBINS:

10

That is


I -- I think you've put it exactly


11

right.

12

say, it applies prior to the moment at which it's actually


13

violated.

14

a way it's a prophylactic protection much like Miranda is. 


15

That is to say, we will let you assert it in what is

16

concededly, for example, a civil litigation setting, a


17

simple deposition.

18

use in a criminal case.

19

because if we didn't, it would compromise your ability to


20

ensure that the right is protected later.


21

It has some antecedent application.

That is to


The premise is we need to ensure against -- in


QUESTION:

No one would suggest that that is a

But we allow you to assert it


Well, suppose in a civil case, the


22

judge orders the witness confined to custody until he


23

testifies in violation of what we can say in common


24

parlance is his Fifth Amendment right to self-


25

incrimination.

Is that not a violation then and there


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

to -- to confine the -- the defendant until he testifies?

MR. ROBBINS:

I think it is consistent with a


3

body of well -- well-developed law that to penalize


4

someone, particularly through that kind of a sanction, for


5

the assertion of a right is in the nature of a -- sort of


6

an unconstitutional condition.

7

established body of law that says --


8

QUESTION:

And there's a well-


I -- I don't know that we usually


9

talk about a violation as an unconstitutional condition. 


10

We -- we would say, Your Honor, I want my client released


11

because you are violating his Fifth Amendment rights.


12

MR. ROBBINS:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

But I -- I --


And I think in a very realistic --


real sense you are. 

MR. ROBBINS:

Yes. 
 I -- I think there is a body

16

of case law that says that if you are punished for the


17

assertion of a right, then under the Constitution you can


18

be relieved of that coercion. 


19

However -- but let me be clear -- the actual


20

violation of the Fifth Amendment is exactly what the text


21

of the Fifth Amendment says.

22

not to be a witness against yourself in a criminal case. 


23

I suggest, Justice Kennedy, that the result -- that the


24

holding in Murphy against the Waterfront Commission is


25

inexplicable if you believe, as the Ninth Circuit does,


It says that your right is


6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that it is sufficient simply to coerce an otherwise


2

incriminating statement because in Murphy against the


3

Waterfront Commission, the holding of that case is that


4

the State court was correct in requiring the witness to


5

testify even though there wasn't a statute that protected


6

him against incrimination because the Fifth Amendment


7

itself provides the fail-safe that if you are coerced into


8

giving an otherwise incriminating statement, it cannot be


9

used against you. 


10

And my central submission on the Fifth Amendment


11

point -- and of course, this is before we even get to the


12

question whether Office Chavez could have -- you know, has


13

qualified immunity.

14

that you don't even have to get to that point because the


15

fail-safe of the Fifth Amendment ensures that

16

Mr. Martinez's statements could not be used against him in


17

a criminal case if they were indeed legally compelled --


18

QUESTION:

Our central submission on this is


What -- what in your opinion in the


19

Constitution prevents a policeman from going and beating


20

up a witness? 


21

MR. ROBBINS:

22

QUESTION:

The Fourteenth Amendment. 


So, the Fourteenth Amendment means


23

that you could -- in other words, your -- your client


24

could have violated the Fourteenth Amendment if -- other


25

things being equal --


7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBBINS:

2

QUESTION:

3

Well --


-- because he was a witness.

He gets


at least -- at least the suspect --


4

MR. ROBBINS:

5

QUESTION:

Yes. 


-- gets the same pre-trial protection


6

as a witness would, and the Fourteenth Amendment prevents


7

coercion being used against a witness who doesn't want to


8

testify.

MR. ROBBINS:

9

Well, let's be clear.

It doesn't


10

prevent all coercion.

It prevents a subset of coercion


11

that shocks the conscience for purposes of the -- the


12

substantive component of due process.

The substantive due process. 


13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ROBBINS:

15
16

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

That's


correct. 

But -- but I think it is important that we not


17

torture the language of the Fifth Amendment to accommodate


18

the worry that police officers will torture witnesses


19

because that concern is completely -- can be completely


20

accommodated, and routinely is in the courts of appeals,


21

under the aegis of the --


22

QUESTION:

You're not saying -- those things


23

that would violate the Fifth Amendment weren't introduced


24

into trial do violate the Fourteenth Amendment for the


25

similar reasons.


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. ROBBINS:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. ROBBINS:

4

QUESTION:

5

Well, I mean, could you say --

Yes. 


-- that those things -- you could say


that. 


6

MR. ROBBINS:

7

QUESTION:

8

I'm sorry.


Yes.

You -- you could say --


All right.

Then why didn't he


violate the Fourteenth Amendment? 

MR. ROBBINS:

9

Well, he -- well, again, let me --


10

I -- I

11

a qualified immunity case, I always want to drop the


12

footnote that we have an extra layer of protection here


13

arising from the fact that none of these propositions


14

could have been -- none of the propositions adverse to us


15

could plausibly be said to be clearly established within

16

the right sense of the term. 


17

want to answer that, but I -- I -- because this is


Getting to your question, Justice Breyer, he did


18

not violate the substantive component of the Due Process


19

Clause because that inquiry turns on a set of concerns,


20

including did the acts shock the conscience.

21

committed with the intent to harm the witness in the sense


22

required by Sacramento against Lewis? 


23

Were they


The failure of the Ninth Circuit in this case


24

with respect to the substantive due process analysis was


25

that it thought that any interrogation which would render


9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a statement involuntary and therefore inadmissible at


2

trial must, therefore, give rise to a freestanding


3

substantive due process claim, actionable and enforceable


4

under section 1983.

5

QUESTION:

That's just wrong. 

Mr. Robbins, going back to the Fifth


6

Amendment self-incrimination privilege, I take it the


7

thrust of your argument is that a police officer who fails


8

to give Miranda warnings quite deliberately, doesn't say


9

you have a right to remain silent, doesn't say any of the


10

rest of it, never commits a violation of 1983 unless and


11

until there's attempt to use the information in court.

12

you can say, police officer, you're not required to give


13

Miranda warnings if we're not going to use this testimony


14

in court.


15
16
17
18
19

So


MR. ROBBINS: 
 I am saying -- I think the answer
to that is yes.

The -- the --


QUESTION:

So that the Miranda is -- is not an


obligation of the police officer. 

MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I respectfully beg to differ,


20

and I -- I also think -- I must say, given the prominence


21

of the Miranda discussion in the respondent's brief and in


22

the green -- green brief supporting respondent, I believe


23

the Miranda concerns in this case are an utter red


24

herring, and let me say why.


25

The sanction for the violation of Miranda is, in


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fact, that the statements taken in violation of Miranda


2

cannot be used in the direct case of the government. 


3

That's the penalty for Miranda, and if that happens, you


4

get the statement struck in the direct case for the


5

government. 


6
7
8

QUESTION:
no 1983 penalty.

But there -- you're saying there is


The penalty is you can't --


MR. ROBBINS:

I -- I think there is no 1983


9

penalty, but the suggestion that as a consequence, because


10

you don't have a freestanding section 1983 claim when the


11

evidence never comes in, when the statement is never


12

offered, the suggestion that that is therefore going to


13

be -- send a signal to police officers that they should


14

violate Miranda, you know, at their -- at their discretion


15

I think is terribly mistaken, and for a very important

16

reason and it's this:

17

you run a serious risk that the failure to give those


18

warnings will be taken as part of the calculus under the


19

Fifth Amendment voluntariness inquiry.

20

which is involuntary for Fifth Amendment purposes is


21

unusable for any purpose at all, direct case, impeachment,


22

derivative use.

23

Kastigar hearing to show that all of its evidence was


24

independently derived, which is, as the Court said in


25

Kastigar, a heavy burden for the government to meet.


If you don't give Miranda warnings,


And a statement


The government then has to put on a


11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

It is a fool's errand I suggest, Justice


2

Ginsburg -- a fool's errand -- to go about deliberately


3

violating Miranda simply because the violation will not


4

cause -- give rise to a section 1983 violation. 


5

QUESTION:

I -- I just have to tell you, I -- I


6

can see your -- your point on Miranda.

Miranda is an


7

exclusionary rule.

8

Amendment is -- is treated in that way because of the


9

questions we've initially covered.


But I'm not sure that all of the Fifth


10

MR. ROBBINS:

11

QUESTION:

Well --


If -- if you beat the defendant to


12

get the defendant -- to get the confession, it seems to me


13

there's a very strong argument that that is a Fifth


14

Amendment violation --


15

MR. ROBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

I think --


-- A Self-incrimination Clause


violation.

MR. ROBBINS:

I think -- respectfully, Justice


19

Kennedy, I think there is a wealth of this Court -- this


20

Court's cases that cannot be reconciled with the


21

proposition that coercing a statement is enough by itself


22

to constitute a Fifth Amendment violation.


23

QUESTION:

All right.

You -- I think you could


24

say after -- after 30 years or 50 years of -- of


25

jurisprudence, policemen know they're not supposed to beat


12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

up suspects or the -- the equivalent.

2

say, all right, at this point, I would think that does


3

shock the conscience for a policeman to beat a confession


4

out of somebody, and so I don't care if you call it


5

Fourteenth or Fifth. 


6

And -- and you can


But then the question here would be, why in


7

heaven's name, when the person is undergoing serious pain,


8

or he thinks he's dying, where the doctors are saying, get


9

out of here, et cetera, whatever they're saying, and he


10

continues to press and then says, well, you're going to


11

get your treatment after you confess -- not confess --


12

after -- after you answer my question.

13

doing?

14

treatment, you'd better -- you better say something,


15

et cetera, et cetera. 
 Why isn't that the equivalent of

16

beating somebody up?


17

Then we'll treat you.

MR. ROBBINS:

What were you


He says, you want your


Well, let me attempt, if -- if I


18

might, Justice Breyer, to -- to very quickly answer


19

Justice Kennedy's question.

20

the Ninth Circuit held that it's enough under the Fifth


21

Amendment simply to coerce a statement that would


22

otherwise be incriminating cannot be reconciled with


23

Murphy and with the -- with Balsys, with the immunity


24

cases, with all the cases that stand for the proposition


25

that so long as the use immunity has not been compromised,


I -- I think the belief that


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you do not yet have a substantive Fifth Amendment


2

violation.


3

To turn, Justice Breyer, to your question, I


4

acknowledge that there is coercion in this case.

5

don't -- we don't blanch on that.

6

the facts of this case are tragic, but the -- but the


7

reality is this.

8

very important piece of information under extraordinarily


9

exigent circumstances. 


10
11
12
13

QUESTION:

Well, was this tried below with a


Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process claim?

MR. ROBBINS:

I don't know that it was


denominated substantive due process.

I think --


Is that in the case? 


QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

18

There was coercion and


This officer was there to find out a


14

17

We


I --


I mean, is it open to resolution on


that basis? 

MR. ROBBINS:

There's -- there's no question


19

that the Ninth Circuit decided a Fourteenth Amendment due


20

process question.

21

substantive versus procedure.

22

suggest --


I don't think they -- they labeled it


23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ROBBINS:

25

QUESTION:

And indeed, as we


Well, if --

-- they conflated the two.


-- if -- if we think the facts here


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

show sufficient coercion to rise to the level of a


2

violation of substantive due process under the Fourteenth


3

Amendment, should the judgment be affirmed --


4

MR. ROBBINS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ROBBINS:

No. 


-- but on a different basis?

The judgment must be reversed,


7

first, because there is not even a suggestion that the


8

intent to harm requirement under Sacramento against Lewis


9

has been satisfied.

And under this -- in this kind of a


10

case, you cannot have a substantive due -- due process


11

violation without that.

12

argued that that Sacramento against Lewis --


13

QUESTION:

No one before you today has


What is -- what is the source of the


14

substantive -- of the intentional harm requirement? 


15

MR. ROBBINS: 
 Is that -- the source I -- I

16

suggest is the -- the principles this Court articulated in


17

Sacramento against Lewis for police conduct that's taken


18

in enormous haste where -- where there is not the


19

opportunity for a second chance.


20

But let me go -- there's a terribly important


21

thing, Justice O'Connor, I have not yet gotten to say in


22

answer to your question.

23

fundamental reason why it would be a mistake, I


24

respectfully suggest, to affirm this judgment, even on the


25

due process argument, is that this is a qualified immunity


The further and perhaps most


15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case.

So you must conclude not only that on balance this


2

rises to the shock-the-conscience standard, but that it


3

does so with such remarkable clarity that it must have


4

been surely apparent to this officer that he was violating


5

that standard.

You cannot find that on this record. 


6

The Ninth Circuit thought so because of Mincey,


7

which is a fair trial and admissibility of evidence case,


8

not a freestanding substantive due process case and which


9

had all manner of important differences from the facts of


10

this case, including an absence -- a total absence -- of


11

exigency.


12

With the Court's permission --


13

QUESTION:

Exigency.

May I ask you a question


14

about that?

15

only -- only chance. 
 But there was an eyewitness, Flores,

16

to this entire thing.

17

police, if they wanted some view other than the police


18

officers who engaged in the -- in the shooting, just to


19

interview Flores? 


20

You said the man was dying.

This was the


Why wasn't it enough for the


MR. ROBBINS:

Well, I -- I think the record


21

suggests that he was not a completely clear -- did not


22

have a completely clear view of the facts.

23

one witness.

24
25

But he's just


This is the man who was there.


QUESTION:

Wouldn't he be a lot clearer than a


man who -- who is -- who has been blinded, who has -- was


16

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

paralyzed, who's under heavy medication?

MR. ROBBINS:

Well, he -- he was the most


3

important non-police witness to these events, and I


4

suggest that the officer would have been derelict not to


5

have found out what happened from him, which is what he


6

was trying to do. 


7
8
9
10

And with the Court's permission, I'd like to

reserve the balance of my time. 

QUESTION:

Yes, you may do so, Mr. Robbins.


Mr. Clement, we'll hear from you.


11

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT


12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,


13

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


14
15
16

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and


may it please the Court:

The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-


17

incrimination safeguards the integrity of the criminal


18

trial process and ensures that an individual is not


19

convicted on the basis of a coerced confession. 


20

But the privilege against self-incrimination is


21

not a direct limit on the primary conduct of the law


22

enforcement officers.

23

no substantive constitutional limits on what law officers


24

may do to obtain information or to secure a confession.


25

But those limits are to be found in the Fourth Amendment


This is not to say that there are

and in the law of substantive due process, not in the

Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege --

4

QUESTION:

So beating a prisoner to compel a --


a statement is not a Fifth Amendment violation.

MR. CLEMENT:

5

That's right, Justice Kennedy. 


6

It's not a Fifth Amendment violation.

be --

10
11

QUESTION:

It very well might


But it could be a Fourteenth


Amendment violation. 

MR. CLEMENT:

It very well -- Justice O'Connor,


it very well could be a Fourteenth --

And very likely would be. 


12

QUESTION:

13

Is there some intent element in that for the


14

shocks-the-conscience --


15

MR. CLEMENT: 
 Well, I think generally, at least

16

as I understand this Court's decision in -- in Sacramento


17

against Lewis, in these kind of executive action contexts


18

where things are ongoing, I think there is some kind of


19

intent element.

20

I think that --


QUESTION:

It's not enough, you think, to find


21

that the officer should have known that you couldn't ask


22

questions in the manner that was done here under these


23

circumstances, and that to proceed gives rise to an


24

inference of intent.


25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'm not sure how intent


18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would need to be proven in any particular case, but I


2

would say the critical difference between the Fifth


3

Amendment inquiry and the Fourteenth Amendment inquiry,


4

when it's -- when it's done in the context of the


5

admissibility of a coerced confession, is in that context,


6

what the courts are taking into account is the effect on


7

the integrity of the trial process of using a coerced


8

confession. 


9

It's a different calculus, though, when you're


10

trying to regulate primary law enforcement conduct because


11

it strikes me that not everything that a law enforcement


12

officer could do to coerce a confession -- there -- there


13

may be some acts that may be sufficiently problematic that


14

you'd certainly want to keep the confession out of the


15

trial.


16

QUESTION:

What about the order of a trial judge


17

in a civil case who orders the witness held in contempt


18

and confined unless he testifies, and -- and there's a


19

valid Fifth Amendment privilege that the judge is


20

overlooking?

21

No Fifth Amendment violation there?


MR. CLEMENT:

No.

I don't think there's a Fifth


22

Amendment -- I don't think there's a complete Fifth


23

Amendment violation.

24

protect the privilege. 


25

QUESTION:

The courts intervene there to


So, if you go in and you want a writ


19
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of habeas corpus and you don't mention the Fifth


2

Amendment. 

MR. CLEMENT:

3

You mention the Fifth Amendment,


4

but I think the important thing is the Fifth Amendment in


5

this context works a -- a bit like the takings clause. 


6

And Justice Souter, for the opinion for the Court in


7

Balsys, noted that the self-incrimination privilege is


8

unusual because it's not purely and simply binding on the


9

government.

10

It doesn't say that in all contexts, the


government cannot coerce confessions.
QUESTION:

11

What it says --


Well, if there's a 1983 suit against


12

a judge in -- in this hypothetical case, what's -- what's


13

the violation?

MR. CLEMENT:

14

Well, typically those cases have


15

been dealt with on -- on habeas. 
 And what I would say

16

is --


17

QUESTION:

Suppose it's a 1983 suit.


18

MR. CLEMENT:

If there's a 1983 suit in that


19

context, I actually don't think a 1983 suit would lie in


20

that context.


21

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't there be a 1983 suit


22

provided that -- and I think this is the assumption of


23

Justice Kennedy's question -- provided that the witness


24

had invoked the Fifth Amendment?

25

action there because that is one at least of two instances


There would be a 1983


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in which we allow the Fifth Amendment to have an


2

application in anticipation.

3

they don't come forward with immunity, we're not going to


4

let this entire process go forward to no avail since


5

nothing can ever be admitted in evidence anyway.

6

is we -- the -- the rule allowing it to be raised in


7

anticipation I suppose would be the predicate for 1983


8

liability here.

9

would be true in the -- in the case of the -- the civil


10

We say if he raises it, and


The fact


That's not this case, but that -- that


example that Justice Kennedy gave, wouldn't it?

MR. CLEMENT:

11

I think that's a very good point,


12

Justice Souter, and the Court has also treated in the


13

penalty context --

QUESTION:

14

Well, is it good enough so that you


15

concede there would be 1983 liability there; i.e., that

16

there would be a violation of the Fifth Amendment in that


17

case?

MR. CLEMENT:

18
19

I don't think so, but I think it


would --


20

QUESTION:

Not that good.


21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

But as I was trying to say --


23

QUESTION:

-- at least be a better case.


Is there any violation in the case


24

that I put, any constitutional violation?

25

that's -- that's extraordinary.


I mean,


21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

There is a -- there is a --


2

there -- what there is is there is an ongoing interference


3

with the Fifth Amendment right that the courts will


4

vindicate, but there isn't a complete constitutional


5

violation.

6

as -- as Justice Souter said for the Court in Balsys, the


7

privilege against self-incrimination is not purely and


8

simply binding on the government.

9

compel testimony in exchange for a valid grant of


And I think the critical distinction is that,


The government can


10

immunity.

What it can't do is compel testimony and


11

attempt to use it in a criminal case.
QUESTION:

12

And --


Well, maybe the -- the point where it


13

would make a difference I guess -- nobody is talking about


14

weakening or overruling Miranda.

15

books, and Miranda set some technical requirements.

16

have to give a warning.

17

pure and simple, is not going to hurt anybody if that's


18

never used in trial, so there isn't 1983 damages, unless


19

you beat the person up.

20

under the Fourteenth. 


We have Miranda on the

You


Now, a failure to give a warning,


Then there is.

And that comes


But there are a set of cases where it will hurt


21
22

people.

The set of cases where it will hurt people is


23

where because they violated Miranda but didn't beat him


24

up, and got a statement, they kept him in jail.

25

rather like the case Justice Kennedy's thinking of.

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

That's

So


1

there he is in jail for a week or a month and he's been


2

hurt, all right. 


3

And the question I guess is -- it's really not


4

this case, but the question is, is there going to be a


5

1983 action in that kind of case?

6

under the Fifth Amendment, the answer is going to be yes. 


7

And if you say it comes under the Fourteenth Amendment,


8

the answer is going to be no.

9

should -- it seems to me what we're going to decide in


10
11

And if you say it comes


I don't know if we


this case is effectively going to decide that.

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

I don't think that's true. 


12

I think that, for one thing, if the person is imprisoned


13

on some basis, that may raise an independent Fourth


14

Amendment violation.

There may be other --


15

QUESTION: 
 Then he goes under the Fourth, and he

16

claims he's wrongly seized and imprisoned because they got


17

this statement out of him in violation of the Fifth. 


18

That's -- I mean, this is -- this is what's -- what's


19

worrying me is not so much this case, but what we're going


20

to write and the implications of it.


21

MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and I think that this Court


22

has already clarified in Balsys that what you need for a


23

self-incrimination violation is both the coercion of the


24

testimony and the use of it in a criminal case.


25

QUESTION:

But may I just interrupt,


23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Mr. Clement?

2

somebody, who claims a -- a privilege against divulging


3

information, and that -- and the court holds him in


4

contempt and locks him up for 30 days or something, and he


5

claims he -- his Fifth Amendment right was violated, you'd


6

say there's no Fifth Amendment violation.

MR. CLEMENT:

7
8

no damages action.
QUESTION:

9

So how could he get out of jail then?

Well, he could get a habeas action


to get out because the court would be granting relief --


12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CLEMENT:

14

I would say there's no -- there's


Of course, he could get --


MR. CLEMENT:

10
11

Supposing there's a witness, a reporter or


Well, I -- I think --

-- to protect the Fifth


Amendment --

QUESTION: 
 With all respect, I think you're

15
16

evading the point that there -- let's assume there's


17

damage.

18

for 5 days for not testifying, and you say there's no


19

Fifth Amendment violation.

20

He's -- he's locked up, as Justice Breyer says,


MR. CLEMENT:

I can't understand that.


Well, in any event, let me just


21

say that the privilege works quite differently in the


22

custodial context.

23

that in the context of a civil trial, the individual has


24

to raise the -- the Self-incrimination Clause themselves. 


25

And we have a different rule that operates in the context


The reason that hypo even comes up is


24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of police custodial interrogation.

2

privilege is self-executing.

3

to raise it. 


4

In that context, the


The individual doesn't have


And -- as -- the other thing that's different


5

about the custodial context is that in the custodial


6

context, this Court has not insisted on a pre-testimony


7

grant of immunity.

8

exclusionary rules prevent a constitutional violation from


9

occurring.


10

They've always held that the


And if I could resort to the analogy to the


11

takings clause.

In that context, it's not enough for the


12

government to take property.

13

violation if the -- if the government simultaneously takes


14

property and refuses to grant just compensation.

15

same way, there's no self --


16

QUESTION:

It's only a constitutional


In the


But are you saying that -- to go back


17

to a question that was asked earlier, that if there -- if


18

the police just take somebody into custody and beat him up


19

in order to get -- get him to talk with no intention of


20

using the evidence at all -- they're just trying to


21

investigate a crime -- is there any constitutional


22

protection against that kind of conduct?


23
24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, and it's the substantive due


process protection. 

QUESTION:

Okay. 


25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

And I think to get back to that


2

point, what's important is in the context of trying to


3

protect the integrity of the criminal trial process, I


4

would think the courts would want to be quite careful


5

about what they let into evidence.

6

law enforcement officers, they're dealing with other


7

objectives than simply trying to get a confession to


8

secure a guilty verdict. 


9

QUESTION:

But in the context of


Well, on the facts of this case,


10

should it be analyzed then under the Fourteenth Amendment


11

for coercion --


12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

It --


-- an activity that might violate the


Fourteenth Amendment? 

MR. CLEMENT: 
 I think it should, Justice

16

O'Connor, and I would respectfully suggest that that's


17

best done on remand --


18

QUESTION:

Yes.


19

MR. CLEMENT:

-- because, although there is a


20

due process argument in this case, it's nobody's fault


21

that in light of the -- the governing precedent in the


22

Ninth Circuit, the Cooper decision, that nobody thought


23

that they had to prove shocks-the-conscience, or any of


24

the factors relevant to a substantive due process inquiry. 


25

Again, that's not the way respondents briefed the case,


26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

but one can hardly blame them for briefing the case they


2

did, given that the Ninth Circuit had held under Cooper


3

that as long as the conduct was sufficiently egregious to


4

have the evidence be inadmissible, therefore you have a


5

full substantive due process violation.

6

it's --

QUESTION:

7

And I think


And you disagree with Mr. Robbins who


8

said, but because of the qualified immunity, you wouldn't


9

send this back in any case.

MR. CLEMENT:

10

Well, I -- I don't really disagree


11

with him.

I think this Court could reach the qualified


12

immunity issue if it wanted to, but I think perhaps the


13

path of least resistance would be to just note that there


14

is a substantive due process limit, and that's something


15

that's best to be resolved on -- on remand.

16

I think the important -- oh, sorry.


17

QUESTION:

18

That's all right.

You can make that


sentence, if you want to.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. PAZ

MR. PAZ:

Justice Stevens, and if it pleases the

Court:

I -- I would start with simply the simple


3

observation that the district court made a finding of fact


4

in this case at page -- it's 28a and 29 of the petition


5

for writ of certiorari in the -- in the appendix.

6

goes directly to the issue of what we've been discussing


7

and that is the -- the intent. 


8
9

And it


And just if I can back up a little bit

procedurally, in argument today, for the first time I


10

heard counsel say that they acknowledge there's no quarrel


11

that there was coercion in this case.

13

At the court of appeals, the entire argument was there was


14

no coercion. 


In the district

At the court of appeals and the district court,

for the first time in the opening brief.


22

Those issues are

They were briefed


Cert was granted in this case on whether there


23

was a violation of the Fifth Amendment, not -- the


24

Fourteenth Amendment wasn't even discussed on cert. 


25

So we've gone through this journey of ever-


28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

changing theories of -- of liability in this case, but I


2

think we have to go back to the beginning.


3

The district court found at page 28, finally


4

defendants argued that Chavez was not attempting to


5

abridge the right against self-incrimination to -- to


6

exact -- extract self-inculpatory data or leads.

7

court goes on to then describe what was argued by the


8

defense, that Mr. Chavez was there simply to find out what


9

happened. 


10

The court directly rejected that.

MR. PAZ:

9

case.

I was there to


That was the core of the


That was all of the evidence in the case. 


10

The subsequent declarations that were submitted


11

were only submitted after -- after Mr. Martinez submitted


12

a motion for summary judgment that as a matter of law,


13

using all of the evidence provided by the defense and


14

giving them the benefit of the doubt on all the evidence,


15

that there was a violation of the Fifth and the Fourteenth

16

Amendment. 


17

QUESTION:

Mr. Paz, let me -- let me tell you


18

why I have difficulty with the proposition which you're


19

urging, which is that any coercion that would suffice to


20

require the confession to be excluded from -- from trial


21

is also a coercion that violates the Fifth Amendment,


22

not -- leaving substantive due process aside. 


23

Suppose you have a situation in which a --


24

a felon has taken a hostage and buried the hostage


25

somewhere, and suppose that it is possible for the police


30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

official to use a degree of coercion which would not shock


2

the conscience.

3

hose, but let's say failing to give a Miranda warning, or


4

using a -- a sort of trickery that -- that would amount to


5

coercion, threatening perhaps, you know, if you don't


6

confess, your brother will be prosecuted or something like


7

that.

8

from the confession from the trial, but the policeman


9

doesn't care about that.

10

It isn't beating the person with a rubber


It would be sufficient to exclude the testimony


He wants to save the life of


the -- of the hostage who's been -- who's been buried. 

Now, you would say that that -- that policeman


11
12

by extracting that confession has violated the Fifth


13

Amendment. 

MR. PAZ:

14

There may be a violation, and -- and I


15

would agree that most likely if -- if it was in violation

16

of Miranda, there would be -- there would be no -- it


17

would not be admitted into a criminal case.

18

may be under the Quarles exception. 

QUESTION:

19

Maybe -- it


What -- you'd say that the person


20

would -- would have a -- a 1983 action against the


21

policeman? 

MR. PAZ:

22

No.

23

kind of a case in which qualified immunity was designed to


24

prevent.

Oh, no, no.

I would say --

When there is an immediate danger, when

The Court has already

You can violate the Fifth Amendment


when there's a danger to the public?

MR. PAZ:

That's what Quarles, I believe, says. 


19

Quarles says that -- that the Miranda violation was not --


20

was not sufficient.

21

Quarles, the evidence was admitted against him.

said, the gun is over there, and that evidence came in to

prove the violation of -- of possession of a weapon.

There was no coercion in Quarles.

MR. PAZ:

Under those circumstances --


4

QUESTION:

Well, this person who goes to prison


5

for -- for putting this person in a -- in a grave begins a


6

suit when he's in prison suing the -- suing the policeman.

MR. PAZ:

7

And I don't believe that's -- that


8

would be the conclusion because the remedy would not be


9

appropriate because there had been, as we saw in -- in


10

Saucier versus Katz, there's a situation in which the


11

police have to act, and so the police act if it's


12

reasonable, even if it's a reasonable mistake, even if


13

they have the wrong guy and they try to coerce the wrong


14

person, it may be reasonable under an emergency


15

circumstance. 

QUESTION:

16

I see.

So let's assume somebody


17

is -- you think he's going to blow up the World Trade


18

Center.

19

necessity exception, you -- you could beat him with a


20

rubber hose.


I suppose if -- if we have this necessity -- this

MR. PAZ:

I would hope not, Your Honor. 

Oh, it's necessary. 

No.

I think --


Since when is -- is necessity a --

MR. PAZ:

Your Honor, only in the limited

situation.

4

gave us was you simply were going to ask him questions


5

repeatedly.

6

example was before me.


7

I think the first hypothetical you gave me --


Now, I -- I don't think the rubber hose


QUESTION:

Do you know -- okay.

Do you know any


8

of our -- any of our cases that -- other than Miranda


9

which, you know, is -- is in a field by itself, do you


10

know any of our cases that say that there is a necessity


11

exception to the coercion prohibition of the Fifth


12

Amendment? 


13

MR. PAZ:

14

QUESTION:

Not at all, Your Honor. 

So maybe the answer would be that --


15

that it's not -- the Fifth Amendment -- the -- the Miranda

16

rules are methods of enforcing the Fifth Amendment so that


17

if all is violated in -- in Justice Scalia's hypothetical


18

is a Miranda rule and the person is not proceeded against


19

in court and the person has not been physically injured in


20

any way and has not suffered any real harm except not


21

being read a right that didn't matter anyway, he would


22

have no damages.


23

MR. PAZ:

24

QUESTION:

25

That would be correct.

So he could bring his lawsuit, but


he'd gain nothing.

MR. PAZ:

2

QUESTION:

I would agree with that analysis. 

Except that my hypothetical was not


3

Miranda.

My hypothetical was that he was coerced in some


4

fashion other than the failure to give a Miranda warning,


5

and short of beating with a rubber hose.

MR. PAZ:

That's right. 


There was no

There may be


Well, maybe this is a Fourteenth

MR. PAZ:

I did -- I did consider that.

and I think clearly it is a Fourteenth Amendment violation

under all the cases --

beginning.

But -- but --


QUESTION:

I don't see why the Fourteenth.

I

mean, the Fourteenth -- the Fifth applies to the States


6

because it's incorporated in the Fourteenth.


7

MR. PAZ:

8

QUESTION:

9

Correct. 

And -- and therefore, if in fact you


violate the Fifth in -- in a way that's significant, not


10

just -- I mean, causes significant harm, not just you


11

didn't read a Miranda right, but you hurt somebody, then


12

why wouldn't the Fourteenth carry that through to the --

MR. PAZ:

By way of the Fourth Amendment. 

Yes.

I believe it does.

I believe


15

the history -- and the history -- the early cases, the --

16

the Bram case in 1897 began with the concept of the -- of


17

the Fifth Amendment protecting all of the rights.

18

course, Bram was a case in which -- it was against the


19

United States. 


20

And of


But as -- as -- there's an evolution that


21

I've -- I've seen through our cases that -- that show that


22

the Fourteenth Amendment, once it was incorporated, it


23

actually incorporated the Fifth Amendment privileges.

24

actually -- the Fifth Amendment was really the -- the core


25

values of what the Constitution meant to embody.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

It


It goes


1

back to -- Bram cites the early -- early cases in England


2

where, although the right against self-incrimination was


3

an evidentiary rule, in Bram they -- they laud the fact


4

that it became a constitutional rule, that it became


5

immutable so that no act of Congress -- as we decided in


6

Dickerson not too long ago, no act of Congress could


7

change that.

So --


QUESTION:

8

But isn't it clear by now in our


9

cases that if a policeman uses excessive force that rises


10

to the level of a Fourth Amendment violation, that we will


11

address it under that amendment, that the Fifth Amendment,


12

the language of it refers to use in trial of the


13

testimony?

MR. PAZ:

I would disagree with you on one

point, and that is the -- the language of the amendment

20

about the meaning, the distinction between a criminal


21

trial and a criminal case.

7

The Arnstein case in 1923 talked about the Fifth


So the extension of the Fifth Amendment goes to


QUESTION:

We just don't force people to

I -- you -- you mean --


8

you say it extends to a bankruptcy proceeding.

9

you can refuse to provide testimony that can be used


10
11

You mean


against you in a bankruptcy proceeding?

MR. PAZ:

That was the holding in Arnstein in --


12

in 1923, and a bankrupt person who was under the


13

bankruptcy proceeding simply said, I have a right to


14

remain silent.

15

The court upheld that right in the bankruptcy proceeding.

that you acquire some pre-trial Fifth Amendment rights

allow you to plead the Fifth Amendment before the evidence
