 (11:14 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear 

4

argument next in Case 121173, Marvin Brandt Revocable 

5

Trust v. United States. 

6

 Mr. Lechner.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. LECHNER 

8

11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. LECHNER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 If upheld, the decision below will upset 

12

100 years of property law and title to perhaps a million 

13

acres of land, based upon an implied reversionary 

14

interest that the government recently created. 

15

 I would like to make three points: 

First, 

16

the decision below violates Leo Sheep, where this Court 

17

rejected the government's attempt to create a property 

18

interest through implication and reaffirmed that the 

19

government does not retain any interest not expressly 

20

reserved in the patent or the granting statute. 

21

 Two, the decision below is contrary to both 

22

the government's argument and this Court's ruling in 

23

Great Northern that 1875 Act rightsofway are easements 

24

and are not fees. 

25

 And finally, the decision below is

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

inconsistent with the Department of Interior's 

2

longstanding interpretation that the 1875 Act granted 

3

only an easement. 

4

 It is axiomatic that the highest evidence of 

5

title in this country is a patent from the government. 

6

When the government issues a patent, it divests itself 

7

of title except for those interests expressly reserved. 

8

Here, the patent did not reserve any interest in the 

9

1875 Act 

10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, you are not 

reading this, are you? 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13

 MR. LECHNER: 

It's all right. 
Here the patent did not 

14

reserve any interest in 1875 Act rightofway.  Yet the 

15

government knew how to reserve interests at that time 

16

because it reserved the interest for ditches and canal, 

17

and reserved the right to two Forest Service roads when 

18

it issued the patent. 

19
20
21

 That some interests were reserved by the 
government in 1976 shows that other interests were not. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, under Section 1912, 

22

the government could  did reserve an interest for a 

23

public highway; is that correct? 

24

 MR. LECHNER: 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No. 
No?

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. LECHNER: 

1912, Section 1912 has to be 

2

read in conjunction with this Court's decision in 

3

Northern Pacific v. Townsend, and Stringham.  And in 

4

those decisions, this Court held that railroad 

5

rightsofway were limited fees with implied 

6

reversionary interests. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The patent you talk 

8

about, I am not recalling it exactly.  It had some  it 

9

mentioned the railroad interest, right? 

10

 MR. LECHNER: 

Yes, it mentioned it in the 

11

context of, that Brandt's title is subject to those 

12

rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the 

13

railroad under the 1875 Act. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So it didn't 

15

characterize it as either an easement or a fee with an 

16

implied reverter? 

17

 MR. LECHNER: 

That it was subject to those 

18

rights for railroad purposes as had been granted to the 

19

railroad sounds like it was granted subject to a 

20

servitude.  "Rights for railroad purpose" sounds like a 

21

servitude.  And of course that's how the Department of 

22

Interior interpreted it at the time, that these 1875 

23

rightsofway were easements, following its longstanding 

24

interpretation plus this Court's ruling in Great 

25

Northern that these were easements.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And at the time, that regulation was the law 

2

of the land.  And that's  that controlled the title 

3

that Brandt got. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What they are saying, I 

5

think the government's point is  the other side is 

6

saying, and I don't remember the term of my property 

7

law.  What's the right term?  It's  you grant to A, 

8

black acre to A and his heirs; it's a fee simple.  But 

9

it's subject to a shifting; it's subject to divestiture, 

10

subject to a condition subsequent.  What's the right 

11

term? 

12

 MR. LECHNER: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14
15
16
17

Well 
It shifts the  it shifts 

it back. 
 MR. LECHNER: 

A defeasible fee?  Or implied 

conditional 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It could be.  There was a 

18

technical term they used to have.  But anyway, that's 

19

what they're saying. 

20

 MR. LECHNER: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's what they're saying. 
And they are saying that 

22

that's, for purposes of who owns the land, the mineral 

23

rights, it's treated as an easement.  But for purposes 

24

of deciding who it reverts to, it's treated as a fee 

25

subject to a shifting use or whatever you call it.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Subject to  what did you say?  Subject to 
 MR. LECHNER: 

Subject to a right of 

reverter. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

5

 MR. LECHNER: 

Yes. 
Yes.  But that's similar to 

6

the argument that the government made in 1942 in Great 

7

Northern.  The limited fee 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, it's different in 

this respect.  It's different that there they were 

10

talking about who owns the mineral rights.  So for those 

11

purposes they say it's treated like an easement.  But 

12

for who gets the reverter, it's treated like a shift of 

13

the fee. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, that's nice.  Do you 

15

know of any other real estate thing which says it's an 

16

easement for one purpose and the fee for another?  The 

17

government absolutely denied in Great Northern, didn't 

18

it?  It was  that was the government's case; this was 

19

not a fee. 

20

 MR. LECHNER: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Exactly. 
They didn't say it's a 

22

you know, for some purposes it is.  They said it was not 

23

a fee.  And that's what the Court held, contrary  in 

24

accordance with what the government wanted, right? 

25

 MR. LECHNER: 

Correct.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

1
2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And that case has been 

around for how long? 

3

 MR. LECHNER: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

72 years. 
Okay.  And the case 

5

explicitly says it's an easement.  And people have been 

6

buying and selling real estate I assume in reliance on 

7

that case for  for that entire period of time.  And 

8

now the government has this new theory that for some 

9

purposes it's a fee; for some purposes it's an easement. 

10
11

That's not what Great Northern said. 
 MR. LECHNER: 

No, but I think it's important 

12

that  the argument that the government is making today 

13

is similar to their alternative argument that they made 

14

there in Great Northern, saying, okay, well, if it's not 

15

an easement, then it's a limited fee in the surface. 

16

 This Court in Great Northern did not even 

17

address that alternative argument, which shows how 

18

strongly this Court in Great Northern believed it was 

19

just an easement.  And this 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But they are not 

21

really not alternative  well, maybe it's all right to 

22

say they are alternative arguments, but they are 

23

mutually exclusive arguments.  I mean they are 

24

alternative in the sense that they led to the same 

25

result, but the one argument is that this is A, and the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

other argument is this is not A. 
 MR. LECHNER: 

Yes.  They'd be mutually 

exclusive. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  We have a 

5

brief here from the cities, and they point out that 

6

that, of course, there is reliance on your side; 

7

you're  I believe you are absolutely right.  But they 

8

say there is also a lot of reliance on the other side, 

9

because cities have built highways, and they've  or 

10

states have, and they've converted it to use under 

11

patents or under statutes that the United States gave 

12

them that right.  And all those are going to be invalid 

13

if you win. 

14

 So what's your response to that? 

15

 MR. LECHNER: 

16

They would all  I'm not sure 

that they would be invalid, necessarily. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. LECHNER: 

Why  why? 
Well, I'm not  I don't know 

19

where all the city public highways' interests are, 

20

visàvis how the land was originally patented.  It 

21

could have been originally patented in a town site plat 

22

or something like that, that  as opposed to here, 

23

where it was originally patented to one  under one 

24

patent, and I'm not sure how all the cities' property 

25

was acquired.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I assume your answer would 

2

be that if it's a choice between disappointing people 

3

who properly relied on the law, and disappointing people 

4

who were  were not following the law, it's clear who 

5

should  who should take it in the neck.  It's the 

6

latter, isn't it? 

7

 MR. LECHNER: 

Absolutely, plus the cities 

8

also have the  the power of the eminent  the power 

9

of eminent domain.  And if they would want a public 

10
11

highway, they certainly could condemn one. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought this  the 

12

cities were relying on Section 912, as applied to the 

13

1875 Act. 

14

 MR. LECHNER: 

That's what  that's what 

15

they  that's what the cities were relying on.  But you 

16

must keep in mind that Section 912 did not alter or 

17

amend the 1875 Act, so the nature of the grant in the 

18

1875 Act must be looked through the eyes of Congress in 

19

1875. 

20

 In 1922, when Congress passed Section 912, 

21

Congress was grappling with what to do with these 

22

isolated strips of land that would be administratively 

23

burdensome to manage.  And they said  well, 

24

originally, they said, well, let's give them to the 

25

settlers because they are the ones entitled to it in the

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

first place, and then  and then as an afterthought 

2

said, well, let's put these as a public highway. 

3

 But they did not amend the grant under the 

4
5

1875 Act or alter the amended grant. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, can you explain to 

6

me something to me about that 1875 Act a little bit?  We 

7

know that until 1871, these railroad rightsofway were 

8

considered to leave the government in the position of 

9

having a reversionary interest. 

10

 MR. LECHNER: 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Correct. 
And I don't see anything 

12

in the 1875 Act statute.  There was an end to the giving 

13

away of large  large quantities of land to the 

14

railroad, and so that was out.  But what is there in 

15

the 1875 Act that changes the rightofway from what it 

16

had been up until 1871? 

17

 MR. LECHNER: 

As the government argued in 

18

Great Northern and as this Court adopted that argument, 

19

the key provision in the 1875 Act is Section 4, which 

20

reserved the right to Congress to dispose of the lands 

21

underlying 1875 rightsofway to settlers. 

22

 And this was a reflection of the change of 

23

policy in 1871 because that's where the Congress changed 

24

its policy to  in an effort to secure homesteads to 

25

actual settlers as opposed to benefiting the railroads.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 In Section 4, as this Court said in Great 

2

Northern, after language to demonstrate a conveyance of 

3

an easement would be hard to find. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the railroad wasn't 

5

benefited by the end of the 1871 understanding of the 

6

rightofway.  The one that was benefited was the 

7

government.  The government got  got back the land, so 

8

it's not  we're not  was going to stop giving land 

9

to the railroad, yes, but the beneficiary that is losing 

10
11

out under your interpretation is the government. 
 MR. LECHNER: 

But it's  it's not only my 

12

interpretation, it's the interpretation of the Court in 

13

Great Northern that it was an easement.  And this Court 

14

was not  this Court in Great Northern knew the 

15

difference of the word "easement" and knew what the 

16

significance of using that term would mean.  So did the 

17

government at the time. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There were  there were 

19

points along the rightofway where the railroad needed 

20

a station or a wider area for water towers and so forth. 

21

And it  it usually could receive those by simply 

22

filing a patent if it was within a permitted zone, if it 

23

was within  if they were 20 miles equidistant or 

24

something like that. 

25

 How did they get those additional lands?

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. LECHNER: 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The station 
One way they could do them 

3

was to condemn them, but absent condemnation, could they 

4

just receive them from the government? 

5

 MR. LECHNER: 

Well, under  under the 1875 

6

Act, yes, Congress did provide for station grounds.  The 

7

railroad could secure station grounds by filing a map of 

8

the station grounds with the local land office, and once 

9

the secretary approved, then they would acquire the 

10
11

station grounds. 
 But the nature of the grant that they 

12

required on the station grounds is the same as for the 

13

rightofway, and that's merely an easement. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Oh.  So it's  so it was 

15

clear at the time of the grant that it was on the 

16

that what was granted was coextensive with what the 

17

rightofway was, with the railroad rightofway. 

18

 MR. LECHNER: 

Yes.  And that was how the 

19

Department of Interior originally interpreted it in 

20

1888, as the  the railroad didn't get a fee in 

21

anything, it got a rightofway  it got an easement in 

22

the railroad  in the rightofway and in the station 

23

grounds. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Are there any instances in 

which the railroad can keep its station even if it

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

abandons the rightofway?  Or does the station fall 

2

with the  when the rightofway is abandoned? 

3

 MR. LECHNER: 

I think the right  the 

4

station grounds are tied to the rightofway.  So if you 

5

abandon the rightofway, the station grounds would also 

6

be extinguished and unburden the underlying fee. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Could I ask you again about 

8

Section 912?  Your patent says that it is subject to 

9

those rights for railroad purposes as have been granted 

10

to the railway company in particular, and its successors 

11

and assigns. 

12

 Now, that was  that patent came after the 

13

enactment of 912, and 912 clarifies the rights of  or 

14

changes the rights of railroad companies and says that 

15

if they abandon property, within one year after that, 

16

they  there can be a public highway established on 

17

that  on that property.  So why wasn't your patent 

18

subject to that? 

19

 MR. LECHNER: 

Well  well, first, I 

20

don't  912 did not change the grant to the railroad. 

21

912 applies if the government has any remaining interest 

22

in the rightofway. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, you didn't get your 

24

property from the railroad.  You got it from the 

25

government.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. LECHNER: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Correct. 
You got a patent from the 

3

government.  So the question is:  What were they 

4

conveying to you?  And if you read the patent in 

5

connection with 912, isn't it clear they're conveying to 

6

you every  arguably everything other than this right 

7

to have a public highway established on that land when 

8

it was abandoned by the railroad? 

9

 MR. LECHNER: 

They were conveying it subject 

10

to those rights for railroad purposes is the specific 

11

language.  And but 912 does not create a reservation; it 

12

doesn't create a right of reverter.  It was simply to 

13

deal with what they were going to do with these strips 

14

of land upon abandonment. 

15

 Because at the time, that's when abandonment 

16

of the railroads first began, Congress was worried we 

17

were going to have these isolated strips.  It didn't 

18

change the 1875 Act, it didn't change the previously 

19

granted rightsofway to expand the scope of them. 

20

 But when they were abandoned and they came 

21

back under the law at the time that the government had 

22

the implied condition of reverter, they came back.  The 

23

government said, okay, well, if you want to establish a 

24

public highway, that's fine, otherwise, it's going to 

25

go  it's going to inure to the benefit of the settler.

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But it didn't change the nature of the 

2

grant.  It didn't change the 1875 Act.  It didn't create 

3

it.  It did not create an interest that wasn't there 

4

before.  It was just how to deal with the interest that 

5

the  that Congress thought it had after this Court's 

6

decision in Townsend and Stringham. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I still don't understand it. 

8

You say this was purely an easement.  All right.  So 

9

that means that when there's an abandonment, the 

10

government has complete title to the property, right? 

11

They convey that property to you, but before they do 

12

that, they say that there's this reservation of rights 

13

with respect to the establishment of a highway. 

14

 MR. LECHNER: 

I'm  I'm  one  well, 

15

I'm  I'm troubled.  Under  under your hypothetical, 

16

the government still owns the underlying land when the 

17

railroad's abandoned?  So when the railroad is 

18

abandoned, the two estates merge.  There was one. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's your argument, isn't 

it? 
 MR. LECHNER: 

Well, I think that's the 

22

argument under  under the common law, too, is  is 

23

what 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

 MR. LECHNER: 

Yes.  Okay.  And may be 
So they  they merge.

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

2

 MR. LECHNER: 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But that's your argument. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, what about when 912 

It may be a good argument. 
They merge. 

5

says that when the railroad abandons a piece of the 

6

rightofway, okay, it then says that the interest of 

7

the United States, with all right, title, and interest 

8

in the state of the United States shall be vested in the 

9

town that builds the highway. 

10

 But your point is, that's true, but where 

11

they previously  where they have previous  where 

12

they have given  where they conveyed it to a private 

13

person, they didn't have any right, title, and interest, 

14

because on abandonment it was simply an easement.  And 

15

on abandonment, that goes to the property owner who owns 

16

the  the land on either side. 

17

 Is that  I mean, your point is that the 

18

United States didn't have any right, title, and interest 

19

on the abandonment unless the United States continued to 

20

own the property. 

21

 MR. LECHNER: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

Correct. 
All right.  So that is your 

point.  They can't convey what they don't have. 

24

 MR. LECHNER: 

25

Correct. 
Okay.

Let's take this in a 

3

normal easement situation.  I have an easement to go 

4

through your backyard to get to the street.  Can I 

5

assign that easement to another person so that the 

6

person who buys my home can now walk through your 

7

backyard? 

8

 MR. LECHNER: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

In certain circumstances, yes. 
So what's wrong with the 

10

concept that when this land was given to you as a 

11

railroad rightofway, when it's abandoned, that the 

12

railroad, in essence, under 1912, and under the 1922 

13

Act, that you are giving that easement to the U.S. to 

14

use as a rightofway? 

15

 And so, whether it's a trail or a highway or 

16

any of the other items that are specified in the statute 

17

that that easement is continuing to be used by the 

18

person who gave it, which was originally the U.S. Your 

19

patent was given subject to that easement, to that 

20

rightofway. 

21

 MR. LECHNER: 

It was subject to those rights 

for railroad purposes, correct. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 MR. LECHNER:

about whether that was actually the language, was it

subject to those rights.  The last full paragraph, 

16

"subject to those rights for railroad purposes have been 

17

granted to the railroad under the 1875 Act."

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

given to the railroad was a rightofway. 

20

 MR. LECHNER: 

21

and a right of passage. 

22

The 1875 Act, what was 

A right to lay their tracks 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Just as I'm seeing the 

23

1875 grant, it was the rightofway through public 

24

lands. 

25

 MR. LECHNER: 

Well, yes, and as the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 government argued in Great Northern that that was 

2

 that right in the 1875 Act was a right to lay tracks and 

3

 it was a right of passage, an easement. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Lechner, I know Great Northern said so 

5

and that is surely very strong support for your 

6

 view.  But why did Great Northern think that there was a 

7

 difference between pre1871 grants and post? 

8
9

 MR. LECHNER: 

First, the shift in Congress's 

 policy.  And the railroads fell out of disfavor and 

10

 Congress passed resolution saying  you know, we want 

11

 to hold on to these lands to secure homesteads for 

12

 actual settlers. 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I mean, I guess I had thought if you 

14

 were just dealing with this as a matter of first 

15

 impression that the shift in Congress's policy was a 

16

 shift about whether to give away  you know, huge 

17

 swaths of land to the railroads, and that Congress 

18

 indeed decided, enough of this, we are not going to give 

19

 these checkerboard grants of land to the railroad, 

20

 because they are making a mint from this, and we would 

21

 rather give it to homesteaders. 

22

 But there was  I don't see any evidence 

23

 that there was any shift in policy or any reason why 

24

 there would be a shift in policy, as to what the rights 

25

 of way were.  Whether they were easements or whether

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 they were limited fees. 

2

 MR. LECHNER: 

Well, Section 4 has a lot to 

3

 do with that, and that is where Congress reserved the 

4

 right to dispose of the underlying lands to the 

5

 settlers.  That provision is not found in the pre1871 

6

 railroad grants, and this Court in Great Northern looked 

7

 at that and you say, you got to look at Section 4, that 

8

 provides light on how to interpret the rightofway 

9

 grant in Section 1. 

10

 And because of Congress's intent and the 

11

 legislative history surrounding similar language when 

12

 Congress passed it in 1872, they called it the 

13

 rightofway is merely going to be an encumbrance. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess  you know, again, 

15

 if you were just looking at this as a matter of first 

16

 impression, the language of Section 4 does not seem to 

17

 me to be very indicative of anything.  You know, it says 

18

 "subject to the rightofway."  Subject to the 

19

 rightofway.  Whatever the rightofway is.  Subject to 

20

 the rightofway if it's an easement.  Subject to the 

21

 rightofway if it's a limited fee.  Doesn't seem to 

22

 pick one or the other. 

23

 MR. LECHNER: 

But as the government argued 

24

 in Great Northern, it would be silly to patent the 

25

 underlying lands subject to a fee.  I mean, there would

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 be no reason for that language at all if the railroad 

2

 got a fee.  And then you patented the  in effect it 

3

 would be the adjacent land, not the underlying land. 

4

 There would be no reason to say that the adjacent land 

5

 is subject to a fee because with the limited fees, they 

6

 were envisioning those things going to the center of the 

7

 earth. 

8

 So you would be patenting the adjacent land. 

9

 But under Section 4 and as Great Northern interpreted, 

10

 the patents go to the underlying land and that's what 

11

 happened in this case, because Brandt owns the 

12

 underlying land and minerals. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, in your answer it 

14

 seemed to me, and maybe you have to do this to proffer, that you 

15

 confused limited fee with fee simple ,with absolute fee. 

16

 Now, obviously that's true if it's the same owner, they 

17

 merge. 

18

 MR. LECHNER: 

Well, I was using limited fee 

19

 in the context as this Court used it in Townsend, 

20

 limited fee with the implied condition of reverter.  I 

21

 mean, even in Townsend 1903, the railroad got it all, 

22

 but it was subject to implied condition of reverter if 

23

 they stopped using it for railroad purpose.  But they 

24

 did give fee simple absolute to the center of the earth 

25

 is how it was construed at that time.

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

 So that sheds light on the fact that Section 

2

 4 reflects that only an easement was granted because you 

3

 would not need to have Subject 2 language at all if you 

4

 were just patenting the adjacent lands. 

5

 It is also well established that the Department of Interior's 

6

 interpretation of public land laws such as the 1875 Act is 

7

 entitled to great deference.  This is because public 

8

 land laws provide for the acquisition of the title, 

9

 which must be secure.  Beginning in 1888 and 

10

 continuing through today, the Department of Interior 

11

 still construes the 1875 Act as easements and they can 

12

 still construe 1875 Act rights of way as different from 

13

 pre1871. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't understand how that 

15

 can be, and yet, the government can argue contrary to 

16

 what the government says.  I mean, is that what you are 

17

 telling us? 

18

 MR. LECHNER: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm saying 
The Interior says one thing 

20

 and the Justice Department here says something else?  I 

21

 mean, we have a president who reconciles these two 

22

 things.  He must agree with one or the other. 

23

 MR. LECHNER: 

Well, I think, under this 

24

 Court's precedent, you defer to the agency in charge of 

25

 administering the 1875 Act, and that is the Department

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 of Interior.  And the Department of Interior has 

2

 consistently interpreted these as  these rights of way 

3

 as easements and that interpretation is entitled to 

4

 substantial deference. 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm sure the government 

 will have an explanation as to why we shouldn't. 
 MR. LECHNER: 

If it pleases the Court, I 

8

 would like to reserve the remainder of my time for 

9

 rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Yang.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG 

13
14
15
16

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. YANG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court: 
 The statute, its legislative history, the 

17

 surrounding statutory context which includes Section 912 

18

 as well as 1906 and 1909 Acts and this Court's decisions 

19

 construing the 1875 Act including Section 4 which 

20

 predated Great Northern show that the United States 

21

 retains the reversionary interest in the surface of the 

22

 land of rightofways granted to railroads 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Mr. Yang, I have to say I 

24

 think the government gets a prize for understatement 

25

 with its brief in this case.  You have a sentence in

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 your brief that says, "We acknowledge that there is 

2

 language in this Court's opinion in Great Northern and 

3

 in the government's brief in that case that lends some 

4

 support to petitioner's contrary argument." 

5

 Here are the subject headings of the 

6

 government's brief in Great Northern.  "The rightofway 

7

 granted by the Act of March 3, 1875, is in the nature of 

8

 an easement.  The language of the 1875 Act shows that 

9

 only an easement was granted.  The legislative 

10

 background and history of the 1875 Act show that the 

11

 grant was of an easement rather than a fee. 

12

 Subsequent administrative and congressional 

13

 construction confirm that only an easement was granted." 

14

 And the first sentence of the summary of the 

15

 argument 

16

 MR. YANG: 

There is also other portions of 

17

 the brief.  I would refer the Court, for instance, to 

18

 Footnote 4 where the government said there would be a 

19

 separate question raised about whether a patent holder 

20

 subsequently who obtains the patent after the grant of 

21

 rightofway would take this government interest.  And 

22

 the Court  the government said in fact that would 

23

 raise different questions. 

24
25

 The Court recognized that on pages  the 
 last two pages of its opinion, it specifically limited

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 its judgment to situations where the government retained 

2

 interest in the entire surrounding parcel and, in fact, 

3

 modified the judgment below which enjoined the railroad 

4

 from oil drilling simply to apply to that. 

5
6
7

 Not only that, the Court was writing on 
 the government didn't cite, for instance 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Wait, wait.  Before you go, 

8

 you really think the Court was saying, It will be an 

9

 easement when that suits the government, but it will be 

10

 something else when that suits the government? 

11

 MR. YANG: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, I think what the Court was 
I mean, it's either an 

13

 easement or it's not an easement.  You really think 

14

 the  the opinion meant to reserve the question whether 

15

 it was an easement. 

16

 MR. YANG: 

I do with respect to the issue 

17

 that we have here.  The question before the Court was 

18

 whether the rightofway, which is a statutory term, 

19

 Congress could have used "easement"; it could have used 

20

 "fee."  It did not.  It uses a special statutory term 

21

 which has accumulated meaning over time, particularly, 

22

 in the railroad context. 

23

 And in that context, the Court was deciding 

24

 whether it was in the nature of an easement, which as 

25

 our subject heading said, it's in the nature of an

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 easement.  But that's visàvis the United States 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

 MR. YANG: 

I got that point. 
 with respect to the mineral 

4

 lands.  And, in fact, the shift that, Justice Kagan, you 

5

 were talking about is a shift about subsidies.  It was a 

6

 shift of subsidy away from these lavish land grants. 

7

 And when Congress was stopping that  that lavish grant 

8

 to railroads, it made no sense to construe the act with 

9

 respect to the mineral rights, which the Court said 

10

 were  were mineral riches.  Why would Congress do that 

11

 when it was cutting back on 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That may be. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right. 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But the term "easement" is a 

15

 wellknown term with an established meaning.  And you're 

16

 saying that  you said it was an easement.  The Court 

17

 said it was an easement.  You  you persuaded the Court 

18

 to say it was an easement.  And now you're saying this 

19

 is some kind of property right that has no name, 

20

 previously unknown to the law. 

21

 MR. YANG: 

It's a rightofway.  And, in 

22

 fact, the government's brief also said that with 

23

 respect  and I'm quoting from page 9  with respect 

24

 to the surface  the control  under any of the 

25

 theories, even under the easement theory, which I don't

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 believe is a true common law easement, the railroad's 

2

 control of the surface was complete.  And then we went 

3

 on further  and this is on pages 36 to 37  that said 

4

 it was a fact that the rightofway has some of the 

5

 attributes of a fee, and those included exclusive and 

6

 perpetual occupation and remedies 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Let me put it 

 this way. 
 MR. YANG: 

And so, again, if we were to 

10

 rewrite our brief, we would certainly do so much more 

11

 carefully now.  But I think that the way that you read 

12

 the brief is the way that you read opinions, which is in 

13

 the context in which it was decided, particularly 

14

 because Footnote 4, and this Court's opinion responding 

15

 to Footnote 4, made clear that they were only addressing 

16

 mineral rights where the United States held the 

17

 surrounding parcel. 

18

 And  and that's particularly true because 

19

 this Court had already construed Section 4 of the 1875 

20

 Act before Great Northern in Stalker and in Steinke. 

21

 And in Stalker, the Court held that the subject to 

22

 this is on page 154  a patent was subject to the 

23

 railroad rights acquired by approval.  That's the 

24

 approval in Section 4, in the subject to language in 

25

 Section 4.

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 "Upon approval, the grounds so selected were 

2

 segregated from the public lands and the required 

3

 material to withdraw the land granted from the market." 

4

 And then the Court goes on, and this is on page 154 

5

 again, "The later patent," the patent issued to a 

6

 settler.  Even though the local land office forgot to or 

7

 omitted to mark the rightofway on the land plats, the 

8

 subsequent patent was inoperative to pass title to those 

9

 later patentholders. 

10

 And then in Steinke  this is 1922  the 

11

 Court followed Stalker and said, "The approved map under 

12

 Section 4 is the equivalent of a patent."  And then they 

13

 go on to say, citing Stalker, that the later patent was 

14

 inoperative to pass title. 

15

 And I think it's important, in both of those 

16

 cases, the Court cited to Interior's regulations.  In 

17

 Stalker, the Court quoted at length the regulations from 

18

 1888, which, although the Court suggested that in Great 

19

 Northern those were the first regulations, they actually 

20

 weren't. 

21

 There were prior regulations in 1878 which 

22

 discuss nothing about the nature of the fee.  And those, 

23

 unfortunately, are hard to find.  They are in Senate 

24

 Executive Document 30, 45th Congress, Third Session, 

25

 1879.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So  but the regs that the Petitioners now 

2

 rely on were specifically referenced by the Court, 

3

 including the regs that say the disposition of the land 

4

 surrounding the rightofway is subject to the 

5

 rightofway. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Yang, the Petitioners 

7

 say that there are thousands or even tens of thousands 

8

 of people in their position.  Do you dispute that? 

9
10
11

 MR. YANG: 

We don't have good numbers, 

 actually, on that. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But what are the numbers? 

12

 I mean, look, this is what I'm thinking.  This is 

13

 property law.  It's not just a question of trying to 

14

 work out what the case could or couldn't have stood for. 

15

 If I try to remember my property class, it vaguely 

16

 was  which was a great class, A. James Casner, real 

17

 expert. 

18

 And he  he, I think, said that when you 

19

 convey subject of divestment, the  something called 

20

 season under the common law went to the recipient of the 

21

 conveyance. 

22

 But if you conveyed an easement, season did 

23

 not pass.  So in holding that it is an easement, you're 

24

 holding there was no season, and therefore, it couldn't 

25

 be a divestiture.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, whether that's true or not or I've 

2

 misremembered it, I'd go back to Justice Scalia's 

3

 question.  Is there a single example since the Domesday 

4

 Book, since Dadonis, since the Bracton, on little to 

5

 whatever it was, I mean, in the history of the common 

6

 law up to the present, where a court has interpreted an 

7

 ambiguous phrase, which doesn't say to grant an easement 

8

 for one purpose, but not for the other.  There may be 

9

 some, but I didn't notice any cited in the government's 

10
11

 brief. 
 MR. YANG:

 MR. YANG: 

But there are some, but the point 

21

 was they were trying to discuss the nature of a 

22

 statutory rightofway.  Congress did not use the term 

23

 "easement," it did not use the term "fee."  And so the 

24

 Court has been using common law terms which don't fit 

25

 perfectly to describe certain kinds of 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you imagine or explain 

2

 to me why a property lawyer worth his salt since 

3

 70 years ago or more, 1942, wouldn't have read that case 

4

 and advised his client, who was buying the land, if the 

5

 railroad abandons it, it's yours. 

6

 MR. YANG: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8
9
10

Yes.  There are 
Where is some evidence of 

 that? 
 MR. YANG: 

There are at least four reasons. 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, not reasons.  I want to 

11

 know if there's any authority, and then you get to the 

12

 the reasons. 

13

 MR. YANG: 

Oh, yes.  There's both statutory and 

14

 case law authority.  I would start with Stalker and 

15

 Steinke, which specifically say that when you have 

16

 approved the map, it's equivalent to a patent, and then 

17

 therefore, any parcel subject  is  conveyed subject 

18

 to the patent or the rightofway, which means you don't 

19

 get any interest at least in the surface of the 

20

 rightofway. 

21

 So this  those cases have never been 

22

 overruled, one.  Two, Congress in 1906, and this is 

23

 this isn't significant.  This is at page  Section 940 

24

 at page 7  6A and 7A of our brief.  Congress said that 

25

 each and every grant of rightofway under this 1875

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

 Act  each and every one  "shall be declared 

2

 forfeited if they haven't been constructed," and  this 

3

 is important  "the United States resumes the full

5

 from such easement"

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 we're talking about is Great Northern.  And, in fact, 

2

 Great Northern quotes this language of Section 940.  The 

3

 very next section goes on to say that the government's 

4

 interests shall inure to the benefit of the land 

5

 conveyed by the United States previously, which was 

6

 subject to the rightofway. 

7

 So that section itself shows that starting 

8

 in 1906, and that's both 1906 and 1909, Congress 

9

 understood that the government had a reversionary 

10
11

 interest. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 back to my question? 

13

 MR. YANG: 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Yang, can I take you 

Sure. 
Thousands, tens of 

15

 thousands?  How many people are involved here and how 

16

 many acres of land? 

17

 MR. YANG: 

Again, we don't know because the 

18

 way that these things are disposed of, there has not 

19

 been a centralized way of tracking it.  It could be a 

20

 significant amount, because the 1875 Act rightsofways 

21

 were at least in number the most numerous. 

22

 It's hard to know about mileage because the 

23

 specific land grants were often quite long, but in 

24

 terms  there were at least a significant number of 

25

 1875 Act rights of ways.

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And so going back to Justice Breyer's 

2

 question about why a good lawyer would not have great 

3

 pause about saying that you got the surface interests. 

4

 You have Stalker and Steinke.  You have the Section 940, 

5

 which was enacted in 1906 and 1909. 

6

 You have Section 922  Section 912, which 

7

 was enacted in 1922, which the Court has already 

8

 discussed, which shows that whenever there is a forfeiture, 

9

 the United States' interest reverts  to first for roads and 

10

 then to municipalities, and if there was anything left 

11

 it would go to a land owner. 

12

 That  you know, was unquestioned it 

13

 appears until  at least with the surface interests 

14

 until the mid1980s, for 60 years.  The municipalities 

15

 and roads were 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I see that they do 

17

 and I certainly think bicycle paths are a good idea, but 

18

 the problem that I see here is just what Justice Kagan 

19

 is bringing up; that is, as I read this, I think there 

20

 might be millions of acres in the last 70 years that 

21

 have been conveyed.  For all I know, there is some right 

22

 of way that goes through people's houses  you know, 

23

 and all of a sudden, they are going to be living in 

24

 their house and suddenly a bicycle will run through it, 

25

 which isn't so bad, but I'm concerned about that, and

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 your answer makes me more concerned 

2

 MR. YANG: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I think it's telling 
 because you haven't 

4

 suggested anything that makes me think there aren't 

5

 millions and millions of acres involved.  Now, what are 

6

 you going to say that disabuses me of that? 

7

 MR. YANG: 

Well, I think it's telling that 

8

 between 1922 and the mid1980s this issue does not 

9

 appear to have arisen.  It has arisen only with respect 

10
11

 to 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Exactly, because the lawyer 

12

 would think  when he reads the case of Great Northern, 

13

 you think it's an easement. 

14

 MR. YANG: 

And then when the city takes the 

15

 road and when the municipality  excuse me  when the 

16

 municipality takes the right of way no one complained 

17

 for 60 years?  I mean, this is the background of the 

18

 law.  This is going to be 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So how much is that?  How 

20

 much roughly is that?  How often has it turned out that 

21

 there was a conveyance  after 1942 there was a 

22

 conveyance of an abandoned right of way by the United 

23

 States to land that had been previously been granted to 

24

 a private owner? 

25

 MR. YANG: 

The amicus brief of 

37

 JUSTICE BREYER:

 MR. YANG:

6

How often? 
Again, we don't have good numbers 

 on how often. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know you don't have good 

 numbers, but can you give me a rough estimate? 
 MR. YANG: 

I think a significant amount of 

7

 time, because the  if you look at the amicus brief of 

8

 the National Council on State Legislatures, they explain 

9

 this.  This is 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I will say ten times as 

11

 much reliance on the one side than the other side, is 

12

 that totally wrong? 

13

 MR. YANG: 

Your Honor, I can't speculate on 

14

 numbers.  I just don't have  it would be not 

15

 appropriate for me for the United States to speculate on 

16

 numbers. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Yang, would you 

18

 clarify what you're  what Mr. Lechner told us.  He 

19

 said that to this very day the Department of Interior 

20

 has taken the position that these railroad rights of way 

21

 are easements. 

22

 MR. YANG: 

That's not correct because it 

23

 needs to be qualified.  After Great Northern, Interior 

24

 has concluded in Amerada Hess, which we cite in our 

25

 brief, that the subsurface interests would go to the

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 patentee, but with respect to the surface interests, 

2

 that has not been the case. 

3

 In fact, until 1984 is the first case that I 

4

 have seen in a case that let  that was the counterpart 

5

 to the Oregon Short Line case that we cite that led to 

6

 the decision here.  It just wasn't disputed about the 

7

 surface interest. 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why then did no one 

 from the Department of Interior join your brief? 

10

 MR. YANG: 

11

 don't always 

They agree with our brief.  We 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 choice, do they?  I mean, it's 

14

 MR. YANG: 

They don't have a 

No, we have been in close 

15

 consultation with the Department of Interior and they have 

16

 signed off on this brief.  The agency that is at issue 

17

 here is actually agriculture because agriculture is the 

18

 forest service which has the lands.  I think 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But both of them want more 

20

 Federal lands, that's surprising, right, both 

21

 agriculture and 

22

 MR. YANG: 

I think that's maybe a little 

23

 unfair, Justice Scalia.  I think government is giving 

24

 the Court its view of the law here.  We are interpreting 

25

 it.  Multiple agencies have been consulted and we've

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 been trying to come to grips with the Court's 

2

 conflicting  you know, language. 

3

 If you take language in the abstract and you 

4

 divorce it from the context of the case, the Court's 

5

 decisions are conflicting, but when you look at the 

6

 context of the case, you look at Great Northern with 

7

 respect to saying that the subsurface interests, the 

8

 mineral interests are like an easement with respect to 

9

 the United States visàvis the railroad, but then you 

10

 have Stalker and Steinke saying that when under Section 

11

 4 of the Act  it's an authoritative construction of 

12

 Section 4 of the Act.  When you approve a map of a 

13

 railroad under Section 4, it is tantamount to a patent 

14

 and thereafter a subsequent patent does not confer an 

15

 interest on the patentee. 

16

 Those cases are reconciled, we think, by 

17

 acknowledging that Stalker and Steinke control at least 

18

 with respect to the surface interests, and then with 

19

 respect to the subsurface interests, Great Northern 

20

 clearly says that, at least visàvis the United States 

21

 and the railroad where there is no thirdparties 

22

 involved that is deemed to be like an easement that 

23

 would not give a subsurface interest.  And there is real 

24

 important reasons to distinguish between the subsurface 

25

 and the surface with respect to rights of way.

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Surface for the right of way is what's 

2

 important.  It's critical.  You need to have an artery 

3

 that connects various parcels of land.  That was true 

4

 back when 1875 was enacted and it's true now with 

5

 respect to highways and other uses that the government 

6

 might put its land to. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The patent here, Mr. Yang, 

8

 which was, what, in the mid1970s did not reserve 

9

 anything.  The government just made an uncritical grant 

10

 to the grant family? 

11

 MR. YANG: 

12
13

And that was true both in Stalker 

 and in Steinke with respect to the subsequent patents. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I'm just suggesting 

14

 that after Great Northern and then you're given this 

15

 patent, which is unequivocal and does not reserve 

16

 anything, why anybody would think that they hadn't 

17

 gotten the whole ball of wax is a mystery. 

18

 MR. YANG: 

Well, I think you would have 

19

 to  I think if you had a good lawyer, the good lawyer 

20

 would say, Look, we've got  there is uncertainty here. 

21

 You've got Stalker and Steinke, which says you get no 

22

 interest.  You have Great Northern, which doesn't 

23

 address interest that pass to third parties. 

24

 It only addresses the interest that the 

25

 railroad has, and it says there is no mineral rights.

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And then you have Congress in 1906, 1909, 1922, and more 

2

 recently in 1988, doubling down and saying  you know, 

3

 the United States' interest goes to roads first. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

It seems to me a fair 

5

 reading of the history here, Mr. Yang, is that it really 

6

 didn't occur to the government until very recently that 

7

 these rights of way had value as anything other than 

8

 railroad tracks, and indeed that the government was 

9

 anxiously trying to give these things away because it 

10

 thought that these spaghetti strips of land, it's of no 

11

 use to the government, here, take them, get them off our 

12

 hands. 

13

 And having done that for many, many, many 

14

 decades, the government faces a problem when it turns 

15

 around and says, you know what, we forgot, there are 

16

 bike paths. 

17

 MR. YANG: 

I don't think that's quite 

18

 accurate.  At least since 1922, the government has 

19

 disposed of  or Congress, I should say, has directed 

20

 the government to dispose of its reversionary interests 

21

 first to roads, and that remains true today.  And then 

22

 also from 1922 until 1988, it was supposed to go to any 

23

 municipality, any land within a municipality goes to the 

24

 municipality; and then third, it would go to any land 

25

 owner of the surrounding parcel that was paying the

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 interest subject to the right of way. 
 Now, of course  you know, Congress is free 

3

 to choose to change its decision about how to dispose of 

4

 U.S. Government interests to any government property. 

5

 There is no vested interest in that.  And I think what 

6

 we are trying to say in our brief is that petitioner 

7

 asks the Court essentially to nullify a significant 

8

 significant enactments by Congress.  It would nullify 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's true, but when you 

10

 talk about  I mean, I went and read  when I read 

11

 I thought your brief was very persuasive but then I read 

12

 Great Northern and I thought they have  they are 

13

 really quoting it correctly. 

14

 Here's what they said about the cases that 

15

 you refer to like Stringer, The conclusion that the 

16

 railroad was the owner of a limited fee  which was the 

17

 conclusion of those earlier cases 

18

 arising out of the 1871 Act, not the 1875 Act, and the 

19

 change of policy in 1875 was brought  was not brought 

20

 to the Court's attention. 

21

was based on cases 

 And then they say that conclusion is 

22

 inconsistent with the language of the 1875 Act.  It's 

23

 history.  And it's early administrative interpretation. 

24

 We therefore do not regard this earlier case as 

25

 controlling.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. YANG: 

That was Townsend, which was 

2

 dictum.  We told the Court that Townsend was dictum.  In 

3

 Townsend, the dispute was by a railroad who got a decree 

4

 from a State court saying it had the right of way. 

5
6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 in the Stringer case.  Is that same as 

7

 MR. YANG: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9
10

Well, I thought they say 

Oh, I'm sorry, Stringer. 
Yes, that's the one you 

 were 
 MR. YANG: 

No, no, we are not relying on 

11

 we are relying on Stalker and Steinke, which are 1875 

12

 Act holdings.  It's this Court construing the very 

13

 statute that we're talking about, Section 4, which is 

14

 the very section that the petitioner  now, it would be 

15

 kind of remarkable to read language in Great Northern 

16

 which addressed a different question in which the 

17

 government specifically reserved the question of what 

18

 interest would transfer to a patentee. 

19

 The Court specifically limited its decision 

20

 so it wouldn't reach that issue.  And then it sub 

21

 silentio overruled two decisions by this Court on the 

22

 very statute decided 30 years earlier when the Court was 

23

 closer to the 1875 Act?  That would be a pretty 

24

 remarkable thing, I think.  And what we're saying is 

25

 that, no, Stalker and Steinke remain good law, even if

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 you characterize the right of way as having attributes 

2

 of an easement because it's clear it can't be a common 

3

 law easement. 

4

 I don't think that even  petitioner may be 

5

 able to dispute this  but a common law easement, as 

6

 this Court has explained, would not give as 

7

 traditionally framed exclusive and perpetual occupation 

8

 to the railroad.  It would not give the remedy of the 

9

 fee.  All those are very practical, real rights that 

10

 would have to be conferred that would be greater than a 

11

 mere common law easement.  And that's true back in 1871, 

12

 and it's true in 1875, and we said it was true in our 

13

 brief to this Court. 

14

 We said as an easement  you know, the fact 

15

 that it has some of the attributes of a fee, including 

16

 exclusive or perpetual occupation and the remedies of a 

17

 fee and not an easement, doesn't take it out of the box 

18

 of what we were talking about in that case. 

19

 And so, again, I think you need to read it 

20

 in context.  I agree that if you just take Great 

21

 Northern and look at it without peeling back the hood a 

22

 little bit, there's language that  you know, would 

23

 lead 

24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's  that's basically 

 my problem.  I guess you just don't have any specific

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 things of what property lawyers were saying.  But those 

2

 two cases are from the era of Stringer, and at that 

3

 point, apparently, the Court thought it was a limited 

4

 fee. 

5

 MR. YANG: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

7

One was before 

 were all  was any of them after Great Northern? 

8

 MR. YANG: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10
11

And then you get  they 

No, not after Great Northern. 
So  so then in Great 

 Northern it comes along? 
 MR. YANG: 

But Justice Breyer, I think it's 

12

 a mistake to rely on these labels of limited fee and 

13

 easement too strongly.  That's what this Court's 

14

 basically said in Union Pacific in 1957.  In Union 

15

 Pacific, the Court said look, these pre1871 cases use 

16

 the term "limited fee," but really, we're not going to 

17

 deem that to be controlling with respect to the mineral 

18

 rights. 

19

 And the Court is doing exactly what we're 

20

 saying should be done here, which is you understand the 

21

 rightofway in the context of the statutory text, in 

22

 the context of the environment, the surrounding 

23

 statutory environment in the context of this Court's 

24

 decisions, and it's not a binary blackorwhite choice 

25

 between  you know, common law terms.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Congress didn't use those common law terms. 

2

 Congress used the term "rightofway."  It used the same 

3

 text that it did in prior grants of rightsofway.  And 

4

 all we're trying to say is that there are real important 

5

 interests here.  It's not practically feasible to ever 

6

 reconstruct these arteries through the lands.  And they 

7

 were important when Congress granted them to develop the 

8

 lands in 1875, and they remain important today, as 

9

 Congress has now repeatedly recognized in terms of 

10
11

 granting public roads.  So 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do we know how many miles of 

12

 public roads and how many miles of bike trails have 

13

 been  you don't know that either? 

14

 MR. YANG: 

On bike trails, this is  this 

15

 is not a RailstoTrails Act case.  There are different 

16

 issues there.  On the RailstoTrails Act case  you 

17

 know, it's  I don't have in mileage, but this is a 

18

 trail that in this case the government used its property 

19

 interest through the national forests as well as through 

20

 this parcel for like a 22mile trail.  There are 

21

 probably 1,000 miles of trail that are  that would be 

22

 affected.  And importantly, there's a lot of interest 

23

 going forward that would be affected. 

24

 When the law again  the law of  in 1922 

25

 was that the Congress would reserve the United States'

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 interests for roads and municipalities and that was a 

2

 significant 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Are there highways that 

4

 would be affected?  I mean, if we rule for the Brandts, 

5

 are there suddenly going to be highways that can no 

6

 longer be highways anymore? 

7

 MR. YANG: 

It certainly would call into 

8

 question the legality of the land transfers.  And I'm 

9

 sure that could be something that could be litigated. 

10

 There would be issues  I'm sure defenses raised by the 

11

 States and municipalities. 

12

 But what the Court would be saying is that 

13

 for  since 1922, and this policy continues now, that 

14

 the highways that have been created under 1875 Act would 

15

 be invalid. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you think of anything I 

17

 can do about this?  It's a case, in my mind at least, 

18

 where reliance interests on  on a previous case in the 

19

 property law area are important, and yet none of the 

20

 briefs here really gives me a  a reasonably concrete 

21

 idea of how much reliance there has been.  And  and 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24
25

On easements. 
So I'm somewhat in the 

 dark. 
 MR. YANG: 

Yes.  It's difficult to know,

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 because again, these are kind of ad hoc things.  When 

2

 there's an abandonment, there might be proceedings, but 

3

 there's been  we've not been able to obtain 

4

 centralized, reliable information on the total number, 

5

 because this goes back a pretty long way.  We're talking 

6

 about, again, starting in 1922, you know.  This has been 

7

 unchallenged until we got two district court decisions 

8

 in '80  in the mid '80s with respect to the surface. 

9

 Now, on  on the subsurface, Great Northern 

10

 has  you know, continued to be applied by Interior and 

11

 that's been treated differently.  And I think it's 

12

 important also to remember that the regulations, not 

13

 only were they cited by this Court in Stalker and 

14

 Steinke, the Court was clearly aware of the regulations. 

15

 In 1931, the  a case called Otis Birch 

16

 where Interior basically followed Stalker and recognized 

17

 that you could not pass title.  Now, that was a Mineral 

18

 Act case, and the Court also  Interior also said that 

19

 because you can't separate the estates, or there's no 

20

 reason to separate the surface from the subsurface, the 

21

 mineral couldn't be transferred, either.  That's been 

22

 overtaken by events. 

23

 It's important to recognize in '31, and when 

24

 the regs were codified in the CFR in '38, which are the 

25

 1909 regs, which had never been changed or revisited on

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the nature of the interests, they simply just carried 

2

 forward, even though Interior recognized that the 

3

 there would be no interest given to patentees of the 

4

 land after a rightofway is granted under Section 4 of 

5

 the Act. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Maybe the reason you 

7

 don't have records on this, which strikes me as pretty 

8

 unusual that the government doesn't know what it owns, 

9

 is that for decades, you didn't think that you owned a 

10
11
12
13
14
15

 reversionary interest. 
 MR. YANG: 

Well, for decades, we thought we 

 owned a reversionary interest.  It's just that 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But you don't have 

 any records on where these things are. 
 MR. YANG: 

Well, but Congress told us 

16

 told everyone how to dispose of it.  It went to streets, 

17

 roads, highways, then to municipalities, and if then not 

18

 municipalities, it would go to the landowner.  So the 

19

 United States  you know, disposed of its reversionary 

20

 interests through statute.  It wasn't until 1988 that 

21

 the policy changed to  to prioritize highways and then 

22

 the U.S.'s interests after that. 

23

 So it's understandable why we haven't been 

24

 intimately involved with all these forfeitures that have 

25

 occurred over time.  Congress directed how the United

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 States interests should be disposed of. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What would  what would 

3

 be the exposure of the United States if we  if you lose

4

 are there takings claims now? 

5

 MR. YANG: 

There are takings claims also 

6

 that would  any 1875 Act case or rightofway which 

7

 has been abandoned, which has then put to another use, 

8

 whether it be a highway under the current Section 912, 

9

 or whether it reverts to the United States, or even if, 

10
11

 for instance, it doesn't revert to the United States 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are there any statute of 

12

 limitations?  Would all of this be subject to the APA, 

13

 or  or a claim for damages against the U.S.? 

14

 MR. YANG: 

I  I don't believe the APA 

15

 would govern a claim of damages against the U.S.  There 

16

 are takings claims which  which proceed under the 

17

 MR. YANG: 

Adverse possession is certainly 

 an issue that might  would come up. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I would think if there's 

24

 been no objection to these spaghetti strips of land, I 

25

 don't think condemnation would cost the government a

 MR. YANG: 

We faced a very considerable 

 amount of litigation in recent years. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Doesn't Interior or some 

8

 I mean, doesn't the highway  aren't there people in 

9

 the government who keep track of where the highways are 

10
11

 built? 
 MR. YANG: 

Well, for local roads?  This 

12

 is  the idea that these  these rightsofways would 

13

 go to States and localities, not Federal highways. 

14

 That's  that's Section 912. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but you should 

16

 should know how much land the United States owns.  It's 

17

  it's incredible that  that there's no record in the 

18

 Interior Department or anywhere else of what land the 

19

 United States own.  You claim you own these thousands of 

20

 acres, and you say we've not kept track of it.  We just 

21

 know where it's going to go, but we don't know what we 

22

 own. 

23

 MR. YANG: 

There are some records that you 

24

 can get from archives with respect to specific things, 

25

 but it's not centralized.  We don't have a way of

52

Alderson Reporting Company

 aggregating what has happened over the last 90 years.

 That's the difficulty that we have here.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. LECHNER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. LECHNER: 

We do know how many acres are 

10

 involved in this case, and the government is claiming 10 

11

 of the 83 acres that it patented to Marvin Brandt's 

12

 parents. 

13

 As this Court has noted, stare decisis 

14

 concerns are  in many cases involving property rights. 

15

 With respect to Stalker and Steinke, those were 

16

 preGreat Northern; those were limited fee cases.  At 

17

 most, they stand for first in time, first in right. 

18

 Steinke was written by Justice Van Devanter 

19

 who also wrote Stringham, which Great Northern 

20

 overturned.  And that's why Stalker and Steinke fell out 

21

 of use over the years.  And if Stalker and Steinke were 

22

 so important, the government should have brought those 

23

 cases to the Court's attention in Great Northern, but it 

24

 didn't. 

25

 With respect to the 1931 land decision the

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 government just brought up, I  I refer the Court to 

2

 solicitor's opinion 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I guess it would be the 

4

 private parties that would have brought it up in Great 

5

 Northern, wouldn't it? 

6

 And do you have any light to shed on the 

7

 comparative amounts?  I mean, they're saying  for all 

8

 we know there are billions of dollars worth of takings 

9

 claims that will come out where the highways run, and 

10

 you're arguing, of course, any reasonable property 

11

 lawyer would have relied on Great Northern to think it 

12

 was just conveying an easement. 

13

 But  you know, I'm not a property lawyer, 

14

 and so what actually happened matters.  And the amounts 

15

 matter, at least to me.  And do you have any light to 

16

 shed? 

17

 MR. LECHNER: 

I don't have any light to shed 

18

 on the actual mileage.  We know it's thousands.  We know 

19

 that 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about on your side? 

21

 What about the possibility that millions of acres has 

22

 been conveyed and there are tens of thousands or 

23

 hundreds of thousands of abandoned railroads that 

24

 property lawyers thought went to the person who bought 

25

 them, and run through somebody's house?  I mean, is that

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 a figment of my imagination? 

2

 MR. LECHNER: 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No. 
And you would say no, it 

4

 isn't, and therefore I'm asking you is there any 

5

 empirical support anywhere for how property lawyers have 

6

 treated Great Northern, how much was conveyed, 

7

 et cetera?  Anything you can say on that would be 

8

 helpful. 

9

 MR. LECHNER: 

I have nothing to say about 

10

 the quantity, but I know that with S.C.  the Seventh 

11

 Circuit ruled in S.C. Johnson that the title insurance 

12

 thought that was a landmark decision because it resolved 

13

 a lot of problems with the title insurance industry. 

14

 Each mile of the rightofway takes up 

15

 24 acres.  At one point there were 270,000, as this 

16

 Court noted in Preseault, there was 270,000 miles of 

17

 roads at the peak in the early 1920s and about 130 of 

18

 those had been abandoned by the time of the Preseault 

19

 decision. 

20

 I want to also address the forfeiture 

21

 provision that they mention and Great Northern relied on 

22

 Section 43, 940, to confirm its conclusion that the S 

23

 and D, these are easements because 43 U.S.C. 940 calls 

24

 them an easement.  And with respect to land that the 

25

 government still owned at the time of abandonment, they

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 said that the government's land would be discharged of 

2

 the easements. 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Is there any doctrine in 

4

 property law that if a right of access is granted and 

5

 its to the exclusion of all other uses, it's  it looks 

6

 for all purposes like absolute control, that it ceases 

7

 to be an easement and becomes a limited fee? 

8
9

 I mean, is there some magic that takes place 
 in property law so that if there's a grant that conveys 

10

 such total control, that it construed not to be an 

11

 easement? 

12

 MR. LECHNER: 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

14

 MR. LECHNER: 

15
16
17

I don't know of any. 
I've never seen it. 
Roads, highways are 

 conveyed 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Have you even heard of the 

 term "limited fee" until this case?  I never heard it. 

18

 MR. LECHNER: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: A. James Casner didn't talk to 

20

22

Well, I read these 

 me about limited fee. 
 MR. LECHNER: Well, I read these cases in law 
 school so I was aware of the term.
