ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. ANDRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

In these three cases, each of the three

11

petitioners filed administrative grievances with the

12

Michigan Department of Corrections.

13

Department of Corrections conducted investigations and

14

issued final decisions on the merits of petitioner's

15

grievances.

16

of the petitioner's complaints was thrown out of federal

17

court without leave to amend because petitioners failed

18

to satisfy on of the Sixth Circuit's judge-made

19

corollaries to the PLRA's exhaustion requirement.

20

of those three corollaries find any meaningful support

21

in the Federal Rules of Procedure, in fact they

22

contradict the federal rules.

23

support in administrative law or habeas law, the two

24

areas of law to which this Court looks for guidance in

25

interpreting administrative litigation and format.

The Michigan

Nevertheless, a year and a half later, each

None

Nor do they find any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Finally, the overwhelming majority of the circuits that

2

have considered these questions have rejected them all.

3

I'd like to begin with the heightened

4

pleading rule that the Sixth District applied here.

The

5

Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require a plaintiff to

6

simply provide a short claim statement of the basis on

7

which his or her claim will lie.

8

Civil Procedure do enumerate certain kinds of

9

allegations that a plaintiff must plead with

The Federal Rules of

10

specificity, those are enumerated in Federal Rule of

11

Civil Procedure 9(c), but exhaustion is not one of them.

12

Accordingly -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the district court

14

finds that in its experience, 80 percent of the claims

15

are ones that are unexhausted, just assume that.

16

the district court said, the only way I can figure out

17

the good 20 percent from the 80 percent that are going

18

to ultimately be dismissed is to have a motion for a

19

more definite, an order for a more definite statement,

20

because I'll do it sua sponte under 12(e), I think.

21

the district court do that?

22

MR. GRANT:

And

I think that would be correct,

23

and that would be consistent with the Court's habeas

24

jurisprudence.

25

Can

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The court could ask for a

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pleading which set forth the facts of exhaustion?

2

MR. ANDRE:

I believe that's true.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then why isn't this -

4

this is just the same if the court has said, you know,

5

in order to make our screening function efficient, we

6

just have to know about exhaustion.

7

MR. ANDRE:

Well, first of all, when

8

Congress created the various screening provisions in the

9

PLRA, it noticeably omitted exhaustion.

It clearly had

10

exhaustion in mind when it enacted the PLRA.

11

"exhaustion" appears in 42 U.S.C. 1997 -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The term

How about, what, if you

13

concede the district court could do it in individual

14

cases or in most cases, why can't the Sixth Circuit do

15

it?

16

That's my question.
MR. ANDRE:

Well, what sets the Sixth

17

Circuit's rule apart from I think the hypothetical you

18

propose, and also from this Court's habeas jurisprudence

19

is that in both of those scenarios the plaintiff, the

20

prisoner, is given a chance to respond.

21

Circuit, if they don't they don't satisfy the heightened

22

pleading rule at the minute that they file their initial

23

complaint, they are out.

24

and that's what happened in this case.

25

In the Sixth

There is no leave to amend,

In Petitioner Jones' case, he filed the
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

complaint and he actually did allege that he exhausted

2

his administrative remedies.

3

administrative remedies, I filed my step one grievance

4

on this date, I received a denial on that date, and he

5

went down the list through all three steps.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

He said:

I exhausted my

The briefs point out that a

7

number of district courts have form complaints that are

8

often used in these cases and that these forms call on

9

the prisoner-plaintiff to address the issue of

10

exhaustion.

11

with those forms, and if a prisoner fills out the form

12

and reveals in filling it out that a claim was not

13

exhausted, is it improper for the district court at the

14

screening stage to dismiss the case?

15

Now, do you think there's something wrong

MR. ANDRE:

With respect to the form, I

16

don't think that the form is improper, but I think it

17

would be improper for a court to dismiss the prisoner's

18

case if the prisoner failed to fill out the section of

19

the form that asks him about exhaustion because

20

exhaustion is an affirmative defense in both

21

administrative law and habeas, and there's no indication

22

in this statute that Congress -

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it's an affirmative

24

defense, then why is it -- why is it proper for a

25

district court, for a district court, to have a form
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that calls on the plaintiff to negate the affirmative

2

defense?

3

MR. ANDRE:

I think the district court can

4

ask the plaintiff pretty much whatever the district

5

court likes.

6

could dismiss a case for failure to comply, failure to

7

respond to that question, that's another matter.

8
9
10

But whether the district court could,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we know under

the statue they can dismiss a case because it's
frivolous, right?

11

MR. ANDRE:

Absolutely.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Regardless of the

13

substance of the claim on the merits, if you know that

14

you've just ignored the exhaustion requirement isn't

15

that a frivolous claim?

16

MR. ANDRE:

We would certainly concede that

17

if it is clear on the face of the complaint that a

18

prisoner has not exhausted his or her administrative

19

remedies then that claim can be dismissed.

20

way it would operate -- and I haven't seen a case like

21

this -- but it would be where a prisoner says, I didn't

22

exhaust my administrative remedies and I have no excuse

23

for failing to do so, but please, district court, please

24

take mercy on me.

25

court could say, there's absolutely no way you can

I guess the

And in that situation the district

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possibly prevail on the merits, so your claim -

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Probably the reason they do

3

this is that there are lots and lots of claims by

4

prisoners in Federal courts that are hard to decipher.

5

They don't know what it's about.

6

the defendant to the burden of coming in in every single

7

complaint when it's quite a good probability it's about

8

nothing.

9

to a rule like this.

They don't want to put

That's the kind of reasoning that would lead
So -- and then you have the

10

statute and the statute says indeed there's a special

11

power here to dismiss if it's frivolous or it doesn't

12

state a claim or malicious.

13

So why isn't this just an exercise of the

14

Sixth Circuit's or a court's ordinary subsidiary

15

rulemaking powers?

16

manage their docket.

17

They're trying to figure out how to

MR. ANDRE:

The problem is that it conflicts

18

with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 8.

19

this Court this repeatedly said, including as recently

20

as last term in Hill v. McDonough, the Court will not

21

impose a heightened pleading requirement absent an

22

amendment to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

If it's

1

MR. ANDRE:

I think that's correct.

2

that's correct, but if it -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think

If we amended the rules

4

that way, in effect it would no longer be an affirmative

5

defense.

6

gets raised by the defendant and so on, so if we amended

7

the Federal Rules in practical terms it would be like

8

adding an element to the claim.

I mean, by definition an affirmative defense

9
10

MR. ANDRE:

Right.

Or if the Court were to

add PLRA exhaustion to the Rule 9(c).

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But Rule 8 and the

12

normal rules weren't addressed to the unusual situation

13

under the PLRA where the district court has an

14

affirmative obligation screen on its own before the

15

defendant even gets involved.

16

follow on Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, 80 percent of

17

the cases have this exhaustion problem, why isn't this a

18

reasonable means of facilitating the screening

19

obligation?

20

MR. ANDRE:

So if in fact, just to

It may be a reasonable means,

21

but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's permissible,

22

because Congress had exhaustion in mind when it enacted

23

the PLRA and noticeably absent from all the PLRA

24

screening provisions is the term "exhaustion."

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, but you just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

told me earlier that if it was a case in which

2

exhaustion is required and not done that would be a

3

frivolous claim, and the statute does refer to frivolous

4

claims.

5

just said, we know that in a large number of cases they

6

are going to be frivolous because they have ignored the

7

exhaustion requirement, and we just want to try to find

8

out which those cases are to fulfill the screening

9

obligation, which takes this out of the normal Rule 8

10

So the district court or the Sixth Circuit has

type of case.

11

MR. ANDRE:

Right, I think I understand.

I

12

think it goes back still to the fact that there's not a

13

clear Congressional expression to take these cases out

14

of the Federal Rules.

15

believe is instructive on that point.

16

the Secretary of the Department of Health Education and

17

Welfare had argued that Section 205(g) of the Social

18

Security Act, which used the term "individual," somehow

19

took those, those judicial review procedures, out of the

20

operation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.

21

Court said:

22

such a clear expression.

23

policy to have individual claims be addressed one by

24

one, but you have to find that clear expression in the

25

statute and that clear expression is not here.

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what about 1997(e) and

2

(g), which prohibits, seems to prohibit a case from

3

getting beyond the complaint, not even to the answer

4

unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has a

5

reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits.

6

Doesn't this clearly take this out of the normal

7

pleading procedures?

8
9

MR. ANDRE:

I don't think so, Justice Alito.

We have exhaustively researched that language, the

10

reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits 1997(g),

11

and the only courts that construe that language are

12

courts construing 1997(e) and (g), and they have

13

universally found that that provision simply summarizes

14

the other screening provisions' terms, so, frivolous,

15

malicious, fails to state a claim, or seeks -- from an

16

immune defendant.

17

what else Congress would have had in mind because while

18

it's like the preliminary injunction standard it makes

19

no sense that Congress wanted a prisoner to satisfy a

20

preliminary injunction standard before requiring prison

21

officials to respond.

22

And we can't really think of what,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Would your answer be

23

different if amendment were allowed?

24

problem in substance here, and I don't mean to dismiss

25

your arguments from the rules, but leaving the argument

4

MR. ANDRE:

I think if the circuit were to,

5

Sixth Circuit were to allow amendment it would certainly

6

mitigate the situation.

7

screening provisions can't overrule Federal Rule of

8

Procedure 15 either, but the problem we see with even

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Andre, didn't you

16

have in one of that's cases that the exhaustion was

17

spelled out by the defendant, there was a complaint that

18

alleged exhaustion, generally but not in all detail.

19

Then the answer attached every piece of paper that came

20

up at all three levels of the grievance procedure, and

21

then the plaintiff said oh, that's a good idea, I'm

22

going to copy all those documents and make them my own.

23

And nonetheless, that case was dismissed for failure to

24

allege exhaustion in sufficient detail although the

25

record made it plain that there had been exhaustion.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The rule that you are opposing would operate that way.

2

If you don't allege exhaustion in detail, it doesn't

3

matter that the deficiency has been made up by the

4

answer.

5

these cases?

6

You go out.

Wasn't that the decision in one of

MR. GRANT:

Yes.

That was in Petitioner

7

Jones's case, and that -- Petitioner Jones's case is a

8

great example of how the heightened pleading rule and

9

the no amendment rule work together to result in a

10

prisoner being unable to cure any problem with his or

11

her initial complaint.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You talk about the

13

lack of statutory direction on the first two points but

14

there is a very explicit statute on the third question.

15

It says no action shall be brought until administrative

16

remedies are exhausted.

17

should be allowed to be brought even if there are

18

unexhausted claims in the complaint.

19

MR. ANDRE:

And yet you say the action

Well, I -- we concede that an

MR. ANDRE:

I guess I should be clear at the

13

outset that we are by no means advocating that a

14

prisoner can shoe horn in unexhausted claims with

15

exhausted claims.

16

So the unexhausted claims must go.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well right, but you

17

provide under your approach no incentive for the

18

prisoner to leave those claims out.

19

screening function turns into an editing function.

20

unexhausted ones but allow the exhausted ones to

MR. ANDRE:

Instead what, a
The

Well, it's been our experience

and from reading the case law it appears that prisoners

25

don't intentionally try to shoe horn in unexhausted

Alderson Reporting Company

1

claims with their exhausted claims.

It's typically

2

based on innocent mistake, a simple failure to

3

understand either the particular circuit within which

4

they are housed, a difficulty in understanding that

5

circuit's exhaustion law, difficulty in understanding

6

the prison grievance procedures that they attempted to

7

comply with, and perhaps even being further confused by

8

the fact that prison grievance administrators seem to

9

apply prison grievance regulations, I don't want to say

10

in an ad hoc manner, but inconsistently.

That's why -- that's why it's easier for the judge just

to dismiss it than to go through many, what could be

many pages with a fine-toothed comb trying to figure out

if there is anything here that was exhausted.

And the other

21

incentive is if you adopt your rule, the incentive on

the prisoner is to put in every possible claim, even if

maybe it won't.

Turning to the naming issue if I could,

7

since we haven't addressed that, the Prison Litigation

prisoner must provide in his or her grievance.

It does

10

not require what the Sixth Circuit held here which is

that as a matter of Federal statutory law a prisoner

must have identified every individual who he or she

MR. ANDRE:

No, right.

I think really the

8

question is an X or not X question.

It's does the PLRA

9

as a matter of statutory law required individuals to be

10

named in the underlying grievances, and the PLRA is

11

entirely silent on that question, and this Court's

12

decision in Sims v. Apfel lends further lends further

13

support to the proposition that a Federal court cannot

14

go beyond what the particular administrative agency's

rules require.

but I think the petitioners win under either the

plurality opinion or under Justice O'Connor's

18

concurrence.

19

you that it's simply an X or Y question that down the

20

road perhaps the Court could address the scenario where

21

a prison system amends its rules to require individual

22

defendants to be named and then perhaps a prisoner can't

23

comply with that based on the short previous filing

24

deadlines, and then there is a question of whether the

25

administrative remedies were actually ever available to

I don't want the prisoner to

be allowed to choose to lop off the unexhausted claims,

that is true, or to amend, to delete them, because then

8

there is absolutely no incentive for the prisoner to

things get thrown out more readily.

2

MS. OLIVIERI:

Habeas does deal with a

3

person's liberty whereas the PLRA is simply dealing with

people basically for the most part trying to get some

5

sort of relief, either injunctive or monetary relief,

that does not deal with their basic freedom.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So in that

One reason to

require total exhaustion is because, I would assume the

10

prisoner may get sufficient relief if the claims are

11

exhausted, that he doesn't feel the need to go forward

12

with litigation.

13

exhausted claims are still alive, and how many, when

14

we're talking about unexhausted claims, are those

15

typically claims that are not going to be available or

16

are they claims that may generate relief once there is

17

exhaustion?

18

But I guess that's only true if the

MS. OLIVIERI:

It could be -- I mean, it's

19

obviously both.

I mean, there are claims that are

20

partially exhausted when the inmate files the lawsuit.

21

He may finish exhausting and get the relief that he's

22

looking for without ever pursuing the case in federal

23

court.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And then sometimes it's

25

impossible to complete the exhaustion.
37
Alderson Reporting Company

I assume in some

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases that the time limit for the last appeal will have

2

expired, right?

3

MS. OLIVIERI:

That can also be the case,

4

and under Woodford versus Ngo, now that they have to do

5

proper exhaustion, there will be more of those cases

6

where it probably, there wouldn't be anything left to do

7

after it's dismissed except for the plaintiff to be the

8

one to go through the maybe 20 claimed complaints and

9

call out the claims that are not exhausted, rather than

10

putting that burden on the court, which is contrary to

11

Congress's purpose, to streamline this system.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you about,

13

there's another question you haven't really touched on

14

yet, the requirement that the prisoner name every

15

defendant that he intends to sue in the exhausting, in

16

the internal procedure.

17

just exactly what happens.

18

kind of medical care he thinks he's entitled to, and he

19

only knows it because either the low level person says

20

no, the doctors said you can't have it.

21

proceeding, an informal administrative proceeding, and

22

they deny relief.

23

sue, his lawyer happens to find out the name of the

24

doctor who was involved, and there are several levels of

25

authority making the decision.

I'd just like a little help on
The prisoner doesn't get the

And he brings a

And then later on when he wants to

Does he have to start

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

all over again to name those people, or what does he do?

2

MS. OLIVIERI:

Medical care is -- well, for

3

one thing, prisoners do have counselors, and so if

4

they're not sure who is responsible for something,

5

that's one of the things that they're supposed to do is

6

talk to their counselor to find out.

7

having this problem, I'm not getting surgery, why am I

8

not getting surgery, who do I talk to, who do I complain

9

to.

10

You know, I'm

So that's one way to resolve the problem.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what if he does talk

11

to the prison guard and the guard says I don't know, I

12

don't know who's responsible for that decision, that's

13

in the warden's office,

14

is the prisoner supposed to do?

15

MS. OLIVIERI:

or something like that.

What

If the prisoner makes inquiry

16

and just simply can't find out who it is, then he should

17

state that in his grievance and indicate that somebody

18

in the medical department is denying me the surgery.

19

You know, I talked to Dr.

20

that I get it, somebody is saying no, I haven't been

21

able to find out who that is.

22

grievance process, he will find out who it is, because

23

one of the responses will probably say that.

24
25

So and So, he's recommended

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And likely during the

of his grievances is nobody told me.

One

Is he out of luck

there?

And I think there may well be situations in

2

which prisoners don't have complete access to all the

3

facts that go into a decision denying them medical care,

4

for example, or say a prisoner has a religious problem

5

and can't get the diet he wants, or something like that.

6

But before he can sue, under your view if I understand

7

it, he has to find out so he can name the people in his

8

administrative complaint.

9

MS. OLIVIERI:

He has to make a good faith

10

attempt to find out.

11

says I've asked my counselor, he is not able to provide

12

me with that information, then he will get a response on

13

the grievance.

And if he really, you know, if he

have had a chance to investigate it and determine

whether it has merit or not, why should he have to name

he can sue them when he later finds out who they are?

21

As long as he has made known in the

25

to prevail on the merits.

the Sixth Circuit rules say that the delegation of the

9

names is not required?

10

It doesn't make any difference.

The

As Justice Stevens said,

Do your rules say that if he can't find out

MS. OLIVIERI:

The Sixth Circuit rule

11

basically says name or identify.

12

with respect to Mr. Jones, he didn't name the

13

classification director.

14

anything negative to say about that.

15

talking about the classification director.

16

Mr. Morrison.

Sixth Circuit rule is basically name or identify, so if

you're going to identify -

Why is it that the Sixth

Circuit rule requires the identification, for complete

exhaustion requires the identification to be made at the

22

first stage?

23

MS. OLIVIERI:

The Sixth Circuit rule does

require that.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So to make sure I

Alderson Reporting Company

understand this, in a case, let's say at stage one he

2

names Dr. X.

3

the response perhaps, he learned that not only was Dr. X

4

involved but Dr. Y was involved in that decision.

5

he is denied relief at stage two, he says X and Y, and

6

he identifies X and why all the way through.

7

nothing satisfactory to him, so he goes in to Federal

8

court.

9

they would say you have not completely exhausted because

10

And for whatever reason in the course of

So if

He gets

Is it correct that under the Sixth Circuit rule

at stage one you did not mention Y?

11

MS. OLIVIERI:

Is that correct?

The Sixth Circuit probably

12

would say that that he would be out of luck with respect

13

to Y.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What justification is there

15

for that?

16

administrative process, Y has been identified.

17

prison has taken action on the merits on the assumption

18

that Y is in fact at least an allegedly responsible

19

party.

20

that the exhaustion is incomplete because he didn't

21

mention Y back at stage one?

22

I mean, for two stages through the prison
The

What reason is there in a Federal court to say

MS. OLIVIERI:

The Sixth Circuit adopted

23

that rule probably in a case like the Walton case here,

24

where Mr. Walton had a problem with his slot restriction

25

and said, you know, Deputy Warden Bobo put this
42

That's at step one.

As I understand it, in that case he keeps going

10

after Bobo, period.

11

learned something, he identifies Y.

12

see the justification, what is the justification?

13

And in my case at stage two, having

MS. OLIVIERI:

And I -- so I don't

I think I was probably giving

14

too much explanation, but I think from my understanding

15

of how this should operate, he is all right in that case

16

to sue Mr. Gearin, who actually did put the slot

17

restriction on him, and he had the wrong name at step

18

one.

19

excuse me, at the end of step one.

20

I think he's got a good claim against Mr. Gearin.

21

Sixth Circuit may not think that's true.

22

No problem.

We got the right name at step two or,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And he pursues it?
The

In my case, you said you

23

understood that the Sixth Circuit would say that

24

although he identified X and Y in stage two and at stage

25

three, and there had been merit for adjudication at
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

those stages, understanding who the named respondents

2

were, the Sixth Circuit would nonetheless say you had

3

failed to exhaust because back at stage A you mentioned

4

X but not Y.

5

still your answer, what could the justification for that

6

be?

7

What is the justification, if that is

MS. OLIVIERI:

I don't think the Sixth

8

Circuit had that type of case in front of them when they

9

issued -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that apparently, if I

11

understand your answer, is what the result would be.

And is there -- and I don't want to, you know, make it

13

hard for you.

14

a justification for that result and I certainly can't

15

find one.

Can you think of any?
MS. OLIVIERI:

I'm saying there is none.

I'm saying he's got a good claim against Mr. Gearin.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Even though the Sixth

9

MS. OLIVIERI:

I disagree with the Sixth

10

Circuit on that, but I don't disagree with the Sixth

11

Circuit in that when he actually got to court, he sued

12

four other people who were never mentioned in any

How about Jones, who

telling me, and so he names that person in his

MS. OLIVIERI:

It isn't that if you haven't named him

to name him at the first step.

It says when you file

your grievance, you know, name JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't there an exception

when you couldn't find out?
MS. OLIVIERI:

And if they say they can't

14

find out, and they've made reasonable inquiry, you know,

15

there's somebody at the top of the chain of the medical,

16

that's understandable that they may not know, because

17

they may have never seen Dr. Pramstaller.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did the Sixth

19

Circuit have the current Michigan policy before them

20

when they made their decision?

21

MS. OLIVIERI:

Not on these three cases, no.

22

It was the previous policy which indicated that the

23

inmate had to be as specific, basically be as specific

24

as possible, something along those lines.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I take it from your answer

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to Justice Ginsburg that back in my Dr. X, Dr. Y case,

2

under the new policy if they got to stage 2 and Y was

3

identified, that Michigan would process the complaint?

4
5

MS. OLIVIERI:

We would process the

grievance, absolutely.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MS. OLIVIER:

The grievance.

Yes.

Yes.

Finally, I would

8

ask the Court to keep in mind that the entire purpose of

9

the Prison Litigation Reform Act is to relieve the

10

courts of the burden and the screening process that's

11

set in place by this statute allows the Court many

12

options.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now you say the primary

purpose is to relieve the courts of the burden rather

15

than determine whether there is merits to the

would think that's more important than saving the court

in determining whether the complaints have merit.

5

There must be, you must have some interest

MS. OLIVIERI:

Well, we do have an interest.

6

We respond to every one of those in three steps, and we

7

never end up in litigation for the most part so the

8

grievance process works totally outside of what

9

litigation goes on.

It does resolve complaints.

But

10

the Prison Litigation Reform Act allows the court to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But these rules that are

13

challenged here are primarily to benefit the courts, not

14

the profits-- the process.

15

MS. OLIVIERI:

They are to, to benefit the

16

courts by taking resources that had previously been

17

spent on meritless cases and spending those instead on

18

cases with merit, to efficiently screen these cases so

10

It's certainly our position that the

The

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This seems to me to

2

be a stretch to say that the prison, which has how many

3

prisoners under their jurisdiction, is in a better

4

position to know in individual cases, an individual

5

prisoner, what this prisoner did or didn't do with

6

respect to the grievance process.

7

is in the best position.

8

least what he is going to allege.

9

MR. ANDRE:

Surely the prisoner

He knows what he did or at

He may be able to aver generally

10

but with specificity there are many cases in which he

11

won't be able to.

12

Corrections' policy directive makes clear that it has to

13

maintain these records for future FOIA requests, and in

14

many institutions it has to track them in a computer.

15

And as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, in the Jones case,

16

they were quite able to bring forward the proof of

17

exhaustion that would satisfy, that would have satisfied

18

the court that Jones had exhausted his administrative

19

remedies.

But the Michigan Department of

20

Jones gets, just got thrown out of court,

21

essentially, in a game of "gotcha," because he hadn't

22

attached his complaint in the first instance.

23

most importantly, from a judicial efficiency standpoint,

24

making exhaustion an affirmative defense makes sense.

25

That means that the lawyers in the state attorney's
51
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

general, in the state, in the office of the state's

2

attorneys general, are going to be able to put forward

3

the best arguments as to why a claim is or is not

4

exhausted.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It requires, it requires

6

response in all the cases, and as this subsection G

7

indicates, part of the purpose of the act was to

8

eliminate the necessity of responding to frivolous

9

complaints.

Why -- why, you know, you have to go

10

through the requesting a response from the government,

11

when in fact there is nothing to this complaint because

12

there has never been any exhaustion.

13

MR. ANDRE:

But to go back to Justice

14

Ginsburg's point earlier Congress could have included

15

unexhausted claims among those types of claims that the

16

court could screen out and dismiss or among those claims

17

for which a court could -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a different

19

argument.

But I mean, don't tell me that it isn't more

20

efficient to have the prisoner say at the outset whether

21

it's exhausted or not.

22

MR. ANDRE:

It certainly is.
Or again, it may be more

23

efficient to have them aver generally, but as far as

24

having a prisoner comply with a heightened pleading

25

requirement, we don't think that that makes sense.

MS. OLIVIERI:

They would have to file an

answer and motion to dismiss raising whatever

affirmative defense they want to raise, but at least it

frame this argument as opposed to putting it on, putting

proceedings and if it's informal and accusatorial as

11

opposed to adversarial, then a court cannot impose a

12

requirement beyond that which the agency itself required

13

at the time that the claims were before the agency.

14

Under Justice O'Connor's concurrence, she

15

was concerned about fair notice, and certainly here in

16

these cases petitioners Williams and Walton didn't have

17

fair notice that a year and a half later the State of

18

Michigan, after going through the entire grievance

19

procedure and never relying on their failure to be

20

sufficiently specific, can then come into Federal court

21

and say, aha -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Future prisoners now

23

do have fair notice because the grievance procedure says

24

name the individuals, dates, names, places, names of all

25

those all involved.

MR. ANDRE:

Yes, they would, they would.

2

And again, there would certainly be constraints to too

3

rigid enforcement of that particular provision.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is the no leeway built

into the rule itself, that if you don't know -

6

MR. ANDRE:

I'm sorry.

7

JUSTICE GINSBERG:

I didn't -

Isn't there -- the

8

current rule, isn't there some leeway for cases where

9

the prisoner simply doesn't know the names?

MR. ANDRE:

I'm not aware of any, Justice

Ginsburg.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
