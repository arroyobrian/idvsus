MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

May

it please the Court:

10

The limited monopoly granted by U.S. patent

11

laws protects against the making, using or selling a

12

patented invention within the United States.

13

271(f) also makes it an infringement to make components

14

of a patented invention within the United States and

15

then simply ship them abroad for reassembly.

This is by no means a trumped-up

It's a very serious suit.

The outcome, the

judgment, the amount of damages that must be paid is not

you call the object code appears in the -- in the

method of getting the software into the new computers.

And I thought it was the software which was arguably the

component, not any physical manifestation.

MR. OLSON:

Well, that's why I said AT&T has

taken two positions.

saying that people use the word "software" in two

23

MR. JOSEFFER:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
It might help if I could start by putting

24

this case into its context in both the United States and

25

international patent law.

Section 271(f) is a limited
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

extension of normal territoriality principles that is

2

designed to shore up the prohibition against actually

3

making a patented invention in the United States, but it

4

does not take the further and extraordinary step of

5

applying United States law to the conduct of copying

6

parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is

7

properly the subject of foreign law.

8
9

As a result, in the context of traditional
manufacturing, for example, it has always been

10

understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while

11

companies cannot make parts in the United States for

12

final assembly abroad -- that's too close to making it

13

here -- they may make copies in a foreign country by,

14

for example, sending the design to the foreign country

15

or sending a specific part to the foreign country that

16

can be copied there.

17

That distinction between copying in the

18

United States and copying in the foreign country has two

19

critical dimensions.

20

foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish

21

the rules of competition that will govern companies that

been viewed because of the Federal Circuit's attempt to

13

tie this to software on the grounds that software can

somewhat narrowly viewed as a software case.

16

truth, there's no basis for distinguishing software from

17

anything else, and if the Federal Circuit's decision was

actually taken to its logical conclusion I have no doubt

19

that other nations would be quite concerned, like in -

The software is the

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, but the, the -- but

4

like with anything, you could say a computer is also the

5

component, but it's the actual computer, not you know,

6

any copy of the same computer.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in this case, you're -

8

but Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or

9

the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded

10

instructions are transferred.

11

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. JOSEFFER:

Do you accept that?
The United States view -- I'm

14

not sure exactly how much we disagree on this -- but the

15

United States view is that, for example, a blank disk is

16

not a component of this invention because you don't need

17

a blank disk to practice this invention.

18

actual component is the physical substantiation, the

19

physical copy of the software that's inserted into a

20

computer and if you get a disk -

In other words, the disk

plus the -- plus the coded instructions.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It could be on the hard

MR. JOSEFFER:

And once it's copied on to

the hard drive, then the copy on the hard drive is

5

itself a component.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I take it that we are

7

operating under the assumption that software is

patentable?

9

we?

10
11

We have never held that in this Court, have

MR. JOSEFFER:

No, but as I was saying

before -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what should we do here?

13

Should, if we are writing this, since it's never been

14

held that it's patentable in this Court -

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think if -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

If I were writing

17

something, should I say on the assumption that it's

18

patentable?

19

Since the issue isn't raised?
MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

I think, I think the

20

reason that's not relevant here is that the patented

21

invention in this case is not software.

22

that has software loaded into it.

23

a patented invention do not themselves have to be

Is it a separate section of the hard drive?
MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

Well, you could go later in

22

and delete that software off the hard drive which

23

confirms that the software does have a separate physical

24

existence in there.

25

the component is the, is the physical substantiation of

But the main point is that the -

there are multiple copies of that same component in a

And you could have a situation where

One JUSTICE ALITO:

If these -- if these

computers are built abroad and are sold with Windows

10

installed, the component is the electrons on the hard

11

drive?

12

Is that what, that's your position?
MR. JOSEFFER:

It's the physical embodiment

13

of the software which in some instances is manifested by

14

-- by those electrons.

15

the abstract code in the abstract is the component.

16

reason that can't be is that object code in the abstract

17

is just a series of 1's and 0's.

18

memorize in my head or write down on a piece of paper.

19

But that's not going to combine with other, with other

20

parts to make a patented invention.

And if I could illustrate that with a simple

lock and key example, a key has a series of ridges on it

of ridges on the key.

3

anything; you can always say that any physical product,

4

any physical part, is a physical manifestation of its

5

abstract design.

6

And you can then say that about

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that analogous to the

7

source and the compilation, the source being the design,

8

the compilation being the key?

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

The source code and

10

object code are just different computer languages for

11

expressing the same thing.

12

difference between them.

13

numbers, but they mean the same thing.

14

reason to treat them differently.

15

There is no -- there's no
One is words and one is
There is no

The point is just that if you treat the -

16

either the source code or the object code as the

17

component, that's just the design of the actual physical

18

software that goes into the computer.

19

you'd have a vastly different statute because any

20

physical part has a design, but the whole point of the

21

statute is to prohibit copying of parts in the United

22

States while permitting copying of parts abroad for sale

23

abroad.

24
25

If you did that

But if the design itself was a component
then you could never copy parts abroad when something
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was designed in the United States, because something

2

designed abroad would always infringe because the

3

something designed abroad would itself be the component,

4

and that would be a vastly different statute there's no

5

reason to think Congress intended here, especially

6

because of the extraterritorial consequences.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

when this statute was passed.

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Windows wasn't around

Well, the statute was enacted

10

in 1984 when software was certainly present.

11

to say that Congress was not thinking of software, but

12

that's further caution for not expanding the statute

13

beyond traditional territorial reaches.

14

this Court has cautioned, has said that it should be

15

cautious in applying existing electrical property

16

statutes to new technologies.

17

emphasized in Deepsouth that the caution against

18

extraterritoriality applies in this very context.

19

Congress is writing against the backdrop of normal

20

territorial principles, which are the making, using or

21

selling inventions of foreign countries subject only to

22

foreign law, and against the backdrop of Deepsouth,

23

which has specifically held that Congress has to speak

24

clearly to enact of statute like this.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's fair

Because first,

I thought it was the

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

position of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be

2

brought into an electronic era, and so the -- the

3

Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp

4

deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that

5

notion should apply to an electronic world.

6

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

And the reason that

7

doesn't work in the statutory text and policies is that

8

the component that we are talking about here is the

9

specific part that goes in the machine.

And if -- and

if -- and under the statute you have to let the company

send the design abroad to manufacture it abroad, both to

protect the company's ability to compete abroad and to

protect the foreign government's prerogatives.

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court.

3

There is no question that Microsoft supplies

computer's processor.

which runs to millions of lines of binary digits, will

11

be installed and stored -- those are Microsoft's

12

words -- in foreign computers precisely so that they may

13

practice AT&T's invention.

14

Those facts resolve this case because it is

15

thus entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of

16

the words of the statute to say that Microsoft has

MR. WAXMAN:

That is very different than

this case because what -- first of all, we all agree

12

that software code in and of itself, removed from a

13

physical structure, cannot be patentable and when

14

software -- when some -- when an invention that is

15

practiced with software is patented, at the most what

16

you will see is preferred embodiments of the source code

17

which is language that humans understand and which

18

computers do not.

A lot of work has to be done in items of

JUSTICE BREYER:

But is there any precedent

for that sort of thing?

3

point now, I think, but however you put it, it has to

4

come down to the fact that this very, very complex and

5

detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set

6

of numbers.

7

application does not itself contain that set of numbers,

8

but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate

9

that set of numbers.

10

That is, I understand your

And I can understand how the patent

But I then would be quite frightened of

11

deciding for you and discovering that all over the world

12

there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be

13

thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this

14

one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of

15

information themselves and alone become components.

16

I'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field

17

analogous instance where the transmission of information

18

has itself been viewed as the transmission of a

19

component?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm not aware of any.

So

In the

21

lower courts, Microsoft was arguing that the biotech

22

industry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious

23

differences between what is supplied in terms of object

24

code that instructs a machine and a, you know, a

25

sequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

nucleotides.

But I think we need to be quite precise

2

here.

We are not complaining that the component is an

3

idea.

We're not complaining -- we're not arguing that a

4

component is some form of information.

5

saying here is -- I mean, nobody is paying billions of

13

in a form of patterns of electrical charges.

14

the code then moves back and forth, the instructions

move back and forth from the CPU and RAM, they -

themselves.

It's

6

That's -

MR. WAXMAN:

If I can, I just want to make

sure I answer your question.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it's totally different

8

in that of course it violates the patent in the United

9

States.

The whole question here is whether or not the

10

person has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can

11

do or not do.

12

about is in the future it might be outside your field,

13

it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the

14

transmission purely of information is the transmission

15

of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see

16

in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction

17

and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create

18

other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri

19

dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that

20

detailed information abroad.

22

govern.

23

And the -- the concern that I'm worried

Then suddenly it's our

That's why I asked for precedent.
MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

First of all, this

24

statute does not reach anything that is done overseas.

25

It doesn't reach what the German OEM does.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

It doesn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reach what anybody does overseas.

It -- it makes liable

2

as an infringer somebody who supplies -- who is in the

3

United States who supplies from the United States a

4

component with the intent, with the express intent that

5

that component be combined in a way to create a device

6

that would practice a U.S. patent.

7

-- I firmly am confident that if you look at what's at

8

issue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions

9

about what is or isn't a component.

Now I don't believe

I might think that

10

a design is a component or it isn't a component, but

11

think of these three features:

12

As I said at the beginning, the stipulation

That's what we're talking about here, something that is

copies can be made in lots of different ways.

And in response to Justice -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

His answer to me is that -

15

that -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if

16

it's just information, because it's really a method that

17

switches things at a level of detail that is impossible

information in a patent application, it's transforming
