CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

Eisenstein v. the City of New York.

Mr. Schor.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GIDEON A. SCHOR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. SCHOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For two main reasons, the Second Circuit's

12

judgment should be reversed.

13

Rule 4(a)(1)(B) the government is a party in qui tam

14

actions because it is named, served, and bound and a

15

real party in interest, all without ever intervening or

16

actively participating.

17

First, under Appellate

And second, any participation-based test

18

party status will create a burdensome fact-specific

19

jurisdictional inquiry at the start of every appealed

20

and declined qui tam -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why at the start?

Why

22

isn't the time the end, when we can -- the notice of

23

appeal is to be filed after there is a judgment.

24

isn't the proper time to determine number of days to

25

appeal when the judgment is entered?
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Why

And at that point,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

one can see that the government has done nothing,

2

absolutely nothing in the case.

3

At the inception, I agree with you, we don't

4

know what, if anything, the government is going to do.

5

But by the time judgment is entered, we surely know.

6

MR. SCHOR:

It will be quite difficult and

7

burdensome, even upon entry of judgment, for a relator

8

or a defendant to determine whether the government's

9

participation was sufficiently active to make the

10
11
12
13

government a party for purpose JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we hear the

government did nothing, not one thing.
MR. SCHOR:

Well, under the -- under the

14

active participation test, that may be.

15

question is -- is, will this Court be adopting the

16

active participation test.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the

The test is -- I don't

18

know what you mean by "active participation" as opposed

19

to just plain participation.

20

judgment is entered to determine how much time you have

21

to file your notice of appeal, the question is, has the

22

government done anything?

23

done nothing at all, then you have 30 days.

24
25

MR. SCHOR:

If the rule is at the time

And if the government has

In -- well, to address Your

Honor's first point, the Second Circuit's test was

participation.

2

government is active participation, which narrows -

3

narrows it somewhat.

4

that it's hard to conclude that the government did

5

nothing here.

6

The test proposed by Respondents and the

We point out in our opening brief

It did request to receive orders and -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So that's the question,

7

whether that's enough or whether the government's power

8

to prevent discovery, which it can do, is that alone

9

enough?

10
11
12

MR. SCHOR:

Well, our position is that the

test is the wrong test.

Our position is that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that.

But -

13

but I'm saying there are various steps the

14

governments -- the government can take, and I -- I think

15

you have a point, that even though this case may be an

16

easy one, we're going to have to decide in future cases

17

how much -- how much activity by the government is

18

enough activity to make the government a party.

19

MR. SCHOR:

And I think it will be a very

20

difficult determination for the relator or the defendant

21

for several reasons.

22

expressly declines to limit or define the circumstances

23

constituting active participation.

24

whole series of legal determinations and possibly trips

25

to this Court to determine the content of the standard.

First of all, the government

5

So there will be a

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Secondly, there will be enormously difficult

2

fact-gathering efforts for the -- that the relator and

3

the defendant will have to undergo at the end of a case

4

after judgment has been entered.

5

sheet in a fully litigated qui tam action, declined or

6

not, can be a hundred or 200 pages, and the case will

7

have gone on for 5 or 5 years.

8
9

Sometimes a docket

The standard would require -- the active
participation standard would require the relator or the

10

defendant to comb through the docket sheet to find every

11

instance of government participation to see whether, if

12

the docket sheet will review it, the participation was

13

sufficiently active.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You wouldn't have to

15

-- you wouldn't have to do anything like that at all.

16

He would just file before 30 days just to be on the safe

17

side.

18

analyze this 100-page document to see whether I get an

19

extra 30 days to do something as simple as filing a

20

notice of appeal.

21

It's not like he's going to say, I'm going to

MR. SCHOR:

Respectfully, I think that might

22

read out of the rules the 60-day period.

23

think it's a reflex among trained counsel always to see

24

first, as soon as judgment is entered, how much time do

25

I have to file the notice of appeal.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

But also, I

So the inquiry

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

will have to be undertaken unless the -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and if the

3

inquiry says it's hard to tell, there's a 30-day limit

4

and there's a 60 day limit, I don't know of any

5

responsible counsel who wouldn't file within 30 days.

6

MR. SCHOR:

If that's the position, then

7

that will read out of the rules the 60-day period.

8

rules do contain a 60-day period.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Why would that -

10

why would it -- I mean, it would still apply to the

11

government or any case in which the government is a

12

party, where it's not an issue whether is the government

13

a party or not.

14

MR. SCHOR:

If it becomes too difficult to

15

determine whether the government is a party, then it -

16

then it would be very hard to imagine the relator or the

17

defendant who will feel able to invoke the 60-day

18

provision, and that would effectively make it a dead

19

letter -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, no, no, no, I

21

agree with you that it -- I'm just saying why in a world

22

would the relator want to invoke the 60-day provision if

23

there's at all -- at all a question about whether it's

24

30 days or 60 days?

25

MR. SCHOR:

It's -- it's the case that

6

It's -- it's a function of the

If the rules say there's a 60-day

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any advantage?

7

I mean, a notice of appeal is the easiest document, so

8

it's not a question that there's any labor involved in

9

doing this.

But is there any advantage to filing -- to

10

taking the 60 days instead of the 30 days?

Why would

11

counsel want to take advantage of the extra 30 days?

12

isn't a question of a labor, having to write, like

13

having to write a brief.

14

to taking the additional 30 days?

15

MR. SCHOR:

It

What advantage would there be

If we're talking about relator's

16

counsel, sometimes in a declined qui tam action the

17

relator's counsel may wait to determine, may want to

18

know whether the government will be filing any sort of

19

amicus brief on appeal before determining whether we'll

20

go ahead with the appeal.

21

known as a protective notice of appeal, which isn't -

22

which isn't an optimal procedure -

23

And rather than filing what's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How would the -- how

24

would you know at the time of filing of the notice of

25

appeal whether the government is thereafter going to
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

file an amicus brief?

2

MR. SCHOR:

Relator's counsel is frequently

3

in touch with government counsel.

4

factor in whether relator's counsel will pursue an

5

appeal and spend the money on the appeal is whether they

6

will have support in any respect from the government.

7

So sometimes it is the case that relator's counsel will

8

very much want to know if government -- if the

9

government will be making any sort of supportive filing

And an important

10

on the appeal, and that may take longer to determine

11

than the 30 days.

12

Sometimes it's 60 days.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- yes, but -

13

you don't have to know that before you file the one-page

14

notice of appeal.

15

can get more time, but you don't have to know all of

16

that.

17

the notice of appeal.

I mean, if you need more time, you

It's not going to cost you a lot of money to file

18

MR. SCHOR:

That's -- that's true.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if it turns out the

20

government is not going to come in, you can always

21

dismiss the appeal.

22

MR. SCHOR:

That is true.

I think it's a

23

suboptimal procedure to file something, to file a notice

24

with the court if -- if you're not certain that it's

25

going to be pursuing your appeal.

I think it's better

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to wait and not file until one is certain that one will

2

be pursuing the appeal.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, anyway, a rule's a

4

rule and discussing all of these consequences is beside

5

the point.

6

60 days, right, and you say the government's a party?

If, indeed, the government's a party, it's

7

MR. SCHOR:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Correct.
And is -- is it your

position that the government is a party to this case for

10

all purposes, for all purposes of all the rules, or is

11

it just some of them?

12

MR. SCHOR:

No, we are not arguing that the

13

government is a party only for some purposes and not

14

others.

15

the government is a party for the case.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Our arguments are consistent with the view that

As opposed to the

17

government's view, which does sort of pick and choose

18

between -

19
20

MR. SCHOR:

Correct, and Respondents' as

well.

21

If the Court, however, wants to rule

22

narrowly and just decide the Rule 4(a)(1)(B) issue,

23

whether the government is a party under Rule 4(a)(1)(B),

24

our arguments are certainly consistent with that as

MR. SCHOR:

Well, the rule is that if the

13

government gets 60 days everybody gets 60 days, even

14

private parties like the relator.

15

government's position is that if the rationale for

16

giving 60 days doesn't apply, then everyone else

shouldn't get the benefit of the 60 days, either.

18

believe that's the government's position.

19

But I believe the

I

We would argue that two factors detract from

20

the government's argument in that respect.

2

enters judgment for the defendant, the problem arises if

3

the relator doesn't appeal or doesn't appeal the

12

It's also true sometimes --it's not at all

I don't think there's any reason that
12

days or, if he doesn't like 30 days, you ask for an

5

MR. SCHOR:

It -- it may be, but I believe

that if Rule 4(a)(1)(B) creates a 60-day period, then

7

the litigants have an entitlement to invoke it.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, your argument goes -

is replying to the government the Respondent's argument

10

that there is no sense in giving 60 days to the

11

government, and what you're saying is, yes, sometimes

12

there is.

13

MR. SCHOR:

Correct.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even when the government

15

has not actively participated.

16

you know, you're doing something that has no point.

17

could have a point, to give the government 60 days, even

18

in a case where it has not actively participated.

19

may need that long to consult with other agencies as to

20

whether to accept a defeat in this case or -- or on its

21

own to conduct an appeal if the relator doesn't want to.

MR. SCHOR:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct, and Can the government appeal

MR. SCHOR:

Since the government is bound by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

that right.

3

Act context for that position, but I think it follows

4

from the conclusion, which is undisputed here, that the

5

government is bound by the judgment in a declined qui

6

tam action even where the government doesn't actively -

I'm sure that's one of the

MR. SCHOR:

Yes, I think that's right,

although they can speak for themselves.
Now, the -- it's important also to note that

14

when the government declines to proceed with a qui tam

15

action, it might be declining to conduct the action or

16

take discovery or use its resources, but it's not

seems to indicate that the government is not a party.

MR. SCHOR:

The fact that ordinarily a party

might get served with certain pleadings doesn't mean

The attachment

way towards suggesting that if it doesn't so request,

then it -- it won't, which means that Congress has

6

there are a number of instances where Congress will

10

And -- and

I have cited a number of instances in that

There are a number of

statutory actions, especially where the government is a

14

everyone's a party, the -- the normal party discovery

15

example.

We have cited FOIA and EPA and

But there are many examples where Congress

Well, if it vetoes a settlement -- - that

If it vetoes a

forward because there is no settlement.

can conduct the action under the statute is if it then

But then if the

So you have a case where the government is

10

already a party when it intervenes; and, therefore, even

11

under the government's example the intervention

provision cannot determine party status.

13

I would like to just go back to the

14

definition of -- of "party" that is in our briefing.

15

The -- several provisions of the False Claims Act show

16

that, even without ever intervening or actively

17

participating, the government satisfies the classic

18

elements of party status.

19

because the statute upholds the government's claim and

MR. SCHOR:

I -- I don't think it's accurate

12

to say that the government is an involuntary plaintiff,

13

because Congress has said the United States will be a

14

plaintiff under these circumstances and -- and in that

15

respect Congress has spoken for the United States.

16

It is an oddity of the False Claims Act that

17

the plaintiff is served with the complaint, but that's

18

there on the face of the statute.

20

in interest by operation of law, then it has -- it's

MR. SCHOR:

In -- in our argument it is a

party even though it is not subject to discovery.

are two ways one could characterize the government.

can either say it's not a party for purposes of

discovery; or, as we say, citing authority in our reply,

it is a party, but it is for other statutory reasons not

characteristics, but whether it comes to Rule 4(a) -

it's a bit more -

25

Official - Subject to Final Review

mean, if we assume you're right, then that's construing

some confusion in the rule about who's right, and all

I'm saying is it seems to me that it would be the

of experience under the qui tam action, the United

2

States was named but had absolutely no right to play a

3

role in the litigation.

4

I don't know that we should elevate form

5

over substance here, and I must come back again to what

6

we think is the critical role, which was the intent of

7

Congress in requiring intervention on the part of the

8

United States Government if it decides that it wants to

9

assume the burdens of party status.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there are certain

11

things the government can do, you concede, without

12

intervening?

13

MR. REPHEN:

Yes, there are certain limited

14

roles.

I don't know that that makes them a party for

15

purposes of the Eisenstein case.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the government did

17

decide to take over, the qui tam plaintiff would remain

18

a party -

19

MR. REPHEN:

But the government would have

20

primary responsibility under the statute.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why shouldn't it work

22

the other way?

When the government stays out, it's a

23

party -- when the government isn't conducting the

24

litigation, it's a party just as a qui tam plaintiff

25

would be a party.

MR. REPHEN:

could be status of being a party where there is limited

5

for participation for collateral purposes.

I have a question for you,

I thought you might.
What is the government's

position on that point?
MR. WALL:

I actually wanted to start

22

exactly where you and Justice Ginsburg began because I

23

think we've gotten off a little bit on the wrong track.

24

If this Court wants a bright-line rule, the

25

right rule is intervention.

Now, that would solve 98 or

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

99 percent of qui tam suits under the False Claims Act.

2

The government urged intervention as a prerequisite in

3

Devlin, and this Court disagreed.

4

left open the possibility in its brief that in a very

5

small number of qui tam suits, on the order of 1 percent

6

or less, it might participate, absent intervention, in a

7

way that would justify treatment as a party under

8

Devlin.

9

So the government

But whether or not the Court agrees with us

10

on that -- a question not presented here where the

11

government hasn't participated in any way -- the right

12

rule is intervention, and it's just a question of

13

whether this Court wants to make it cover 98 percent of

14

the suits or 100 percent of the suits.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do you take the position

that without intervention though, nonetheless the

And that's an important point, I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't it need the 60 days

5

to figure out whether it would want to intervene in

6

order to be able to appeal?

7

MR. WALL:

Justice Scalia, I think that

8

would be equally true in a number of contexts -- for

9

instance, class action settlements where the government

10

is entitled to notice, presumably so that it can

11

intervene; government contractor suits.

12

number of Federal cases where the government might find

13

the decision shocking and want to come in, but until it

14

does, it's a non-party.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are any

But they are not statutes

16

which give the government an extended period of time in

17

order to allow the consultation.

18

does that.

19

envision the need for that consultation in the situation

20

where the government has had no participation but comes

21

up with a -- with a decision contrary to what it thinks

22

the good law is, and it has to decide whether it wants

23

to intervene in order to appeal.

24

given 60 days?

25

This is a statute that

And why would they -- why would they not

MR. WALL:

Why shouldn't they be

Well, Justice Scalia, with all

respect, the False Claims Act itself doesn't say

2

anything about intervention.

3

about 60 days.

4

to come in and take over the action and run it and allow

5

the relator to continue as a party.

6

uses the word "intervene" -- because Congress understood

7

that, in its accepted legal meaning, as a process by

8

which a nonparty becomes a party, and the idea was to

9

give the executive branch a choice.

It doesn't say anything

It just says the government has a right

And that's why it

In each qui tam

10

suit, the executive is able to determine whether to

11

assume the greater benefits and burdens of party status.

12

Petitioner is caught in the awkward position

13

of saying that he thinks that the government is a party

14

at the time the case is filed, not then a party for

15

purposes of discovery, but even though it hasn't done

16

anything, it's somehow a party again when the notice of

17

appeal is filed.

18

just where it does not come into the case and doesn't

19

intervene, it's not a party for any of those purposes.

20

And the government's position is that

MR. WALL:

I think there are two distinct

harms, Mr. Chief Justice.

The first is to the

25

government, and the second is to Congress and the system
44
Alderson Reporting Company

it set up in the statute.

2

that, if it can be made a party under FRAP 4, despite

the fact that it has actively attempted to decline party

status, it could also be made a party under the other

5

rule.

6

The harm to the government is

MR. WALL:

any objection in theory to a period of 60 days for only

points, I think.
First, if this Court announces a 30-day
rule, that's clear going forward.

Relators and their

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

counsel will treat declined qui tam suits like civil

2

actions generally to which the United States is a party.

3

Second, if the rules are better read for a

4

30-day period, because the United States was not a

5

party, you're entitled to appeal the judgment, then

6

Petitioner was not entitled to assume that he would get

7

60 days -

JUSTICE ALITO:

What about the relators and

the parties in the four circuits that have adopted the

12

13

They had a court of appeals opinion in

They're just

Well, I think they also were on

14

notice that there's a long-standing circuit split on

15

this question which the court has never answered.

16

the fact that what you're talking about is a ministerial

17

task, filing a one-page notice, there are actually

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Given

I'm sure that the

16

30 days.

17

the -- what is now FRAP 4, drew the exception of 60 days

General to make a decision.

The rule and the

And then the Judicial Conference, in the -- in

about how we do that.

I

And I'm not sure that the

What Congress had in mind when it passed

3

2107 was if the -- if the -- the United States is a

4

potential appellant and requires more time to conduct

5

its internal decisionmaking processes, it gets 60 days.

6

Otherwise, that 30-day baseline governs, and I

7

respectfully disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, that Congress

8

was not concerned about moving appeals forward

9

expeditiously.

It shortened the period from three

10

months to 30 days precisely because of wanting judgments

11

to become final.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it is -- it is a

potential appellant.

concerned about situations in which the government is a

15

potential appellant.

16

these cases until the 30 days have elapsed, at least.

17

It -- it can intervene, and why shouldn't it have the 60

18

days to decide whether to appeal or not?

19

MR. WALL:

I mean if you say Congress is

It is a potential appellant in

I guess -- and I -- the same

20

answer I gave earlier, Justice Scalia:

That's equally

21

true virtually in any Federal case that might affect the

22

United States's interests -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand, but this -

24

this goes to your argument about congressional intent:

25

That they were concerned about preserving to the

government time as a potential appellant to think the

2

matter over.

3

wash.

4

It seems to me that argument is -- is a

MR. WALL:

But I think it goes back to what

5

Justice Ginsburg asked much earlier, which is:

6

time the judgment is entered, who is a party entitled to

7

take the appeal?

8

it's not a potential appellant.

9

Yes.

MR. WALL:

Well, it is -- yes, and it is -

19

it is equally true that it is a potential appellant then

20

in any case that might affect its interests.

21

not commonly consider the United States a party to every

22

class action settlement or in every government

23

contractor suit simply based on the possibility that it

24

may want to intervene.

25

But we do

When it does so very rarely -- we're talking
49
Alderson Reporting Company

about -- I mean that is the exceptionally rare case in

2

the False Claims Act, and the government is saying, we

3

can make that decision within the 30 days because we are

4

not a party to the judgment at the time it's entered.

5

And, again, I think what Petitioner strains to do when

6

he says at page 25 of his reply brief that when you

7

decline as the government, you avoid the burdens of

8

party status.

9

is any different for the burden of appealing an adverse

What Petitioner can't explain is why that

10

judgment and the burdens of discovery.

11

rules speak in terms of party status.

All of those

12

If Petitioner is able to foist on the

13

government a status that it actively attempted to

14

decline, as was its right afforded it by Congress, then

15

it seems to me Petitioner can equally try to foist on

16

the government, though it doesn't here, in future cases

17

party status.

18

by case:

19

each rule of civil and appellate procedure?

20

that approach threatens much more uncertainty than the

approach the government is outlining where intervention

is a simple, workable, administrable test to determine

23

whether the United States is a party to a qui tam suit.
