 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll now hear our 

argument on the second question presented in this case. 
 Mr. HallwardDriemeier. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARDDRIEMEIER 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 2 

8
9
10

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 The Question 2 Petitioners are already 

11

married.  They have established those enduring 

12

relationships, and they have a liberty interest that is 

13

of fundamental importance to these couples and their 

14

children. 

15

 A State should not be allowed to effectively 

16

dissolve that marriage without a sufficiently important 

17

justification to do so. 

18

 These Petitioners have built their lives 

19

around their marriages, including bringing children into 

20

their families, just as oppositesex couples have done. 

21

But the nonrecognition laws undermine the stability of 

22

these families, though the States purport to support 

23

just such stability. 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

I was somewhat surprised by 

the arguments you made in your brief because they are

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

largely a repetition of the arguments that we just heard 

2

with respect to Question 1. 

3

 I thought the point of Question 2 was 

4

whether there would be a  an obligation to recognize a 

5

samesex marriage entered into in another State where 

6

that is lawful even if the State itself, 

7

constitutionally, does not recognize samesex marriage. 

8

I thought that's the question in Question 2.  Is  am I 

9

wrong? 

10

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

It is the question 

11

in Question 2, and this Court's decisions establish that 

12

there is not only a right to be married, but a right to 

13

remain married; that there is a protected liberty 

14

interest in the status of one's marriage once it has 

15

been established under law. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Even  even if that 

17

marriage is  is not lawful under  under the 

18

receiving State's law; right? 

19

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

20

There is definitely 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's right. 

Is that right?  No 

22

matter  I mean, suppose  well, let's say someone 

23

gets married in a  in a country that permits polygamy. 

24

Does a State have to acknowledge that marriage? 

25

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, of course,

Official

6
1

the State could assert justifications for not doing so, 

2

and I think there would be justifications 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MR. HALLWARDDREIMEIER: 

5
6

Okay.  So 
 for not 

recognizing such 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 what would the 

7

justification be?  That it's contrary to the State's 

8

public policy, I assume; right? 

9

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, no, Your 

10

Honor.  I think that the justification would be that the 

11

State doesn't have such an institution.  The  a 

12

polygamous relationship would raise all kinds of 

13

questions that the State's marriage laws don't address. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it would be the same 

15

argument.  We don't have such an institution.  Our 

16

marriage in this State, which we constitutionally can 

17

have because the second question assumes that the first 

18

question comes out the way the United States does not 

19

want it to come out, the State says we only have the 

20

institution of heterosexual marriage.  We don't have the 

21

institution of samesex marriage. 

22

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

No.  The 

23

institution is the institution of marriage, and the 

24

experience of those States 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you're saying that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

but the State doesn't.  The State says the only 

2

institution we have is heterosexual marriage. 

3

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

The  the point 

4

I'm making, Your Honor, I think is demonstrated by what 

5

has happened in those States where, by court order, 

6

States have had to permit samesex couples to marry. 

7

 All that has happened under their laws is 

8

that they have had to remove genderspecific language 

9

and substitute it with genderneutral language. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, could I  could 

11

I  because I don't  if you want to finish answering 

12

Justice Scalia's 

13

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I was going to say 

14

that  that plural relationships raise all manner of 

15

questions that are not addressed by this State's current 

16

marriage laws. 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if it's not a plural 

18

relationship?  What if one State says that individuals 

19

can marry at the age of puberty?  So a 12yearold 

20

female can marry.  Would a State  would another State 

21

be obligated to recognize that marriage? 

22

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I  I think 

23

probably not.  But the State would have, in that 

24

instance, a sufficiently important interest in 

25

protecting the true consent of the married person.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

And  and most States don't recognize minors' ability 

2

to consent, certainly not to something that is as 

3

important as marriage. 

4

 But what we see, in fact, is that, quite in 

5

contrast to the nonrecognition laws at issue here, the 

6

States do recognize the marriages of person who, by age, 

7

would not have been able to marry within their own 

8

States. 

9

 That is the longstanding practice of all of 

10

the States, precisely because of the abomination, as it 

11

was referred to in the old treatises, of the notion that 

12

a  persons could have a different marital state in 

13

some jurisdictions than others. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sir, how about the 

15

consanguinity situation?  Virtually all states would 

16

recognize cousins through marriage getting married, but 

17

there's at least one State that doesn't; right? 

18

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20
21

Well, I 
Are you saying that that 

State is 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I think that 

22

the  that the constitutional test is the one that the 

23

Court set forth in the Zablocki, which is does the State 

24

have a sufficiently important interest not to recognize 

25

it?  And certainly in the case of incest, the State does

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1
2
3
4

have a sufficiently important interest. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

This is not incest. 

They're not biologically tied. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, the States 

5

that I'm aware of that have the rules against cousin 

6

marriage do so under their incest statutes, and they 

7

simply define incest in a broad way that would encompass 

8

cousins to marry. 

9

 At some point, certainly the familial 

10

relationship is too extenuated that I don't think the 

11

State would have a sufficiently important justification. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But Justice Alito's 

13

question points out, the assumption of his hypothetical 

14

is  and  and of the way these cases are presented, 

15

is that the State does have a sufficient interest so 

16

that you need not allow the marriages in those  in 

17

that State. 

18

 So there is a sufficient interest, under our 

19

arguendo assumption here, to  to say that this is not 

20

a fundamental right.  But then suddenly, if you're out 

21

of State it's different.  Why  why should the State 

22

have to yield? 

23

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, at the very 

24

least, you would have to analyze differently the 

25

interest that the State might assert for not allowing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

couples to enter marriage versus the  the interest 

2

that they assert as related to a couple who is already 

3

married. 

4

 For example, Kentucky has asserted that its 

5

interest in only permitting oppositesex couples to 

6

marry is to increase the birthrate.  Well, now apply 

7

that theory to samesex couples who are already married. 

8

They are already married in the States where they were 

9

married.  They are already married in half the States in 

10

the country. 

11

 Kentucky would have the Court believe that 

12

it is a sufficiently important interest to have that 

13

couple disregard their existing marriage vows and 

14

obligations to each other to marry someone else in 

15

Kentucky in order to procreate biologically even though 

16

the couple may already have children together.  That, I 

17

would dare say, is not a rational justification, much 

18

less a sufficiently important one. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I think  I think 

20

what Kentucky is saying is that the longterm effects of 

21

having samesex couples in Kentucky will be, which 

22

you  you didn't agree with, but what  what counsel 

23

for Respondent argued in the prior case, will be a  a 

24

reduction in  in  in heterosexual marriages and a 

25

a reduction in the number of children born to those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1
2

marriages.  I mean, that 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Your Honor, this 

3

Court has rejected that type of speculation as a basis 

4

for drawing these distinctions before as it did in 

5

Loving. 

6

 The State in Loving argued that it was too 

7

soon to know what the effect of interracial marriages 

8

would be and what the stigma would be on their children 

9

if not the biological 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But we will not have 

11

rejected it if we come out the way this question 

12

presented assumes we have come out. 

13

 MR. HALLWARDDREIMEIER: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15
16

Well, the State 

Mainly, saying that it's 

okay for a State not to permit samesex marriage. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

The State asserts 

17

that it has an interest in the  the stability that 

18

marriage provides for children.  That interest does not 

19

justify extinguishing marriages that already exist. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

May we clear this one 

21

thing.  If the Petitioner prevails in the first case, 

22

then the argument is moot; right? 

23

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

24

absolutely right, Your Honor. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's  that's 

So you are supposing a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

situation where the Plaintiffs do not prevail, and so a 

2

State can retain its ban on samesex marriage. 

3

 The question is has  does it have to 

4

recognize marriage from out of State?  Would it make any 

5

difference if the couple came from the State where there 

6

is a ban on samesex marriage, goes to a neighboring 

7

State that allows it, and then comes right back home 

8

again? 

9

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

No, Your Honor.  I 

10

don't think that there would be such a distinction. 

11

And, in fact, none of these four States draws that kind 

12

of line that Your Honor presupposes.  And that's one of 

13

the points that's so important here, is that as the 

14

Court observed with respect to DOMA in Windsor, the 

15

nonrecognition laws here are a stark departure from the 

16

State's traditional practice of recognizing outofstate 

17

marriages even though they could not have been 

18

celebrated within the State.  It's precisely that 

19

circumstance where the laws diverge that the issue 

20

arises. 

21

 And the  the three States that have this 

22

issue, Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky, are, between them, 

23

able to identify only 5 instances in which they did not 

24

recognize a marriage that was valid outside the State, 

25

even though it could not have been celebrated inside.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

And those instances are incest, which we think the State 

2

would have sufficiently important justification not to 

3

recognize, miscegenation laws, not a precedent on which 

4

I think the Court would want to rely in this instance, 

5

or other interests that I think probably would not 

6

survive today, such as the  the rule against allowing 

7

a divorced person to remarry. 

8

 So they're  and  and more importantly, 

9

the most recent of those cases is from 1970.  So the 

10

rule that the States cite about their ability to 

11

disregard, to effectively dissolve marriages that 

12

already exist, around which people have already begun to 

13

build their lives, is less applied than the Federal 

14

government's own authority to define the 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes.  But, again, I 

16

think you're avoiding the presumption on which we're 

17

starting, on the assumption, which is that the State's 

18

policy for same  supporting samesex marriage is 

19

sufficiently strong, that they are  they can, as a 

20

matter of public policy, prohibit that in their own 

21

State.  And yet you're saying it's somehow so much 

22

weaker when you're talking about marriages from other 

23

States. 

24
25

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I  I think there 

are a couple of points that I'd like to make in order to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

distinguish this situation from the  the question in 

2

the first case. 

3

 In the first case, it was very significant 

4

that Respondents' counsel was emphasizing that he 

5

thought it was merely rational basis scrutiny that would 

6

apply.  But that was to the question of whether people 

7

should be allowed to marry in the first instance. 

8
9

 Our Petitioners on Question 2 are already 
married.  We know from Windsor, because the Court held, 

10

that once married, a couple has a constitutionally 

11

protected liberty interest in their marriage. 

12

 We also know from Windsor that where a  a 

13

sovereign disregards that marriage in a way that would 

14

be extraordinary and out of character with tradition, 

15

that that requires, at the very least, careful 

16

consideration.  And that's 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

19
20

It certainly 
 what we have 

here. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It certainly 

21

undermines the State interest that we would, assuming 

22

arguendo, have recognized in the first case, to say that 

23

they must welcome in their borders people who have been 

24

married elsewhere.  It'd simply be a matter of time 

25

until they would, in effect, be recognizing that within

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

the State. 

2

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

4

Well 
Because we live in a 

very mobile society, and people move all the time. 

5

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And  and 
In other words, it 

7

would kind of  it  one State would basically set the 

8

policy for the entire nation. 

9

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, of course, 

10

there would be many fewer such couples raising children 

11

within their borders than heterosexual couples who are 

12

raising children who are not biologically linked to 

13

them. 

14

 I have to say that I think that the 

15

arguments that the State has made are so over and 

16

underinclusive at the same time, that they leave the 

17

the feeling that it can only be pretext.  And we know 

18

that that's true, because the State not only can't draw 

19

the lines that they are purporting to, they don't draw 

20

the lines that they're  would suggest, and they would 

21

never draw the lines that they afford to 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Wait.  I  I've 

23

lost you there.  What  what lines are you talking 

24

about? 

25

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Alderson Reporting Company

A line, for

Official

16
1

example, that limits marriage to those couples who are 

2

able to procreate biologically without any assistance. 

3

The States don't draw those lines.  The States have laws 

4

that treat adoptive relationships with the same legal 

5

effect as biological ones.  They actually have laws that 

6

further support and  and give greater stability

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

The  the  their

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

The  the  I 

17

think it goes from 13 to 18.  And  but  but as I 

18

said before, the tradition of the States  the issue 

19

does not come up that much, but the tradition of the 

20

States is to recognize a marriage that was entered into 

21

by someone of an age that could not have been entered 

22

within the State, because of the nature of the marriage 

23

once it's established, recognizing that the fundamental 

24

nature of that relationship is not one that the State 

25

should put asunder.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I thought you answered 

2

me earlier that a State could refuse to recognize a 

3

marriage in  contracted in another State where the 

4

minimum age was puberty. 

5

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, they  they 

6

could, and I do believe that if, in the individual case, 

7

it was shown that it was because of lack of consent, 

8

the  the State could decide not to recognize the 

9

marriage.  But with respect to the categorical nature 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It would have to be 

11

shown, I think, the presumption would be in such a 

12

State that someone age 13 can't consent. 

13

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

The age 13, I think 

14

probably you're right, but if it is a matter of 15 

15

instead of 16, that the courts probably would recognize 

16

it, especially if, in reliance on their marriage, the 

17

the couple had already conceived of a child, it would do 

18

no one any good to destroy that marriage and the stable 

19

environment that it might provide for the children, just 

20

as it does no one any good  it certainly doesn't 

21

advance the interests of the children of oppositesex 

22

couples to destroy the marriages that provide stability 

23

to the children of samesex couples who are already 

24

married under the laws of other States. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Alderson Reporting Company

I think your  your

Official

20
1

argument is pretty much the exact opposite of the 

2

argument of the Petitioners in the prior case.  The 

3

argument that was presented against them is, you can't 

4

do this, we've never done this before, recognized 

5

samesex marriage. 

6

 And now you're saying, well, they can't not 

7

recognize samesex marriages because they've never not 

8

recognized marriages before that were lawfully performed 

9

in other States. 

10

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12

one or the other if you win. 

13

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, what 
You've got to decide 

No, I don't think 

14

so at  at all, Your Honor.  And  and I think that 

15

what's  what's essential and common between us is that 

16

we recognize that the marriage that our Petitioners have 

17

entered into is a marriage.  It is that same 

18

institution, that same most important relationship of 

19

one's life that this Court has held out as 

20

fundamental 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And maybe 
 in other cases. 
 I'm just 

24

repeating myself, but we only get to the second question 

25

if you've lost on that point already, if we've said

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

States do not have to recognize samesex marriage as a 

2

marriage. 

3

 So assuming you've lost on that, I don't see 

4

how your argument gets  you can't say that they are 

5

not treating the marriage as a marriage when they don't 

6

have to do that in the first place. 

7

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, I  I think 

8

that that actually highlights one of the problems of 

9

trying to decide the  the two cases differently, 

10

because, of course, deciding against Petitioners on 

11

Question 1, even if the Court decides in favor of 

12

Petitioners on Question 2, would forever relegate those 

13

marriages to second class status and would raise all 

14

kinds of questions whether those marriages could be 

15

subjected to laws that are not quite so favorable as 

16

opposite 

17

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You're rearguing Question 1 

now?  Is that  is that what you're doing? 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

No.  No.  I'm 

suggesting, though 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I thought you were. 
 that even a win 

23

on Question 2 does not fully validate our Petitioners' 

24

marriages, but certainly we think that the State cannot 

25

disregard them  cannot effectively dissolve existing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

marriages without a sufficiently important reason for 

2

doing so. 

3

 This Court recognized in the Lawrence case 

4

that marriage, procreation, family relationships, 

5

child rearing are fundamental aspects of autonomy that 

6

samesex couples can enter into, can choose for purposes 

7

of autonomy to the same extent as oppositesex couples, 

8

especially when those couples have done so, have 

9

established a marriage, have brought children into 

10

I'd like to give an example, if I could, because I think 

11

that it sort of brings home what's really happening. 

12

 Matthew Mansell and Johno Espejo married in 

13

California in 2008.  In 2009, they adopted two children. 

14

Now, in reliance on the protection that is afforded by 

15

marriage, Mr. Espejo was willing to give up his job to 

16

become the primary caregiver of their children. 

17

Mr. Mansell is the primary breadwinner.  His job in an 

18

international law firm was transferred from California 

19

to Tennessee, and the cost of that transfer for that job 

20

for them was the destruction of their family 

21

relationships, all that they had relied on in building 

22

their lives together. 

23

 And in support of that, the States offer 

24

exactly nothing.  There is no reason that the State 

25

needs to disregard that marriage.  No reason the State

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

needs to destroy the reliance that Mr. Espejo has had in 

2

giving up his career to look after their children.  They 

3

are doing everything 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It would have been  it 

5

would have been the argument made with respect to the 

6

first question; namely, that the existence of samesex 

7

marriages erodes, erodes the  the feeling of society 

8

regarding heterosexual marriages. 

9

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

As I say  as I 

10

say before, Your Honor, I  I don't think that that 

11

holds up because oppositesex couples who have no 

12

children, who may be beyond childbearing years, when 

13

they move into these States, their marriages are 

14

entitled to respect, and yet they are situated precisely 

15

as our Petitioners are.  Our couples, likewise, have 

16

marriages.  They may not be able to procreate 

17

biologically together, but they are able to procreate 

18

through assisted means, through adoption.  They bring 

19

children into their families just as oppositesex 

20

couples do.  And when, in reliance on their own State 

21

where they live, they move into these States, that 

22

marriage is destroyed. 

23

 This Court relied on Federalism, the 

24

vertical kind, in Windsor to identify something that was 

25

highly unusual.  In this case, it's horizontal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

Federalism, I think, that identifies something that's 

2

highly unusual.  As part of a Federal form of government 

3

in which the States are equal, the States have ceded 

4

some form of their authority.  And one is to  to 

5

recognize that when another State creates an enduring 

6

relationship, encourages people to, in reliance on the 

7

protections the law affords, to establish families, that 

8

it is not that other States are simply free to disregard 

9

that which those States have created. 

10

 In the corporate context, once a corporation 

11

is established under the laws of one State, that 

12

corporation exists in all other States.  Certainly, the 

13

families that our Petitioners have established are 

14

entitled to at least that same respect. 

15

 I think that, Your Honor, it is quite 

16

interesting to note that in the first argument, Michigan 

17

was forced to argue some positions that I think are 

18

quite astonishing, that the State could limit marriage 

19

to couples who are capable of procreation without 

20

assistance or indeed, that it could abolish marriage 

21

altogether. 

22

 It's our clients who take marriage 

23

seriously.  They took vows to each other and bought into 

24

an institution that, indeed, as this Court has said, 

25

predates the Bill of Rights, that is the most important

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

and fundamental in their lives, and the State should 

2

offer something more than mere pretext as ground to 

3

destroy it. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The State's rationale is 

we  we treat outsiders the same way we treat insiders. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, thank you, 

7

Your Honor.  They  they certainly have offered that, 

8

but what the State ignores is that these socalled 

9

outsiders are already married.  The State, it's true, 

10

says, well, we have samesex couples in our State, and 

11

we don't allow them to marry, so we're going to  to 

12

treat you the same way. 

13

 Well, they ignore that our clients have 

14

already formed those relationships, and I think that it 

15

would be, in terms of the interests that distinguish 

16

between the two questions, it's  it's helpful to think 

17

again, perhaps, about heterosexual couples.  We don't 

18

think that a State could limit marriage to only those 

19

couples who are capable of procreation.  We don't think 

20

it could preclude marriage by women who are 55, but it 

21

would be quite a different and distinct constitutional 

22

violation for the State to dissolve the marriages of 

23

oppositesex couples when the woman reaches 55. 

24

 I don't think that that's constitutionally 

25

permissible.  The States don't do that and, of course,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

they never would do that, because the essential 

2

protection against arbitrary laws is that the majority 

3

has to live under the same laws that they would subject 

4

the minority to.  And there is no chance that the 

5

majority would subject themselves to such a law as that.

7

 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my 
time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH F. WHALEN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS ON QUESTION 2 

12

 MR. WHALEN: 

13

please the Court: 

14

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The Fourteenth Amendment does not require 

15

States with traditional marriage laws to recognize 

16

marriages from other States between two persons of the 

17

same sex. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about Article IV?  I'm 

19

so glad to be able to quote a portion of the 

20

Constitution that actually seems to be relevant.  "Full 

21

faith and credit shall be given in each State to the 

22

public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every 

23

other State."  Now, why doesn't that apply? 

24
25

 MR. WHALEN: 

Your Honor, this Court's cases 

have made clear that the Court draws a distinction

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

between judgments between States and the laws of each 

2

State.  And the reason in part that the Court's 

3

decisions have said that is that otherwise, each State 

4

would be able to essentially legislate for every other 

5

State. 

6
7
8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Public acts?  It would 

include the act of marrying people, I assume. 
 MR. WHALEN: 

My understanding of this 

Court's decisions as the reference in the Constitution 
to public acts is that each State's laws. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So there  there's nothing 

12

in the Constitution that requires a State to acknowledge 

13

even those marriages in other States that  that are 

14

the same. 

15
16

 MR. WHALEN: 

That's essentially correct, 

Your Honor. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

 MR. WHALEN: 

Really? 
Under this Court's decisions, 

19

that's  that's essentially right.  There has been 

20

under the jurisprudence with regard to Allstate 

21

Insurance and Alaska Packers and so forth that 

22

there's  there's a minimal due process requirement to 

23

decline to apply another State's substantive law. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

We  we can say the only 

marriages we acknowledge in  in New York are marriages

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

concluded in New York; is that possible? 

2

 MR. WHALEN: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm sorry?  I don't 
New York can say the only 

4

marriages we acknowledge in New York are those marriages 

5

that have been made under the laws of New York. 

6

 MR. WHALEN: 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 MR. WHALEN: 

9
10
11
12
13
14

Yes, Your Honor. 
Really? 
If I'm understanding your  if 

I'm understanding your question correctly. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What case is that? 

What case would you cite to support that proposition? 
 MR. WHALEN: 

I'm not sure if I understood 

the question correctly, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

He said  I mean, I 

15

already have several cases to read.  I might as well get 

16

another one. 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What  what is the case 

19

that holds that the State of New York has the right to 

20

recognize only marriages made in New York?  And when 

21

if you're married in Virginia, New York has the 

22

constitutional right to say, we treat you as if you 

23

weren't married, whoever you are. 

24
25

 MR. WHALEN: 

I didn't  I did misunderstand 

the question.  My understanding of the question was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

whether New York could decline to recognize an 

2

outofstate marriage that did not comport with New 

3

York's law. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's not what I said. 
Because it is clear that 

6

if the law of the two States is the same, that was used 

7

against Fedder, that the State cannot say we won't apply 

8

the other State's law, even though it's the same as our 

9

own. 

10
11

 MR. WHALEN: 

Even though it's the same as 

ours? 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
Like New York.  For 

14

example, I happen to know has a law that a Federal judge 

15

from Washington couldn't marry someone.  I mean, you can 

16

get married to your own wife, et cetera, but you can't 

17

marry two other people, but the District of Columbia has 

18

the opposite law.  So if I marry two people in 

19

Washington D.C. and they happen to move to New York, you 

20

are saying that New York doesn't have to recognize that 

21

marriage because it doesn't comport with the marriage of 

22

New York; is that your point? 

23
24
25

 MR. WHALEN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  I think 

that's 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And then what case says 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

that?  I think there are a few people going to get

2

nervous about this. 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 MR. WHALEN: 

My  my answer is based on 

5

essentially this Court's decision in Nevada v. Hall, 

6

because the State's own law sets its own policy and the 

7

other State's law would be in conflict with that State's 

8

policy. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But here the policy would 

10

be we distrust Federal judges from outside the State. 

11

And even that, they would get away with, in your view, 

12

because I'm next going to ask, and what is the 

13

difference between that kind of policy and the policy 

14

that says, well, we don't recognize the gay couple's 

15

marriage for the reason that we fear that if gay couples 

16

get married, even if they have children and adopt them, 

17

and even if we allow people who are not gay to get 

18

married and they don't have children, despite all that, 

19

this policy, which I've had a little trouble 

20

understanding, warrants not recognizing it?  Did you 

21

follow that question?  It was a little complicated. 

22

 MR. WHALEN: 

I  I probably did not, but 

23

I'm going to try to answer.  I  I think the underlying 

24

focus is not just that there's a policy, but that 

25

there's a legitimate policy.  And as this Court's 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

questions earlier indicated, I proceed now on the

2

assumption that the Court has decided the first question 

3

in the State's favor, and is determined that, indeed, 

4

the State's policy to maintain a traditional manwoman 

5

definition of marriage is, indeed, legitimate, and we 

6

obviously agree that it is, and the Court should so 

7

decide.  So 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you don't see 
But none of this has 

10

anything to do with Article IV, right?  None of this has 

11

anything to do with Article IV?  Full faith and credit, 

12

right? 

13

 MR. WHALEN: 

It  full faith and credit 

14

provides the background for the  for the States to be 

15

able to assert that, indeed, we have the right to 

16

decline to recognize the outofstate marriage based on 

17

the outofstate 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

19

 MR. WHALEN: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You're 
 law 
You're making a 

21

distinction between judgments  full faith and credit 

22

applies to judgments.  You can't reject a judgment from 

23

a sister State because you find it offensive to your 

24

policy, but 

25

 MR. WHALEN: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1
2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

has never been interpreted to apply to choice of law. 

3

 MR. WHALEN: 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

5
6

 full faith and credit

Yes, Your Honor. 
That  that's the 

distinction. 
 MR. WHALEN: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And  and 

7

so, in  in essence, by deciding whether or not to 

8

recognize another State's marriage, the  the State is 

9

deciding whether or not to recognize the other State's 

10
11

law under which that marriage was performed. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  You don't 

12

see a fundamental difference between creating a marriage 

13

and recognizing a marriage?  You don't think there's any 

14

difference in terms of the rights of people?  If States 

15

regularly don't say that the prerequisites to marriage 

16

in our State are not necessarily against public 

17

policy  and they have said it for age differences, 

18

they have said it for a lot of things, why  why would 

19

the gay marriage issue be so fundamental that that can 

20

lead them to exclude a whole category of people from 

21

recognition? 

22

 MR. WHALEN: 

It goes, Your Honor, to the 

23

essence of what I think, in fact, both  both questions 

24

before the Court today get at.  And that is that  the 

25

fundamental notion of what marriage is.  And  and let 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

me answer the question, if I could, in this way.  The 

2

the comparison between how States have operated with 

3

regard to recognizing or not recognizing marriages 

4

before, in other words, before there was any idea of 

5

samesex marriage, can't be compared at all to how 

6

States are responding across the board with regard to 

7

the phenomenon of samesex marriage. 

8
9

 And here's the reason: 

commentators have 

observed that when all States are on the same page about 

10

what marriage is, that's where the place of celebration 

11

rule evolved from, that every State had the same 

12

definition.  Every State shared the same interest, and 

13

so there was a liberal policy of recognizing marriages 

14

from one State to the other because 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

That's just not 
 decrees are closer to 

laws? 

19

 MR. WHALEN: 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

21

You think marriage 

I'm sorry? 
You think marriage 

decrees are closer to laws than they are to judgments? 

22

 MR. WHALEN: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I do 
I mean, you need to get 

24

a judgment to divorce.  And I think that, in my mind, 

25

that makes the decree much closer to a judgment than it 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1
2

does to a law.
 MR. WHALEN: 

I  I think that the  the 

3

performing of a marriage is closer to law is because, in 

4

essence, when the marriage is performed, all the rights 

5

that flow from that State's laws evolve to that couple. 

6

And it's different than judgments and so does not 

7

deserve the same kind of treatment that judgments would, 

8

under the full faith and credit jurisprudence, because 

9

of the reason that this Court has drawn that distinction.

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11

under the Constitution, or 

12

 MR. WHALEN: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14
15

So what is an order 

I 


act under the 

Constitution that's not a judgment? 
 MR. WHALEN: 

I didn't catch the first part 

16

of your question, Your Honor. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do you separate out 

18

the terms that Justice Scalia gave you?  They're not all 

19

judgments. 

20

 MR. WHALEN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22
23
24
25

No.  I  I 
Three different terms 

were used, or four different terms were used.

 what I recall and that

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 MR. WHALEN: 

 records

 Court's jurisprudence has been that that refers to laws 

5

 and records and judgments of another State.  And 

6

 marriages have always been treated as a conflict of law

 matter throughout all the years  in fact, it  it

 gives rise to the entire conflict of law doctrine on

 on which Petitioners rely here, which is Joseph Story's

 stepdaughter. 

20

 I would  I would hasten to add, though, 

21

 because of where  what I was starting to describe with 

22

 regard to how we got to this point, while  while 

23

 States were all playing along under the same definition 

24

 of marriage, what they confronted in an unprecedented 

25

 fashion was some States changing the rules of the game, 

Alderson Reporting Company

2

 if I can extend the metaphor, and so 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but they 

3

 weren't playing along with the same definition.  There 

4

 have always been distinctions based on age and family 

5

 relationship.  So they weren't playing along under the 

6

 same definition.  And still, despite that, it apparently 

7

 is quite rare for a State not to recognize an 

8

 outofstate marriage. 

9

 MR. WHALEN: 

It  it was and is quite rare, 

10

 so long as we're talking about what marriage is, so long 

11

 as we're talking about the fundamental man and woman 

12

 marriage.  And that  and that's my point, is that as 

13

 soon as States were confronted with the reality that 

14

 some States were going to redefine marriage or expand 

15

 the definition of marriage to include samesex couples 

16

 for the first time, then it's unsurprising that they 

17

 would determine, in keeping with their own laws, that 

18

 they would not recognize those other States' marriages 

19

 in  in Tennessee. 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This second question puts 

21

 both you and Mr. HallwardDriemeier in a very unusual 

22

 situation, because, first of all, we have to assume that 

23

 this first question has been decided against the 

24

 Petitioner, or we wouldn't get to the second question. 

25

 So we have to assume that we would hold that 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

 a State has a sufficient reason for limiting marriage to

2

 oppositesex couples.  And Mr. HallwardDriemeier 

3

 acknowledged that a State could refuse to recognize an 

4

 outofstate marriage if it has a very strong public 

5

 policy against that marriage, if it's a polygamous 

6

 marriage, if it's a  a marriage of very young 

7

 individuals. 

8
9

 So the question is whether there could be 
 something in between.  So there  there's a  a 

10

 sufficient reason to  for the State to say, we're not 

11

 going to grant these licenses ourselves, but not a 

12

 strong enough reason for us not to recognize a marriage 

13

 performed out of state.  I suppose that's possible, 

14

 isn't it? 

15

 MR. WHALEN: 

Well, let me answer it this 

16

 way, and hopefully I'll  I'm answering your question 

17

 in doing so.  Let me be clear.  The  the 

18

 justifications that have grown over time and the 

19

 requirement for a strong public policy reason to decline 

20

 to recognize a marriage have grown up around the 

21

 manwoman definition. 

22

 Our position is that so long as we're 

23

 talking about a marriage from another State that is not 

24

 the manwoman definition, that it is simply the State's 

25

 interest in maintaining a cohesive and a coherent 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 internal State policy with regard to marriage that

2

 justifies not recognizing those marriages. 

3

 Otherwise, as  as the question that was 

4

 put earlier indicated, any resident of the State could 

5

 go to another State, get married, come back and demand 

6

 to have their  their marriage recognized. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That happens already. 

8

 People who are not permitted to be married in a lot of 

9

 States go and do that, and they come back to their home 

10

 States, and the home States follow the rule of marriage 

11

 celebration. 

12

 MR. WHALEN: 

And  and, again, we're 

13

 talking about the fundamental distinction between 

14

 marriage as the States see it, the traditional 

15

 definition, and the samesex marriages that other 

16

 States have 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. WHALEN: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, they have 
 have adopted. 
The prerequisites are 

20

 always a State's judgment about marriage, about what 

21

 should be a recognized marriage. 

22

 MR. WHALEN: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24

 MR. WHALEN: 

25

But, Your Honor, the  the 
They make exceptions. 
 the difference here, I 

 think, is  is the  the landscape that we find 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

 ourselves in.  Tennessee, Ohio, Kentucky, and other

2

 States with a traditional definition of marriage have 

3

 done nothing here but stand pat.  They have maintained 

4

 the status quo.  And yet other States have made the 

5

 decision, and it certainly is their right and 

6

 prerogative to do so, to expand the definition, to 

7

 redefine the definition, and then to suggest that other 

8

 States that have done nothing but stand pat now must 

9

 recognize those marriages imposes a substantial burden 

10
11

 on the State's ability to selfgovern. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It is  it is odd, isn't 

12

 it, that a divorce does become the decree for the 

13

 nation?  A divorce with proper jurisdiction in one State 

14

 must be recognized by every other State, but not the act 

15

 of marriage. 

16

 MR. WHALEN: 

I  I understand the point, 

17

 Your Honor, and, again, I think it falls within the 

18

 Court's recognition of a distinction between judgments 

19

 and laws.  And here I think we're dealing only with 

20

 laws, and, again, it would allow one State initially 

21

 literally one State, and now, a minority of States to 

22

 legislate fundamental State concern about marriage for 

23

 every other State quite literally.  That's  that's an 

24

 enormous imposition and an intrusion upon the State's 

25

 ability to decide for itself important public policy 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

 questions and to maintain  particularly when you're

2

 talking about recognition.  There  there is an impact 

3

 that occurs when one State is asked to recognize another 

4

 State's samesex marriage because of the fact that its 

5

 entire domestic relations policy has been built around 

6

 the expectation and the presumption that there is a 

7

 manwoman relationship.  That  in Windsor, this Court 

8

 recognized and observed that marriage is the foundation 

9

 of the State's ability to regulate domestic relations. 

10

 And to give you one concrete example that 

11

 is  that it comes up in this case itself.  One of the 

12

 incidents of marriage is the child  the presumption of 

13

 parentage that comes with a marriage.  And for the State 

14

 to be required to recognize another State's marriage 

15

 where there is a child of that marriage in a samesex 

16

 situation would fundamentally alter the State's 

17

 definition of parentage, which I can tell you 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I don't 

19

 understand your argument.  I understand your argument 

20

 that it's a fundamental public policy question about 

21

 whether you're going to recognize samesex marriage or 

22

 not.  But I don't see the difficulty in following the 

23

 consequences of that under domestic relations law as 

24

 treating a couple as married.  And it  and so the 

25

 first question is a big step, but after that, it seems 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 to me that the question of how you apply the domestic

2

 relations law is pretty straightforward. 

3

 MR. WHALEN: 

Well, it  that's part of the 

4

 reason why I wanted to mention this in particular 

5

 because a large part of the Petitioners' focus has been 

6

 on the impact on the children that are involved. 

7

 And  and I think it's important for the Court to 

8

 recognize that in many States  and I can tell you in 

9

 Tennessee that the definition of parent has always been 

10

 biologicallybased.  That marital presumption of 

11

 parentage has its foundation in biology.  It has its 

12

 foundation in the manwoman relationship. 

13

 So when and if a State were required to 

14

 recognize a samesex marriage and so therefore, change 

15

 the pronouns and change the terminology to apply 

16
17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 adoptions.  What's  what's the problem? 

18

 MR. WHALEN: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20
21

Oh, but you do that for 

Because 
This  this is a really 

 big deal? 
 MR. WHALEN: 

It  it is a big deal, Your 

22

 Honor, because you are changing the way the State 

23

 defines a parent.  And in the adoption context, you have 

24

 to understand adoption and the traditional definition 

25

 of  of marriage, they work in tandem.  They work 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 together.  And as Mr. Bursch described, the objective

2

 with regard to marriage is to link children with their 

3

 biological parents.  When that breaks down, then there's 

4

 adoption.  And so yes, there's an effort to 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you think that a 

6

 State can fail to recognize the birth certificate of a 

7

 particular  another State? 

8

 MR. WHALEN: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not 
Just that.  Do you think 

10

 the word "records" in the Constitution includes birth 

11

 certificates? 

12

 MR. WHALEN: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
So California without 

14

 any reason, no suspicion of fraud, no anything, could it 

15

 refuse to recognize another State's birth certificate? 

16
17
18
19
20

 MR. WHALEN: 

I  I have to admit, Your 

 Honor, I  I can't speak to that intelligently. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Records to me has to 

 have a meaning. 
 MR. WHALEN: 

Record has a meaning.  It does, 

21

 Your Honor.  The reason that I'm hesitant is that I know 

22

 that there  there is disagreement in the  in the 

23

 cases about exactly what the impact of that is between 

24

 whether that just means we have to acknowledge the 

25

 existence of the record for the evidentiary purposes, or 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 whether the effect of the record has to be acknowledged.

2

 And as I stand here I can't speak to it. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I recognize that that's 

 an issue. 

5

 MR. WHALEN: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
But if a birth 

7

 certificate were to be a record, don't you think a 

8

 marriage certificate  it's an official act of a State. 

9
10

 MR. WHALEN: 

Well, the  the marriage 

 certificate 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12

 MR. WHALEN: 

As a record. 
 certifies  and I guess it 

13

 goes exactly to the point.  It certifies the fact that 

14

 there was a marriage.  I think that the laws that 

15

 allowed that marriage to occur, when they are different 

16

 fundamentally with the laws of a State like Tennessee, 

17

 preclude the application of that same principle from one 

18

 State to the other. 

19

 With regard to the effect of requiring 

20

 recognition on a State, I think it's important also to 

21

 consider the fact that the Petitioners have complained 

22

 about the impact that it has when they move from one 

23

 State to the next with regard to the rights that they 

24

 enjoyed under the marriage as it was defined in New 

25

 York, for example, or California.

 Federalism accommodates this situation. 

It

2

 is the strength of our Federal structure to accommodate 

3

 the very difference of viewpoint and the very difference 

4

 in approach that this fundamental debate that we're 

5

 having about samesex marriage generates.  And so it 

6

 makes all the sense in the world, with respect to that, 

7

 to allow the Federal structure to do what it was 

8

 designed to do and to accommodate those different points 

9

 of view.  And that is why we asked the Court to 

10

 determine that the Fourteenth Amendment does not come in 

11

 and then disrupt that balance and impose a duty on one 

12

 State to recognize the laws and recognize the marriage 

13

 of a different State because of the intrusion that it 

14

 would have on that State's public policy.

 question.

 also loses on the second question?  It's a fortiori?

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARDDRIEMEIER 

6

9

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS ON QUESTION 2 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Thank you, Your 

 Honor. 
 If I may start with the assertion that 

10

 Tennessee law has always rooted parental relations in 

11

 biology, that is not so.  Tennessee law  and I'm going 

12

 to quote from chapter 361.1.  I mean  sorry.  It's 

13

 68.3.306 referred to on page 15 of our reply.  It 

14

 provides that a child born to a married woman as a 

15

 result of an artificial insemination with consent of the 

16

 married woman's husband, the father is deemed the 

17

 legitimate child of the husband and wife, though the 

18

 husband has no biological relationship with the child. 

19

 Tennessee, in other words, just as it does 

20

 with adoption, reinforces the bonds of parent and child 

21

 irregardless of biology, as long as the  a 

22

 parent  or as long as the couple is of opposite sexes. 

23

 The import of that for real people, like 

24

 Drs. Tanco and Jesty, is that they, who fell in love and 

25

 married while in graduate school in New York, as many 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

 academic couples, were only able to find a position at a

2

 same university in Tennessee.  They moved there, and 

3

 Dr. Tanco has given birth to their daughter in 

4

 Tennessee. 

5

 Now, as a result of the nonrecognition laws, 

6

 when, as occurred last week, their daughter is 

7

 hospitalized, Tennessee would treat Dr. Jesty not as 

8

 mom, but as a legal stranger with no right to visit her 

9

 child, no right to make medical decisions for her. 

10

 These laws have real import for real people. 

11

 And although, I think that counsel was suggesting that 

12

 Federalism and allowing States to make different laws, 

13

 if you choose to get married in your State, just don't 

14

 move to ours.  That's the cost of Federalism. 

15

 Well, Sergeant Dekoe and his husband, 

16

 Mr. Kostura, didn't have a choice.  The United States 

17

 Army moved them to Tennessee, and given the location of 

18

 Army bases in this country, it's almost a certainty that 

19

 anyone serving in the Army for any length of time will 

20

 be stationed at some point in a State that would 

21

 dissolve their marriage as a matter of State law. 

22

 I want to get back, Justice Sotomayor, to 

23

 your comment about categorical and how unprecedented it 

24

 is, because even in the age of antimiscegenation laws, 

25

 the States would give effect, for some purposes,
