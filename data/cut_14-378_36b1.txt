 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear

argument this morning in Case 14378, McFadden v. 

5

United States.

 Mr. Russell.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 

8

11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 The briefing in this Court has narrowed 

12

considerably the disagreement among the parties.  We now 

13

all agree that the Fourth Circuit misconstrued the mens 

14

rea element for a  a criminal offense under the 

15

Controlled Substance Analogue Act, and we further agree 

16

that the jury instructions actually given in this case 

17

were erroneous. 

18

 Instead, we and the government now agree 

19

that to prove an offense, the government must show that 

20

the defendant knowingly distributed an analogue.  And we 

21

further agree that the government may do that by showing 

22

that the defendant knew that the substance in question 

23

had the characteristics that made it an analogue under 

24

the statute. 

25

 Where we may disagree is over the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

government's alternative theory that it can instead show 

2

that the defendant knew that the substance was illegal 

3

or regulated.  If all the government means by that is 

4

illegal or regulated under the statute of conviction, 

5

the Controlled Substances Act itself, we would agree, 

6

but the government would simply lose because, as it's 

7

acknowledged, the evidence in this case tended to show 

8

that my client did not believe that his conduct violated 

9

the CSA itself. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But just to make sure I 

11

understand all that you're agreeing on, you do agree 

12

that if the defendant knew that the substance was 

13

illegal under the Controlled Substances Act or the 

14

Analogue Act, even though the defendant didn't know the 

15

chemical structure or the particular effects  say that 

16

the dealer had handed him a box and said this is our new 

17

analogue which is illegal under this  under the 

18

Analogue Act, you  you agree that that is sufficient 

19

for a conviction. 

20

 MR. RUSSELL: 

We do agree with that.  And I 

21

think that that is simply a special application of the 

22

general rule that the defendant has to know the facts 

23

that make his conduct unlawful because he knows in that 

24

circumstance the only fact he needs to know in order to 

25

know that what he's doing is illegal.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And that  that sounds 

2

sensible to me.  What about the expert testimony from 

3

chemists?  Is that still put on in the trial?  Does the 

4

government still have to show  put on an expert to 

5

say, well, this is chemically modified, but it's 

6

substantially similar and the jury sits there knowing 

7

that it doesn't have to listen to this?  I mean, how 

8

does that work? 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

No.  They do have to show that 

10

because the government still has to prove that it is, in 

11

fact, an analogue.  So they have to both show that the 

12

defendant 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but does a jury have 

to understand the chemical testimony? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

They've  they've got to make 

16

the determination that it is, in fact, chemically 

17

substantially similar.  I acknowledge that that's a lot 

18

to ask of a jury.  It's a lot to ask of a  of a 

19

defendant to understand that. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it is the 

21

government's burden to show both the composition in 

22

relation to the controlled substance, and the  the 

23

effect of the drug.  Those  those the government must 

24

prove.  But what we have out of the way is that the 

25

defendant now doesn't have to know  you agree the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

defendant doesn't have to understand the chemical 

2

structure? 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

He doesn't have to understand 

4

the chemical structure if the government can prove that 

5

the defendant knew that the substance was illegal under 

6

the Controlled Substances Act itself. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, the government 

8

has given up a lot getting to this point and I think 

9

you've just given up a lot. 

10

 I would have thought your  your position 

11

that you have to know that it's regulated under the 

12

chemical substances or Controlled Substances Act, it 

13

seems to me is  is contrary to the proposition that 

14

ignorance of the law is no excuse.  If you didn't 

15

know  I didn't know this was regulated, you would say 

16

he's  he's innocent because he didn't know the law. 

17

 I thought your position was that you do have 

18

to know, as in all the other cases in the mens rea area, 

19

the  the facts that make your conduct illegal.  You 

20

don't have to know that it's illegal. 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That  that is certainly our 

22

principal position.  We are willing to say, however, 

23

that either  whether you consider it a special 

24

exception to that rule or a special application to that 

25

rule, if the government can show that the defendant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

knows that the substance is illegal under the statute of 

2

conviction, that serves the basic purpose of the 

3

knowledge of fact requirement, which is something 

4
5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 
know, he's innocent. 

6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8
9

And if he doesn't 

If he does not 
If he's ignorant of 

that law, he's not guilty. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, he's not guilty unless 

10

the government can show that he knows that the substance 

11

has the characteristics of  of an analogue, in which 

12

case his ignorance of the law is not an excuse. 

13

 So the government has two options: 

It can 

14

prove the facts, the factual knowledge in the way that 

15

this Court described in Staples and has applied in other 

16

cases involving prohibited items.  But we're willing to 

17

acknowledge that if they can, instead of that, show that 

18

he knew that this is illegal under the statute, that's 

19

good enough because 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And  and I take it that's 

21

the same as under the Controlled Substances Act itself; 

22

is that right?  That's the analogy, is that you can 

23

either show the person knew it was heroin or you can 

24

show, well, the person didn't know it was heroin, but 

25

the person did know that it was some drug that was on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

Schedule I of the  of  of  and so a controlled 

2

substance. 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's right.  And where we 

4

disagree with the government is that it construes some 

5

of the lower court cases that say that as saying the 

6

broader thing, which is 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  You keep 

8

saying "knowing that it's illegal under the Act."  He 

9

doesn't have to know the Act.  He just has to know it's 

10

illegal, that some law regulates it; otherwise, he's not 

11

going to know what the number of the law is or the 

12

Controlled Substance Act. 

13
14
15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, let me be clear.  When I 

say 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I mean, criminals don't 

16

care.  They just know that this is  they may think 

17

it's something.  They just know it's a controlled 

18

substance. 

19

 MR. RUSSELL: 

No.  I  I would disagree 

20

with that.  And I think that's the principal 

21

disagreement we have with the government here, is that 

22

it's not enough to show that the defendant thinks that 

23

it's illegal generally or that it's unlawful under an 

24

import statute or State law. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All right.  The  the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

government would say if he's selling it without paying 

2

the sales tax, he knows that that's illegal, that's 

3

enough to convict him under the Controlled Substances 

4

Act. 

5

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Potentially, I  I think 

6

that that may be their argument, you know.  So we give 

7

the example in our brief of somebody who knows he's 

8

selling Cuban cigars in violation of the import ban.  He 

9

knows in that case that it's an illegal or controlled 

10

substance, but that knowledge doesn't equate  you 

11

wouldn't say that somebody in that case knows he's 

12

selling a controlled substance, simply because it turns 

13

out, unbeknownst to him, that the cigars have marijuana 

14

in them. 

15

 That's not the way that you use the English 

16

language.  You wouldn't say that he knowingly sold 

17

marijuana or even that he knowingly controlled a  sold 

18

a controlled substance. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

 Let's take the  a 

20

case involving a drug that isn't an analogue, a drug 

21

that's actually listed.  And let's say that the facts 

22

are these:  The distributor gives it to the person who's 

23

going to make the distribution and says this is an 

24

illegal drug, go distribute it.  And the person then 

25

goes and distributes it and tries to evade law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1
2

enforcement and so forth, is caught. 
 Now, is it  is that sufficient  is that 

3

evidence sufficient to take the case to the jury so the 

4

jury can find  the jury can decide whether there's 

5

circumstantial evidence that the person who distributed 

6

the drugs knew that it was a controlled substance under 

7

Federal law as opposed to one of the few things that is 

8

illegal under State law, but not under Federal law? 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Yes, I think that's sufficient 

10

evidence to go to the jury.  The jury then has to decide 

11

whether to make that inference.  And in a case like this 

12

where the defendant puts on countervailing evidence that 

13

he, in fact, didn't believe it violated Federal law, or 

14

when  or if the defendant is able to explain, yeah, I 

15

thought it was illegal because I thought it was in 

16

violation of an import statute, then it's up to jury to 

17

decide whether to believe that.  But if it does, then it 

18

ought to conclude that mens rea wasn't established 

19

unless the government can show that the defendant knew 

20

the characteristics of the substance that made it an 

21

analogue. 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Suppose the supplier 

23

tells the dealer this substance produces exactly the 

24

same effect as cocaine.  Would that be enough to satisfy 

25

the mens rea requirement?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

 MR. RUSSELL: 

It wouldn't be enough to 

2

satisfy it.  It would may be evidence from which the jury 

3

could draw an inference that the defendant knew that it 

4

was a controlled substance under Federal law.  I don't 

5

think that they  they should.  I think it's  it's 

6

only partial evidence. 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You  you say he has to 

8

know the  the chemical makeup that causes it to be an 

9

analogue.  Right? 

10
11
12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

He either has to know that or 

he has to know that it violates the CSA. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I understand.  Let's assume 

13

that he doesn't know that it violates the law.  He also 

14

doesn't know that it  what the chemical makeup is. 

15

But he knows what it is.  It is MVD3.  That's all he 

16

knows. 

17

 Now, under the Controlled Substances Act, 

18

that would be enough.  He wouldn't have to know the 

19

makeup of it.  He would just have to know it's one of 

20

the named controlled substances.  If indeed MD3 is 

21

is an analogue, why isn't that enough that he just knows 

22

what it was and what it was is an analogue? 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Right.  I think that's 

24

parallel to somebody knowing that he has an AR15 rifle, 

25

which is, in fact, a machine gun.  In Staples, this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

Court said that's not enough.  You need to know the 

2

facts about the gun that make it an analogue, which 

3

isn't its name  or which make it a machine gun, which 

4

isn't its name.  Here it's not the name 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, this isn't a rifle. 

6

This is, in fact, an analogue of a controlled substance. 

7

I mean, it's  it's not a proper comparison. 

8

 MR. RUSSELL: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

With respect 
He knows that it is  he 

10

knows the identity of it.  And  and that chemical 

11

is  has, in fact, the characteristics that make it an 

12

analogue. 

13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

He knows  knowing simply the 

14

name of it doesn't tell you whether it's an analogue or 

15

not.  You don't know that it's an analogue simply 

16

because you know the name.  And the way that you 

17

would 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's true.  And  and 

19

knowing that it's cocaine doesn't prove that you know 

20

it's a controlled substance. 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

It  it does though, because 

22

the only fact that you need to know about cocaine for it 

23

to be a controlled substance is that it is cocaine. 

24

Because that's the fact that makes it illegal.  It's 

25

listed on the Controlled Substance Act and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

controlled substance schedules.  So if it's cocaine, you 

2

know everything you need to know, based on the 

3

presumption that you know the law, to know that what 

4

you're doing is illegal, and that's not true 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Suppose  suppose the 

6

distributor gives it to the person who's going to 

7

distribute it and says, here, distribute this and 

8

there's the actual chemical formula on the container and 

9

it's the chemical formula, excuse me, for PCP, whatever 

10

that is, Csomething Hsomething and  so that's all a 

11

person knows.  He knows exactly what it is, the chemical 

12

formula.  Is that  has he not committed a  a crime 

13

then? 

14
15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Under the ordinary 

Controlled 

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

17

 MR. RUSSELL: 

18

 I don't know. 

Yes. 
 Substances Act? 
I mean, it depends, I think, 

19

on how it's listed in the schedule.  I think the 

20

schedule might, in fact, list the chemical name, but 

21

if 

22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It does list the chemical 

name. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

So then I think you do know 

the fact that that makes the conduct unlawful.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But you don't know  the 

2

person has just arrived, excuse me, from  from Mars 

3

and has no idea what  you know, whether  whether 

4

it's legal or not. 

5

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think the basic assumption 

6

is that people know what the law is.  They know what's 

7

in the  the schedules.  And if you know what's in the 

8

schedule and if you know the fact, that's enough, I 

9

think, to convict. 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What  what do you do 

11

with the actual facts of this case?  That is, the 

12

defendant gave names to what he was peddling.  He called 

13

it speed, NuUp, a replacement for the listed  now 

14

listed MPPD.  He  these were supposed to be bath 

15

salts, but there's no bath salts in the world that cost 

16

what those packets cost. 

17

 So what  what do we make of what he was 

18

advertising this to be, SpeedUp, and selling it at a 

19

price that fits a controlled substance? 

20

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think what it reflects 

21

what a jury certainly could find it to reflect, and I 

22

think what the truth of the matter is, is that it shows 

23

that Petitioner thought he'd found a loophole to the 

24

Federal drug laws; that so long as something was not 

25

on the schedules, even if it had druglike

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

effects, he could sell it and he could sell it at 

2

whatever price the market would bear. 

3

 You know, certainly, the government can 

4

point to that kind of evidence to suggest that he knew 

5

that his conduct violated the Controlled Substances Act. 

6

But here, of course 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I  I thought you said that 

8

that kind of evidence was enough to get you to a jury, 

9

right? 

10

 MR. RUSSELL: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
That the defendant acted 

12

furtively or that he sold these for incredibly inflated 

13

prices, that all of that, it's not  it's not the thing 

14

itself, but it's evidence of the thing that the 

15

government is trying to prove. 

16

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That's right.  And I think it 

17

gets to the jury, but it doesn't prove what the 

18

government has to prove here, which is harmless error 

19

beyond a reasonable doubt. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But then if I can just 

21

understand.  I mean, I think  tell me if I'm wrong 

22

that the only thing that's possibly separating you and 

23

the government  we'll see if it is separating you and 

24

the government  is this question of what happens if 

25

the defendant knew it was illegal under something other

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

than the CSA or the Analogue Act, right?  And that's the 

2

only point of potential difference between you and the 

3

government? 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think that's true with 

5

respect to our legal interpretation.  I will say we also 

6

think that you ought not to reach that because this 

7

entire regulated status theory was raised for the first 

8

time in the government's brief on the merits in this 

9

Court 

10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Wait  wait a minute.  I 

mean, yes, you do differ with the government on that. 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
But  but assuming that 

14

that the government cannot prove any belief in 

15

illegality, the government would not say it therefore 

16

must prove that you knew the chemical composition of 

17

what you were selling.  And you say, you have to know 

18

the chemical composition. 

19

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Right.  I  I think we're all 

20

on the same page.  So just to be clear about our 

21

position, I think that the only disagreement about the 

22

meaning of the law between the government and us now is 

23

this question of whether it's sufficient as a matter of 

24

law for the government to show that the defendant 

25

believed that the substance was unlawful under some law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

other than the CSA.  They think that's sufficient; we 

2

think it's not sufficient. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  So 
Beyond that though 
And this is for 
Assuming it's not 

7

sufficient, what  what else does the government have 

8

to prove?  I think you differ on that. 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't think so.  I think the 

10

government agrees that one way to prove the mens rea in 

11

this case is to show that the defendant knew the 

12

characteristics of the substance that made it an 

13

analogue.  They agree that they can do it that way. 

14
15
16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Which means the chemical 

composition? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Yes.  Yes.  I understand that 

to be 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. RUSSELL: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Okay.  We'll see. 
 their position. 
And who would that reach 

21

other than the  the chemist?  The underground chemist 

22

would be in a position to know that, but an ordinary 

23

person would not. 

24
25

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I  I acknowledge that giving 

the statute what I think is a pretty straightforward

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

and  and traditional reading does have the effect of 

2

making it substantially harder for the government to 

3

prove that mens rea for an ordinary layperson, but 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, my  my under 

5

well, the government will tell you, but my understanding 

6

of the government is it would be enough if the defendant 

7

knew the name  the name of the drug, that it's blue 

8

fly 

9
10
11
12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Now, if 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 or whatever else.  And 

if, indeed, that drug has the chemical composition. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I won't spend the Court's time 

13

looking it up.  I'm pretty confident that's not their 

14

position. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. RUSSELL: 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Okay. 
That they've said the opposite. 
Suppose the court 

18

instructs the jury that it's  it suffices if the 

19

defendant knows that this is an illegal drug because of 

20

its hallucinogenic effect. 

21

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I don't think  it  again, 

22

the critical question is illegal drug.  If it  by that 

23

you mean illegal drug under the CSA. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No.  It's an illegal drug 

because of its hallucinogenic effect.  Maybe that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

19
1

incorrect because it has to be chemically the same, so 

2

that's incomplete.  But it seems to me that should 

3

suffice for mens rea. 

4
5
6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Just to be clear.  I think a 

court 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And, excuse me, and 

7

then  and then it's  it's shown that this is 

8

chemically similar. 

9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Right.  I think the Court 

10

would have to tell the jury that you can take into 

11

account the defendant's knowledge of its hallucinogenic 

12

effect in deciding whether he knew it was illegal under 

13

the Controlled Substances Act itself. 

14

 And so what I'm quibbling with is just the 

15

unadorned word "illegal."  I don't think it would be 

16

sufficient if a jury was convinced that the defendant 

17

thought it's a hallucinogenic effect and it's illegal 

18

under State law.  That's why I was acting furtively. 

19

 I don't think that a jury could, if it 

20

believed that, find the mens rea established unless, of 

21

course, it went under this factual knowledge prong. 

22

That's  that's the ordinary way in which knowledge of 

23

unlawful possession of a prohibited item is proven. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The  the instructions at 

page 14 of your brief  the brief in footnote 9  can

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

you say that by adding just a sentence or two to the 

2

first paragraph? 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

5
6

No.  Because 
Or  or is it beyond hope 

or what? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

No.  I  I think  recall 

7

that this is setting forth the elements.  And so I think 

8

the element is that the defendant has to know that he's 

9

distributing an analogue.  And then there's questions 

10

about ways in which to prove that.  And I think the 

11

jury  the  the court could give an instruction of 

12

the sort that we proposed, which said that the defendant 

13

has to know that  that this is an analogue within the 

14

meaning.  It has the characteristics that make it an 

15

analogue within the meaning of the statute. 

16

 Had the government asked for an instruction, 

17

it could have also given instructions that  or the 

18

government can show that the defendant knew the conduct 

19

was unlawful generally.  And you can make that  or 

20

unlawful under the CSA itself.  And you can reach that 

21

conclusion based on circumstantial evidence, including 

22

evidence concerning the defendant's knowledge about the 

23

drug's effect. 

24

 But there's a world of difference between 

25

saying that this is relevant circumstantial evidence

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

about whether the defendant knew that he was violating 

2

the statute of conviction and what the government's 

3

position is, which is once you prove that the defendant 

4

knows that it's illegal at all, you're done.  And the 

5

jury is compelled to conclude that mens rea is 

6

established.  And I think that that's simply wrong. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry to put you 

8

through this again, but it's important, I think for me 

9

anyway, to get it right.  I understand your  your 

10

understanding that the SG  it's a big difference.  The 

11

SG says you have to know it's illegal under any law. 

12

You say, no, under the CSA. 

13
14
15
16
17

 Now, what was the other way in which you 
disagree with the government? 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I think that's the only way in 

which we disagree about the meaning of the statute. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  But I thought 

18

that you were disagreeing about names and 

19

characteristics. 

20

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I was disagreeing with 

21

Justice Scalia.  I don't think we're actually 

22

disagreeing with the government about that because I 

23

think they have said in their brief under the knowledge 

24

of identity approach, they have to show that the 

25

defendant knows the chemical structure and effects of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

22
1

the analogue because it's not enough to simply know its 

2

name.  And so I don't think that we disagree with each 

3

other on that. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I ask, Mr. Russell, 

5

about your difference as to whether it's under this 

6

statute or under any statute? 

7

 If you look at some of the instructions that 

8

are given just under the CSA, not analogues, that some 

9

of the instructions just say that you need to find that 

10

the defendant knew that he was distributing some kind of 

11

prohibited drug.  And they don't say a drug prohibited 

12

under the CSA.  So if we use that as the analogy here, 

13

that would suggest that  that the  the jury wouldn't 

14

need to find the  the analogue prohibited under the 

15

CSA and the Analogue Act, but just that they knew it was 

16

prohibited by something. 

17

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Right.  I think there is an 

18

ambiguity in those instructions, whether it's referring 

19

to unlawfulness generally, or unlawfulness under the 

20

CSA.  I think courts  what they really mean is under 

21

the CSA.  And in the cases where the defendant has come 

22

forward and said, actually, I thought it was illegal 

23

under some other statute, in Hassan and again in 

24

Hussein, and  and, I believe, the case of Morales. 

25

Three of the seven cases the government cites for this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

proposition, the Court has said, no, that's not good 

2

enough.  And those are  and that makes complete sense. 

3

 Now, it  it could be that in a lot of 

4

cases the government is going to present evidence that 

5

the defendant just thinks it's  it's a controlled 

6

substance generally.  And we agree that a jury can 

7

infer, absent other evidence, that he thought it was 

8

illegal under the CSA itself.  But you have to leave 

9

open the possibility that the jury can, in a case like 

10

this, say, actually, no, he  the evidence doesn't show 

11

that he believed it was lawful  unlawful under the CSA 

12

because he looked at the schedules, and he quite 

13

reasonably believed that if they weren't on the 

14

schedules, they weren't illegal. 

15

 I mean, I will acknowledge, the only reason 

16

that they are illegal if they're not on the schedule is 

17

the existence of the Analogue Act.  And I'll acknowledge 

18

that prior to this case, I didn't know about the 

19

Analogue Act, and I think a lot of people didn't. 

20

 And in the community where  where my 

21

client was selling these things, these things were being 

22

sold openly in delis and gas stations that were being 

23

advertised in local newspapers and magazines.  And 

24

that's, I think, consistent with the  the fact that 

25

lots of people entertain the incorrect notion that if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

something's not on  on the schedules, then it's legal 

2

to sell.  And somebody who is ignorant to that 

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, and you don't defend 

that, right?  I mean, ignorance of the law is no excuse. 

5

 MR. RUSSEL: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's no excuse. 
You would agree that, even 

7

though you're totally ignorant that it's on the Analogue 

8

Act, if you know the chemical composition and it happens 

9

to be on the analogue  covered by the Analogue Act, 

10

they got you; right? 

11

 MR. RUSSELL: 

12

clear my position. 

13

No.  I  let me try to make 

 We agree that if the government can prove 

14

that you had the factual knowledge that the chemical has 

15

the characteristics that make it  it an analogue, 

16

ignorance of the law is no excuse. 

17
18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
Wait. 

19

 MR. RUSSELL: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21

Well, wait.  Wait.  Wait. 

We do not 
What  what does that 

mean? 

22

 MR. RUSSELL: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So 
I know all of the chemical 

24

characteristics.  Okay?  I have to, in addition, know 

25

that those characteristics make it an analogue?

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. RUSSELL:

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3

 MR. RUSSELL: 

4
5
6
7
8
9
10

No. 
Okay. 
So there  there are three 

options. 
 The one is that you proposed, they know the 
name of the  of the substance. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right.  You  you reject 

that. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

We don't think  we don't 

think that's enough. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Right. 
If they know that the  the 

13

substance is chemically substantially similar to a 

14

controlled substance, then they know the fact that makes 

15

its possession unlawful under that realm.  They have to 

16

know, as well, that it's substantially similar and 

17

represented actual fact. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, suppose  I mean, 

19

I'm not a chemist.  I don't know that it's substantially 

20

similar, but I do know what the chemical composition is. 

21

I have to, in addition, know that that chemical 

22

composition is substantially similar? 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

Yes. 
I don't think so.  I think 

if I know the chemical composition and, in fact, that is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

substantially similar 

2

 MR. RUSSELL: 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well. 
 they got you. 
I think  I think we disagree 

5

about that.  But if you take that view, we still win 

6

this case because there's no evidence that Petitioner 

7

knew anything about the chemical structure of  of what 

8

he was selling here. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I assume your argument is 

10

simply that it's a kind of coincidence.  You have to 

11

know that this substance is an analogue, and there are 

12

two ways you could know that.  One way you could know it 

13

is you could know what the chemical composition of this 

14

is and what the chemical composition of, say, cocaine 

15

is.  That would be one way.  Very few people other than 

16

chemists know that. 

17

 Then there is a second way you could know. 

18

The second way you could know is that you know that it 

19

is forbidden by a law which has the title forbidding 

20

analogues.  And if you happen to know that it falls 

21

within that, of course you know it's an analogue because 

22

you know it falls within it.  And those are the two 

23

ways. 

24

 MR. RUSSELL: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
And no one's been able to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1
2

think of a third. 
 And ignorance of the law is no excuse has 

3

nothing to do with this case.  This is just a 

4

coincidence that those are the two ways you could know 

5

it was an analogue. 

6

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, I certainly agree that 

7

those are the two ways that you can know that it is an 

8

analogue.  And I don't think that  that the government 

9

can even argue that it satisfied that burden in this 

10

case, much less that the jury would have been compelled 

11

to find that harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but you say that the 

13

government has to prove knowledge of two chemical 

14

compositions:  The chemical composition of what is being 

15

sold, but also, the chemical composition of one of the 

16

items on the  on the list of controlled substances. 

17

 MR. RUSSELL: 

18

our position.  And that 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.  Yes.  That is  that is 

But only if that's the 

20

government's theory.  Only if the government goes that 

21

route rather than the route of just saying you knew it 

22

was an analogue. 

23

 MR. RUSSELL: 

That is correct.  And, you 

24

know, I will acknowledge that going the knowledge of 

25

identity route in an analogue case is going to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

different  difficult for nonchemists. 

2

 But I think it's difficult for reasons that 

3

should not give the Court pause, which is simply that 

4

it's difficult for somebody to know, even if they know 

5

what the law is, whether what they're doing is illegal 

6

or not.  And so, you know, our theory has the benefit of 

7

avoiding entirely the vagueness problems that we think 

8

are inherent in this statute. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Was there enough evidence 

10

in this case to go to the jury under the instruction 

11

that you want? 

12
13

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Yes.  I will agree that there 

was. 

14

 And so the only question here is whether 

15

there should be a new trial under which we can have 

16

another discussion with the  with the district court 

17

about what the proper instructions are  I don't think 

18

we will have a lot of disagreement about that  or 

19

whether the court should instead hold that the error is 

20

harmless. 

21

 And it would be exceedingly unfair to do 

22

that in this case on the ground that Petitioner didn't 

23

prevent  present sufficient evidence to rebut a theory 

24

the government wasn't making at trial.  That's why we 

25

have and why we enforce forfeiture rules.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

 And this Court could, I think, quite easily 

2

resolve this case by saying, as Justice Breyer did, here 

3

is the legal rule, here are the two ways in which this 

4

can be proven, but the government in this case, to the 

5

extent it has some special new theory about illegal 

6

under some other law has waived that argument by failing 

7

to preserve it. 

8

 If I could reserve the remainder of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

Thank you, counsel. 

 Ms. Harrington. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 My friend, Mr. Russell, is almost correct 

16

about the extent of the disagreement that's left in this 

17

case.  Our position is not that we can prevail if we can 

18

prove that the defendant believed that his conduct was 

19

illegal under some law other than the CSA or the 

20

Analogue Act.  Our position is that we can prevail if we 

21

can prove that a defendant knowingly distributed a drug 

22

and that he believed that his conduct, that his 

23

distribution of the drug was illegal, generally. 

24

 As Justice Sotomayor has 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My question is  that I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

posed to him is really for you. 

2

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Would you mind repeating 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I'll try. 

5

 Suppose you have to show, and I think you 

3

it? 

6

do, that the defendant did know it is an analogue, say 

7

to cocaine.  There are two ways you could do that.  The 

8

first way is you could show that this defendant, being a 

9

graduate in chemistry, knows what the chemical 

10

composition of cocaine is, knows what the chemical 

11

composition of this other substance is, and knows they 

12

are the same.  You're not going to be able to do that 

13

very often. 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right. 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Another possibility is you 

16

could show that he knows that this particular substance 

17

is banned by a law that is called the  the Analogue 

18

Act, because obviously if he knows that it is banned by 

19

the Act that bans analogues, it must be an analogue. 

20

Those are two ways you could prove knowledge. 

21

 To prove that it is banned by the 

22

AntiTurkey Shoot Act proves nothing about his knowledge 

23

that this is an analogue.  And, therefore, once you say, 

24

as you are trying to say, I think, that some other 

25

illegality is enough to convict, I no longer understand

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1
2

the argument. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, the argument, as 

3

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, in the real world, 

4

defendants don't tend to know specific provisions of 

5

Federal law or State law, but they do tend to know 

6

whether what they're doing is illegal or not.  And so 

7

our view is that the knowing or intentional standard in 

8

Section 841(a) describes a culpable state of mind.  And 

9

one way to prove that culpable state of mind is to prove 

10

that the defendant knowingly or intentionally engaged in 

11

the act 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, but then you're not 

13

then you are saying the defendant does not have to know 

14

it is an analogue, and that, I think, you don't want to 

15

say. 

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, what we're saying 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Because you could think it 

18

was banned by some other act, and that would make you 

19

know that it is that thing that the other act bans.  It 

20

doesn't tend to show it's an analogue. 

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.  Well, what I'm 

22

saying is defendants tend to believe that what they're 

23

doing is illegal, not under any particular provision, 

24

but just generally they believe it's illegal.  And we 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's not what the statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

says.  The statute doesn't say knowingly be a bad guy. 

2

It says knowingly manufacture, distribute, or dispense a 

3

controlled substance. 

4

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes, and it 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's what the knowingly 

6

applies to.  So you have to know that it violates that 

7

law, not just know that you're  you're a bad guy. 

8

That doesn't  that's not what it says. 

9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, in almost every 

10

context, the easiest way to prove knowledge of  of 

11

this kind of statute is to prove that the defendant knew 

12

the facts that made his conduct illegal. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right. 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But what the knowing 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Under the statute. 

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But just to prove the 

17

facts.  He doesn't have to have any awareness of the 

18

statute, but if he knows all the facts, which in this 

19

case would include knowledge of the chemical structure 

20

and pharmacological effects, that's usually, in other 

21

contexts, the easiest way to prove knowledge under this 

22

kind of statute. 

23

 In this context, that's not the easiest way, 

24

and we think there is another way.  We think the knowing 

25

or intentional standard describe the culpable mental

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

state, and this Court has said that that's  that to 


2


prove knowledge, you don't always have to prove that the 

3

defendant knew all the  the critical facts. 


4


 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How do you answer the 

5

the Cuban cigar that turns out to be filled with 

6

marijuana? 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, I guess our primary 

8

submission is that it's sufficient if the government 

9

proves that a defendant distributed a drug and that he 

10

believed that doing so was illegal under some drug law; 

11

that he knew it was some kind of illegal drug.  We think 

12

it would be 

13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it has to be under 


some drug law. 

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we think 


16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You didn't say this before, 


17

and I don't think your brief said it.  It has to be 

18

illegal under some other drug law. 

19

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, just  let me just 

20

point out the reason there's maybe not as much 

21

explication in the briefs is because there's a 

22

fundamental disagreement that became clear in the reply 

23

brief that  that we disagree with Petitioner about 

24

what the courts of appeals have done in the CSA context. 

25

And I can get to that in a second.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

 But we think certainly it's sufficient if a 

2

defendant believes that what he's doing is illegal under 

3

a drug law, that he's distributing an illegal drug.  We 

4

think it would be consistent with sort of broader 

5

principles if the Court held more broadly than that, 

6

that he believed that his conduct was illegal generally. 

7

You don't need to go that far in this case.  The breadth 

8

of that hasn't fully been briefed in this case. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the problem  I 

10

mean, that highlights what I think is the practical 

11

difference here.  You've got a defendant who is 

12

obviously  knows something's out there.  He's trying 

13

not to do something, whether it's not to violate the CSA 

14

or whether it's not to violate anything.  And you just 

15

want to be able to show to the jury, look, something is 

16

bothering him.  He knows that something's afoot, and 

17

and that's all you want to be  have to prove, as 

18

opposed to he knows he's violating either the CSA or a 

19

drug law. 

20

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, we 
And I just don't 

22

know how that works.  I understand how that works in 

23

this case, because you just say to the jury, look, 

24

he's  he's checking the schedule every day, he's doing 

25

this, he's doing that.  But I'm a little concerned about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

extending that as a general matter, where it doesn't 

2

have to be the law in  one, because I think usually 

3

it's not a question whether you know anything about the 

4

law at all, it's simply whether you know a question 

5

about the facts, and whether that happens to bring it 

6

under the law. 

7

 But then I don't know how broad the 

8

principle is that you just have to know what you're 

9

doing is  would raise a doubt in the jury's mind about 

10
11

whether you knew it was legal or not. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, so I  I have two 

12

types of responses, which I'll just point out so that I 

13

can come back to them in case I don't get through them 

14

all.  The first is a doctrinal point.  And second, I can 

15

give you sort of a real world example of how this works 

16

in the CSA context. 

17

 The doctrinal point is that this Court has 

18

held that there are other ways to prove knowledge other 

19

than that a defendant actually knew a critical fact. 

20

For example, the government can prove willful blindness. 

21

And the Court has explained, as recently as the 

22

GlobalTech case, that the reason you allow willful 

23

blindness to substitute for knowledge is not because 

24

being willfully blind to a fact is the same as knowing 

25

the fact.  It's because a person who is willfully blind

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

to a fact has the same culpable state of mind as the 


2


person who knows the fact. 


3


 And so we would submit that a person who 


4


engages in an act intentionally and correctly believes 


5


that doing that is illegal is at least as culpable, if 

6

not more culpable, than the person who knows all the 

7

facts that make his conduct illegal. 

8

 And so the real world 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He thought he was violating 

10

a sales tax law, and you're going to send him up the 

11

river for 15 years. 


12
13
14
15
16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, again, we believe 

that 
JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You think he's just as 

culpable? 
MS. HARRINGTON: 

We don't think the Court 

17

needs to hold that in this case.  We think certainly 

18

it's sufficient if the government can prove that a 

19

defendant knowingly distributed a drug believing it to 

20

be illegal to do so, whether or not he knew what 

21

provision of law 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's illegal because, in 

23

fact, it's bad for animals, and the law involved 

24

prevents veterinarians from using this kind of drug for 

25

animal treatment.  That's all he knows.  That's all he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1
2

thinks. 
 Now, he's guilty of this statute? 

That 

3

doesn't tend to show at all that knowledge that he knows 

4

it's an analogue.  But in your view, because he feels 

5

guilty, as perhaps he should, he's guilty of violating 

6

this law. 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we do believe that 

8

that would establish the necessary culpable state of 

9

mind.  But again, the Court doesn't really need 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, why?  Can you give me 

11

any authority for that?  I mean, your example of willful 

12

blindness is an example of where, in fact, in respect to 

13

this law, he knows there is a risk he is violating doing 

14

the conduct that it  that it permits, he knows there 

15

is a serious risk, and he pays no attention to that at 

16

all. 

17
18
19
20
21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we do think it's 

fine 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's not a very strong 

analogy, I don't think. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, but I think what it 

22

shows is that you don't have to prove actual knowledge 

23

of a fact to satisfy a knowledge standard in a statute. 

24

And again, we think it would be perfectly sufficient for 

25

the Court to hold in this case that when the government

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

proved the defendant is distributing an illicit drug for 

2

human consumption and he believes that what he's doing 

3

is illegal, and he is correct about that, then that is 

4

enough to  to satisfy the CSA or the Analogue Act. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, it might be except 

6

that there is some evidence in this case different than 

7

what you're saying.  He checked, according to his 

8

brother, the Controlled Substance Act; didn't see this 

9

listed.  And also when he was told something was 

10
11

illegal, he flushed it down the toilet. 
 So why isn't  why don't we leave this to 

12

the court below to figure out whether the error was 

13

harmless or not, given the evidence in the case? 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I certainly acknowledge 

15

that that is the Court's usual practice, to remand for 

16

application of a harmless error standard, and we 

17

wouldn't have any problem with the Court doing that 

18

here. 

19

 We do think the evidence that you point 

20

tends to show that he may not have believed he was 

21

violating the CSA specifically, but he  there is 

22

plenty of evidence to show that he knew and correctly 

23

believed that what he was doing was illegal.  He sold 

24

his products in little baggies and vials 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  He has to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1
2

know that it's a controlled substance? 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

He has to know that it's a 

3

controlled substance analogue.  Where we differ is how 

4

you prove that 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Not even an analogue, 

6

because plenty of people sell things thinking it's maybe 

7

cocaine, but in fact, it's crack, or they sell something 

8

else thinking that it's a different drug, they just know 

9

it's a drug. 

10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

We totally  we are 

11

100 percent on the same page as you.  I think Petitioner 

12

believes 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yeah, but you keep 

14

saying has to know it's an analogue.  I think that's 

15

wrong.  He just has to know it's a controlled substance. 

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.  But I mean  but 

17

by controlled substance, what we don't mean  this is 

18

where we differ with Petitioner  we don't mean that he 

19

has to know that it's illegal under Control Substances 

20

Act.  That's Petitioner's position.  That's not our 

21

position. 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is this a real world 

23

problem?  This sounds to me like the most artificial 

24

distinction that I've heard in a long time.  Is there 

25

does Virginia have an Analogue Act?  This is from

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

Virginia, right? 

2

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
Does have Virginia have an 

4

Analogue Act that's different from the Federal Analogue 

5

Act? 

6
7
8
9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I do not know that  the 

answer to that question.  Let 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Do the States typically have 

Analogue Acts, period, or do they have Analogue Acts 

10

that are different from the State Analogue Acts?  You 

11

know, all of these cases  unless this case involves a 

12

chemist, your proof that a person knew the thing was an 

13

analogue is going to be that this person engaged in all 

14

kinds of furtive conduct to try to hide it from  from 

15

law enforcement. 

16

 And so it's going to be for the  for the 

17

jury to  to determine, based on circumstantial 

18

evidence, whether the person knew that this thing was 

19

illegal under some law.  And if it's not the Federal 

20

Controlled Substances Act, I don't know what act it's 

21

going to be.  The defense is going to be, well, you 

22

know, I knew that it was illegal, but I thought it was 

23

illegal under the State Analogue Act, it wasn't illegal 

24

under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.  Is that 

25

what we're worrying about here?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I think that sort of gets 

2

to the point, I mean, the way you sort of characterize 

3

what might be the right instruction, that you have to 

4

prove that the defendant knew it was  or believed it 

5

was illegal under some drug law, we're fine with that. 

6

I think Petitioner would like the instruction to be that 

7

you have to  the government has to prove that the 

8

defendant knew it was illegal under the Controlled 

9

Substances Act or under the Analogue Act. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yeah, and the question I'm 

11

asking, a practical question is, we've got the Federal 

12

Controlled Substances Act, the Analogue provision.  What 

13

is this other  what is this other body of law that 

14

might come into play here? 

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, I'm not sure there is 

16

one, but I think our point is that the defendant  most 

17

defendants don't  aren't aware of any body of law, 

18

right?  They just know that what they're doing is 

19

illegal, and so we shouldn't have to prove that he had a 

20

specific  a specific statute of conviction in his 

21

mind 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Harrington, I mean, I 

23

take your points that this is going to have a very small 

24

practical effect in terms of what either the prosecutor 

25

or the defense attorney is  is putting on at trial.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

But it actually seems to me to be a real theoretical 

2

difference, which has implications far beyond this case. 

3

 Then what Mr. Russell has suggested is two 

4

ways of showing that a defendant knew a fact.  That the 

5

fact that he was distributing an analogue, and you might 

6

know it because you know the chemical structure and all 

7

its properties, or you might know it because you know 

8

you know, somebody has given you a box and said, this is 

9

an analogue prohibited under the Analogue Act, and so 

10
11

you know that it's an analogue. 
 So those are two ways of knowing a fact. 

12

But you're saying that in addition to knowing a fact, 

13

the mens rea is satisfied if you can just show that the 

14

defendant knew he was acting culpably in violation of 

15

some law.  And that, it seems to me, is a theory that 

16

could be put on to any law.  That in addition to knowing 

17

all the facts that a statute says you have to know, the 

18

government has an alternative way of proving its case, 

19

which is just to say, oh, look at  look, you were 

20

acting culpably.  You knew you were doing something 

21

wrong. 

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes, and again, you know, 

23

we would embrace a narrower articulation in this case of 

24

what your knowledge of illegality has to be.  If you 

25

know you're violating a U.S. drug law or you know you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

are distributing an illegal drug, we think that's 

2

sufficient 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose he thought that 

4

there was a labeling law and he was violating the 

5

labeling law.  He's wrong, there is no labeling law, 

6

but it violates the Analogue Act.  Guilty? 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Under our view, that would 

8

be sufficient.  We don't think the Court needs to reach 

9

that in this case because there's no suggestion that 

10

he  that his belief in illegality was that he was 

11

doing anything other than distributing an illicit drug, 

12

that he was violating some U.S. drug law. 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So you  so you  just 

14

to clarify, you  you are saying it's not just any 

15

illegality, it has to be an  a drug law that's 

16

that's a qualification. 

17
18
19

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

We're saying at least for 

the purposes of this case, that is sufficient. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What do you mean by "for 

20

purposes of this case"?  What is the law generally? 

21

Must it be a drug law or could it be any law? 

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we think it's 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why don't you give it up, 

24

Ms. Harrington?  I mean 

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Let me just try one more

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

time. 

2

 (Laughter.) 

3

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

We think it would be 

4

sufficient  it would be consistent with the way this 

5

Court has treated other mens rea issues such as, you 

6

know, willful standard. 

7
8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We've got the willful.  I 

don't think the problem is with your articulation. 

9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, let me 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think the problem is 

11

we're sitting here thinking of examples like, you know, 

12

there's an antibird hunting statute, and it says you 

13

cannot hunt greeneyed turkey's, you know, and the guy 

14

has never heard of that, and you say, okay, I don't know 

15

if this is a greeneyed turkey, and I don't know if it 

16

violates the greeneyed turkey statute, but maybe it 

17

violates something.  You know, and that sounds like an 

18

odd principle, even if you limit to all laws concerning 

19

birds.  And  do you see the problem? 

20
21
22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I  I understand the 

Court's concern. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And I suddenly worry the 

23

government's going to start  he's skulking around in 

24

the bushes, you see. 

25

 (Laughter.)

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, I think 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We can go on like this, but 

3
4

 I think I better not. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So I think that has not 

5

 turned out to be a real world problem, and I 

6

 certainly understand the Court's concern, and I'm not 

7

 trying to sort of blow it off or avoid answering it.  I 

8

 do think in the willful context, that that has  the 

9

 Court in Bryan said that's sufficient if  if the 

10

 the defendant correctly believes that what he's doing is 

11

 illegal, he doesn't have to have any sense of what law 

12

 he's violating. 

13

 Now, willfulness is generally thought to be 

14

 a much higher mens rea standard than knowing or 

15

 intentional, and although this Court has never addressed 

16

 this precise question, both the model penal code and the 

17

 Brown Commission Report have embraced the idea that when 

18

 you satisfy a higher mens rea standard, you necessarily 

19

 satisfy all the lower ones.  Having said that, I 

20

 understand the Court's concern  I don't mean to 

21

 interrupt you, Mr. Chief Justice  but  and so we are 

22

 embracing a narrower articulation for the purposes of 

23

 this case. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but you say 

 you're embracing the narrower articulation, but it seems

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

 to me that's just a casespecific one, and Justice Alito 

2

 is right, it's hard to see how that would make a 

3

 difference here.  But I think it could make a world of 

4

 difference when you expand that to the other cases 

5

 involving mens rea.  And when you get to that point, it 

6

 is sort of an ignorance of the law question.  I mean, in 

7

 all the cases involving mens rea, we do not ask whether 

8

 you have any idea whether it violates the law or not. 

9
10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, in the 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And  and we 

11

 your position makes it much easier to convict people 

12

 because you don't have to show that they even knew the 

13

 facts that made their conduct illegal.  All you have to 

14

 do is say that  under  illegal under the law that 

15

 they're being charged.  All you have to do is say, they 

16

 did something that makes it look like they knew that 

17

 they did something that makes it look that they were 

18

 suspicious.  And if we can find any law in the 

19

 United States Code that makes what they did illegal, we 

20

 can prosecute them for what we want to prosecute them 

21

 for, even though they didn't know that the facts fell 

22

 under that provision. 

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, you have to prosecute 

24

 them for the  for the  for the actions they actually 

25

 took that broke the law, I mean 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes, and part of 

2

 that prosecution is you must show that they had the 

3

 requisite mens rea. 

4

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
And what you're 

6

 saying is, we can show that simply by showing the jury 

7

 that they were acting suspiciously. 

8
9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I mean, I don't think 

 that's quite correct.  We have to convince the jury that 

10

 the defendant in any case believed that what he was 

11

 doing  that the relevant conduct, which is in this 

12

 case would be distributing the drug, violated the law, 

13

 was illegal.  You have to prove that beyond a reasonable 

14

 doubt.  And so just merely suggesting to the jury that a 

15

 defendant was acting suspiciously, I think is not going 

16

 to get the job done in most cases. 

17

 And I do think in most contexts it is easier 

18

 to prove that a defendant knows the facts that make his 

19

 conduct illegal than it is to prove that he knew what he 

20

 was doing was illegal 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What's the best case you 

22

 can give us to help?  In Morissette, the defendant 

23

 didn't know that the surplus shell casings belonged to 

24

 the government.  And he was exonerated because he had to 

25

 have an intent.  Suppose that he  he didn't know they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

 belonged to the government, but he thought that it was 

2

 an illegal casing because it was dangerous.  And he was 

3

 wrong about that.  But it did wrong  could he be 

4

 prosecuted then? 

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

We think he  we think he 

6

 could be.  I mean, I think all of the cases that  in 

7

 that line, the Morissette, Staples, all of those cases 

8

 involved defendants who claimed that they genuinely 

9

 genuinely believed what they were doing was innocent. 

10

 And so the problem for this Court was to try to figure 

11

 out a way to construe the statute so that it didn't 

12

 sweep in people who really were innocent.  Now, this is 

13

 a case where 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

 case you have for us? 

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

What  what  is there a 

So  so  the easier 

17

 cases where the defendant really truly believes that 

18

 what he's doing is illegal, and those cases tend not to 

19

 come to this Court.  There are some statements in the 

20

 opinion in Bryan.  Now, Bryan was principally a case 

21

 about the willful standard, but there was also a 

22

 discussion of a knowledge standard.  And in Bryan, the 

23

 Court said the government doesn't necessarily have to 

24

 prove that a defendant knew what he was doing was 

25

 illegal, and I think the use of necessarily there

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

 suggests  at least leaves open the possibility that if 

2

 the government did prove that, then it would be 

3

 sufficient.  The Court also said 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's the best you have? 

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

The Court  the Court also 

6

 said in Bryan that the defendant  that the government 

7

 merely needs to prove knowledge of the facts that make 

8

 his conduct illegal, suggesting that that's an easier 

9

 standard for the government to meet. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Just 
Just to follow 

12

 up  I'm sorry, just to follow up quickly on Justice 

13

 Kennedy's hypothetical, what if he knew he was 

14

 trespassing when he went on to the government property 

15

 and  and took the casings?  You have to show he knew 

16

 what he was doing was illegal, he was trespassing.  The 

17

 sign said government property.  And so we can convict 

18

 him for taking the shell casings. 

19

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we would we would tie 

20

 it more directly to the conduct that actually violates 

21

 the law.  And so if  if he needs to know that the 

22

 taking of the shell casings is illegal, not that some 

23

 ancillary conduct that, you know, brought him to the 

24

 shell casings was illegal.  And so here we would say, 

25

 again, he needs  the defendant needs to know that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

 distribution of the drug is what's illegal.  And we 

2

 think, you know, if you look at the  I think we're on 

3

 the same page with Petitioner in suggesting that the 

4

 same standard should govern both CSA cases and analogue 

5

 cases.  We just disagree about how the courts of appeals 

6

 have applied this in the CSA context. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

8

 Start with a drug that is on the list. 

Let me try this out. 
All 

9

 right.  The defendant knows the chemical composition of 

10

 the drug that's on the list.  The defendant has no idea 

11

 that this is on the list, knows nothing about the 

12

 Federal drug laws.  This person distributes it 

13

 intentionally, knowingly. 

14

 That person has violated the law. 

The 

15

 person's ignorance of the fact that this is a controlled 

16

 substance is irrelevant.  Are you  am I right so far? 

17
18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 
 identity of the drug. 

19
20

Yes, because he knows the 

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

He knows  he knows what it 

 is. 

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

22

 JUST ALITO: 

Yes. 
So he knows the chemical 

23

 composition.  He knows the name.  All right. 

24

 Now, let's assume that we have a list of 

25

 analogues.  It's the same thing.  If the defendant knows

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

 that the thing is on the list, knows the chemical 

2

 composition of it, and it turns out that this is an 

3

 analogue, that is sufficient.  That's not going to be 

4

 the proof in most cases. 

5

 And I think maybe the confusion is that the 

6

 defendant  a defendant's knowledge of the illegality 

7

 of what he or she is doing is not something that has to 

8

 be proven.  It is circumstantial evidence that the 

9

 person knows that the thing that is being distributed is 

10

 something that is on the list. 

11
12

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

 no list in the analogue context.  It's 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

16

I understand that. 
Okay. 
But it makes it easier to 

 understand 

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

19

Right.  And, again, there's 

Yes. 
 if we imagine that there 

 is. 

20

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

21

 Our position is that if we can prove that a 

22

 defendant knew what he was doing was illegal, that's a 

23

 way of proving that he knew he was distributing a 

24

 controlled substance analogue or a controlled substance. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes.  So, no, we agree. 

But it's not something that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

 you have to prove.  You don't have to prove that he knew 

2

 that it was illegal under Federal law, or under State 

3

 law, or under any other law. 

4

 You have to prove that he knew that it was a 

5

 substance that constitutes  that, in fact, constitutes 

6

 an analogue. 

7

 But the fact that he knows that it's illegal 

8

 under Federal law is circumstantial evidence that he 

9

 knew that it was something that fell within that 

10
11

 definition. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.  And it might help if 

12

 I could give you sort of a real world example of how 

13

 this has worked in the courts of appeals under the CSA. 

14

 There's a number of  of cases in the  in 

15

 the courts of appeals dealing with a substance called 

16

 khat, which is KHAT.  Khat is a plant that's grown in 

17

 the Horn of Africa, generally, and if you pick the 

18

 leaves off the plant and chew them, it gives a stimulant 

19

 effect.  And the reason it gives a stimulant effect is 

20

 because fresh leaves of khat contain a substance called 

21

 cathinone, which is a Schedule I substance illegal under 

22

 the CSA.  It sort of produces amphetaminelike effects. 

23

 So khat is legal in many places in the 

24

 world.  It's illegal to distribute it in this country 

25

 because, again, it contains  when freshly picked,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

53
1

 contains a Schedule I controlled substance. 

2

 So there are a number of cases where the 

3

 government has prosecuted people under the CSA for 

4

 distributing cathinone in the form of distributing khat. 

5

 And defendants in those cases have said, Look, I didn't 

6

 know it had cathinone, I was distributing khat.  It's 

7

 legal where I come from, I have no what the chemical is 

8

 in this  in this plant.  And the courts of appeals 

9

 have generally upheld those convictions based on 

10

 proof  or when there is proof that the defendant knew 

11

 that distributing the khat was illegal, even if he 

12

 didn't know why it was illegal.  Even if he didn't 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Wait.  The light is dawning 

14

 slightly, maybe.  Don't say I'm restating your argument 

15

 correctly if I'm not. 

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Okay. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Please.  The 

18

 you're  you're saying, first, he doesn't know the 

19

 chemistry.  So he doesn't  he has to know it's an 

20

 analogue, but he doesn't know the chemistry. 

21

 Now, you're saying, of course, if he knows 

22

 that it is illegal under the Analogue Act, that's good 

23

 enough because he knows it's an analogue. 

24

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now you're saying if he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

 knows it's illegal generally under the drug laws, that 

2

 should be evidence of the fact that he knows it's an 

3

 analogue because let's ask him why do you think it's 

4

 illegal under the analogue  I mean, why do you think 

5

 it's illegal under the drug laws?  I'm going to tell you 

6

 its not a listed substance.  Why could it be?  And he'd 

7

 sort of be stuck there because he doesn't want to say, 

8

 hmm, because it's a lot like cocaine. 

9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Because once he says 

11

 because it's a lot like cocaine, he knows it's an 

12

 analogue.  And if say, using my, you know, far out 

13

 examples, it's not because he thinks it's a veterinarian 

14

 law. 

15

 So what it should be  is this right  if 

16

 I follow your argument, you'd say the fact that he knows 

17

 it's illegal under the drug laws, is, itself, evidence 

18

 that he knows it's an analogue, but he's free to come up 

19

 if he wants with some kind of basis for saying that even 

20

 though he thought it was illegal under the drug laws, he 

21

 thought it was illegal under some other law that had to 

22

 do with postage stamps or something.  That  that 

23

 should be, if the jury believes that, get him off. 

24

 Have I got it basically right? 

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

That's a correct

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

 characterization of our narrower argument, yes, that 

2

 if  right.  If we can prove that the defendant 

3

 believed what he was doing violated some drug law, 

4

 that's enough to prove that he knowingly distributed an 

5

 analogue. 

6
7

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What would "some drug 

 law" be other than the CSA and the Analogue Act? 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.  In the Federal 

 context, there wouldn't be, but, again, our point is 

10

 really that the defendant, generally, does not have a 

11

 specific law in mind.  He just knows that what he's 

12

 doing is breaking the law. 

13

 And so when Petitioner says we have to prove 

14

 that he knew he was violating the  the statute of 

15

 conviction, we think that's a  much too high a burden. 

16

 The only time you have to do that is when you have a 

17

 willful standard in the tax evasion context; right? 

18

 This is certainly not that context. 

We 

19

 think just general knowledge of illegality and intention 

20

 to engage in the prohibited act is sufficient. 

21
22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 
 must relate to drugs. 

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

24

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

25

But  but the illegality 

Pardon me? 
The illegality must 

 relate to drugs.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

56
1

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

We think that's  it's 

2

 certainly sufficient when the government proves that, 

3

 that the illegality relates to drugs. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And  and sufficient.  It's 

5

 not just evidence that he knew it was an analogue; it's 

6

 conclusive evidence. 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

We think that's correct. 

8

 Yes.  And, you know, to  Petitioner suggests that the 

9

 courts 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So even if he comes back and 

11

 says, Yes, I thought that what I was doing was wrong, 

12

 but  but it wasn't because I thought this was an 

13

 analogue, it was for some other reason. 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we think if he came 

15

 back, for example, and said, Well, I thought it violated 

16

 the Virginia Controlled Substances Act  and because 

17

 not  some States control more drugs than the 

18

 Federal  than the Federal schedules include  but I 

19

 didn't know it violated a Federal drug law, we think 

20

 that would not be a defense.  Right?  That some 

21

 knowledge that you're violating a drug law is 

22

 sufficient. 

23
24
25

 You know, and we think in this case there is 
 actually 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You said sufficient.  How

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

 about necessary?  Is it necessary?  Is the drug  is 

2

 the law that he thinks he's violating, be a drug law, is 

3

 that necessary? 

4

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So, again, we think that 

5

 there is  that a broader view would be correct.  But 

6

 we are perfectly happy with a ruling in this case that 

7

 it  that it would be sufficient that the government 

8

 we don't think that there is necessarily a basis for 

9

 limiting the knowledge of illegality specifically to 

10

 drug laws.  As long as you tie the conducts to the 

11

 belief in illegality, we think that's enough. 

12

 But we think it's definitely sufficient for 

13

 this case to hold that when the government proves a 

14

 belief that  that he is violating a drug law, that 

15

 that's enough. 

16
17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So  so the conduct is 

 related to the genus of illegality. 

18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Right. 
I think  I think 

20

 there are areas where criminal defendants do try to 

21

 tailor their conduct to fall within, if they're captured 

22

 or caught, particular laws but not others.  I recall 

23

 cases where that's true. 

24
25

 I mean, hypothetically, let's say they know 
 that this much marijuana or cocaine is a misdemeanor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

 If they got up to this much, you know, it's 15 years 

2

 mandatory minimum, so they structure their activities to 

3

 fall within the lower level. 

4

 You would be able to prosecute them, 

5

 according to your theory, for the big 15year mandatory 

6

 whatever, if they happen to go beyond the misdemeanor 

7

 amount. 

8
9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Certainly, yes.  You know, 

 if a defendant believed that he was distributing 1 pound 

10

 of cocaine and it turned out  and that's probably, 

11

 it's, you know, I don't know what the right numbers are, 

12

 but say he believed he was distributing 1 pound of 

13

 cocaine.  Turned out, he was distributing 5 pounds of 

14

 cocaine and there's different sentence that applies for 

15

 5 pounds.  If we can prove he actually distributed 5 

16

 pounds of cocaine, then I think that would be sufficient 

17

 under the Controlled Substance Act. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what does that 

19

 do to your theory that they have to  what they have to 

20

 know is that it's illegal under the drug laws. 

21

 What  what was illegal  what they knew 

22

 was the misdemeanor amount.  And you're saying, well, 

23

 that doesn't  it doesn't matter that they  doesn't 

24

 matter that they didn't know they were distributing the 

25

 larger amount.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So I took your hypothetical 

2

 to be that he knew what he was doing was illegal.  He 

3

 just 

4
5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

He knew what he was 

 doing was an  was a misdemeanor. 

6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay. 
Because of the 

8

 amount.  He didn't know it was a going to be a felony 

9

 because he didn't know he had that much of the drug. 

10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, under our view, if he 

11

 knew what he was doing violated a drug law, which I 

12

 think would be the case in your hypothetical, then 

13

 that's sufficient. 

14

 Now, of course, if he thought what he was 

15

 distribute  what he was distributing was oregano and 

16

 it turned out to the marijuana, then we think that 

17

 wouldn't be sufficient because he would have believed 

18

 what he was doing was innocent, and he wouldn't have 

19

 known the facts that made his conduct illegal. 

20

 In this case, there are  there are plenty 

21

 of facts to show that Petitioner really believed that 

22

 what he was doing was illegal, and it turned out that he 

23

 was correct.  Again, he sold his products in little 

24

 baggies and vials instead of having sort of more 

25

 traditional commercial packaging.  He charged $450 an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

60
1

 ounce for these products, which sort of undercuts his 

2

 belief that he thought that they were aromatherapy 

3

 products or things that you would actually pour into a 

4

 bathtub.  He named 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, you know, you charge 

6

 what the market will bear.  And if it has the same 

7

 effect  if it has the same effect as cocaine, even if 

8

 it's perfectly legal, you should charge 400.  Don't you 

9

 believe in the free market? 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Not in the illegal drug 

12

 I mean, you know, the free market works in the illegal 

13

 drug context the same way it works everywhere else. 

14

 But I think it's certainly evidence that he 

15

 knew what he was selling was a drug, and it was an 

16

 illicit drug.  And he named the analogues after 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All it shows is that he 

18

 knew it would give you a high.  That's all.  And  and 

19

 so he was charging what people are willing to pay for 

20

 that. 

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

He also acted furtively. 

22

 You know, he sort of hid his products on his website. 

23

 He wouldn't answer direct questions from his customers 

24

 about which high, you know, was most like for the 

25

 controlled substances.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

61
1

 And so we think there is certainly 

2

 sufficient evidence to show that Petitioner in this case 

3

 believed that 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, the Petitioner's 

5

 counsel agrees that there is sufficient evidence to 

6

 convict under a proper instruction. 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.  I mean, I think he 

8

 has a different view of what a proper instruction is. 

9

 And so, again, I understand that the Court 

10

 generally remands for application of harmless error.  We 

11

 think that would be appropriate in this case, 

12

 particularly, because the government didn't ask for this 

13

 instruction because it was following circuit precedent 

14

 below, and then defending a harsher instruction that was 

15

 actually given in the case. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How can we  when a jury 

17

 is told that human ingestion is enough, he has to  he 

18

 has to intend that this  these bath salts are not to 

19

 put in the bathtub, but to ingest, that's all that he 

20

 that was the only mens rea that was charged.  Isn't that 

21

 so? 

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

It was not the only mens 

23

 rea that was charged, Justice Ginsburg.  That was the 

24

 mens rea instruction that the government requested 

25

 because that was what circuit precedent had said was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

62
1

 enough.  But the instruction that was actually given, 

2

 told the jury it had to find that he knowingly 

3

 distributed a controlled substance  a substance that 

4

 had the same pharmacological effects as a controlled 

5

 substance. 

6

 Thank you. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

 Mr. Russell, you have four minutes left. 

9
10
11
12
13

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Let me start with the 

 instruction. 
 Justice Ginsburg, even under the 

14

 government's interpretation of the jury instructions as 

15

 requiring the jury to find that the defendant knew about 

16

 the similarity in effect, the government acknowledges it 

17

 didn't require any knowledge about the similarity 

18

 instruction.  So the government has acknowledged that 

19

 this  the instruction here was inadequate, even under 

20

 the government's new view of the law.  And so the 

21

 question here is simply whether or not they're entitled 

22

 to take advantage of that, and to make a harmless error 

23

 argument, based on a theory that they only developed in 

24

 this Court. 

25

 But let me  with respect to the general

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63
1

 legal questions, let me start with  with addressing 

2

 their broad "any law will do" position.  And that is 

3

 simply, as I understand them now, premised on their 

4

 thought that all the statute requires is culpable state 

5

 of mind, but that's not what the statute says.  It 

6

 doesn't say distribute an analogue culpably, it says 

7

 distribute knowingly. 

8

 And this Court has repeatedly said that 

9

 knowing distribution of a prohibited item requires 

10

 knowledge of the facts.  And there may be a  an 

11

 exception that we've discussed that you can meet that by 

12

 showing that there's knowledge under the law of 

13

 conviction itself, but there is no precedent from this 

14

 Court that gives the court  gives prosecutors the 

15

 option of either proving the facts, the defendant knew 

16

 the facts that made the conduct unlawful, or simply that 

17

 he acted culpably or that he knew that the conduct was 

18

 unlawful under some law. 

19

 Now, with respect to their fallback 

20

 position, that it has to be illegal under a drug law, 

21

 we're getting closer.  We would agree, if they were to 

22

 say, as some courts have said, including Hussein, which 

23

 is a case they feature prominently in their brief, that 

24

 it has to be a Federal antidrug abuse law.  Now, the 

25

 truth of the matter is there's only one of those, but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

64
1

 the  the value in that articulation is that it makes 

2

 clear that the defendant doesn't have to know the name 

3

 of the statute. 

4

 But if the government's position is that 

5

 it's enough that it be under State drug abuse laws, and 

6

 Justice Alito, there are lots of State Analogue Acts, 

7

 and there are lots of States that have been ahead of the 

8

 government in putting on their schedules things that are 

9

 analogues, including some of the substances in this 

10

 case. 

11

 That's clearly not what this Court has ever 

12

 had in mind in interpreting the word "knowingly" in a 

13

 statute.  And it's up to Congress to decide what is 

14

 culpable enough.  And when it uses the word "knowingly," 

15

 it is entitled to know that that word is going to get 

16

 the same interpretation that it has in the past.  The 

17

 government points to cases like Bryan in which the Court 

18

 has said, in addition to knowing the facts, we must also 

19

 know something about the law.  And it says that, you 

20

 know, willfulness is enough to establish knowing 

21

 knowing distribution.  But of course, in those cases, 

22

 it's not simply that they have some general knowledge of 

23

 unlawfulness, they also know the facts that make the 

24

 conduct unlawful. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

A defendant who knowingly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

65
1

 distributes heroin, knows that it's heroin, doesn't have 

2

 any idea that it's illegal, nevertheless has violated 

3

 the law.  Now, I don't see why the rule should be any 

4

 different with respect to an analogue. 

5
6
7
8
9

 MR. RUSSELL: 

I  I don't say that it is. 

 I think they have  they can either 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So then the defendant 

 doesn't have to know the legal status of  of the drug. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

Again, we're talking about the 

10

 government's alternative theory.  The government always 

11

 has the option 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sorry.  If a State law 

13

 calls it an analogue, he knows he's violating the State 

14

 law, he knows this is an analogue. 

15

 MR. RUSSELL: 

Well, if  if he knew that he 

16

 was violating a State Analogue Act that had the same 

17

 definition under Federal law, I think you could then ask 

18

 the jury to infer that he knew that he was violating the 

19

 Federal law.  But most of the time, as my colleague 

20

 said, the government's evidence is simply going to be 

21

 that the defendant knew that the conduct was unlawful 

22

 somehow.  And the jury is entitled 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I  I'm not sure that you 

 answered Justice Alito's question fully. 
 MR. RUSSELL: 

I'm sorry.

Alderson Reporting Company

66

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

2

 MR. RUSSELL: 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

4

 MR. RUSSELL: 

He 
So 
Go ahead. 
So, Justice Alito, the 

5

 government never has to prove the defendant's knowledge 

6

 about the law at all, if it proves that he knows the 

7

 facts that make the conduct unlawful.  And so what we're 

8

 objecting to is the government's alternative route to 

9

 showing mens rea.  And we agree with them up to the 

10

 point of the fact that they think that it's enough to 

11

 show that the defendant knew it was violating some State 

12

 law or perhaps some provision of the FDA which regulates 

13

 substances independent of the Controlled Substances Act. 

14

 As a practical matter, in most cases, what 

15

 the government  the proof is going to be what the 

16

 government described, which is simply that the defendant 

17

 engaged in some furtive conduct that suggests that he 

18

 knows that the substance is illegal. 

19

 And unless the  the defendant comes 

20

 forward with some reason for the jury to think that, in 

21

 fact, he had in mind that it violated some other law, or 

22

 in fact, that he looked and  and came to the 

23

 conclusion it doesn't violate this Controlled Substances 

24

 Act, then the jury is very likely to find mens rea 

25

 established, and we don't have any problem with that.

Alderson Reporting Company

 In this  just to finally address the facts 

2

 of this case.  The fact that my client was distributing 

3

 things in baggies rather than vials shows that he was 

4

 doing this from his home business.  The fact that he was 

5

 charging large prices shows that he thought he had found 

6

 a loophole in the Federal drug laws.  There is no reason 

7

 in the world why he would have  if I could finish this 

8

 sentence  why he would have flushed his product down 

9

 the toilet when he discovered that it contained a 

10

 substance that was on the schedules if, in fact, he knew 

11

 that the other products also were illegal and didn't 

12

 care.
