ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY D. THOMPSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

This Court has held in several decisions that


12

the police questioning of individuals is a legitimate and,


13

indeed, vital law enforcement technique.

14

below ignores this Court's teachings as to when a police-


15

citizen encounter on a bus may violate the Fourth


16

Amendment and may constitute the seizure of the passenger.


17

The decision


Police-citizen encounters have proven to be


18

effective law enforcement techniques in the area of drug


19

and weapon interdiction.

20

important in today's environment with respect to the


21

protection of passengers in the Nation's public


22

transportation system. 


23

These encounters are also


This case is controlled by this Court's decision


24

in Bostick and the court below incorrectly applied the


25

Bostick test to these facts. 

3

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Thompson, isn't it so that in


2

Bostick the police did inform the passengers that they had


3

a right to refuse consent?


4

MR. THOMPSON:

That is correct, Your Honor, but


5

also in Bostick this Court clearly pointed out, on remand


6

to the Florida Supreme Court, the factors that the Court


7

should evaluate in terms of determining whether or not the


8

encounter was coercive or otherwise inappropriate.

9

two of those factors are important here that would put


10

And


into context what the court below considered. 


11

For example, this Court pointed out to the


12

Florida Supreme Court whether or not there were guns


13

pointed and noted that there were no guns pointed in a --


14

in the Bostick case.

15

Florida Supreme Court that -- whether or not there was the


16

existence of threatening language, and none of that


17

existed in the case below. 


18

QUESTION:

This Court also pointed out to the


Well, I -- I suppose that the advice


19

that you have a right to decline the request applies --


20

and I -- I take it you could read Bostick this way;


21

perhaps you disagree -- to whether or not the -- the


22

consent was actually given as opposed to whether there was


23

a coercive environment. 


24
25

MR. THOMPSON:

That's correct, Your Honor, and


as the Bostick Court pointed out with respect to the test

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to be applied is whether or not, under all the


2

circumstances, the police conduct communicated to a


3

reasonable person -- and that presupposes a reasonably --


4

a reasonable innocent person -- whether or not the


5

passenger could have refused the officer's request to


6

consent or otherwise have terminated the -- terminated the


7

encounter.


8

There is really nothing remarkable about the


9

facts of this case when you look at this Court's decision


10

in Bostick and compare Bostick with this Court's decision


11

in Robinette which clearly pointed --


12

QUESTION:

My question, Mr. Thompson, was your


13

opening statement was that the Eleventh Circuit had ruled


14

in direct conflict with this Court's precedent.

15

applying a totality of the circumstances test, that's one


16

circumstance that was present there, is not present here. 


17

So, whether the Eleventh Circuit erred is for us to


18

determine today, but I do think it's a bit much to say


19

that they -- they just disregarded this Court's precedent.


20

MR. THOMPSON:

If we're


Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit


21

considered factors that were unlike the factors that this


22

Court in Bostick believed were important in determining


23

whether the police conduct at issue was coercive.

24

moreover, Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit incorrectly


25

applied the legal principles that this Court formulated

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And


1

with respect to the facts of this case. 


2

For example, the Eleventh Circuit noted the


3

importance of Officer Hoover at the front of the bus and


4

pointed out that his presence might lead a -- a passenger


5

to believe that he or she could not leave the bus.

6

this Court in Bostick clearly pointed out that the -- in a


7

-- in the context of a bus interdiction effort, whether or


8

not the passenger could leave the bus was the wrong


9

question.

Well,


The question was whether or not the passenger


10

-- whether or not the police conduct communicated to the


11

passenger whether or not they could refuse the consent


12

requested or whether or not they could just terminate the


13

questioning of the police officer.


14

QUESTION:

Well, it's -- it's true that the --


15

the issue of whether someone could leave the bus or not is


16

-- is not really an issue that -- that focuses the


17

question, and we said so in Bostick.

18

follow from that that it was irrelevant in Bostick or that


19

it's irrelevant here that there was an officer stationed


20

at the front of the bus.

21

totality of the circumstances test, wouldn't you agree


22

that that is one relevant fact to consider in trying to


23

reconstruct the atmosphere and decide whether or not it


24

signaled to the -- to the person searched the -- the


25

possibility of just ending the encounter? 


But it doesn't


If we're going to have a

1

MR. THOMPSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

That -- it is


2

one relevant fact to be taken into consideration with the


3

other factors, but here the officer stationed at the front


4

of the bus -- at the front of the bus really did not


5

communicate, nor did Officer Lang who was doing the


6

questioning -- did not communicate that -- to any


7

passenger that he or she could not terminate the


8

questioning. 


9

QUESTION:

He did -- nobody said, you can't


10

leave the bus.

But isn't it a fact that a passenger would


11

take into some consideration that there was an officer


12

stationed at the front of the bus?


13

MR. THOMPSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

He wasn't keeping people out,


apparently.


16

MR. THOMPSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

Your Honor --


Excuse me. 


It's -- it's a relevant fact in


determining the coerciveness of the atmosphere, is it not?


19

MR. THOMPSON:

Your Honor, not in this case. 


20

The court below and the Eleventh Circuit acknowledged in


21

-- in their findings, if you will, that the -- the aisle


22

was not blocked, the exit was not blocked.

23

every --


24
25

QUESTION:
suggestion.

In fact,


Let me -- let me try a -- a different


The fact that the officer at the front of the

1

bus was kneeling in the driver's seat was one graphic


2

reminder of another fact in this case, and that is, that


3

the driver was gone.

4

only people exercising any kind of official capacity in


5

that bus were three police officers.

6

occupying the driver's seat.

7

nobody is going to be going anywhere on this bus?

8

bus isn't going to be going anywhere until the officers


9

are satisfied. 


10

The driver had left the bus.

The


One of them was


Isn't that a signal that

This


Now, that may or may not be dispositive of


11

anything, but it is a relevant fact on the question of


12

coercion and voluntariness.

13

MR. THOMPSON:

Isn't it? 


Your Honor, the presence of the


14

officer at the front of the bus is a factor, but in the


15

context of these facts and if -- in the context of this


16

Court's decision in Delgado where you had armed agents


17

surrounding the factory, and this Court held that simply


18

because the factory workers could not leave without


19

passing those agents --


20

QUESTION:

I agree with you.

You're -- you're


21

absolutely right there.

The -- the point that I'm making


22

is that you can't go through this kind of analysis and


23

say, well, this fact is irrelevant.

24

been considered by the court.

25

That shouldn't have been considered.

This shouldn't have


That fact was irrelevant. 

It was a relevant

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fact.

2

Delgado reference, is a different question, but it's a


3

relevant fact, isn't it?


4

What it all adds up to, as you suggest by the


MR. THOMPSON:

It's a relevant fact, but the


5

factors to be considered and the factors that this Court


6

clearly announced in -- in the Bostick case were factors


7

that were threatening, factors that were otherwise


8

coercive, like pointing a gun.

9

Your Honor, the Eleventh Circuit even noted that there was


In this particular case,


10

no evidence that any of the passengers saw that this


11

officer was armed.

12
13
14
15
16

QUESTION:
was an officer?

The officers were --

Mr. Thompson, did they know that he


Was it clear that he was an officer?


MR. THOMPSON:

The officer was conducting


individual passenger-specific questioning. 

QUESTION:

The -- the other two officers were I


17

know, but was there -- was it clear that the person


18

kneeling in the driver's seat was an officer? 


19

MR. THOMPSON:

He was casually dressed, Your


20

Honor, and it's not clear from the record as to whether or


21

not he was a police officer.


22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

showed their badges.

Did he have his badge?

The other two


Did the one in the front show --


MR. THOMPSON:

I don't believe the record is


clear as to where the badge was located with respect to

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the officer at the front of the bus. 


2

QUESTION:

3

MR. THOMPSON:

4

Yes.

They all entered as


passengers, all casually dressed. 


5
6

Did he enter with the other two?


And with respect to the conduct of this -- of

this search --


7

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, I -- what -- I don't


8

know what that -- why should that make a difference.

9

somebody shows me a badge and he's casually dressed, I


10

know he's got a gun, or he's going to be fired.

11

officer is fired if he doesn't carry his gun.

12

knows that.


13

Let me -- let me ask you this.

If


An

Everybody


Would it be


14

appropriate in your view for this Court to write an


15

opinion in which we say that citizens have certain


16

obligations to know their rights and to assert their


17

rights?

18

law lives in the consciousness of the people.

19

have a certain obligation to assert their rights.

20

don't want to be searched, they say I don't want to be


21

searched.

22

That's what makes for a strong democracy.

The


And people

If they


Should we write that in an opinion? 

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, that follows on with the --


23

the clear test that this Court announced in Bostick, and


24

the test was, Your Honor, whether or not the police


25

conduct commuted anything -- communicated anything to the

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

citizens and these passengers as to --

QUESTION:

What about the proposition as I -- as


3

I've stated it?

4

there's a good answer for it -- then I'd just say, well,


5

we have to distinguish Miranda at least.

6

on a contrary assumption.

7

my mind as I'm asking the question. 


8
9

Because if you say yes -- and I think


MR. THOMPSON:

Miranda is based


That's what's running through


Well, here -- here the -- the


citizens -- some citizens did refuse Officer Lang's


10

request, and what -- what you posit is -- is really the


11

guts of what is going on here.

12

Your Honor, many of the citizens -- most citizens went


13

along with the police questioning in -- in this particular


14

-- these particular bus interdictions, and they -- and


15

they were happy to do so.

16

many of the bus passengers appreciated his efforts in


17

coming onto the bus.

18

-- of safety. 


19

As Officer Lang testified,


Officer Lang testified that


They -- it made them feel a sense of


And here citizens generally do know their


20

rights, and here the police did not communicate anything


21

to these passengers that would indicate that they had to


22

answer, that they were required or otherwise compelled to


23

answer Officer Lang's questions. 


24
25

QUESTION:

Did any other case that we considered


involve a body pat-down, not just a request to look at

11

turn up anything of interest to the police, but the pat-


3

down did. 


4

This -- in this case the -- the luggage didn't


And the image of let's take what is -- Mr.

Drayton is sitting next to a man who has just been hauled


6

off the bus, handcuffed.

7

intimidation at that point when the police then turned to


8

him and said, okay, we'd like to search you too.


9

MR. THOMPSON:

I imagine he would feel some


Well, the -- the Bostick test


10

presupposes a reasonable, innocent person.

11

particular case, Mr. -- Mr. Brown's consent was


12

unambiguous.

13

14

out a cell phone.


15
16
17

He opened his coat.

QUESTION:

In this


He -- in response to


He opened his coat.

He took


But Drayton said nothing throughout


the whole encounter. 

MR. THOMPSON:

Drayton's -- Drayton's consent,


18

as the district court found, was clear and unambiguous. 


19

He raised his hands off of his thighs, Your Honor.

20

was nothing that Officer Lang said to Mr. -- or said to


21

Mr. Drayton or had said to Mr. Brown that would have


22

indicated that Mr. Drayton could not have terminated the


23

questioning or that he could have refused consent. 


24
25

There


And as this Court noted -- as this Court noted

in Bostick, the fact that a lawbreaker knows that the

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

search is going to uncover contraband or is -- knows that


2

the search is going to uncover drugs does not make the


3

consent involuntary.


4

QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't make it involuntary,


5

but it -- it does suggest perhaps that there is an


6

ambiguity here as -- as against your claim that there was


7

none in Brown's consent because -- and correct me if I'm


8

wrong on the facts, but I -- I think the first request to


9

Brown was -- or maybe to the two of them together -- can I


10

look at your -- your luggage, your bag, whatever they had


11

pointed to, and they said, sure.

12

sure because they knew there was nothing in it that was


13

going to be incriminating.

14

-- in the luggage and he found nothing. 


15

And I presume they said


So, the officer looked in the


Then he turned to Brown and said, mind if I do a


16

pat-down, or whatever the phrase was.

Well, that's the


17

search that's in question here, and I would have thought


18

that at that point Brown was in the situation in which the


19

reasonable citizen would have thought I'm damned if I do


20

and I'm damned if I don't.

21

he's thorough about it, he's going to find the -- the


22

drugs.

23

permission to him to -- to look in the -- in the bag, he's


24

going to know that there must be something on me that


25

wasn't on the bag.

If he pats me down and he's --


If I say you can't pat me down, having just given


And -- and, therefore, it seems to me

13

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the -- that Brown at that point was by no means in a


2

position in which he had a kind of free choice to say yes


3

or no.

4

Have I got the facts wrong?


5

So, it sounds to me as though it is ambiguous. 


MR. THOMPSON:

You have the facts, but your


6

conclusion, Your Honor, I would differ with because in --


7

in the situation both individuals pointed to the bag.


8

There was nothing in Officer Lang's request to Mr. Brown


9

that would -- that would -- that -- that would send or


10

communicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have refused


11

the request.

12

that would indicate to Mr. Brown that he could not have


13

otherwise terminated the questioning.

14

There was nothing in Officer Lang's question


QUESTION:

Why some of the --


Well, you don't agree, I hope, with


15

the -- with the proposition that there would be no reason


16

to decline the pat-down search except the reason that he


17

had something incriminating on him.

18

that you've -- you've acceded to the luggage search, which


19

is a much less intrusive search, does not show that --


20

that you have something to hide when you -- when you


21

decline to -- to have a pat-down.

22

agree that a consent to a luggage search is a lot less


23

difficult to obtain than consent to a pat-down?


24
25

MR. THOMPSON:

I mean, the mere fact


Don't -- don't you


The nature -- the nature of the


search is not necessary to the Bostick inquiry.

1

QUESTION:

Well, I think you're -- I think


2

you're missing my point.

Justice Souter was suggesting


3

that having acceded to the luggage search, the only


4

plausible reason for objecting to the pat-down would be


5

that I have something on me that is incriminating.

6

-- I acceded to the luggage search because I knew there


7

was nothing incriminating.

8

innocent citizen could agree to a -- a policeman's search


9

of luggage but not agree to a pat-down? 


And I


But don't you think that an

QUESTION:

And -- and, of course, I would

QUESTION:

You know, let's be reasonable here.

QUESTION:

Yes.

12

15

Absolutely, Your Honor.


agree --


But don't -- don't you think


the most probable inference is the inference I gave you?


16

MR. THOMPSON:

No, Your Honor.

You have --


17

again, you have to understand this Court's holding in


18

Bostick and that is the --


19

QUESTION:

The holding in Bostick, if I remember


20

it, was that the Florida Supreme Court was wrong in


21

adopting a per se rule and left open the question of


22

whether there was a seizure in that case.

23

right?


24
25

MR. THOMPSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

Isn't that


But in this


particular case, the reasonable person, as this Court

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said, presupposes a reasonable, innocent person. 


2

Lawbreakers sometimes agree to be -- agree to be searched,


3

knowing that the drugs are in their luggage or on their


4

person, for a number of reasons, sometimes as -- as these


5

gentlemen did.

6

want to send some kind of message that they indeed have


7

the items in question.

8

They do this for any number of reasons, hoping that the


9

police officer will not search them and go away. 


They want to be cooperative.

QUESTION:

MR. THOMPSON:

QUESTION:

They do not

Mr. Thompson, you --

It has nothing to do with --


-- you were about to say --

-- compulsion.

Excuse me.


-- that the police -- you were about


15

to say when the police go over the line.

16

here they did nothing that would imply that consent or


17

that -- that the search was required of the citizen.

18

-- can -- can you give a description of when the police


19

would step over the line?

20

words of command, get up, I want to search you?

21

-- does it take that?


22

MR. THOMPSON:

I think you said


What


Is it -- must the police give

Is that


The -- if -- if the police would


23

communicate to the citizen somehow that the citizen's


24

response was compelled.

25

this Court noted that pointing guns, drawn guns would lead

to that -- that kind of compulsion or coercion.

example, if the police used threatening language.

3

police communicated to the reasonable person that he or


4

she could not refuse the request for consent or could not

otherwise terminate the questioning.

QUESTION:

to the extent anything explains it.

(Laughter.) 


9

QUESTION:

10

For


That -- that was a custodial


interrogation, wasn't it? 


11

MR. THOMPSON:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor. 


And the -- the physical custody would


13

have had that -- that effect of -- of causing the person


14

to believe that he had no choice.


15

MR. THOMPSON:

Absolutely.

Here you have


16

unstructured, rapidly developing police-citizen


17

encounters, and what is important here --


18

QUESTION:

And you have a request and a


19

response.

And the response is that there is no objection


20

to the search.

21

objective consideration of the highest importance. 


And it seems to me that that is an

MR. THOMPSON:

QUESTION:

24
25

That's correct, Your Honor. 


May I ask, Mr. Thompson, do you


regard this primarily as a seizure case or a search case?

MR. THOMPSON:

This is a seizure case, Your

17

1

Honor.

That's the -- the court below decided this case


2

under the -- under the Bostick test.

3

the Eleventh Circuit urged the Bostick test, and this is


4

-- I would submit that this is a seizure case.


5

QUESTION:

Both parties before


Do you think it always would follow


6

if you concluded that there was no seizure, that there was


7

necessarily voluntary consent to the search?


8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

If there was no seizure?


Right. 


MR. THOMPSON:

It -- in this Court's test in


11

Bostick, the Court merged the voluntary issue and the


12

voluntariness in with the -- in with the Bostick seizure


13

analysis.

14

together and are related. 


So, I would say that -- that the two are merged


15

QUESTION:

16

analytically they have to be.

17

have a case in which you could -- the officer could say to


18

the man, you're perfectly free to get off the bus anytime


19

you want to, but I'd like to -- to search you first, and


20

may I do so?

21

search was voluntary even if there had been no seizure. 


22

It seems to me that could be a scenario that would make


23

sense. 


24
25

It doesn't seem to me that

It seems to me you could


And then the question would be whether the


MR. THOMPSON:

It's -- it's hard to -- in the


context of these bus -- police-citizen encounters on a

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

bus, it's hard to really see the distinction between the


2

voluntariness test and the seizure test.


3

QUESTION:

But it does seem to me the passenger


4

might have two different thoughts.

5

off the bus.

6

wherever we're going.

7

off the bus, but it just doesn't make any sense.

8

that's one inquiry.

9

let this fellow search me?

10

One, I better not get


I want to get to Columbus or Cleveland or

So, I -- that -- maybe I can get

But


The second inquiry is, do I want to

It seems to me they are really


two separate questions. 


11

MR. THOMPSON:

I don't know, Your Honor, but I


12

-- I would posit here that we do not really need in this


13

particular case to -- to understand the full extent of the


14

scope of the voluntariness test because the court below


15

clearly decided this case under Bostick and as a seizure


16

case.


17
18

QUESTION:

A seizure of the person or seizure of


the contraband?


19

MR. THOMPSON:

20

QUESTION:

The person, Your Honor. 


If we were writing on a blank slate


21

and other cases weren't there, what would be the


22

Department's objections to a rule of law that said when


23

you're on a bus, only 11 inches of an aisle, three people

One is sitting in the back looking over the

The other two systematically work their way to the

1

front.

2

of course, you can ask citizens to cooperate?

3

that's a very desirable thing.

4

cramped quarters where you have three, just say you don't


5

have to answer if you don't want to.

6

searched if you don't want to, making clear that you're


7

eliciting voluntary cooperation and nobody is under


8

compulsion.

9

What would be the objection to saying, policeman,

Certainly


But in those closed,


You don't have to be


What would be the objection to that?


MR. THOMPSON:

Well, as this Court noted in


10

Bostick, Your Honor, just because the police-citizen


11

encounter happens on a bus, there's no reason to establish


12

some kind of per se rule.


13

QUESTION:

Well, I assume Congress could enact a


14

statute like that, couldn't it, for Federal officers? 


15

Couldn't Congress prescribe that whenever Federal drug


16

agents enter a bus, they -- and to conduct a -- a search,


17

they shall make such a statement?


18

MR. THOMPSON:

19

QUESTION:

I -- I don't know --


You would have no problem with


20

Congress doing that, would you? 


21

MR. THOMPSON:

22

Honor, here that --


23

QUESTION:

I would -- I would say, Your


It might.

It might be bad policy. 


24

And my question was are there policy objections to -- I'm


25

not saying what the constitutional rule is.

I understand


20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those arguments.

2

find out if that would cause a practical problem or not.


3

I'm just, for my own benefit, trying to


MR. THOMPSON:

I can think of three reasons. 


4

Your Honor, this Court has consistently held that we --


5

you do not want to saddle law enforcement officers with


6

some kind of bright line test in Fourth Amendment cases. 


7

That's very important here when I would submit that


8

Bostick is an appropriate vehicle to determine the


9

validity of consent.


10

In these particular cases, it's -- it's very


11

difficult.

12

developing situation, and warnings would not be --


13

You have an unstructured, rapidly evolving and


QUESTION:

And one of the difficulties with --


14

with a warning is, you know, Miranda was supposed to be a


15

bright line test where, you know, we didn't have to argue


16

about anything.

17

deciding whether somebody introduced -- was interrogating


18

and that sort of thing.

19

requirement like that, it's just another layer of


20

litigation. 


21

Well, we had at least 60 or 70 cases here


MR. THOMPSON:

So, if you have some sort of a


Absolutely, Your Honor, and I


22

would direct the Court's attention to a case that was


23

cited in the Government's brief, United States v.


24

Stephens, where there was some appropriate warning, and


25

the court -- the Ninth Circuit in that particular case

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said that the warning confused the passengers, intimidated


2

the passengers.

3

But --


QUESTION:

Well, I assume the other policy


4

objection is, the underlying premise of Justice Breyer's


5

suggestion is the Government has some obligation to teach


6

everybody about their rights.

7

sweeping proposition. 


8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

QUESTION:

10

And that's a -- that's a


I would agree. 


Especially when it's not required by


the Constitution. 


11

MR. THOMPSON:

12

QUESTION:

I would agree, Justice --


May I ask you what significance, if


13

any -- I don't know if it's significant or not -- do you


14

attach to the fact that, as I understand it from the court


15

of appeals opinion, that this officer had made similar


16

requests several hundred times and only five or six people


17

had ever said no?

Is that relevant at all? 


18

MR. THOMPSON:

19

Some people did say no.

20

QUESTION:

It is not relevant, Your Honor. 

Most people --


You don't think that suggests that


21

perhaps most people thought they had an obligation to


22

answer? 


23

MR. THOMPSON:

Well, Your Honor, as this Court


24

-- as this Court held in Delgado, simply because most


25

citizens cooperate and most citizens agree with the

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

officer's request, that's no indication that the consent


2

at issue is involuntary.

4

If there are no further questions, I would like

to reserve the remainder of my time. 


5

QUESTION:

6

Ms. Spivey, we'll hear from you.


7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GWENDOLYN SPIVEY


8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS


9
10

Very well, Mr. Thompson.


MS. SPIVEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


11

This Court should reaffirm Bostick in its


12

entirety.

We are not arguing that advice should be


13

required.

Rather, we think that Bostick got it entirely


14

right with the language that advice is a factor


15

particularly worth noting.

16

would ask the Court to remand to the court of appeals, as


17

it did in Bostick, so that it can reconsider. 


18

If Bostick is revised, we


I believe the key to this test -- and I don't


19

mean to sound presumptuous.

20

I think the key is that the Eleventh Circuit really was


21

trying to give voice to the seizure or -- and the consent


22

test, as set out in Bostick.

23

Court wrote -- it focused on what the police conduct --


24

conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person.


25

Having thought long and hard,


In Bostick at U.S. 437, the


And in Washington at 1357 and Guapi at 1395,

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what the Eleventh Circuit focused on -- it said, it is


2

enough that the circumstances themselves would indicate


3

that the search can proceed only if consent is given.

4

I believe that the Eleventh Circuit parallels Bostick's


5

use of the word -- that focused on what does it


6

communicate with their use of the word indicate.

7

indicate necessarily refers back to -- it expressly refers


8

back to the circumstances, which is the totality. 


9

So,


And


And while courts tend to focus most commonly on


10

whether or not advice was given or not given, I think


11

there are any number of acts or omissions that focus on


12

the police conduct --


13

QUESTION:

That -- that I think is true, but


14

could -- if their point is that if -- if you were to take


15

your case, this case before us, and say under the present


16

law and the test that you're enunciating, that you do have


17

to tell the passengers what I suggested earlier -- tell


18

them they don't have to answer or respond -- well, then


19

you'd have to in every case.

23

thought of is that that we've all flown on airplanes and

Alderson Reporting Company

-- because actually oddly enough Bostick is about buses.

MS. SPIVEY:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir. 

And -- and there -- it's about buses.

Yes, sir. 

And the buses are stopped and

7

think of any example in those circumstances where they


8

wouldn't have to make that announcement? 


9

All right.

MS. SPIVEY:

So, what is -- can you


Yes, sir.

In a -- besides


10

referring to the specific factors here and suggesting that

14

matching, and did not do any more than a -- a flight

attendant does standing in the aisle and talking


16

that would communicate to a reasonable, innocent person

language that it's voluntary.

20

that it's voluntary.

Did they say, you know, open your coat, I want


2

to pat you down? 


3

MS. SPIVEY:

QUESTION:

They used --

Didn't they make it clear that they


5

were asking permission which suggests that the person has

the ability to deny permission?

MS. SPIVEY:

Respectfully, Justice Scalia, I

don't believe so.

they were asking for was cooperation.

QUESTION:

Wait.

And -- and that's all they

asked, and when the person said yes, they immediately

searched the bag?

Do you mind if I check it?

Does -- does that not suggest exactly

what you want them to suggest, that the person has the

ability to withhold that consent?


16

MS. SPIVEY:

No, Justice Scalia.

In Schneckloth


17

at U.S. 229, this Court referred to the, quote, subtly

question, do you mind if I inspect it?

MS. SPIVEY:

Because I think no matter how a

reasonable, innocent person answers it, Mr. Chief Justice,


25

the police can construe it as consent.

But -- well, is there any doubt that


this person answered it in a way that indicated consent?

MS. SPIVEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, I believe there

is doubt because I believe -- not as to the bag, but as to

the question, do you mind if I check your person.

believe there's definitely doubt because of the indirect

question and also because of his --

you mind if I check your person? 

MS. SPIVEY:

23

MS. SPIVEY:

around that? 

MS. SPIVEY:

Well, Justice Breyer, the district


3

court applied the wrong test.

4

leave test.

5

and that's specifically what this Court rejected in


6

Bostick the Florida Supreme Court had done. 


7

It applied the free-to-


That -- that's at the joint appendix at 132,


He also -- I disagree with the Government's

representation that he said that Mr. Drayton was clear or

unambiguous.

11

He did not address -- he did not make any


factual findings as to the actual encounter.
QUESTION:

And --


The freedom-to-leave test actually is


12

-- is more beneficial for your client.

13

you're not free to leave the bus.

14

mean, that's -- that's what we said in Bostick.

15

seems to me that the district court applied a higher


16

standard than -- than was necessary and still found

voluntary search.


18

MS. SPIVEY:

Everybody knows


You'll miss the bus. 
 I
So, it


Well, Justice Kennedy, from my


19

perspective, the important point is that he applied the

wrong test, the test this Court has rejected. 


21

And also, he made two other legal --


22

QUESTION:

Do you want us to reverse because

there was a test that's too favorable to your client?

1

objection with the Bostick test, either the test for


2

seizure at U.S. 437 or the test for consent at U.S. 438. 


3

I think that the court of appeals then applied the correct


4

test and overturned the -- the legal conclusion which the


5

district court reached. 


6

The district court said that -- he made a global


7

conclusion.

He said, quote, their consent leads me to


8

believe there was no violation.

9

all respect, is a tautology.

Well, I think that, with


Just because they consent,


10

it doesn't mean there's no violation.

11

he said --


12

QUESTION:

And I think that --


Surely he meant their consent in


13

those circumstances.

Didn't he recite in the opinion all


14

of the circumstances involved? 


15

MS. SPIVEY:

16

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor. 

Don't you think it's a little unfair


17

to -- to read that after -- after he describes the whole


18

situation as simply saying, well, since they consented, it


19

must be okay? 


20

MS. SPIVEY:

21

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia --

I mean, you can say, you know, I'm


22

going to torture you if you don't let me look at it. 


23

Okay, okay, okay, look at it. 


24

(Laughter.) 


25

QUESTION:

Surely nobody is going to say his

30

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

consent shows that it was voluntary. 


2

MS. SPIVEY:

No, Justice Scalia, I don't agree


3

with the first part of the question because the district


4

court made no findings whatsoever regarding the specifics


5

of the actual encounter or exchange between the -- the


6

defendants and the -- or the police officers and


7

individual passengers. 


8
9

QUESTION:

ask for findings that were that detailed? 


10
11

Did you ask for findings -- did you


MS. SPIVEY:

The trial -- neither trial counsel


for the Government nor the defense did, Your Honor. 


12

But the district court then said there's nothing


13

coercive about this encounter, and I believe that's an


14

ultimate legal conclusion which, when the court of appeals


15

applied the correct test from Bostick, reached the correct


16

result.


17

QUESTION:

As far as Drayton is concerned,


18

there's nothing in the record other than that he lifted


19

his hands from his lap.

20

words, and so his consent rides on that gesture and what


21

it meant.


22

MS. SPIVEY:

Is there -- he didn't utter any


Yes.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that


23

is correct.

And I think it's clear under Schneckloth and


24

Bumper that mere acquiescence -- and that was -- is not


25

sufficient.

And that's why I was saying I think that the

31

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

police conduct can be either acts or -- and/or omissions. 


2

And I think the omission here or the act here was simply


3

not waiting on an answer.


4

QUESTION:

Excuse me.

When -- when you're asked


5

a question, do you mind if I conduct a pat-down, and you


6

raise up your arms like that, what -- what does that


7

naturally convey?


8
9

MS. SPIVEY:

I think that's a classic example,


Your Honor -- after you've just watched the other


10

passenger arrested and hauled across the top of you,


11

that's a classic example of mere acquiescence to a show of


12

authority. 


13

QUESTION:

Mere acquiescence.

That's apparently the opposite --

Of course.

The right to say,

13

MS. SPIVEY:

But that's not ignoring them, Your

QUESTION:

MS. SPIVEY:

I don't think --

That -- that doesn't make sense.

I don't think a reasonable,


5

innocent person would take what happened to -- to a


6

passenger sitting next to him as anything but a classic


7

example of a show of authority. 


8

In -- in response to your question, Justice


9

Kennedy, to the Government earlier, I think that putting


10

the burden on the citizen shifts the -- the burden is on


11

the Government in every case to prove that the encounter


12

is consensual and that any consent given is voluntary and


13

is uncoerced.

14

And I think --


QUESTION:

The question is whether or not the


15

Government also has the burden to educate citizens as to


16

their rights in every encounter, whether or not there


17

isn't some obligation on the part of the citizen to know


18

and to exercise his rights or her rights. 


19

MS. SPIVEY:

Justice Kennedy, I believe that


20

that ignores the demographic realities of the reasonable


21

bus passenger.

22

most bus passengers are economically disadvantaged, and


23

they don't know who their Congressman is or the Governor.

QUESTION:

So, you want people to travel on

buses where people might have weapons and drugs and can't

4

You think that's better for passengers.


MS. SPIVEY:

Certainly not, Your Honor.

Certainly not, but I think there is a limit to the

of ferreting out ordinary criminal wrongdoing.

Okay, but they're sitting next to

they're all -- they're both wearing heavy, baggy clothes.


14

I'm not sure that -- that the major result of

been to give the police probable cause anyway to -- to

My view is that in a case like

this, which is at the margins, where a court of appeals

looks at it and feels that it's so coercive that there are

various acts or omissions that the police can do to

Government that, well, because this -- this factor didn't

weigh heavily, we shouldn't even look at it.

But the other was that it recognized the

importance of a court of appeals in a totality test,

other than preclusion in a particular case?

MS. SPIVEY:

It's considered persuasive


authority but not binding authority.

But my point was simply that if they had -- if


6

they had a de facto per se rule, then it would be outcome

-- the presence or absence of rights would be outcome --

outcome-determinative in every case.

cases, which were on-bus searches, there was either no

11

these unpublished opinions are very hard to get, but the


12

Government gave me an incentive to find them.


13

QUESTION:

And of course,

about the fact that they didn't announce that everybody on

4

It -- it seems to me this world you're creating

for us is -- is not strong for the Constitution.

to me a strong world is when officers respect people's

and assert their rights.

MS. SPIVEY:

QUESTION:

It seems


I don't want to be searched.


Well, Justice Kennedy --

I don't want to be searched.

Leave


me alone. 


12

MS. SPIVEY:

I agree that would be an ideal


13

world if all our citizens took civics or took law and knew


14

their rights, but I don't believe they do. 


15

And I think the fact that we go through the


16

factors is simply a product of the totality test.

That's


17

necessary to look at all the relevant factors in that


18

totality test.

19

point at which one -- a person can say I think it's up to


20

the court in every case, is this too coercive, does it go


21

too far? 


But I don't think there is any defining


22

I would note that in Bostick, Bostick did -- did


23

set out the seizure test at 437, the consent test at 438. 


24

The one thing it really in my mind didn't really clearly


25

focus on was the test that the Eleventh Circuit was

44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

looking at.

The question they looked at is whether the


2

circumstances here were so coercive that no reasonable


3

person could have given a consent that would have been


4

determined to be voluntary.

5

court's opinion, the court of appeals opinion -- this is


6

-- excuse me -- footnote 4 at page 6a of the petition to


7

the appendix.

8

I'm sorry.

9

then used the language, quoting Bostick, but whether a


And I think that's why in the


That is why they then used the language --


I'm sorry.

It's footnote 6 at page 8a.

They


10

reasonable person would have felt free to decline the


11

officer's request. 


12

And I think that is -- was their attempt to go


13

to the element of was this -- was this a coercive


14

environment.

15

which focuses on the police conduct and what it would have


16

communicated and I -- and then the consent test, which is


17

at 438, which focuses -- under Schneckloth includes a


18

focus on the personal factors, factors personal to the


19

defendant.

20

that those factors personal to the defendant were not


21

determinative because we're looking at a little higher


22

level of analysis as to whether this environment was so


23

coercive. 


24
25

It distinguishes it from the seizure test


And I think that's why the Court here said


I do agree that in the context of your average

bus case, it's a very short encounter, very brief.
45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

The


1

testimony was that in 15 to 20 minutes, the officer could


2

engage with two to three people.

3

5 to 10 minutes per person.

4

that the factors relating to seizure and the factors


5

relating to the -- the consent tend to be conflated, and


6

so it is sometimes sort of hard to sort out.

7

the factors will apply to both of those tests.


8
9

QUESTION:

So, you're looking maybe


And I think that the test --


And a lot of


Why -- why is it that the most


immediate expression of the police officers does not

counteract whatever other indications of compulsion might


11

exist under the circumstances?

13

spread your legs, I'm going to pat you down, you're under


14

compulsion.

search your person, you know, I don't care what other --


16

there's a policeman in the front of the bus.

17

He -- he has made it very clear that he's asking for your


18

permission.

19

you mind if I search your person?

I mean, if the policeman

What -- what more need he do than that?

MS. SPIVEY:

Do


I believe, Justice Scalia, if the


21

Court ruled that, it would be a bright line test as


22

opposed to a totality test.

23

when one applies a reasonable person -- reasonable,


24

innocent person test, one of necessity puts themselves in


25

the seat of that bus passenger.

And I think one has to --


How do they feel?

Alderson Reporting Company

And


1

that's why, Justice Breyer, I tried to give the -- the


2

little example of the airplane because --


3

QUESTION:

My problem, of course, is I think if


4

you go with an all-facts test, you've got to go with the


5

district court.

6

didn't.

7

there's something inherently coercive about the bus


8

environment that suggests a -- a need for a warning.

9

you don't agree with that and -- and therefore I'm sort of


10
11

stuck.

He saw it and the court of appeals


And that's why I've been wondering if maybe


But


And there we are. 

QUESTION:

Why -- why don't you agree with that? 


12

I mean, it seemed that was almost the question that I -- I


13

asked when -- when you were responding to Justice Stevens


14

and you said, well, ultimately sure, anybody who gets


15

these warnings, with a teaspoonful of brains, is going to


16

say no, I -- I'm not going to let you search. 


17

And -- and it seemed to me that maybe the -- the


18

answer to the problem is there are some situations in


19

which if you don't give the warning, it does get to the


20

point of -- or is virtually a -- a coercive situation per


21

se, and it may be that there's no easy answer in those


22

circumstances. 


23

If you don't let them know that they have a


24

right to refuse, there's inherent coercion.

If you do let


25

them know, most people are going to say, no, you can't

as inherently coercive.

MS. SPIVEY:

You -- you don't regard it


And I -- I guess I'm not sure why

Why isn't it? 

Justice Souter, personally yes, I

do agree with you.
