 (11:04 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

next this morning in Case 13435, Omnicare, Incorporated 

5

v. the Laborers District Council Construction Industry 

6

Pension Fund. 

7

 Mr. Shanmugam.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON SHANMUGAM 

9
10
11
12

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 Like other provisions of the Federal 

13

Securities laws, Section 11 of the Securities Act 

14

imposes liability only for untrue or misleading 

15

statements of material fact.  The only fact conveyed by 

16

a statement of opinion or belief is the fact that the 

17

speaker held the stated belief. 

18

 As this Court concluded in Virginia 

19

Bankshares v. Sandberg, a statement of opinion or belief 

20

can, therefore, be actionable only if the speaker did 

21

not actually hold the stated belief. 

22

 In the decision under review, the Sixth 

23

Circuit, alone among the courts of appeals, concluded 

24

that this Court's reasoning in Virginia Bankshares did 

25

not apply to a claim under Section 11, even though

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Section 11 contains a materially identical falsity 

2

requirement to the provision at issue there.  Neither 

3

the Sixth Circuit's interpretation, nor those of 

4

Respondents or the government, can be reconciled either 

5

with the plain language of Section 11 or with this 

6

Court's decision in Virginia Bankshares. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if I say or the 

8

company says in a prospectus, we believe that we have 

9

3.5 million units of inventory in our secret inventory 

10

warehouse, so long as they say we believe, they can't 

11

you know, it turns out they have none, that's all right? 

12

They're still protected? 

13

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I think that that would 

14

probably be a statement of opinion, but it is much 

15

closer to the line between statements of opinion and 

16

statements of fact.  Let me explain 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Really, you think 

18

it's an open question if they say it's a very precise 

19

number for something that only they know anything about, 

20

and it's wildly off, you think they're protected or may 

21

be simply by saying "We believe"? 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I  I think that 

23

the reason why I think it's a close question as to 

24

whether or not that would be a statement of opinion is 

25

simply because the second restatement's definition of

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what constitutes a statement of opinion, which we think 

2

is a useful guide, includes not just statements on 

3

matters of judgment, like the statements we have at 

4

issue here, but also statements that express uncertainty 

5

about factual matters. 

6

 And I think in your hypothetical, Mr. Chief 

7

Justice, you can view that statement as being the 

8

equivalent of a factual statement that along the lines 

9

of, we have approximately 3 million units or widgets in 

10

our inventory, such that if they had nowhere near that, 

11

that statement would be an objectively false statement 

12

of fact and, therefore, actionable. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But suppose it is actually 

14

disputed, an expert  expert  a museum expert on an 

15

archaeological mission says, it is my opinion that those 

16

bones in that mountain are of a diplodocus and not a 

17

Trisopterus.  Now, wouldn't you have thought that at 

18

least he'd looked into it, that at least he'd seen the 

19

bones?  You see, it's absolutely open, it is a matter of 

20

opinion, but there's some things implied. 

21

 If you had learned later he'd been in a bar 

22

all night and had never even seen or heard one word 

23

about what the bones were like, wouldn't you think he 

24

had issued a misrepresentation? 

25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So, Justice Breyer, first,

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that would be clearly a statement of opinion 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

4

on a matter of judgment. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

6

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yes. 
 because it's a statement 

Yes. 
Our view is that where the 

7

speaker does not say anything about the basis for its 

8

opinion, the only fact that is being conveyed is the 

9

fact of the speaker's belief.  The plaintiff 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  And I just produced 

11

an example because I knew that was your view, and what I 

12

looked for was an example where your view doesn't seem 

13

quite so reasonable.  And  and that was why I said it 

14

doesn't seem reasonable there because I think any 

15

listener would think that the archaeologist had not been 

16

spending all night in the bar, but, rather, had at least 

17

looked at the bones or done some basic examination. 

18

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And so what I would 
And that's  now, that's 

20

the point I want you to address yourself to, why is that 

21

statement I just made wrong? 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

24
25

Sure. 
It is my opinion it is 

right. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So notwithstanding  so

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

notwithstanding the fact that it in our view, Justice 

2

Breyer, there is no implied statement of fact there. 

3

There may nevertheless be a claim, and that is for the 

4

simple 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There is an implied 

6

statement, I think.  The implied statement is that he's 

7

done some work to figure this out. 

8
9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well  and I think that we 

may end up ultimately getting to the same place because 

10

let me explain how we think the analysis would work in 

11

that situation. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yeah. 
In a situation like that, we 

14

believe that the ultimate legal inquiry is whether the 

15

speaker did not possess the stated belief.  But a 

16

plaintiff would be able to come forward with 

17

allegations, in your hypothetical, that the 

18

archaeologist spent the evening in the bar, that the 

19

archaeologist had no basis for his or her opinion, and 

20

in that circumstance, that would be circumstantial 

21

evidence that the speaker, in fact, did not possess the 

22

stated belief that the bones were those of a diplodocus. 

23

And so 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So you're saying that 

this evidence, what we're  we're talking about, the

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidence that the speaker didn't believe what he said, 

2

that could be proved by showing he made no investigation 

3

at all. 

4

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes.  That is 
So  so you're saying 

6

that the  whether there was any investigation or 

7

whether it was reasonable will factor into whether the 

8

belief was honestly held. 

9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

10
11

Yes, that is correct. 

And 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But why  and we're 

12

dealing with a registration statement.  Why isn't it, as 

13

Justice Breyer suggested, implicit that when somebody 

14

when an issuer puts something in a registration 

15

statement, that the issuer has acted with diligence in 

16

making that statement? 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, we don't believe that 

18

there is any necessary implication from the statement, 

19

and we think that that is true regardless of whether or 

20

not it appears in a registration statement because, 

21

after all, in Section 11, while Congress certainly 

22

imposed a heightened obligation on issuers and did so by 

23

relaxing other elements of liability, Congress included 

24

exactly the same falsity element as it did in a variety 

25

of other provisions of the Federal securities law 

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

laws. 

2

 But, again, our view is that for purposes of 

3

pleading a claim, a plaintiff is not restricted to 

4

smoking gun evidence that the speaker did not possess 

5

the stated belief.  And so, again, if a plaintiff is 

6

able to come forward with allegations that cross the 

7

pleading threshold of plausibility to suggest that the 

8

speaker, in fact, did not hold the stated belief, that 

9

will, in fact, be sufficient. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that may be true, but 

11

do you deny the fact that there can be situations in 

12

which a person makes a  makes a statement of belief 

13

and believes that to be true, but lacks a reasonable 

14

basis for stating the belief?  There is a difference 

15

between those two situations, isn't there? 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I think there is a 

17

difference between those two situations, and I think 

18

this illustrates an important conceptual distinction.  I 

19

think in a case where a speaker has no basis whatsoever 

20

for the stated belief, there will be comparatively few 

21

cases  and I'm certainly not aware of any case from 

22

the reported cases in this area  where the speaker 

23

held the stated belief but lacked any basis for it 

24

whatsoever. 

25

 However, I think that the government's

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable basis standard, the position of the Solicitor 

2

General here, suggests, I think, something more.  And, 

3

quite frankly, it's not entirely clear how much more 

4

that position would require.  It seems to focus on how 

5

the speaker actually arrived at its opinion, and that 

6

suggests that the focus may be on the diligence that the 

7

speaker conducts. 

8

 But our view is that once you start getting 

9

into a lack of a reasonable belief, you're really 

10

getting into a matter of opinion.  And I really do think 

11

that however the government's test operates in 

12

practice  and, again, I think the government's brief 

13

provides 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What's wrong with that? 

15

There's an assumption that there's something wrong with 

16

that.  But if what one wants is honesty in  in 

17

securities statements of any kind, wouldn't one want 

18

boards, issuers, others to have some sort of reasonable 

19

basis  I'm borrowing the government's words  before 

20

it goes about making predictive  even predictive 

21

statements? 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So two points in response to 

23

that, Justice Sotomayor.  First of all, at the risk of 

24

being glib, we simply don't think that that is the 

25

statute that Congress enacted.  And certainly, if

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress had wanted to impose an obligation on issuers 

2

of essentially providing an implied warranty for any 

3

statement of opinion that issuers make in their 

4

registration statements, it could have done so, and 

5

there are other statutes that impose liability where 

6

there is an absence of a reasonable basis. 

7

 Let me explain why it's problematic as a 

8

matter of policy.  We believe that a reasonable basis 

9

standard, that is to say, a standard that goes further 

10

than the standard that I think Justice Breyer was 

11

suggesting, that goes beyond simply saying that you have 

12

to have some basis, but that looks at the reasonableness 

13

of the basis, opens up issuers to afterthefact second 

14

guessing on matters of judgment. 

15
16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
factual basis? 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19
20

Well, what about saying a 

I'm sorry? 
Factual basis.  There has 

to be a factual basis for making 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, again, I think there's 

21

a meaningful difference.  And I think in your 

22

hypothetical 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  I mean why 

24

wouldn't that work as the standard?  You're worried 

25

about the standard reasonableness is too open to

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

speculation.  Okay.  What about just saying there has to 

2

be a factual basis for it? 

3

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, as a practical matter, 

4

I think that where you have no factual basis whatsoever 

5

and where a plaintiff is able to so allege, that will be 

6

sufficient to allow the plaintiff to go forward even 

7

under our legal standard. 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The person did have the 

9

opinion about the diplodocus, it was his opinion.  He's 

10

an archaeologist.  He, you know, looks around, sees the 

11

sky, the mountains.  There's some basis.  People all the 

12

time say it's my opinion.  Really, they haven't looked 

13

into it and so forth. 

14

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16
17

And as I 
A registration statement, 

you ought to have looked into it. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

And as I indicated earlier, 

18

Justice Breyer, I'm really not aware of any cases that 

19

involve that precise fact pattern.  And 

20
21
22
23
24
25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm sure there are none 

involving the diplodocus.  But the  the 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Or any other case where the 

speaker has no factual basis for the statement. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, don't say no.  Say 

don't say no.  You  you leave it up to the judge or

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the  depending on the factfinder to say, is there a 

2

factual basis?  And just his opinion is something that 

3

depends on context, whether something is an opinion.  So 

4

factual basis in support will have, to some extent, 

5

depend on context. 

6

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

And as a practical matter, 

7

Justice Breyer, I really do think that our legal 

8

standard takes care of that situation because in a 

9

situation where the plaintiff is able to make that 

10

allegation  and I would note parenthetically that the 

11

plaintiffs certainly haven't made that allegation 

12

here  it would likely be sufficient to surmount the 

13

pleading for 

14
15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Shanmugam, 

suppose 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you think that 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Justice Scalia. 
Do you think there's a 

19

difference between a factual basis and a reasonable 

20

factual basis?  I mean, if we adopted a factual basis rule, 

21

would we accept an unreasonable factual basis? 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I think that really 

23

depends on what the reasonable basis stated in the 

24

standard actually means. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, I think it's 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

it's just the same rule in  in disguise really. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I think that in the 

3

context of legal compliance, if statements of the sort 

4

that we have at issue here, I think that  that that 

5

context in many ways illustrates the potential 

6

difference. 

7

 So suppose you had an issuer who had two 

8

separate legal opinions, one suggesting that a 

9

particular practice was legal and the other one was not. 

10

Certainly there, I think you would say that the issuer 

11

has at least some basis, but it may be open to 

12

afterthefact determination as to whether or not that 

13

was a reasonable basis in light of the fact that there 

14

was a competing opinion. 

15
16
17

 Again, it's entirely unclear exactly what 
that standard means, I think, in part because it's a novel standard. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think Justice Scalia is 

18

right there, and there would be something like that, 

19

but  and so your point is a  is a good point, that 

20

it isn't so easy to figure this out exactly what the 

21

standard is.  The alternative, of course, is to issue 

22

registration statements that have statements in them of 

23

opinion, very detailed, very factbased, and where 

24

people would think some work was being done, and, in 

25

fact, far less work has been done than anybody would

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think was plausible, and they just float right by 

2

without attack.  Now, isn't the law designed to catch 

3

those things? 

4

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I would say this, 

5

Justice Breyer.  I mean, again, the statute itself does 

6

not contain any reasonable basis requirement, and 

7

nothing in this Court's decision in Virginia Bankshares, 

8

in our view, suggests such a requirement.  So we really 

9

don't think that there is any support 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

How do you say that about 

11

Bankshares, which contains the statement that the 

12

Government refers to; conclusory opinions in a 

13

commercial context are reasonably understood to rest on 

14

a factual basis that justifies them as accurate. 

15

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yes.  And, Justice Ginsburg, 

16

that's a statement at page 1093 of the Court's opinion 

17

in Virginia Bankshares, and we think that in context 

18

that statement stands for the proposition that I've been 

19

articulating this morning, namely that where a speaker 

20

makes a statement of opinion and has no basis for that 

21

statement, that may be relevant in showing disbelief. 

22

That may be relevant in showing what the Court went on 

23

to say was legally required, namely both subjective 

24

disbelief and objective falsity. 

25

 And before the Sixth Circuit's opinion in

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this case, that was the consistent understanding of 

2

lower courts in construing this Court's opinion in 

3

Virginia Bankshares, and so we certainly think that 

4

Virginia Bankshares does not stand for the proposition 

5

that an issuer  whenever an issuer makes a statement 

6

of opinion, somehow includes in that statement an 

7

implied warranty that the speaker has a reasonable basis 

8

for that statement. 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If we adopt your position, 

10

which I take it to be that lack of reasonable basis 

11

for a statement can be evidence that the belief was not 

12

sincerely held, in this case do we still have to remand 

13

or did I understand you to say that the plaintiffs below 

14

did not specifically allege that there was no reasonable 

15

basis at all for the statement? 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So two things.  Two things 

17

on that point, Justice Kennedy.  If you adopt our view 

18

that the legal standard here turns on subjective 

19

disbelief, which again we believe was the holding of 

20

this Court in Virginia Bankshares, then the plaintiffs 

21

here are foreclosed because the plaintiffs disclaimed 

22

any allegation based on a state of mind, which is to say 

23

that the plaintiffs in this case, in an effort to 

24

exclude  to avoid being subject to the heightened 

25

pleading standard of Rule 9(b) 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Shanmugam, I thought 

2

that the complaint alleged that the defendants had no 

3

that no defendant had a reasonable ground to believe 

4

that Omnicare's arrangements were lawful. 

5

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yes, and that was going to 

6

be my second point, Justice Ginsburg.  So just to be 

7

clear, there are two paragraphs of the complaint that we 

8

think are relevant here.  The first is Paragraph 178, 

9

which is the paragraph in which the plaintiffs 

10

disclaimed any allegation relying on fraud or 

11

intentional misconduct.  And we think that under our 

12

legal standard that forecloses plaintiffs in this case 

13

from going forward.  I would note that plaintiffs don't 

14

really dispute that under our legal standard their claim 

15

is foreclosed.  They make no effort in their brief to 

16

suggest that their claim could nevertheless go forward. 

17

 Now, if this Court were to adopt the 

18

Solicitor General's legal standard and to say that the 

19

legal standard here is whether or not there was a 

20

reasonable basis for the opinion, this Court would 

21

obviously have to vacate and remand because that was not 

22

the legal standard that the Sixth Circuit applied.  We 

23

think that we would have a very strong argument on 

24

remand that we should, nevertheless, prevail because the 

25

plaintiffs in this case have pointed only to the

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conclusory allegation that you identified, 

2

Justice Ginsburg, and that is the allegation in 

3

Paragraph 183 that says that none of the defendants had 

4

a reasonable ground to believe in the statements in the 

5

registration statement. 

6

 If the inquiry in this case focuses on how 

7

the speaker arrived at its opinion, this complaint is 

8

really threadbare in terms of allegations that relate to

that issue, and so we've  but that would be an issue 

10
11

for the Sixth Circuit on remand. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If the test is subjective as 

12

you claim, with respect to the issuer, whose subjective 

13

state of mind should  must the Court look at?  Would 

14

it be solely the person who signs on behalf of the 

15

issuer, or would it be everyone else who is required by 

16

law to sign the registration statement? 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So I think that the inquiry 

18

would be much the same as the inquiry with regard to 

19

claims that have a scienter requirement, such as claims 

20

under Section 10(b).  I would note that there is a 

21

little bit of disagreement in the lower courts about how 

22

broad the category of individuals at an issuer is, whose 

23

state of mind is relevant, but the inquiry generally 

24

focuses on those who either made or approved the 

25

statement at issue.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Shanmugam, suppose that 

2

in a particular registration statement there was a 

3

statement that said a particular kind of transaction was 

4

lawful, all right, and the person who makes that 

5

statement, whoever it is, really believes it.  But, in 

6

fact, that person knows that the Government is breathing 

7

down his neck, that the Government seems to have a 

8

different view.  That person knows that its competitors 

9

have a different view.  And that person has also 

10

consulted three lawyers, and two of them have given a 

11

different view.  But he still believes what he believes. 

12

He believes that the Supreme Court is going to vindicate 

13

his legal position. 

14

 But the only thing he says is, I think this 

15

is lawful.  Now, why isn't that something where there is 

16

an omission that makes the statements misleading? 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So we don't think that there 

18

is an omission under that circumstance because we think 

19

that the only fact that is being disclosed by the 

20

statement is the fact of the speaker's belief, and if 

21

you look at the relevant language on which respondents 

22

and the Government really focus, it is that language 

23

concerning omissions.  It's not the language concerning 

24

falsity.  And that language focuses time and time again 

25

on the fact at issue.  So it refers to omissions,

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

omission to state a material fact.  And so what is 

2

omitted has to be a fact necessary to make the 

3

statements therein, and I think that's a reference back 

4

to statements of material fact 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it just says 

6

statements therein.  It doesn't actually say statements 

7

of material fact or not. 

8

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

9

I think that's most 

naturally a reference back to the language a couple 

10

volumes earlier about statements of material fact, and I 

11

think this all just underscores the fact that Congress 

12

in this provision did not impose a broad affirmative 

13

duty to speak, nor did it impose liability on untrue or 

14

misleading statements. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it didn't  it didn't 

16

impose an obligation to speak, but once you speak, it 

17

said that you're  that you can't make omissions that 

18

make your speech  your statements misleading.  And I 

19

guess what I'm saying is, you know, what I've given you 

20

is a case where this is a judgment call, whether you 

21

think something is legal or not. 

22

 But what you know  and after all you're in 

23

the position to know and all your readers are not in a 

24

position to know.  What you know is that the Government 

25

seems to disagree, that your competitors seem to

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disagree, and that most of the lawyers seem to disagree. 

2

And still you're going to put this in your statement and 

3

say, oh, no problem, that's not misleading. 

4

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, in your hypothetical, 

5

Justice Kagan, you know, I think  there are two points 

6

I would make about it.  The first is that, again, the 

7

fact that is being conveyed is the fact of the 

8

speaker's belief, and that is what makes the statement 

9

material, which is to say that when you have statements 

10

of opinion in a registration statement, the reason that 

11

they are material is precisely because it is 

12

management's view on a particular question. 

13

 And so when you have a statement of that 

14

variety, that is the fact that has to be shown to be 

15

either false or misleading.  Obviously if the speaker 

16

does not possess the stated opinion, the statement is 

17

false.  But we don't believe 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But don't you think a 

19

reasonable reader would look at that statement and say 

20

two things actually:  Both, he's done something to try 

21

to check as to whether the transaction is legal, and he 

22

doesn't know anything that's very dispositive going the 

23

other way.  And both of those things, I mean, could be 

24

false. 

25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I think where a speaker says

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nothing about the basis for the opinion, there are 

2

obviously a spectrum of potential bases for the opinion 

3

that the speaker could have, and so, again, we don't 

4

think that there is any necessary implication about the 

5

scope of the basis for the opinion. 

6

 Now, again, if it's a case where the speaker 

7

truly has no basis for the opinion, we believe it will 

8

be quite possible for a plaintiff to include all 

9

these underlying allegations about the basis as a way of 

10
11

showing subjective disbelief. 
 And so what that really leaves you with, we 

12

would respectfully submit, is the hypothetical situation 

13

in which a speaker in the face of overwhelming contrary 

14

evidence and no basis nevertheless adheres to a genuine 

15

belief, and the question of whether or not liability 

16

should lie in those circumstances. 

17

 And our view is simply that it is not worth 

18

the candle to frame the legal standard in a way as to 

19

cover that entirely hypothetical situation. 

20

 And in part, to get back to 

21

Justice Sotomayor's question from the beginning of the 

22

argument, that is because it is important to underscore 

23

the fact that this is a statute that imposes strict 

24

liability.  And as this Court explained in Pinter versus 

25

Dahl, when it comes to statutes that impose strict

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

liability, issuers really need to have certainty and 

2

predictability. 

3

 And a legal standard that focuses on 

4

reasonable basis is going to open up issuers to 

5

afterthefact secondguessing by jurors about whether 

6

or not a particular basis is reasonable. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I don't think, 

8

Mr. Shanmugam, that the fact that the statue has  is a 

9

strict liability statute might cut the other way.  Why 

10

is it a strict liability statute?  Because Congress had 

11

some understanding, number one, that it was the issuer 

12

who knows the facts, not the readers; and number two, 

13

that it is awfully hard to show subjective intent. 

14

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, Congress dealt with 

15

the context of registration statements precisely by 

16

relaxing the other elements of liability that of course 

17

exist under other provisions of the securities laws. 

18

And what that leaves us with is a statute where this 

19

falsity element is really the entire ball game because 

20

elements such as reliance and loss causation are no 

21

longer affirmative elements of liability. 

22

 And, of course, what that means is not only 

23

that it is easier for plaintiffs ultimately to prove 

24

liability but that it is also easier for plaintiffs to plead 

25

a claim under this provision.  And I do think that a

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable basis standard, depending on how that 

2

standard is framed, could make it very difficult for 

3

issuers to avoid liability at the pleading stage. 

4

 And as, of course, this Court has recognized 

5

in the securities context, obtaining resolution of these 

6

claims on a dispositive motion is often, as a practical 

7

matter, the only way in which defendants can avoid 

8

liability because of the pressures of settlement in 

9

cases of this variety. 

10
11

 Unless the Court has any further questions, 
I'll reserve the balance of my time. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Goldstein.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

16

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

17

it please the Court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

18

 The difficult part of this case for the 

19

other side is that we all know that opinions, and 

20

Virginia Bankshares makes this point, frequently imply 

21

facts.  The difficult part of this case for our side 

22

and it's important for me to confront the hard part of 

23

the case  is that sometimes they're just state 

24

opinions are just statements of belief.  And what you 

25

have to figure out, I think, is, A, what is the default

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rule that you should be looking at a registration 

2

statement for; and, B, what is it that the issuer can do 

3

to make it clear, no, look, this is just our sense of 

4

the matter? 

5

 They didn't write the registration statement 

6

in a bar one night.  A registration statement is a very 

7

solemn document, and you know that from a variety of 

8

things.  The first is, as Justice Kagan points out, it is a 

9

strict liability document. 

10

 Unlike the great majority of the provisions 

11

of the securities laws, Congress said we don't have to 

12

prove scienter.  Congress said that reliance doesn't 

13

matter.  Congress said that causation is for the other 

14

side to prove.  We know that when Congress wrote that 

15

statute, it had opinions in mind because Section 11 

16

refers to opinions. 

17

 There are audit opinions, and with respect 

18

to an audit opinion, the auditor has to prove that he or 

19

she engaged in due diligence. 

20

 We know that it had forwardlooking 

21

statements in mind, which are opinions, because it said 

22

that forwardlooking statements the  that are subject 

23

to section  that are subject to the exemption, it is 

24

the plaintiff that has to prove that they actually knew 

25

that the forwardlooking statement was false.

25

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The Sixth Circuit held that 

2

once a false statement has been made, a defendant's 

3

knowledge is not relevant to a strict liability claim. 

4

Was that correct? 

5

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It is true with respect to 

6

the factual representations that are expressed or 

7

implied.  The Sixth Circuit was not confronting, I 

8

think, an important part of the case because the 

9

petitioners had not made the argument, what do we do if 

10

the opinion is hedged?  What do we do if, instead of 

11

just a representation, that  here is our opinion which 

12

carries with it the implication about a certain set of 

13

facts, we instead say, we're uncertain? 

14

 And I think that's an important issue that 

15

isn't before you, either.  But with respect  it is a 

16

strict liability statute.  If the factual 

17

representations that are expressed or implied are 

18

incorrect, then they are liable.  And the reason for 

19

that is that this is not a securities fraud 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Since that's the holding of 

21

the Sixth Circuit, don't we at a minimum have an 

22

obligation to vacate and remand?  Because they didn't 

23

hold that their reasonable basis standard was satisfied 

24

here. 

25

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Your Honor, the

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

judge  as a purely technical matter, I think that's 

2

not correct.  We don't  I don't particularly care what 

3

the last word in your opinion is.  What the Sixth 

4

Circuit did is it remanded to the district court.  If 

5

you refine the rule for applying the  for applying 

6

Section 11, I think what you do is affirm and correct 

7

what you regard as the misapprehension of the Sixth 

8

Circuit's rule. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But assuming they're wrong 

10

about this, they said the Section 11 does not require a 

11

plaintiff to plead a defendant's state of mind, and a 

12

statement of opinion is actionable when it is ultimately 

13

found to be false. 

14

 Now, that, I don't think, is what you are 

15

arguing, what the SG is arguing.  The point is that the 

16

statement, it is my opinion that the warehouse will hold 

17

up in a 93mileanhour wind for 17 hours as long as the 

18

windows are closed.  And that statement may be false, 

19

but it may also be true that the issuer before issuing 

20

the statement performed a variety of tests, in which 

21

case you would agree, I think, that it is not 

22

actionable. 

23

 And so  so it isn't just that it's false, 

24

it's that there was no reasonable basis for holding it. 

25

Moreover, whether the issuer has a reasonable basis is a

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fact about the issuer's state of mind.  It isn't whether 

2

there's a reasonable basis in the world.  It is about 

3

whether those people who issued this statement had a 

4

reasonable basis for issuing it or not.  I think that's 

5

about their state of mind in a sense.  But those two 

6

things, I think, do require reversal. 

7

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, Your Honor, first of 

8

all, you have described what the Government has 

9

articulated as the rule, and that is the reasonable 

10

basis standard.  We endorse that test.  We have a still 

11

broader argument that we would win on, even if you 

12

that we would win the case even if you disagreed with 

13

it.  And that is this is a strict liability statute. 

14

 If it turns out that the implied factual 

15

representation, or indeed the express factual 

16

representation  that is, that the building will hold 

17

up  turns out to be wrong, and the building will fall 

18

down, even though they did their very best to figure it 

19

out, this is the hard case, and that is they tried really hard to 

20

figure out about the building.  They had a structural 

21

engineer take a look at it. 

22

 On our broader reading of the statute, 

23

Section 11 changes and assigns the risk of error to 

24

them. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sorry, that doesn't 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that doesn't make much sense to me.  A statement is made 

2

truly or falsely at the time it's made. 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

Yes. 
So how can you rely on 

evidence of what happened later? 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Okay. 
We would never have 

8

closure on a securities action if we were to rely solely 

9

on the fact that the building fell down 10 years hence. 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Fair enough.  And that is 

11

that  Justice Breyer's hypothetical happened to be 

12

about what would happen in the future, and that would 

13

indicate the forwardlooking 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

No. 
Can I give you a 

16

hypothetical that I think will avoid your problem but 

17

still raises the hard case for us? 

18

 And that is we have a million dollars in 

19

inventory today on the day of the registration 

20

statement.  So the following  in our view, we have a 

21

million dollars in inventory.  It's an opinion.  It's 

22

describing what happens today.  We know under 

23

Section 11, which talks about the date the registration 

24

statement becomes effective, that if the warehouse burns 

25

down a week later, they're not responsible.

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But what about the case in which the day 

2

before the registration statement is issued, the 

3

warehouse burned down, and they had no way of knowing 

4

it?  It was in rural India.  Their very best efforts 

5

wouldn't have disclosed it.  Under Section 11, they're 

6

responsible.  What Section 11 does 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no, I don't see how 

8

that could be.  They said, in our opinion, we have X 

9

amount of inventory.  And you're starting out by saying, 

10

well, it is an opinion, but an opinion carries the 

11

implication that they would have some basis for it.  And 

12

they did have a basis for it.  In fact, they had a 

13

reasonable basis.  So how there can the plaintiff 

14

recover? 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

This is a problem that the 

16

common law confronted, and it's addressed in the 

17

restatement first of contracts and of torts in 474 of 

18

the Restatement of Contracts and in 542 of the 

19

Restatement of Torts. 

20

 And it says if you get an opinion, if your 

21

expert archaeologist or if an art appraiser says this is 

22

a Picasso, you're allowed to rely on the truth of the 

23

assertion.  The reason they say "in our opinion" is not 

24

to express doubt. 

25

 If you go back and look at the transcript

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

today, Mr. Shanmugam will have said "we believe," "we 

2

think," or "in our view" 20 times in the first 20 

3

minutes of this oral argument.  He wasn't intending to 

4

express doubt.  He was trying to say, "Look, I have 

5

looked at this problem.  Here is our view of the 

6

situation as people who are specially involved." 

7
8
9
10
11

 Sometimes opinions are intended to evoke 
certainty, not uncertainty. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  You've given me 

those times.  What about the other times? 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Okay.  And that's, I think, 

12

the point.  And that is, you have to decide which of 

13

those things is present in a registration statement. 

14

And our view is that, in a registration statement, you 

15

are dealing with a circumstance, because it's strict 

16

liability, it shifts the risk of error to the issuer 

17

because they're collecting the money for when they 

18

get 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Goldstein, can I just 

20

clarify what seems to be your point.  You do not take 

21

the reasonable factual basis.  You are saying it's the 

22

same thing as if we excised "we believe."  That you take 

23

that out, and then you have a statement of fact which is 

24

false, and then they're responsible.  So you're really 

25

saying there is no such thing as an opinion versus a

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fact, that it's just the same as if they left out "we 

2

believe." 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Two things.  The first is, 

4

we do believe in the reasonable basis standard; that is, 

5

the government has a more modest, what you could call a 

6

middle ground.  We endorse it.  We have a more expansive 

7

reading of the statute as well.  So that's point 1. 

8

 Point 2 is we do think absolutely that you 

9

can have an opinion in a registration statement that 

10

makes clear it is not something on which you should rely 

11

on for the ultimate truth.  And you could look at some 

12

of the statements 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Isn't that exactly what you 

14

have here?  Because if you look at these registration 

15

statements, you know, we have been looking at one or two 

16

sentences in a vacuum, but, in fact, if you look at the 

17

registration statements themselves, they're sort of 

18

surrounded by reasons to discount the opinion.  It says, 

19

you know, CMS, the government might think differently, 

20

and if that's so, we're really in bad shape.  It says, 

21

these laws may be interpreted in the future in a manner 

22

inconsistent with our interpretation.  I mean, it seems 

23

to me that they actually did a pretty good job of 

24

saying, look, we think this, but there are  there are 

25

some problems 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right. 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

 with this and it could go 

3
4

the other way. 
 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I think this is a really 

5

important point.  I think the critical thing is to 

6

realize that Mr. Shanmugam doesn't.  His view is, even 

7

if there are no qualifications whatsoever, it is only 

8

telling you what is in his client's head.  So that's 

9

point 1.  And they did not make this argument in the 

10

district court or the court of appeals here that you 

11

have to look at the full context of the opinion and see 

12

whether the party is actually fully hedging. 

13

 Now, point 2 is that there are statements 

14

that we are relying in our complaint that aren't like 

15

that.  If I could take you to the Joint Appendix to give 

16

you one good example, and I'll take you to page 192. 

17

And this is our allegation about therapeutic 

18

interchange.  We allege  and they settled a bunch of 

19

cases, including with the government over whether they 

20

were switching their patients' drugs in order to have an 

21

arrangement that was more profitable to them but not 

22

good for the patient.  And we allege that therapeutic 

23

interchange, as implemented by them, was illegal. 

24
25

 Here is what they said at the top of 192 : 
"When required and/or specifically requested by the

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

physician or patient, branded drugs are dispensed and 

2

generic drugs are substituted in accordance with 

3

applicable State and Federal laws as requested by the 

4

physician or resident." 

5

 So this is an instance in the registration 

6

statement where they didn't have any of that hedging. 

7

They simply said, we are acting legally.  And our point 

8

is that either of two things is implied by that.  One is 

9

that it's legal or at least that no person  or that a 

10
11

person would reasonably conclude that it's legal. 
 What we want to do on remand is the 

12

following:  We want to show the actual facts, and we 

13

want to show that a person would not reasonably conclude 

14

this activity was legal.  To the extent they have hedged 

15

in the registration statement and said, look, here's a 

16

vague law, and we know there are vague laws out there, 

17

we know there are vague regulations, and if the 

18

registration statement is read to say, look, you could 

19

read it as A, as B or C, then we're going to have to 

20

prove that the facts are inconsistent with A, B or C. 

21

 That is to say on the government's 

22

intermediate view, that the actual facts don't comport 

23

with a reasonable reading of the statutes and 

24

regulations that are involved.  Remember, that it is 

25

very hard to understand why Congress would have written

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a statute that says you're going to be strictly liable 

2

for misrepresentations, and we're going to ignore the 

3

fact that the reason you state opinions in a 

4

registration statement is precisely so that people will 

5

rely on them. 

6

 The whole point of having these in the 

7

registration statement is to persuade people about the 

8

state of the company, about the state of what it's 

9

doing, about its profitability and the like.  And if you 

10

announce a legal rule that says we're going  so long 

11

as you put the words "we believe" in front of any of 

12

those sentences, then what you're going to have is a 

13

situation in which every single time when Congress is 

14

trying to make sure that the company speaks truthfully, 

15

the plaintiff is going to be held to the burden of 

16

proving what's inside people's heads.  And I don't think 

17

that that is what you would naturally infer from a 

18

statute like this. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Could I just make sure I 

20

understand, Mr. Goldstein?  The basis of your argument 

21

in the text is not the untrue statement of material 

22

facts language, right?  Because I would take it that you 

23

agree with the government and with Mr. Shanmugam that as 

24

to that, the only untrue statement in an opinion is 

25

whether you hold it?  But the basis of your view, both

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as to agreeing with the government and also suggesting 

2

that a further view is the omissions language; is that 

3

right? 

4

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

That is not quite correct. 

5

I think that it's a very subtle difference to say, is 

6

what we're holding them liable for the implied 

7

statement, which was untrue, or the omission of the fact 

8

that makes it nonmisleading?  I'll tell you  let me 

9

give what you Virginia Bankshares said about this.  It 

10

spoke  and this is in the context of Rule 1489, which 

11

uses the same language as Section 11, and this is on 

12

page 1092. 

13

 "Such statements are factual," in two 

14

sentences, "as statements that the directors do act for 

15

the reasons given or hold the belief stated and as 

16

statements about the subject matter of the reason or 

17

belief expressed."  And in that example, the Court 

18

understood the statement, we  you know, we recommend 

19

this merger because $42 is a high price to be an implied 

20

statement about the nature of the price and whether it 

21

was high or fair. 

22

 I don't think much matters in the 

23

characterization of whether it's an implied statement 

24

or, instead, the failure to include a fact that would 

25

make it true, but that's how Virginia Bankshares looked

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

at the question.  
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, there in that case 

3

of Virginia Banks, it was a given, it was stipulated or 

4

proven already by the jury verdict that they didn't 

5

believe what they said. 

6

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

And I think that's a really 

7

important thing about Virginia Bankshares.  I think the 

8

most that my friend can try and derive from Virginia 

9

Bankshares is under that under Section 1489, the Court 

10

said you can hold someone liable if you have both 

11

subjective and objective disbelief. 

12

 What they're trying to do is to say that 

13

that is not just sufficient, but necessary.  And that 

14

is, that you  Virginia Bankshares stands for the 

15

proposition that you have to prove subjective disbelief. 

16

 And let me just point you to the language of 

17

the Court's opinion that I think is completely 

18

inconsistent with that.  There are  this is going to 

19

be on page 1095 of the Court's opinion.  The first 

20

sentence is going to be from precisely before what Mr. 

21

Shanmugam read. 

22

 Under Section 14A then, "A plaintiff is 

23

permitted to prove a specific statement of reason 

24

knowingly false or misleadingly incomplete even when 

25

stated in conclusory terms," and that is referring to

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the following statement that, "However conclusory the 

2

director's statements may have been, then it was open to 

3

attack by gardenvariety evidence, allowing respondents 

4

the opportunity for recovery on the allegation that it 

5

was misleading to call $42 high," and the Court said you 

6

could recover just on that allegation. 

7

 And remember how anomalous it would be to 

8

say that Virginia Bankshares holds that you must prove 

9

the state of mind of the speaker.  This is a strict 

10

liability statute.  To say you have to prove that the 

11

person didn't believe the implied fact is to say it's 

12

not a strict liability statute, it's essentially 

13

scienter.  And why is it, we would ask, that Congress 

14

would say, we recognize an implied statement in the 

15

opinion, but we're going to require that you prove that 

16

they essentially intentionally lied to you.  It's just 

17

contrary to the entire structure and notion of Section 

18

11, which isn't a fraud statute at all.  It is derived 

19

from principles of common law that said, if you have a 

20

even negligent misrepresentation, even an innocent 

21

misrepresentation, you just state the facts wrong. 

22

 Then what you have is effectively 

23

rescission.  And that is, the issuer got the money from 

24

the person who bought the stock.  There was a mistake. 

25

It went wrong.  We're not saying that they're

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intentional liars, but they got the money on the basis 

2

of an incorrect representation.  They get the money 

3

back.  And you can't say that you have a stateofmind 

4

requirement when the statute simultaneously says for 

5

auditors, for the lawyer who has to produce a legal 

6

opinion with respect to forwardlooking statements, then 

7

you inquire whether  and it's going to be on the 

8

defendant to prove that they engaged in due diligence. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if it's not purely 

10

subjective, if it's the reasonable basis test, what does 

11

that mean?  Mr. Shanmugam says that's very openended. 

12

And I think he has a point.  I don't really know what a 

13

reasonable basis would be in that situation. 

14

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Well, this is something that 

15

the common law has employed and utilized for well over a 

16

hundred years.  In this case, we would be required to 

17

prove, with respect to the hedged legal statements, that 

18

a reasonable  or that the legal view of the company is 

19

consistent with the facts, and that is, you couldn't 

20

reasonably hold this legal view if you were taking 

21

kickbacks and you weren't passing the money on to the 

22

government.  There is 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But to what degree must the 

24

person  let's just take the CEO who signs on behalf of 

25

the corporation.  To what degree must he conduct an

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

investigation to determine whether illegality is going 

2

on someplace in the company? 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

If you are making  if you 

4

go out of your way to say what we're doing is legal, 

5

then you're going to have to undertake a reasonable 

6

investigation.  I'm not  let me just say to you 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what does that mean? 

8

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It means 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Now, I believe it's  I 

10

belive  the CES says, I believe that nobody in this 

11

company is paying bribes. 

12

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And the CEO says no one 

14

from  it's a true statement of belief, and he's 

15

received information from certain corporate compliance 

16

officers that no bribes are being paid. 

17

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Yes. 

18

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

How much investigation does 

19

he have to go on, does he have to do?  Does he have to 

20

hire an outside firm to do an investigation to see if 

21

maybe somebody is paying bribes? 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

It depends on whether he has 

23

information.  The most specific thing that I can help 

24

you with your opinion in the case is that, remember, 

25

this due diligence standard exists in the statute.  Any

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

expert that offers an opinion is going to have to show 

2

reasonable investigation.  Congress didn't write more 

3

into the statute for the defense because it's very 

4

contextual. 

5

 If the CEO knew that there had been claims 

6

in the press, for example, there had been allegations, 

7

they were facing a qui tam lawsuit, then there would be 

8

a heightened obligation to investigate. 

9
10
11

 My point for you is that Mr. Shanmugam 
thinks none of that's relevant, and that is 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I understand that.  He 

12

says it's purely subjective.  You say basically, it's 

13

the  state of mind is completely irrelevant.  But if 

14

we're in the middle someplace? 

15

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

Right, and the middle ground 

16

is that when he makes that statement in the registration 

17

statement, he is trying to induce me to believe, at the 

18

very least, I wouldn't say this if I didn't have a 

19

reasonable basis.  We then will have to prove as the 

20

plaintiffs that there was not a reasonable set of facts 

21

that could lead them to say this.  In his view, even if 

22

it was completely unreasonable, that is to say the CEO 

23

heard these rumors and ignored them 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But you're not really 

helping me.  But maybe  all you're saying is

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable, reasonable, reasonable.  I  I would like 

2

some more concrete guidance as to what is reasonable. 

3

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

I'm sorry, it's just very 

4

contextdependent.  In your hypothetical, what I would 

5

say is that if the CEO knows that there's never been an 

6

allegation about this, his general counsel has said, We 

7

are complying with the law, I don't think the CEO is 

8

going to have to do more. 

9

 But, in fact, if the contracts by their 

10

terms, which is what we allege, involve direct payments 

11

for increasing market share, if they are paying 

12

here  here's another good example.  We have in the 

13

complaint that their own lawyers told them not to make 

14

these purchases with respect to nursing homes because it 

15

would amount to an illegal kickback. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yeah, well, that's 

17

your  your case, but I gather your answer to 

18

Justice Alito is that the CEO doesn't know about 

19

anything, and his lawyer comes in and says, Nope, I 

20

don't know about anything, then that cannot be the basis 

21

for a suit? 

22

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

In your hypothetical in 

23

which there is no question about the reasonableness, I 

24

think that they will have an excellent 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

No, I'm asking you,

Official

1

is it reasonable for 

2

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

4
5
6

Yes. 
 him to say, I 

don't know anything about any bribes. 
 The lawyer comes in, Do you know anything 
about bribes? 

7

 No, I don't know anything about any bribes. 

8

 Is it reasonable for him to say, In our 

9

opinion, our employees are not giving bribes? 

10

 MR. GOLDSTEIN: 

If that is true across the 

11

company, because it's not just the CEO that signs the 

12

registration statement, then yes. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

14

 Ms. Saharsky. 

15

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICOLE SAHARSKY 

16
17
18
19

Okay.  Thank you. 

 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, 
 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

20

 The parties have offered you two extreme 

21

positions, and we think that the answer lies in the 

22

middle.  And this is an answer that comes right from the 

23

language of the statute because it's not the case as 

24

petitioner suggests that the statute only requires that 

25

you make statements that are literally accurate.  The

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute says that you have to make statements that are 

2

both literally accurate and not misleading as to a 

3

that there cannot be a material omission. 

4

 And this is a  this is really a standard 

5

that makes sense in the context of this particular case 

6

where we're talking about whether something in a 

7

registration statement has a reasonable basis. 

8

 And I want to clarify what we mean by 

9

reasonable basis.  We mean a basis that would be 

10

expected under the circumstances, that a lack of a 

11

reasonable basis is what makes an omitted fact make the 

12

statement about the opinion misleading. 

13

 So to answer Justice Alito's question, a 

14

plaintiff has the burden to come into court and provide 

15

an omitted fact that should have been put in the 

16

statement of opinion or provided along with it in order 

17

to make it not misleading.  And that has 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, it seem  it seems 

19

to me that you're not in the middle, that you're almost 

20

90 percent with the respondent because you give very 

21

little weight to the subjective belief component. 

22

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

We think that the  you 

23

could establish liability either way.  It's really the 

24

Court of Appeals kind of addressed two questions, and we 

25

agree with the Court of Appeals halfway.  The first

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question is do you always have to have subjective 

2

disbelief to recover under Section 11 for an opinion. 

3

The Court of Appeals correctly said the answer to that 

4

was no. 

5

 But then to 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you  I  I  are 

7

you disavowing Virginia Bankers?  Virginia Bankers says 

8

you need two things, you need subjective disbelief 

9

and/or not quite, but you need an objective fact that's 

10

not true, meaning you need to prove the falsity of the 

11

objective fact? 

12

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, with respect, we don't 

13

think that the court in Virginia Bankshares held that 

14

both were required because as you pointed out before the 

15

jury 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, you're right.  It 

17

only held that the second was required, so you always 

18

have to prove that.  So what mental state are you saying 

19

has to be proven?  Either they didn't believe what they 

20

were saying and there was no reasonable, or there was no 

21

reasonable basis for what they were saying? 

22

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

That's right.  Either they 

23

didn't believe what they were saying, or there was no 

24

reasonable basis for what they were saying.  And to 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do we 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You were asking, in 

2

Justice Kennedy's, you said it was right and wrong, and 

3

then you got the part out about it being right.  What 

4

in what way was it wrong? 

5

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

The way in which the Sixth 

6

Circuit decision was wrong is because it suggested this 

7

idea of liability by hindsight, that if there is 

8

something that you give an opinion on about legality and 

9

it's later proven or later  later established to be 

10

false by a  untrue by a court, that you could be found 

11

liable by hindsight, and we think that's not true. 

12

 What matters is the state of mind and the 

13

basis that you had at the time the registration 

14

statements were made.  And that's actually directly in 

15

the language of the text of the statute which focuses on 

16

when the registration statement became effective. 

17

 But just to make clear, and, again, in 

18

response to Justice Alito's question, this is a 

19

contextspecific inquiry, and the burden is on the 

20

plaintiff to come forward with an omitted material fact 

21

that should have been stated.  And in the context about 

22

an opinion, the kinds of things that would be omitted 

23

material facts that would matter are things that 

24

undercut a basis that you would expect.  So it could be 

25

a lack of any investigation whatsoever.

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 But it could be, as Justice Kagan said, that 

2

you have been sued.  And several courts have held 

3

against you.  Those are the kind of facts. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But this is always going to 

5

come up after it's been shown that the statement turned 

6

out  the statement of belief turned out to be 

7

incorrect.  The registration statements says, We believe 

8

X.  It turns out X is not true. 

9

 So it's not going to be very hard in that 

10

situation for a plaintiff to allege that the  that the 

11

issuer did not make a reasonable investigation because 

12

if  if they had done a reasonable investigation, they 

13

would have discovered that X wasn't true. 

14

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, with respect, I'm not 

15

sure that that's true because of the stringent pleading 

16

standards that are in place.  First of all, it's not 

17

just that they could allege a conclusion under this 

18

Court's decision in Twombly and Iqbal.  It's that you 

19

have to have facts to support it. 

20

 Also, there are some courts, like the court 

21

in this case, depending on the allegations, that say 

22

they need to meet the particularity standard for fraud, 

23

a claims that sounds like fraud under Section 9(b).  So 

24

there is, in fact, a burden on the plaintiffs. 

25

 And one point that I want to make is that

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this is the kind of inquiry that comes up in omissions 

2

cases all the time.  The question is the plaintiff says, 

3

and has to say with facts behind it, There's something 

4

that was omitted that matters. 

5

 And the question ultimately for the finder 

6

of fact to decide is did it make the statement 

7

misleading or not, and that is a very contextspecific 

8

discussion.  But 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

They say, someone pleads 

10

that  they said we believe there were no bribes paid, 

11

and then later it's discovered that lots of bribes were 

12

being paid off someplace.  So they alleged all the 

13

things that have turned out to be inconsistent with the 

14

statement of belief, and they say had they sent someone 

15

there to investigate, they would have found this, they 

16

would have found that.  So how difficult is that going 

17

to be? 

18
19
20

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, again, I think the 

depends on the case. 
 You know, one thing that I would suggest to 

21

the Court by way of reassurance, is both that the Court 

22

has addressed a number of omissions cases and asking, 

23

you know, is the kind of information something that 

24

should have been included to make the statement not 

25

misleading, but also that the standard that we're

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

talking about, the lack of a basis, has deep roots in 

2

the common law, it's been the longstanding position of 

3

the SEC, and there are numerous courts that have used 

4

this standard, including the Third Circuit's decision in 

5

the Trump case, the Weiss case that's cited in our 

6

brief. 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you think that there are 

specific omissions in this case? 
 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, the case wasn't really 

10

pleaded the way that we conceive of it in terms of the 

11

lack of a reasonable basis, so we do think the 

12

appropriate thing for the Court to do would be to 

13

provide appropriate instructions to the lower courts, 

14

send this case back, and potentially allow this case to 

15

be repleaded because of the fact that we do think there 

16

was a kernel of this lack of reasonable basis idea in 

17

two places in the complaint in this case. 

18

 The one is the relatively conclusory 

19

statement in Section 183 of the complaint that there was 

20

not a reasonable basis, but then there was also, as 

21

Mr. Goldstein noted, paragraphs 89 and 90 of the 

22

complaint, which were specific facts that were alleged 

23

about the company's attorney saying with respect to one 

24

of the specific contracts, this contract has all the 

25

kick  the hallmarks of a kickback, an illegal kickback,

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and that is the kind of thing that potentially is an 

2

omission that could be material and could make the other 

3

statements in the registration statement misleading if 

4

you don't provide such information. 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, do you think that 

6

Twombly in this  in this context requires the 

7

plaintiff to allege what kind of investigation was 

8

conducted before there is discovery? 

9

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

I think that that would be a 

10

casespecific determination, but I don't think that that 

11

under Twombly and Iqbal, that the  that the plaintiff 

12

could just come in and give a very generic, a very 

13

conclusory allegation.  That's what the Court said is no 

14

conclusory allegations. 

15

 But another  another point I think that 

16

might be helpful to the Court is that this is really 

17

this no reasonable basis standard is really something 

18

that polices the egregious cases because it has to be 

19

the case that the plaintiff can come forward with 

20

information and that the basis that the company had is 

21

really outside the bounds of reasonableness, and we need 

22

to have it for egregious cases, for example, if there 

23

was a company that really did no investigation before 

24

putting statements like financial statements or 

25

financial predictions in its 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, why wouldn't they 

2

just say, Look, the statement turned out to be false, we 

3

don't doubt that he did hold that opinion as his 

4

opinion, he was sincere, but he had no basis for that 

5

whatsoever, period.  That's what the complaint says. 

6

Now, how can you avoid discovery on that? 

7

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, I think the plaintiff 

8

has the burden to  to allege specific omitted facts 

9

that should have been given in the registration 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

He never looked into it. 

11

He had no basis for it.  That's trying to prove a 

12

negative.  What are they supposed to allege a negative, 

13

he didn't go to the law books, didn't go to the library, 

14

didn't talk to this, didn't talk to that.  I mean, it's 

15

pretty hard to do, isn't it? 

16

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Well, I think it depends in 

17

the context of the entire complaint, whether there's 

18

sufficient factual matter there or not.  But again, what 

19

I would tell the Court is that this kind of issue, not 

20

with respect to opinions specifically, but in general, 

21

arises in omissions cases, and there are many omissions 

22

cases under Section 11, which is not surprising when you 

23

think about it because these registration statements are 

24

so carefully vetted.  It's not often the case that you 

25

find facts that are stated that are actually untrue.

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And that's really the key point that I want 

2

to make when you are thinking about Petitioner's 

3

statement, is the SEC does really view this as a problem 

4

to say that the Petitioner's idea that you can just put 

5

"we believe" in front of something and then not have any 

6

need to make an investigation into it or see whether it 

7

has a basis. 

8
9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Why can't that be 

submitted to the jury?  In other words, you can look, 

10

not to see if in fact it has a reasonable basis, but to 

11

use the evidence about how unreasonable the basis must 

12

be to suggest that the belief was not sincere? 

13

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, Congress made 
If someone comes in, 

15

in Justice Breyer's hypothetical, and there's no basis 

16

at all and says, "I believe that this," and the evidence 

17

shows he had no basis at all, a jury can easily 

18

determine, we don't think he really believed it. 

19

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

You're right that that's 

20

probative evidence.  But I think the key point is the 

21

language Congress enacted, that Congress did not limit 

22

liability to statements that are literally true or 

23

false.  There could be statements that are literally 

24

true, like he had the belief, but were misleading, and I 

25

think that that's the situation.  There are places where you

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could have something that is subjectively believed, a 

2

company in litigation, and the company lawyer thinks 

3

we're going to win this, we can, but they haven't been 

4

winning it, and they don't disclose the fact that there 

5

are some serious risks there. 

6

 And that's the kind of thing that really 

7

shouldn't be put in registration statements without 

8

qualification. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Saharsky, does this 

10

affect not only the private right of action?  I was 

11

uncertain whether it also affected the SEC's ability to 

12

stop a registration statement which it thought had a 

13

misleading statement of opinion.  If we come out the way 

14

Mr. Shanmugam says, is the SEC's ability to do that 

15

severely compromised? 

16

 MS. SAHARSKY: 

Yes.  The language, the 

17

operative language, is nearly identical.  This is 

18

between Section 8, which is about the SEC stop orders, 

19

and Section 11, and the key language is that there has 

20

to be the misstatement of material fact or the omission 

21

that makes the  because the omission is present makes 

22

this statement not misleading. 

23

 So this is nearly identical language, and 

24

the SEC has taken the position for many years that in 

25

fact a lack of a reasonable basis is a serious problem

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

even if the person sincerely believes it.  Those are the 

2

cases cited in our brief, and the reason we're here 

3

today is because it will severely hamper the SEC's authority, as 

4

well as the authority of private persons to recover, if 

5

you can just put things in registration statements 

6

without even having a basis for them. 

7

 Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Shanmugam, you have seven minutes

Thank you, counsel. 

remaining. 
 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice. 
 This is the rarer case in which none of the 

16

parties is defending the reasoning of the court of 

17

appeals below.  And just to reiterate, the court of 

18

appeals in this case held that the falsity requirement 

19

in Section 11 operates differently because Section 11 is 

20

a strict liability statute, and that's the reasoning at 

21

page 47 of the Joint Appendix. 

22

 So the real question before this Court is 

23

whether to reverse outright, as we submit this Court 

24

should do, or to vacate and remand for application of a 

25

somewhat different legal standard such as the reasonable

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

basis standard. 
 I want to really set out three reasons in 

3

this rebuttal why we believe that the Court should 

4

reverse outright. 

5

 First of all, I want to focus on the text of 

6

the statute.  And to go to the colloquy, Justice Kagan, 

7

that you and I were having, and the similar colloquy 

8

that you also had with my colleagues at the bar, whether 

9

or not there is a reasonable basis is not a fact that 

10

can be said to be omitted, and that is for the precise 

11

reason that this test is not simply a "some basis" 

12

standard.  This is a reasonable basis standard that 

13

requires some evaluation of whether the basis is 

14

sufficient. 

15

 And so that is really a judgment. 

It is 

16

really a matter of opinion, and I don't think that it 

17

can fairly be said to be a fact that is omitted.  And 

18

again, as I suggested earlier 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But there might be omitted 

20

facts, such as I didn't check with any of my lawyers, or 

21

I checked with my lawyers and they told me the opposite. 

22

I mean, those are facts, and that's the thing that makes 

23

the statement in the registration statement itself 

24

misleading. 

25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

And so the only point I

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would add is the point that I think I made in my opening 

2

argument, which is that the statement of material fact 

3

here is still the statement of the opinion, and there is 

4

nothing misleading about that statement as to that 

5

stated fact.  That is to say, either that is the opinion 

6

of the issuer or it isn't.  And I think it was telling 

7

that Mr. Goldstein in his argument 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I think what 

Ms. Saharsky is saying, maybe not Mr. Goldstein, is that 

10

there's another part of the statute which is omissions, 

11

and that those omissions of facts  I didn't check with 

12

anybody or I checked with everybody and they said the 

13

exact opposite  that's the thing that makes my own 

14

statement misleading, and that's why it fits within the 

15

statute. 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Right, but it still has to 

17

be an omission that is, in the words of the statute, 

18

"necessary to make the statements therein not 

19

misleading."  And again, we think that the statements 

20

therein are really the statements of material fact. 

21

 Now, Mr. Goldstein made a somewhat different 

22

textual argument, and I want to address that, too, just 

23

to kind of lay all of our cards on the table.  He argued 

24

that, in essence, because this concept of due diligence, 

25

this concept of having a reasonable belief, exists in

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the affirmative defense, that this Court can somehow 

2

just import that concept into the affirmative falsity 

3

requirement. 

4

 To me, that really illustrates why this is a 

5

profoundly atextual view, because in essence what he is 

6

saying is that, although Congress incorporated a 

7

reasonableness standard in certain specific contexts 

8

with regard to defenses for persons other than the 

9

issuer, you should impose it as an affirmative 

10

requirement with regard to statements of opinion whoever 

11

the speaker is. 

12
13
14

 And again, we simply don't think that can be 
squared with the text of the statute. 
 I would note a couple of further things in 

15

response to Ms. Saharsky's argument as to the text here. 

16

First of all, as I said in my opening, if Congress 

17

wanted to specifically impose liability in the absence 

18

of a reasonable basis, it certainly could have done so. 

19

There are statutes outside the securities context that 

20

use that phrase in order to impose liability. 

21

 But second, to the extent that the SEC views 

22

this as a massive problem, the SEC certainly could 

23

promulgate a rule under its authority under Section 19 

24

of the Securities Act, which allows the SEC to specify 

25

what should be included in a registration statement.

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And the SEC in fact has somewhat broader power than 

2

Ms. Saharsky suggests because, while it is true that the 

3

SEC stop order power under Section 8(d) uses similar 

4

language, the SEC also has the power to prevent a 

5

registration statement from going into effect under 

6

Section 8(b) where that statement is inaccurate or 

7

incomplete in any respect. 

8
9

 In our view, that is broader language that 
would give the SEC somewhat more expansive authority if 

10

it believed that a statement of opinion is objectively 

11

false. 

12

 With regard to Virginia Bankshares, I would 

13

just note one thing in response to Justice Sotomayor's 

14

question, and that is that, as we point out at page 10 

15

of our reply brief, there was no jury finding in 

16

Virginia Bankshares on the issue of subjective 

17

disbelief.  This Court was instead characterizing the 

18

jury's finding precisely because this Court believed 

19

that what it meant for a statement of this variety to be 

20

false was for the speaker to have acted with subjective 

21

disbelief.  And again, I would point the Court to what 

22

we said in our reply brief.  We cite the verdict form as 

23

confirmation of that proposition. 

24
25

 Third, I want to say just a word about the 
policy considerations here, pro and con a reasonable

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

basis standard.  As I pointed out earlier, we believe 

2

that that standard is amorphous, and I don't think that 

3

anything that's taken place in the intervening half an 

4

hour has dispelled that proposition. 

5

 Ms. Saharsky says that whether or not a 

6

basis is reasonable is whether or not the basis is one 

7

that would be expected under the circumstances, and I 

8

would respectfully submit that that really doesn't 

9

provide much more by way of clarity, and it certainly 

10

would make it very easy for a plaintiff to plead a claim 

11

under this legal standard because all they would 

12

presumably have to say is that the basis is not that 

13

that was expected under the circumstances. 

14

 And as Mr. Goldstein said, this inquiry 

15

would be very context specific, and again in a context 

16

where issuers really require predictability and 

17

certainty, we believe that that is cold comfort. 

18

 There is one other policy consideration, 

19

however, which I didn't mention earlier that I just want 

20

to mention very briefly.  There are very few statements 

21

of opinion that are required to be included in 

22

registration statements.  There is the statement of the 

23

auditor, statement of the lawyer that the issuance of 

24

these securities is valid.  But beyond that, the statute 

25

and the regulations really do not require very many of

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these statements.  And we, therefore, believe that a 

2

standard  an amorphous liability standard like the 

3

reasonable basis standard will really have a chilling 

4

effect in cases of this variety. 

5

 And I would note, as was illustrated in the 

6

discussion with Mr. Goldstein, that in this case most of 

7

the statements at issue were accompanied by cautionary 

8

language, and I think that the reason why that is so is 

9

that the reason why companies like Omnicare make 

10

disclosures like this is precisely to warn about the 

11

risks of doing business.  If you take a look at 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What would be your 

13

position if those qualifying statements that do appear 

14

just before and just after this belief statement were 

15

omitted? 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, our view would be the 

17

same in the sense that we certainly think that 

18

subjective disbelief would still be required, and of 

19

course we believe that that is the holding of this 

20

Court's decision in Virginia Bankshares as it has been 

21

understood. 

22

 But I make the point for a somewhat 

23

different reason, which is simply to illustrate why 

24

issuers believe that it is desirable to make statements 

25

of this variety, and if issuers are subject to liability

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under an amorphous standard they will simply omit to do 

2

so.

 Thank you.
