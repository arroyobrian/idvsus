ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
GENERAL KATYAL:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
For 13 years, Arizona has permitted private

14

citizens to contribute money to private organizations

15

set up by private individuals and has let those

16

organizations use that money towards scholarships when

17

individuals apply for them.

18

first in finding that the taxpayer plaintiffs had

19

standing, and second in striking the program down.

20

The Ninth Circuit erred

On standing, this lawsuit fails each of the

21

three necessary elements.

Regarding injury in fact, the

22

key point is this:

23

goes to fund religion.

24

to track and monitor each cent that the Respondent

25

plaintiffs pay in tax, not a cent, not a fraction of a

Not a cent of the Respondents' money

1

cent, would go into any religious school's coffers.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Katyal, their point

3

is that this tax money does belong to the State that the

4

private individuals are using, because it is money that,

5

even by the new amendment, says either you pay it to the

6

State or you use it for this purpose, but it's the

7

State's money, and it's giving you by its largesse the

8

right to redirect it.

9

That's their argument.

GENERAL KATYAL:

10

Right, and -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it would be the

11

taxpayers' tax dollars being spent on religion, if they

12

could sustain their claim.

13

GENERAL KATYAL:

There are two problems with

14

that.

One has to do with injury in fact.

The other has

15

to do with redressability.

16

fact, our point is, as you track the taxpayers' dollars,

17

it doesn't actually fund any religious program, unlike

18

the -- unlike Flast and other cases in which this Court

19

has considered taxpayer standing for religion.

With respect to injury in

20

Their complaint is not that the government

21

is spending money that the taxpayers has been -- money

22

that has been extracted and spent of the taxpayers.

23

Their complaint is that someone else's money is not

24

being extracted and spent enough.

25

language in Flast says that for taxpayer standing to
5

Alderson Reporting Company

And the relevant

Official

1

occur, that, quote, "his tax money" must be extracted

2

and spent, and here that's not occurring.

3

Now, with respect to the other argument, not

4

injury in fact, but addressability and causation, our

5

point is this:

6

that chain of events that you spelled out, Justice

7

Sotomayor, would actually happen.

8

Cuno, for example, when a tax credit is given, sometimes

9

that actually reduces the amount of money the government

It's speculative as to whether or not

As this Court said in

10

has to spend.

11

different than the direct outlay that was at issue in

12

Flast.

13

It doesn't increase it.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so that's

Then is it constitutional

14

if we get a new system?

15

The taxpayers who are religious will be able to check a

16

box, and the check that they send to the IRS -- it's a

17

possible system -- what happens is that that check is

18

cashed by an official, and the cash is given to the

19

local priest to say prayers for the individual who

20

contributed the money.

21

one who could challenge that?

22

Here's what the system will be:

And, in your view, there is no

GENERAL KATYAL:
First is:

Well, let me say two things

23

about that.

That is not all that different,

24

Justice Breyer, than what we have today with 501(c)(3)

25

deductions.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

The difference is, of

2

course, that in the one case it's a deduction, and in

3

this case you're paying it 100 percent with money that

4

would otherwise go into the coffer.

5

GENERAL KATYAL:

That -- that's -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand that.

But I'm

7

interested in, conceptually, does the Government think

8

that there is no one who could challenge that?

9

GENERAL KATYAL:

I don't think that any

10

taxpayer could challenge that.

11

the hypothetical, Justice Breyer, I'm not sure if the

12

government is specifying which religious organizations

13

might be eligible for the check box.

14

government is doing something that is under-inclusive

15

and only giving tax credits to one set of religious

16

organizations, that's a Texas Monthly problem, where

17

this Court -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is, depending on

But if the

So, if you go back into

19

history, it could have been the case that the -- as long

20

as they were fair to every religion, the first Congress

21

could have funded prayers throughout the nation in

22

churches for anyone to go and pray, and that would not

23

have violated the Establishment Clause, or if it had,

24

nobody could have challenged it.

25

GENERAL KATYAL:

No, Justice Breyer.

standing, not the merits.

3

if the government funded only religious organizations or

4

religious prayer, I do think that other organizations

5

would have standing -- not as a taxpayer, because this

6

Court has been very careful in Flast and in Hein to say

7

there's an extremely narrow exception for taxpayer

8

standing, a narrow exception to Frothingham, but other

9

organizations would have Texas Monthly standing because

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General -- counsel, does

12

anyone have standing, in your view, to challenge this

scheme?

14

GENERAL KATYAL:

The way this scheme is set

15

up, our answer is no.

16

this Court's general reluctance to confer taxpayer

17

standing in this area.

18

And I think that accords with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if we leave out the

19

fine points that you were discussing, isn't the

20

underlying premise of Flast v. Cohen that the

21

Establishment Clause will be unenforceable unless we

22

recognize taxpayer standing?

23

GENERAL KATYAL:

I -- I don't see that,

24

Justice Ginsburg, in Flast.

25

narrow exception for when someone's dollars are being

I think Flast is a very

No, but you don't need be,

21

can get around it -- that can get around it in some

22

circumstances.

2

clause in the Constitution.

most narrow of exceptions, and -­

4

Taxpayer standing is the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it is -- there is a

5

plaintiff -- we have a Bill of Rights, and most

6

provisions have plaintiffs who are hurting, whose free

7

speech is being suppressed, but this one doesn't have.

8

It's in the Constitution like all the others, and I

9

thought, to be candid, that that's what the problem was

10

in Flast v. Cohen, and that's what the Court was

11

responding to.

12

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I don't see that in

13

Flast, Justice Ginsburg, but be that as it may, I think

14

this Court in Valley Forge was very clear to say that

15

if, at the end of the day, you can't find a plaintiff

16

with standing, that is not an excuse to relax the -- our

17

general requirements of Article III standing.

18

And here, if you granted the plaintiffs

19

standing, what you would be granting is, for the first

20

time, a -- a tax credit which is a complaint about

21

someone else's money not being spent to a high enough

22

level.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if you are right, General

24

Katyal, the Court was without authority to decide Walz,

25

Nyquist, Hunt, Mueller, Hibbs, this -- this very case,
10

Alderson Reporting Company

just a few years ago?

2

authority to decide any of those cases, but that somehow

3

nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG

4

recognize that fact.

5

each of those cases.

6
7

The SG participated, I believe, in

GENERAL KATYAL:

Right.

So let me say two

things about that.

That the Court was without

First is, I do think it's very much just
like Frothingham, in which Frothingham had to deal with

10

this exact problem.

11

taxpayer standing case after taxpayer standing case, and

12

then, when it was teed up and presented to the Court as

13

a question about Article III standing, the Court said:

14

No, we shouldn't have granted taxpayer standing in those

15

cases.

16

The Court had conferred standing in

So my answer to you is yes.
Now, I do think that this Court's decision

17

in Hein, I think, reiterated some of the fundamental

18

principles and the limits on Flast.

19

Court -- the plurality made quite clear that it would go

20

no further than the facts of Flast.

And I think the

21

And to grant standing here, you have to

22

go -- tremendously depart from what Flast is about:

23

direct government outlay of funds out of -- taking money

24

out of someone's pocket to fund religion.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just want to make sure I

heard your answer to the -- you said the answer is yes.

3

In other words, you agree with Justice Kagan's criticism

4

of those cases, and you said, yes, she's right; those

5

cases were wrongly decided.

6

GENERAL KATYAL:

They -- they could have

7

gone out -- the results may have been the same.

It just

8

would have been -- would have been on standing instead

9

of the merits.

Mueller, for example, upheld the

10

program.

11

the same, but the way in which the Court got there would

12

have been so that there was no tax -­

So the bottom-line decision would have been

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

there would have been no standing in those cases.

15

GENERAL KATYAL:

No taxpayer standing.

16

there may have been other forms of standing, Texas

17

Monthly standing, that could have been alleged to

18

challenge those programs, but yes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now,

But it wasn't -- it

20

wasn't -- I don't remember whether the Government

21

participated in the Winn case when it came up under the

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

Thank you, General.

MS. BICKETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Arizona's tuition tax credit does not

12

violate the Establishment Clause, because it's a neutral

13

law that results in scholarship programs of private

14

choice.

15

that the Court upheld in Mueller, it's one of many

tax-saving devices, including some 26 other credits that

17

are available to Arizona taxpayers on a neutral basis.

It's neutral because, like the tax deduction

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Bickett, could you

typical tuition voucher scheme?

23

voucher schemes, the State just gives the -- the voucher

24

or scholarship or what have you.

25

complicated and complex and unusual.

Could you tell me why

In other tuition

This is so much more

14

Alderson Reporting Company

And it just left

Official

me wondering why it was chosen, or what the State thinks

2

the advantages are of it now?

3

MS. BICKETT:

Yes, Justice Kagan.

One of

4

the things that is true in Arizona that was not true in

5

Ohio is that, under the Arizona Constitution, any direct

6

aid to private schools is prohibited.

7

The other thing about the tax credit program

8

is that it does encourage contributions not only from

9

parents but from the community at large.

And this -­

10

this then provides money for low-income students,

11

students from low-income families.

that there's some reports that -- studies that have been

have switched from public schools to private schools as

but rather from others who can contribute to the

7

program?

8

MS. BICKETT:

The question was, is

Well, what the record shows is

that there have been -- there's a large amount of

10

contributions.

11

12

number of contributors and who contributes -- or not the

13

individuals who contribute.

You could only

get -- if you give a million dollars, you still only get

3

a $500 tax credit, right?

4

MS. BICKETT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

5

The -- the programs are programs of private

6

choice, because any aid that reaches religious schools

7

does so after -- only after at least four levels of

8

private decisionmaking.

9

rules for the -- this tax credit, and after that,

Arizona sets up the neutral

10

private individuals and organizations take over.

11

can form a school tuition organization, and the increase

12

in the number and diversity of school tuition

13

organizations over the 13 years that the tax credit has

14

been in existence demonstrates, in fact, that -- that

15

this is free for everyone to participate in.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Something that worried me

in Zelman is this, and I might get your answer.

regulations and rules.

qualitatively the subject matter that the public

think it's ever had to -- that it is constitutional for

12

the government to support private charity.

13

14

letting you deduct charitable contributions, it can't

That

So if you believe that the charitable

deduction in the Federal income tax is a constitutional

thing for the government to do, to support private

20

charity by picking up part of the tab -- that's true

21

when there's a deduction -- then you have to give the

22

deduction to people who contribute to religion.

Suppose the government in

and the STOs then gave out the scholarships.

be constitutional for an STO to say to a parent who

you're not, we won't give you a scholarship -­

The people who

Well, suppose they change

one rule, and the rule that the STOs had was this:

11

said we will give you tuition if you otherwise qualify

12

for your child to go to the school that you wish to go

13

to, and if you are Jewish or you are Protestant and you

14

want to go to St. Joseph's Catholic School, that's

absolutely fine; they won't keep you out, and vice

I'm sorry.

I just want

to Justice Breyer that your complaint was that the STOs

4

are giving scholarships based on the student's religion.

5

MR. BENDER:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You just said

Yes.
I thought another part

7

of your complaint was that the STOs were giving just to

8

the religious schools.

9

MR. BENDER:

STOs don't give scholarships to

10

religious schools.

11

The parents are awarded the scholarships, not the

12

schools.

13
14

They give scholarships to parents.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But to attend that

school?

15

MR. BENDER:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

To attend that school, yes.
So the essence of your

17

complaint is that some of the STOs are requiring that

18

the recipient, the recipient child, be of a particular

19

religion?

20

MR. BENDER:

That, and some of the STOs are

21

also requiring that, in order to get the scholarship,

22

the parent agree to send the child to a particular

religious school.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if Arizona had a statute

that gave an income tax deduction only to individuals

who make charitable contributions to educational

institutions, there would be a problem there, because

5

they -- it wasn't a general tax exception for charitable

contributions?

7

MR. BENDER:

No, Justice Alito.

I think it

8

would be constitutional if it said that you get a

9

deduction for making a charitable contribution to an

10

educational organization and that that can include a

11

religious educational organization, because if it

12

didn't, it would be unconstitutional.

deduction for giving to educational institutions but not

description, Flast says, about how taxpayer standing

will go forward.

24

Valley Forge makes that clear because the dissenters

said exactly what you said, which is, look, let's just

it doesn't really matter; it's the bottom line on the

treasury.

And this Court said no, that isn't the case.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

General Katyal, Flast could

not have meant that it's your particular dollar.

There

7

would be no way to know it's your particular dollar, and

8

that would be a silly and fictional thing to say as the

9

plurality opinion in Hein makes clear.

What Flast said

10

was that taxpayer dollars, not your dollar, but taxpayer

11

dollars are going to this activity in the same way that

12

it's going to the activity here.

13

GENERAL KATYAL:

I disagree on two levels.

14

First is I don't think that's what Flast is.

15

Flast is about that micro-fraction of a cent that is

16

coming from your pocket and being used to fund religion.

And that's what Madison complained about.

you are going to get using the language of Flast.

GENERAL KATYAL:

That's as close a nexus as

Again, I think that doesn't

4

deal with the direct injury on the taxpayer, which is

5

the language of Flast.

6

disagree with me, the relief -- the harm here is a lot

7

more speculative, just like Cuno, because you have to

8

posit, in order for the harm to exist to this taxpayer,

9

that tax credits will cost the government money, not

Even if we -- even if you

10

save it, that his tax burden will go up as opposed to

11

someone else's tax burden, a corporation and the like,

12

or you have to posit that the government won't cut

13

spending in order to make up the shortfall in revenues

14

that he says is going to exist.

15

do all of those things, none of which you have to do in

16

a Flast situation because it's just a direct outlay of

funds.

You're going to have to

Justice Kennedy's question about State action, which, of

20

course, they didn't advance below as the Ninth Circuit

21

said.

22

in saying that the fact that the government regulates or

23

funds something doesn't transform it into a State actor.

24

If it did, then all 501(c)(3)'s would become State

25

actors, and that, I think, would be an enormously
