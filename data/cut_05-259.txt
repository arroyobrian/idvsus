ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
There is no more vexing set of issues in the

12

employment discrimination context than arise out of

13

issues of retaliation under section 704 of title VII.

14

As the Solicitor General's brief and a couple of the

15

other amici briefs point out, the number of -- the

16

number of these claims has increased by more than 100

17

percent over the course of the last decade, more than

18

30 percent of the EEOC's docket is now made up of

19

retaliation claims, and the cost of an average

20

contested retaliation claim exceeds $130,000 per case.

21

Plainly, this is a fundamentally important question,

22

and the standard to be applied under section 704 is

23

critically important to both employers and employees.

24
25

And the Respondent has given you truly a
choice and not a shadow in this particular case because

3

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Respondent's analysis of section 704, based

2

essentially on the language, any discrimination, is

3

that everything that is in any sense against an

4

employee, any act of retaliation, no matter how

5

trivial, is nevertheless a basis for a section 704

6

lawsuit.

7

This is a position that's embraced by none of

8

her supporting amici.

It's a position that's been

9

embraced by no court of appeals up until this point,

10

and it is a position that is utterly untethered in the

11

relationship between section 704 and its language and

12

section 703, which is the heart and soul of the anti

13

discrimination norms in title VII.

14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It has been endorsed

by the EEOC, though.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not -- not that broad -- no,

17

not even the EEOC in its most aggressive

18

interpretation, which obviously the United States has

19

rejected in this case, ever went to the point of saying

20

any.

21

because in the guidelines, the commission always said

22

that in a situation where there was absolutely no

23

question of retaliation, charge filed against a

24

supervisor, supervisor disinvites an employee to lunch,

25

a lunch that's held with all the other employees -- it

And I'll give you a good illustration of that

4

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has always been the position of the -- of the EEOC that

2

in that circumstance, that would not be enough to raise

3

even a fact issue to go to a jury on.

4

Under the Respondent's theory of this case,

5

it is clear to me that being disinvited to a lunch

6

would, in fact, be a basis for a Federal lawsuit under

7

section 704.

8
9
10

So there is no one, neither governmental nor
nongovernmental, that has embraced the extreme position
that the Respondent has put forward under section 704.

11

And indeed, it's very difficult for me to

12

understand why Congress would ever have adopted a rule

13

that was more protective of those against whom --

14

against -- where retaliation takes place as opposed to

15

the core of who was protected by section 703, which is

16

the people who are in the protected class in the first

17

instance.

18

To adopt the rule, I think, of the Respondent

19

in this case would not only increase the number of

20

claims another 100 percent, at least, in the future,

21

but it seems to me would render completely meaningless

22

the observation of this Court in Weber that management

23

prerogatives are to be left undisturbed to the greatest

24

extent possible.

25

once an employee has filed a complaint under -- and,

There are no management prerogatives

5

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore, is protected under section 704.

At that

2

point, everything becomes essentially a straitjacket

3

problem.

4

I don't think there's a rationale to support

5

that interpretation, and so therefore the question is,

6

what is the right standard under section 704?

7

And here, it seems to me the United States

8

and Burlington Northern are on exactly the same page.

9

We believe that this Court announced the appropriate

10

standard under section 703 in dealing with harassment

11

cases.

12

that the Ellerth standard is the proper one for

13

defining a tangible employment action.

That's the Ellerth standard, and we believe

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But 703 has the language and

15

704 doesn't.

16

-- to employment, prerogatives of employment.

17

doesn't.

18

I mean, 703 has language limiting it to

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

704

Justice Scalia, this

19

Court has also said that that negative pregnant has

20

never been used as an overarching interpretive guide.

21

You have to evaluate 703 and 704 in tandem, and it

22

seems much easier to interpret 704 as simply using

23

discrimination against as a shorthand for the wide

24

range of discriminations that are outlined in section

25

703.

It seems quite cumbersome, at a minimum, and

6

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

probably worse if Congress were to actually sit down

2

and try to rewrite every aspect of 703 in order simply

3

to say in addition to the protected classes that 703

4

protects, there is certain conduct under 704 that we

5

protect in exactly the same way that we protect --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

It wouldn't have to do

7

-- I mean, fairly -- you know, to be fair, it wouldn't

8

have had to say that.

9

act that is discrimination under 703.

It would have said any -- any

10

discrimination under 703.

11

said.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Any act that is

Seven words it could have

They could have said it that

13

way, but it seems to me quite clear that Congress still

14

intended for 703 and 704 to be interpreted in pari

15

materia.

16

the same problem, Justice Scalia, as to why is it that

17

Congress would want to protect more thoroughly 704

18

plaintiffs than it would 703 plaintiffs.

19

to me there's no --

And -- and again, you -- you still run into

And it seems

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's a curiosity.

It is.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the answer would be

22

because Congress is worried that people won't complain.

23

That's why.

24

25

And there are millions of ways of

You freeze them out.

1

you insult them.

You -- I mean, it's easy to think of

2

things that don't rise to the level of the -- Ellerth.

3

So, I mean, if I -- maybe I'm right, maybe

4

I'm wrong, but if I'm right, why not just take, say,

5

the D.C. Circuit standard?

6

have to show that the employer's action would have been

7

material, which means the action might well have

8

dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting

9

a charge of discrimination.

They -- they say that you

Now, how about that?

That

10

has the virtue of allowing a person not to be harassed,

11

et cetera, who wants to make a complaint, and it also

12

allows the judge to focus on the particular case and

13

see if what the person is doing is reasonable.

14

holds the complainant to a standard of reasonableness,

15

which is common in law.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It

And the issue would be, I

17

assume, how much a reasonable person likes a free

18

lunch.

19
20
21

MR. PHILLIPS:

That would be -- that would be

the question.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, in fact, if it turns

22

out to be the power lunch of all time and, in fact, the

23

person can't be at the power lunch because she's a

24

woman, for example, and therefore, her future career is

25

likely to take a real nose dive, why shouldn't that

8

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

count as a violation?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I will tell you, Justice

3

Breyer, that the -- at least one of the problems with

4

that is that the EEOC's guidelines expressly state that

5

that is not a claim that's actionable under section

6

704.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They say one lunch, but

8

not if there's a weekly lunch, and the only person who

9

gets left out is the person who filed a charge under

10

title VII.

11

EEOC guidelines leave out, but if it's a routine lunch

12

with all the preferred employees and they leave out the

13

one who filed a title VII charge, that would fit

14

within the EEOC's definition.

15

That's -- a one-at-a-time curiosity the

MR. PHILLIPS:

That would fit under the

16

EEOC's definition, although I don't think it's an

17

answer to Justice Breyer's hypothetical --

18
19
20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it wouldn't fit under

your -MR. PHILLIPS:

-- that was talking the big

power lunch.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Under your definition,

23

lunch is lunch, and so there would never be -- there

24

couldn't be --

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, not under my -- no, that's

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not necessarily the case, Justice Ginsburg.

2

you know, there are two standards under -- under an

3

adverse employment action.

4

there's a tangible action, and that's the Ellerth

5

standard.

6

severe standard, so that if you have -- you know, being

7

routinely excluded rises to the level of pervasive or

8

severe, that would still be actionable under 704 in

9

exactly the same way that that's actionable under 703.

10

In my --

The first one is whether

And then there's always the pervasive and

Well, does it or doesn't

13

title VII charge, once a week.

16

The -- the facts are simply that the manager takes

And -- and does it on a

pervasive basis, sustained and pervasive basis.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does it once a week, and

17

I'm not using any adjective to characterize it.

18

just happens once a week.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think you probably

20

have a jury question at some point, depending on how

21

long it went on for because it would become -- it would

become a pervasive practice.

24

to become a jury issue.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the -- the reason why

that's not a problem is that there is no economic

is absolutely clear.

But that was not the -- but

16

Well, it has an effect on

your back.

12
13

The -- the proof in this case

-- you've got a jury

You've got a jury finding this was

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there's -- there's no

23

question that there's a jury finding of retaliation.

24

The question is whether or not this is a tangible

25

employment action.

11

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but if your -- if your

2

argument is sound, Mr. Phillips, then -- then any

3

employer is well advised to define job categories by

4

having one really nice job within the category and one

5

really rotten job within the category.

6

who's got the nice job does something like make a title

7

VII complaint, automatically gets, in effect,

8

reassigned to the rotten job, and your answer will be,

9

you know, there's no economic effect.

And if anybody

They're getting

10

the same amount of money each week.

I mean, that would

11

seem to me -- asks for an end run around the whole

12

concept of retaliation.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Souter, let me -- in

14

the first place, it's not a very practical hypothetical

15

because, one, when you -- when you define your job

16

positions --

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, isn't -- isn't there a

18

big difference between sitting on a seat and running a

19

forklift and -- and picking up steel rails with your

20

bare hands?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, one, she wasn't

22

typically picking up steel rails with her bare hands.

23

All of this stuff is done mechanically.

24

pulling nails out of rails periodically.

25

sure that that's precisely the way to characterize it.

1

But the -- but at the end of the day, it

2

still seems to me that what Ellerth tells you you

3

should look at is primarily whether there is a -- a

4

direct economic effect.

5

economic effect, then what you ought to be looking for

6

is whether or not the -- the conduct is severe or

7

pervasive, and -- and if it is --

MR. PHILLIPS:

And if there is no direct

there's a separate action.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that's not the claim

Okay, but do you -- do you

13

agree that direct economic effect cannot be the only

14

criterion here?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I don't think it can be

16

the only criterion.

I think that you would have a

17

situation -- and a lot of times the -- the economic

18

effect will be either immediate or potentially indirect

20

its guidelines where a butcher is shifted over to be a

5

they traded every day or something like that, and the

company put out a notice that said anybody who -- who

7

files a claim will not be eligible to ride on the

8

forklift ever again.

10

Supposing people like to work the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

That's a quid pro quo

violation.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

That would be a violation?

This Court held in -- in

13

Ellerth that those kinds of quid pro quos are -- are

14

subject to liability.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So anytime there's an

16

advance notice that you will -- there will be some kind

17

of action in response to a -- a claim, that would be

18

retaliation.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, because the employer --

I mean, employers aren't going to --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

22

adverse job action.

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Even though it did not

2

amount to -- did not have any economic effect on the

3

employee.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, in that -- you know, in

5

-- under those circumstances, it seems to me that the

6

standard is slightly different for quid pro quo

7

violations than they are for simply tangible employment

8

actions.

9
10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So a quid pro quo violation

does not have to be an adverse employment action.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

It -- right, because the --

12

there are -- I mean, they are all adverse employment

13

actions.

14

There's a quid pro quo action, and then there's the --

15

There's a tangible employment action.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that -- that

16

interpretation requires you to interpret 703 and 704

17

differently.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

I -- I don't believe so

19

because I'm -- I'm -- what I'm trying to do at least is

20

to apply the Ellerth standard under 703 for each of the

21

three elements in the same way that I'm trying to apply

22

them under 704.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but are you?

I'm --

24

I'm a little concerned that -- that you're trying to

25

persuade us to interpret 704 the same as 703 at the

15

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

expense of watering down 703.

2

you can concede that -- that refusing to invite

3

somebody to lunch, if it's more than -- more than a

4

single lunch, could be a violation of 703.

5

that come within the -- with respect to compensation,

6

terms, conditions, or privileges of employment?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't understand how

How does

Well, I think that if -- if

8

you could certainly envision a circumstance -- and

9

again, this goes to the pervasiveness of it.

It's --

10

it's a fundamental, sort of constructive adjustment of

11

your employment situation.

fairly capacious term, Justice Scalia, and I could well

imagine that if you were being systematically treated

differently and differently from every other employee

some point it strikes me that it would become somewhat

problematic.

Yes.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

But let's get the --

But -- and that is why it's

5

important, and it goes back to Justice Breyer's

6

question, if I can go back to that for a second,

7

because he asked about the D.C. Circuit's opinion,

8

which, you know, of course, adopted the EEOC's now-

9

discredited theory of this case and, again, untethers

10

703 from 704.

That's the problem with the D.C.

11

Circuit's interpretation.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

13

think of a million things.

14

a million, but it does seem --

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

You see, I can

I can't think literally of

I suspect you could, actually.

-- to me there are many,

18

many possible ways of really discouraging a worker from

19

complaining that are not quite as tangible as the list

20

under 703.

21

SG here, which seems like a variation of the D.C.

22

Circuit -- much -- the standards seem much -- not as

23

different as you might -- as it seems to me you're

24

saying.

25

little vaguer and a bit broader than the specific

So the D.C. Circuit -- and I think even the

MR. PHILLIPS:

That gives

Right.
It leaves it up to case-by

case.

It leaves it up to the administrative agency,

8

all in areas where I frankly don't know one lunch from

9

another.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry?
I don't know one lunch from

12

another often, but the -- the EEOC might and -- and so

13

might a judge who hears evidence.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

Justice Breyer -And that's the virtue of

their standard.
MR. PHILLIPS:

-- I mean, you can ask Mr.

18

Garre what his view is with respect to the waiting on

19

the position of the Solicitor General here.

20

But it still seems to me that there is a

21

fundamental difference between the way the D.C. Circuit

22

is analyzing this case and -- and the way this Court

23

analyzed it Ellerth.

And the fundamental difference is

24

-- I agree with you.

There are other circumstances

25

that are not tangible employment actions that are,

nevertheless, actionable under both 703 and 704, but

2

those are -- those are taken care of under the Meritor

3

standards.

4

retaliatory in purpose and that they are severe or

5

pervasive.

The -- the assumption is that they are both

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

What about the --

When you reach that standard,

then you create a question of fact for the jury.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- what about the Seventh

10

Circuit case that posed the question of same job, same

11

character of work, except that the employee had flex

12

time, which enabled her to take care of her disabled

13

child when she could leave at 3:00, and she's just

14

changed to -- same job except it's got to be 9:00 to

15

5:00.

16

Would that fit within your definition?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I doubt it actually, Justice

17

Ginsburg, because I think typically mere

18

inconveniences, even -- even significant

19

inconveniences, have traditionally been rejected as

20

bases for taking an issue to the jury.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though the jury has

22

made a finding that the only reason that was done was

23

in retaliation for her having filed a complaint.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Ginsburg, every one of

these cases is based on the assumption that the only

19

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

reason it was done is because of retaliation.

The lunch is in exactly the

same position.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you would say that's

outside --

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

So that can't be the standard.
-- that would be outside

704 if this is done deliberately in retaliation for

10

filing a complaint.

11

routine that she could easily manage and still take

12

care of her family and to one that is impossible for

13

her to manage.

14

Just switch her from a work

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Ginsburg, if you adopt

15

the other approach, what you say is that every change

16

in assignments within the ordinary course of business

17

is subject to claim by a plaintiff --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22
23

Not -- not --

-- in any situation --- not every --

-- where he or she thinks

she's been retaliated against.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not everyone, but only the

24

ones that would, in fact, deter a reasonable person

25

from filing a charge.

And that would not be every

trivial --

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

And -- and again, the problem

3

with that legal standard, Justice Ginsburg, is it is

4

not the same one that applies under section 703, and it

5

seems to me there's no reason to provide greater

6

protections under 704 to plaintiffs than you would have

7

under section 703.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't you say that

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical would be covered by the

10

Meritor standard, if in fact this woman couldn't --

11

couldn't really do the job with this -- with this new

12

time assignment?

13

sufficiently severe or persuasive --

Why wouldn't it qualify as being

21

I mean, to be sure, that's a

peculiar effect on one person, but for most people --

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

But that -- this is a

matter.

But it could be severe enough.
-- most people it wouldn't

it severe, I think, to that person?

2

the Meritor standard, is, is it severe to the

individual plaintiff?

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think that is

So you're changing your

5

answer.

6

wouldn't fit because it's the same job.

7

You originally told me that, no, that that

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Well, that's because

8

that's the tangible employment aspect of it.

Justice

9

Scalia says you're right about -- well, I don't know if

10

he said I'm right about the tangible -- tangible

11

employment aspect of it.

12

recognize, there is a second category of claims, and

13

the second category of claims is the Meritor standard,

14

which I've been arguing for.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But he says, you know, as you

Isn't a change in the hours

16

that a person works a change in the terms and

17

conditions?

18

the day shift to the -- to the night shift, isn't that

19

a change under 703?

20

You change your -- somebody's shift from

MR. PHILLIPS:

It -- it probably depends on

21

whether or not it was the expectation of the -- of the

22

employee that -- that he or she would have a certain

23

set of hours, because an awful lot of employees take a

24

job with the expectation that they'll work any hours.

25

Now, you may get into a particular pattern and -- and

22

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

even set yourself up for that, but if -- if the

2

expectation is that you were going to work potentially

3

24 hours and you shift from one set to another, that I

4

don't think is a change in terms and conditions of

5

employment within the meaning of 703.

6

If I could just shift slightly to the

7

suspension, pending investigation, part of the case.

8

And there are two parts, and it's important to

9

recognize that if the Court sets aside either one of

10

those claims, then we're entitled to a new trial

11

because the damages flow directly from both and there

12

was no specific -- there was no special verdict in this

13

case to identify what -- where the damages come from.

14

And our argument with respect to the

15

suspension, pending investigation, is that there was

16

simply no final action taken by the employer in this

context until 15 days later.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but then the question

still remains, Justice Scalia, for it to be a tangible

But it didn't -Yes, but if the employer --- it didn't cure.

I

mean, it was 37 days, right, that she went without pay?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not just 2 weeks.

And she

11

understandably experienced much stress in that time.

12

She worried about how she would be able to feed her

13

children, could she get them Christmas presents.

14

was -- there was nothing that she got, when it was

15

determined that she hadn't been insubordinate, that

16

compensated her for that stress and, indeed, for the

17

medical expense that she incurred because she had that

18

stress.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

That

Justice Ginsburg, there still

20

remains the core question of whether this is a tangible

21

employment action.

22

not an economic effect, and the fact of -- of anxiety

23

-- that happens all the time in the work place.

It's not a long-term action.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

3

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

4

Because title VII prohibits an employer from

5

suspending an employee for 37 days without pay because

6

of her sex or from reassigning her from one

7

responsibility that's material different -- materially

8

different than another responsibility because of her

9

sex, it prohibits an employer from doing so because she

10

filed an EEOC charge complaining about discrimination.

11

Title VII's anti-retaliation provision

12

creates an additional basis for unlawful

13

discrimination, but it does not create a different or

14

more expansive concept of discrimination in the

15

statute's core prohibitions.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, in -- in the

17

absence of any suggestion that the collective

18

bargaining process is also infected with sex

19

discrimination, why can't we rely on that process to

20

give some basis to the job descriptions?

21

words, forklift operator was not a separate job from

22

rail yard employee, and if the union wanted to make

23

them separate jobs, they could negotiate that, but they

to another part of a job?

2

MR. GARRE:

Well, I think the problem that

3

Justice Souter identified, I believe, where an employer

4

or even a collective bargaining agreement could

5

identify categories that had so many different

6

responsibilities --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but the

8

difference there is that's an employer unilaterally.

9

We don't have that here.

The employer is dealing with

10

the union.

11

union would categorize them differently and negotiate

12

for that.

13

If the jobs really were that different, the

materially significant change in responsibilities.

2

That's the language that comes from this --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't your approach

4

require an employer to keep shuffling the employees

5

around so they don't get a sort of adverse possession

6

of particular types of job responsibilities?

7

MR. GARRE:

I don't think so.

I think it

8

would be ultimately a jury question in this particular

9

category of claims.

As -- if -- if it were the case

10

that employees typically worked the forklift and then

11

the next day worked the -- worked the track, then the

12

next day did something else, then I don't think a jury

13

could find that there was a material -- materially

14

significant change in responsibilities.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

That's his point.

I

16

mean, that's his point, that -- that the one way to

17

avoid the problem is to keep shifting people around.

18

MR. GARRE:

Well, that -- that --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would have been

20

impossible here because there was no one in that entire

21

unit who could operate a forklift except this one

22

employee.

23

MR. GARRE:

That's right.

And -- and if --

24

if employees were shifted around for one reason or the

25

other, then I still think it would be unlikely to be a

There was testimony to that

Also, when -- when

10

Respondent was hired, they had just lost their existing

11

forklift operator, someone who had done that.

12

In any event, I don't think the evidence will

13

permit a court, if it agrees that material adverse

14

employment action is the test, to overturn the jury's

15

finding that the change here was materially adverse.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

With respect to the

suspension, what -- what if she had been -- during the

process of investigation, she had been allowed to stay

In other words, the facts are the

Well, I think most courts have

held that where you have suspension with pay, then you

Washington, DC 20005

1

don't have material adverse employment action.

2

some level, if the suspension is so long, 6 months, a

3

year, then effectively you could have a different type

4

of material adverse action, but where it's a 2-week

5

suspension to investigate, that would not be material

6

adverse action.

7

brief points out, I think, that's the favored practice

8

in the industry.

9

Now, at

In fact, as -- as the AFL-CIO amicus

Now, we -- we do think that with respect to

10

the standard, that as this Court recognized in

11

Faragher, it makes good sense to harmonize

12

discrimination standards. And here, we think that

13

Congress intended the courts to harmonize the standard

14

for section 704, the anti-retaliation provision, with

15

the standard for section 03, the act's core

16

prohibitions.

17

Justice Scalia, it does -- the section 704

18

does omit the phrase, terms, conditions of employment,

19

but as we've explained in our brief, we think it is

20

reasonable to read the discriminate against as a

21

shorthand for the unlawful employment practices

22

identified in section 703.

23

It's also important to keep in mind that

24

Congress knows how to write a broader anti-retaliation

25

statute when it wants to.

Look at the ADA, the Family

Look at the Family Medical Leave

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know if that hurts

7

you or helps you.

I mean, that -- that eliminates what

8

seems to me is the strongest argument of the -- of your

9

side, which is that it makes no sense to impose greater

10

sanctions upon somebody who -- who files a complaint

11

than it does upon somebody who -- who violates

12

somebody's race, religion, or whatever by -- by

13

discriminating.

14

MR. GARRE:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

Well, we -You're telling me it does

make sense, that we've done it in other areas.
MR. GARRE:

With respect, what I'm telling

18

you is that Congress has determined in that some areas

19

it may be important to have a broader provision

20

protecting against intimidation and coercion.

21

if the Court interprets discriminate against to include

22

all that kind of conduct, then it renders those

23

provisions redundant.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean,

Does your test cover the

person who's a former employee who complained under

32

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

title VII, wants a recommendation letter, and isn't

2

given one for retaliation -- as retaliation for having

3

complained under title VII?

4

MR. GARRE:

It does, Justice Ginsburg.

As

5

the Government explained in its brief in the Robinson

6

case, post-employment references are reasonably viewed

7

as a term, condition, or privilege of employment

8

because it's routine for employees to request them and

9

routine for employers to provide them.

10

Now, if I could address the --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. GARRE:

13

Well --

-- the reasonably likely to deter

test that you referred to, Justice Breyer.

14

If the Court disagrees with our submission

15

that the statute should be written in pari materia,

16

then as we said in our brief, we think that that is the

17

next best test to adopt.

18

-- it should be clear to the Court how much broader

19

that test is than the material adverse action test.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

But -- but the Court should

It's not -- it's not -- the

21

-- the words of the statute that I think are relevant

22

is it -- is it -- you can't discriminate with respect

23

to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges

24

of employment.

25

in 703.

Now, the words I just cited are present

So that's the substantive offense.

Those

33

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

words, as Justice Scalia pointed out and others, are

2

missing in 704, and that suggests that you could have a

3

broader definition than those words I just cited as to

4

what counts as harm flowing from a discrimination.

5

That's the statutory argument.

6

And then you add, there could be good reason

7

for that.

8

are lots of subtle forms of harm and some not so

9

subtle.

10

These people typically are at work and there

MR. GARRE:

Well, again, we think Congress

11

knows how to write that statute, and it does it

12

differently.

13

example, in the Family Medical Leave Act, not only

14

included the coercion and intimidation language, it

15

also said in any manner discriminate.

It has a different provision.

For

16

We also think, again, going to our

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD A. DONATI

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. DONATI:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
When Burlington Northern reassigned Ms. White

10

from the forklift to the track and then removed her

11

without pay for 37 days during Christmas, it, quote,

12

discriminated against Ms. White under any reasonable

13

standard, the EEOC standard, the plain language

14

standard, or the standard that the unanimous en banc

15

court of the Sixth Circuit adopted.

16

the Court applies, Ms. White should prevail, if it's a

17

reasonable standard, other than that of the -- of the

18

Petitioner.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Whatever standard

What if she'd been

20

operating the forklift for only a week and then she was

21

reassigned?

22

any standard?

23

Would that still be discrimination under

MR. DONATI:

With respect to the motivation,

24

if there -- if there was a motivation, a retaliatory

25

motivation, according to the proper reading of 704, it

would be because what that aims at is motivation.
And the question was asked, and -- and a

3

legitimate question was asked.

4

704(a) more expansive than 703?

5

the text of 704(a) at the beginning of the caption, it

6

says, discriminate in assisting, participating, or

7

cooperating with enforcement.

9

Why would Congress make
Well, if you look at

This -- this provision, as the dissent said
in the Jackson case last term, in referring to

10

retaliation, the dissent made this -- made this point

11

about the relationship between retaliation and the

12

primary right.

13

right is being protected by the retaliation provision,

14

that without the retaliation provision, the primary

15

right could be impeded, inhibited, and prevented from

16

individuals having access to the remedial mechanisms.

17

The dissent indicated that the primary

It doesn't take much to intimidate an

18

individual from filing a claim of discrimination if

19

they have an economic interest.

20

less to intimidate a witness to come and testify when

21

they have no basis.

It takes much, much

22

What 704 was aimed at was allowing the law

23

enforcement agency here, the EEOC, to have access to

24

complaints about discrimination and witnesses, allowing

25

the courts to have access to complaints and witnesses

38

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

because without that free access and without 704 acting

2

as a guardian around the primary rights, the primary

3

rights would be eviscerated.

This is a perfect example of -- of a case

criterion that is going to stop every little thing from

MR. DONATI:

There are several things that

23

are built into the statute.

First is 701(b).

24

to be an act of the employer, and those trivial matters

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

2

almost any act of his subordinates will be deemed act

3

of the -- of the employer where retaliation is

4

concerned, I'll bet you.

5

What else besides that?

6

MR. DONATI:

Plus, you always have to show

7

causation, and many, many cases are dismissed on the

8

basis of summary judgment, even termination cases on

9

the basis of causation.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'll give you causation.

11

But I'm talking about the triviality -- the

12

triviality of the action in question.

13

that eliminates a trivial action from the aggrieved

14

employee who -- who wants to litigate?

15

MR. DONATI:

MR. DONATI:
