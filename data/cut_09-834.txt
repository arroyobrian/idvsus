ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. KASTER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KASTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

When Kevin Kasten told his employer that the

12

location of the time clocks was illegal and that if they

13

were taken to the court they would lose, he filed any

14

complaint within the meaning of the 215(a)(3) under the

15

Fair Labor Standards Act, because filing includes an

16

oral communication, because "any" means any, which

17

includes formal or informal, written or unwritten

18

communications.

19

designed to have a broad construction under section 2 of

20

the statute 202 and under Mitchell v. DeMario and the

21

Tennessee Coal case.

22

And the words in the statute were

I would like to begin with the Tennessee

23

Coal case, Tennessee Coal v. Muscoda.

24

interpreted "work" in a broad fashion to include the

25

time in a mine when workers were moving from one place
3

Alderson Reporting Company

The Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to another, not actually engaged in physical labor.

2

In interpreting work that way, the Court

3

said that the act is not to be interpreted in a narrow,

4

grudging fashion.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me give you this

6

example.

7

that if you want to make a complaint, there's a

8

particular supervisor you should go to.

9

they say you can make this complaint in writing, you can

10
11

Suppose a company has an established policy

And let's say

make it orally.
Now, there's -- something's going on in the

12

workplace and the supervisor happens to be walking by,

13

maybe a machine is broken, an employee has been hurt,

14

and an employee walks up to the supervisor who is

15

walking briskly by, taps the supervisor on the shoulder

16

and says the company is violating the Fair Labor

17

Standards Act because of the placement of a clock.

18

said that filing has no formality requirement.

19

that be the filing of a complaint?

20

MR. KASTER:

You

Would

I think it would, Your Honor.

21

I don't think that the fact that the employer has a

22

policy that says you do it on Tuesday morning would

23

control what the statute says one way or the other, so I

24

think it would constitute a filing.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you mean that if the

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government says you've got to file a complaint with us

2

by either calling us or submitting something in writing,

3

and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government

4

employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company

5

is violating the law.

6

That that's enough?

MR. KASTER:

I don't -- you know, I don't

7

believe that that's -- in the context of a non-work

8

environment, Your Honor, I would note that, I don't know

9

exactly the answer to the Court's question, to be

10

honest.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The reason I'm asking

12

that question is related to Justice Alito's question,

13

which is, what does filing a complaint mean?

14

have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the

15

person that you are reporting this to?

16

MR. KASTER:

Filing means directing it to

17

somebody who can do something about it.

18

necessarily have to be.

19

Does it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it doesn't

Well, at a cocktail

20

party that employee may be there on personal time, but

21

when he goes back to work the next morning he could do

22

something.

23

Is that enough?
MR. KASTER:

Well, it may be.

If it's

24

directed towards the responsible party, then it would be

25

filing a complaint.

So it could occur outside of
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

work -

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what you are doing is

3

he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way

4

that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in

5

writing.

6

oral procedure even if it chose not to?

7

thought an oral procedure would create havoc, et cetera,

8

et cetera?

9

We are now forcing the Government to adopt an

MR. KASTER:

Even if it

If the person is directing the

10

complaint to the Government and communicates that to the

11

responsible party who can do something about it, I think

12

that they are filing a complaint, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's one thing to say that

14

filing doesn't necessarily mean that something is

15

written, although that's usually what the word means,

16

isn't it?

It can often mean a written

You are?

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the ordinary usage of

3

But to say that it includes no degree of

Well, Your Honor, I would say

there are no formal requirements for the filing.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If that's the law and the

6

employee gets fired and the employee says, well, this

7

was done in retaliation for my having filed an FSLA

8

complaint three weeks ago, and the employer says what

We have no record of any such complaint and

10

the employee says, oh, yes, I said it orally to a

11

supervisor who was passing by and my buddy Joe was there

12

and he's going to corroborate this.

So now we have a

have an office.

In terms of the formality of

He doesn't have

That's where he communicates with people.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Why do you feel the need to

13

go beyond, say, what the AFL-CIO identifies as a normal

14

oral failing -- filing?

15

initial stage of the grievance procedure, there is

16

confrontation with an eye to fact finding, and the

17

dispute is joined when the employee or the steward or

18

supervisor come face-to-face to identify, to discuss,

19

and hopefully to resolve a problem.

20

They use language like, at the

Now that's a formal kind of relationship.

21

It doesn't involve a cocktail party, and yet it is done

22

orally.

23

But from you've said, I gather that you want to go well

24

beyond that and provide that cocktail parties -- perhaps

25

not cocktail parties, but just a tap on the shoulder

And there is a tradition as to how that works.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

would be sufficient, where I take it that would normally

2

be sufficient in the grievance process.

3

MR. KASTER:

The grievance process, Your

4

Honor, a grievance process is a formal process, and so I

5

wouldn't compare the average workplace -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Suppose I think

7

that that provides a good precedent for -- for oral

8

filings.

9

in your case?

10

What happens then?

MR. KASTER:

What am I supposed to do

Your Honor, in the general

11

proposition we would be accepting of the Scrivener rule

12

that the Court adopted in the '70s, that is that the

13

filing of a charge includes those things that happened

14

orally prior to and around the time of the filing of the

15

charge.

16

That's what this is about.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, we are talking about a

17

filing.

18

repeat it, but it seems to me form having read the brief

19

that filing takes place without writing, provided that

20

there are these other safeguards which are described.

21

In the grievance process -- I don't want to

Now, I want to know in your opinion, is

22

there a reason for not importing that into this system?

I don't know what

MR. KASTER:

In terms of the formality of

requirements, the Court may adopt formal requirements.

3

The employer certainly did, Mr. Kasten followed those.

4

What I am looking at are the words of the statute that

There is a word "filing" in

the AFL-CIO statute as well.

So I am looking for a way

Are you against that?

Do you

If so, why or why

not?

11

MR. KASTER:

In terms of the procedure that

12

they adopt, Your Honor, that may be an acceptable

13

procedure.

14

statutory language in the case.

15
16

The thing that I am looking at is the

17

MR. KASTEN:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

And there wasn't -- he

He didn't -
In this case, he didn't

invoke the grievance procedure.

20

MR. KASTER:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So that would keep you

22

out, if that were the test, that you have to formally

23

invoke the grievance procedure.

24

every other time the word "file" is used in this Act,

25

Fair Labor Standards Act, it refers to a writing.

But we are told that

10

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

so you are urging a meaning that deviates from the

2

standard meaning of the term in the very Act at issue.

3
4

MR. KASTER:

I don't think I am doing that,

Your Honor, with all due respect.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there another

6

provision where the word file is used to mean something

7

other than a writing.

8
9

MR. KASTER:

It means, according to the

first enforcement action back in 1961, it means submit

10

or lodge, Your Honor.

11

own policies use it to describe a verbal communication

12

by protecting against retaliation for somebody who has

13

filed a complaint for sexual harassment.

14

it in a manner that -- as an example to obviously

15

include both verbal and written communications.

16

I would note that the defendant's

I mean, you can talk about a grievance
I suppose there's always one in -- in

Your -- the -- the Respondent is -- is going
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to argue that this statute doesn't apply to private

2

filings of complaints anyway, that it relates only to

3

the filing of a complaint with the government.

4

that -- that's a new -- a new point in this case, and

5

normally I would not be disposed to consider it.

And

6

My problem is, I cannot decide on -- on the

7

question of whether filing means filing only in writing

8

or also includes verbal filing, without resolving that

9

other question.

That is to say, if indeed the complaint

10

has to be quote, "filed" with the government, I'm

11

inclined to think that an oral complaint pursuant to

12

procedures established by the agency which permit an

13

oral complaint, even a complaint by telephone that would

14

be okay.

15

But my goodness, if it applies to private

16

employers as well including employers that have no

17

grievance procedures, including employers who have

18

employees who go to cocktail parties, I am -- I am very

19

disinclined to think that it -- that it could mean an

20

oral complaint in -- in that context.

21

MR. KASTER:

Your Honor, I'm just looking at

22

the statutory language -- file "any complaint."

23

important -- the word "any" has a particular meaning.

24

would not that if -

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's

What does file -- what

that.

Now come on, people don't talk like

MR. KASTER:

If I submit or lodge, that is

asserting a statutory right.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

MR. KASTEN:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

Well, I'd like to go

I am not asserting -
I would like to go back to

the question Justice Scalia filed just earlier.

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what would you say

21

about his point that it seems to me had substantial

22

merit?

23

interpretation of what filing means might well depend on

24

whether filing in -- or a complaint includes

25

intracompany complaints, the grumbling of an employee

It - it's really our determination -- our

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and so forth; and I recognize this -- this argument

2

comes up late.

3

other circuits?

4

Has it been addressed in any of the

MR. KASTER:

Yes, Your Honor.

There has

5

been -- a number of the circuits have interpreted this

6

statute and included -- the Ninth Circuit, the First

7

Circuit, the Tenth Circuit have all -

8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All have said that

intracompany complaints -
MR. KASTER:

Intracompany complaints; that

11

is true as well in the Sixth Circuit.

12

to talk about the cases where that hasn't been true -

13

in Memphis Barbecue, the Fourth Circuit; in Genesee

14

Hospital, the Second Circuit.

15

Barbecue case really addresses the testimonial clause.

16

And it's easier

Memphis --the Memphis

Genesee Hospital is the only case in the

17

Second Circuit where they have held that all complaints

18

need to go to the Department of Labor.

19

would say about that particular argument, Your Honor.

20

Is it makes superfluous instituted proceeding.

21

superfluous instituted proceeding which -- or cause to

22

be instituted.

23

The one thing I

It makes

If you file a complaint -- it - then -- with

24

the Department of Labor, their argument is, and I think

25

it's true, that you institute a proceeding.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute would be redundant, and "file any complaint"

2

would cover a null set.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure that's true.

4

You -- you can complain orally to somebody at the Labor

5

Department who decides that the complaint isn't serious

6

enough to -- to warrant commencing a proceeding.

7

mean, if you go in and insist, I -- you know, I want to

8

begin a proceeding, that's -- that's something else.

9

But you can file a complaint orally without -- without

10

I

doing that, it seems to me.

11

MR. KASTER:

Well, Your Honor, if you have

12

made the phone call and started the process I think you

13

have instituted a proceeding.

14

what stage of formality it gets to, I'm not sure, Your

15

Honor, but I think you have begun the process of

16

instituting a proceeding or causing it to be instituted.

17

That's one.

18

Now whether it gets -- at

The other thing I -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not if it's never

21

of having caused a proceeding to be instituted.

22

MR. KASTEN:

There's a -
So if you make an informal

a proceeding, but -- but this company is just, you know,

4

That's -- I'm 00 I'm prepared to say that's

filing a complaint, if you are only talking about filing

about oral filings of the complaints with employer, I am

For instance, the NLRB has found that if, you know,

employees are complaining to each other, that they can't

to write to be able to get this right so it will not be

job.

23

The Government sees these statutes as a whole, so

MR. WALL:

I -- I think the kind of indicia

24

or formality you are talking about are signs that the

25

employer has submitted to his employer an assertion of
19

statutory rights under the FLSA.

2

two things that the lower courts have consistently

looked to.

good sign that the employer has, but they are not the

5

only sign.

6

I think those are the

And I think those indicia of formality are a

If I walk into the happy hour and I have

7

actually written down on a form that my employer

8

promulgates and I hand it off to my supervisor -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, fill in

10

this blank then, there must be surrounding the oral

11

complaint sufficient elements of formality such that -

12

MR. WALL:

That the employer has -- the

13

employee has indicated to his employer, someone in

14

supervisory authority, that he is asserting statutory

15

rights under the FLSA.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if he just says

17

to the employer, "You know, I think we ought to have a

18

little more time to put on our gear," is that an

19

assertion of statutory rights under the FLSA?

20

MR. WALL:

21

a difficult question.

22

here, because this isn't a content case.

23

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that's
I don't think it is presented

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, I know, but the

24

idea -- one of the objections to your position is that

25

it's going to be very hard to figure out in any
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

particular case what is a filing an oral complaint under

2

the FLSA, because one, it's got to be reconstructed,

3

unlike the situation where you had have a government

4

agency that's doing it, or you have a written complaint;

5

and second of all, it's -- it's unclear perhaps for the

6

employer to know that he's being charged with a

7

violation of the FLSA.

8
9
10

MR. WALL:

But that question comes up in

every case, whether the complaint is written or oral to
the Government or an employer.

11

If I write down -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if it's

12

written -- if it's written, you have got a document that

13

people can look like -- look at, whether it's the NLRB

14

or a court, that -- that they can look at and say, yes,

15

this is a -- an assertion of a violation.

MR. WALL:

17

promulgated by my employer I don't like where the time

MR. WALL:

expressed language or regulation, so for instance, the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is the rule -- your -- your -- Mr. Kaster's

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me go back to the

10

example I started out with.

supervisor is going to attend to the hurt worker, and an

12

employee says, the company is violating the FLSA.

13

the supervisor says, don't tell me, and don't tell me

14

about it now.

15

A worker has been hurt, a

I'm doing something else.

MR. WALL:

And

That's enough?

I think the test, Justice Alito,

16

is whether the employee has submitted a complaint to his

17

employer that has put the employer on notice that that

18

employee is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA,

19

claiming that he is legally entitled to something he is

20

not receiving.

21

If the supervisor walks in the next morning

22

and says to his boss, yesterday morning while I was

23

attending to the plant accident, Joe told me that the

24

time clocks are in the wrong place.

I think we need to fire him, he's a troublemaker.

goes to the boss and says, boss, you ought to do

there.

listening to my colleagues on the other side, it will be

quite clear that this is an inherently unworkable

standard that they asked us to adopt under these -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why is it inherently

unworkable here in any greater extent that it is

unworkable in all of the other statutes where oral

I don't know that it is

13

necessarily any worse in this particular context.

think what it suggests is that the Congress that looked

at this problem, which as Justice Scalia pointed out was

the 1938 Congress, and what that Congress was saying is

we are taking a very dramatic step.

narrow reading of any complaint?

But why should we read their language with a

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think you have to

read their language as the way it was written and as the

25

way they would have understood it at the time, which was
27

Alderson Reporting Company

1

to file any complaint, which as it would have been

2

understood in '38 and frankly after that, when you file

a complaint that usually entails some notion of

formality and when you put it in the context of a

5

specific provision where it is not only filing a

6

complaint, but institute any proceeding, caused any

proceeding to be instituted, justify any proceeding.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would it work if they

2

instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding

3

required itself to start orally?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't -- the truth is, if

5

the employer envisions in its mind that it is

6

instituting a proceeding, that's still not a proceeding

7

within the meaning of what Congress meant in 1938.

8

had in mind an official action by a government agency.

9

And no private employer is ever going to institute a

10

It

proceeding within the meaning of that particular scheme.

11

You know, it's extremely important in the

12

context of this particular statute, and the one thing I

13

should have answered, Justice Sotomayor, to your

14

question is, what's different about this statute than

15

any other?

16

it.

This statute carries a criminal penalty with

And no other retaliation statute except for one -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is a protection

18

built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability

19

only if it's willful.

20

liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, you

21

certainly don't have to prove willful, you just prove a

22

violation.

23

And on the civil side, the civil

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but the reality is

24

that this Court held in the CIT case that the Court

25

would not construe this statute broadly in order to
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

expose people to potential criminal liabilities.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wouldn't any retaliatory

3

action be willful?

4

means you are firing this person because of the

5

complaint.

6

I mean, to say it's in retaliation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is whether

7

the violation is willful.

The willful qualification in

8

the criminal context is are you willfully denying your

9

workers the wages and hours the statute requires?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12
13

Right.
Nothing to do with

retaliation.
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I -- well, it does have

14

something to do with retaliation, but, Justice Ginsburg,

15

it seems to me it's all of a piece, though.

16

reason why you can be comfortable with a willfulness

17

standard even which extends to conscious disregard

18

beyond the intent as well, but the reason why you can be

19

comfortable with that is if you look at the way the

20

statute is crafted in terms of the retaliation provision

21

itself, it speaks specifically to formal actions that

22

are taken, the filing of a complaint, the institution of

23

a proceeding.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because the

Do you know, how common

is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the Fair Labor Standards Act?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't believe -- I mean,

3

it's not a null set, but I don't believe it's a

4

particularly, I don't think it's a large number of

5

proceedings.

6

understand what the Congress of 1938 would have done and

7

trying to understand why it would have approached this

8

in a narrow way, and why this provision is aimed not

9

generally to protect workers, but is aimed really to

But it seems to me, though, in trying to

10

make sure that information gets to the Federal

11

Government.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the whole

13

idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I

14

would like you to address particularly the amici's

15

point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many

16

were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many

17

were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language,

18

for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have

19

meant that all complaints are okay?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Let me start by saying, first

21

of all, even if the FLSA has broadly a pro employee

22

protective purpose, it's still important to recognize

23

that the retaliation provision we are talking about here

24

specifically did not provide a cause of action, a

25

private cause of action until 1977.
31

Alderson Reporting Company

So that when

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress enacted this statute in 1938, it didn't say boo

2

about allowing the employees to show up in court and to

3

assert their rights.

4

expansive, grant rights to the employee's portion of

5

this legislation.

6

This is not part of that

And then second, Justice Ginsburg, with

7

respect to the specifics of what did Congress have in

8

mind, it seems to me the better way to evaluate this is

9

not did Congress have in mind a group of illiterate

10

employees or not, but what language did Congress use in

11

trying to formulate the specific provision that gives

12

rise to the protections against retaliation.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your case would be a lot

14

easier if you didn't try to have it both ways, to say,

15

number one, it only applies to filing a complaint with

16

the Government.

17

applies to written complaints to the Government.

18

mean, why don't you -

19
20
21

And number two, you say, it also only

MR. PHILLIPS:

I

I will take the former

argument, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why don't you give a break

22

to the illiterate and let them file oral complaints with

23

the Government?

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, my guess is the truth

is they will be able to file oral complaints with the
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government because, the only thing that is left open is

2

the precise hypothetical you gave, Justice Scalia, where

3

you make an oral complaint and nothing gets instituted

4

in those circumstances.

5

the Federal Government's authority to simply adopt a

6

rule that says any time anybody makes an oral complaint

7

to us we will institute a proceeding.

8

adopted that view, I don't think there is anything we

9

could do about it.

10

And it seems to me, clearly, in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if the agency

Suppose it says we won't

11

necessarily institute a proceeding, but we will regard

12

it as a complaint?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I mean, my own view is

14

the better way of reading -- that is a much closer case,

15

I will concede that, Justice Scalia.

16

that when you talking about file a complaint, that is

17

just not the way Congress ordinarily thinks about file a

18

complaint.

19

sorry.

20

My own view is

File always has in mind written -- I'm

Justice Scalia's

very common.

23

complaints and then the EEOC considers whether it's

24

going to institute a proceeding or not.

25

For example, the EEOC, people often file

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.
33


Alderson Reporting Company

And I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

quarrelling with that.

2

the truth is, you know, I think for another day the

3

issue will arise and the Court can decide whether or not

4

a mere oral complaint to a government agency is

5

sufficient to file a complaint within the meaning of

6

this statute.

7

I mean, I understand that.

And

I do think it is fundamentally important for

8

this Court to decide the underlying question of whether

9

oral complaints are sufficient only in the context in

10

the first instance of deciding whether or not it has to

11

go to a government agency as opposed to any kind of

12

private or intracorporate activity.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, the vast majority of

22

those statutes talk about any action that -- opposing a

23

practice, and therefore they deal with a lot of

24

intracorporate activities, and obviously at some point

25

there is an issue as to sort of what the employer's

intent is and how far it got up the ladder -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is it -- so in those

complaints count as opposing any practice.

5

6

an oral complaint to my supervisor, and supervisor said

7

I never heard of it?

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Has there

Well, I suspect that issue

comes up almost every day, and it is a problem; but it's

10

a problem that Congress made a judgment that we would

11

rather go ahead and allow those matters to be litigated;

12

and language that is very expansive in protecting

13

employees from retaliation.

14

at that at times as a managing partner of a law firm, I

15

recognize that that is the judgment that Congress made.

And while I -- I may chafe

16

Here we are talking about a Congress that

17

made a very different judgment about how it wanted to

18

protect retaliation.

19

made, it seems to me, very much in the context of 1938.

20

Justice Sotomayor, you are very right; they were not

21

sure they even had constitutional authority to be

22

adopting this approach; and they are attaching to it

23

criminal sanctions, and they are not providing a private

24

right of action; and in that context it seems to me that

25

this Court should comfortably say that this is a much

And it was a judgment that was

35

narrower proposition.

What about Justice

Ginsburg's question?

6

In 1938 a lot of illiterate people couldn't have filed

written complaints.

recognized that fact, and -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if they did, isn't it

11

reasonable to think that they would have included in

12

filing, in such circumstances, oral filing?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, because if under those

14

circumstances when you're going to impose criminal

15

sanctions on somebody, you're going to say we are not

16

going to do that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You may not want to give up

your first point.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't want to give up

5

either of the points, actually.

6

Justice Breyer, the question presented is -- is very

7

broad.

8

governmental entity is fairly -

But the bottom line is,

I mean, the question of whether this goes to a

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Then it's odd that

10

you say -- it -- I gather, as well, for about 50 or

11

60 years the relevant agencies have interpreted the -

12

the statute the way that -- to include oral complaints.

13

And that seems to me a fairly strong reason

14

for continuing to do so, if -- where the language is

15

so -- allows it and there aren't any strong reasons the

16

other way.

17
18

MR. PHILLIPS:

there's 50 or 60 years of allowing oral complaints -

19
20
21
22

Well, I don't know that

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe it's 30 years.

Maybe

it's 30.
MR. PHILLIPS:

-- to be in the -- in the

private context.

23

There may be 50 to 60 years of allowing oral

24

complaints being brought to the government agency, which

25

I do think would go to Justice Scalia's point, but with
37

respect to intracorporate communications there is no

2

60-year practice -

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do we owe any deference to

the Government's position on this point?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I would not give any

6

deference to the Government's position.

7

Chevron deference because this is not a -

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Certainly not

Well, Chevron deference

would depend on an intent.

I guess you are getting into

10

an argument here that there's no reason to repeat in

11

public.

12

agree on this.

I mean, Justice Scalia and I don't necessarily

13

Why would you -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, regardless of

14

whether we do, why -- why don't you think we --we have

15

to give any deference, Chevron -- Chevron deference.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean I -- yes.

17

There is no Chevron deference -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Why?
-- because this is not a

20

matter that has been allocated to either the EEOC or the

21

Secretary of Labor to administer and to adopt

22

regulations.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do we know?

I mean,

24

all right, if you want to get into it, this is a very

25

minor sort of interstitial point in a statute that they
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

administer, and there are lots of instances, I think

2

where the Court has said, where these minor matters of

3

how you work out the actual application of the word are

4

implicitly delegate it to the agency to determine within

5

the context of reasonable view.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Justice Breyer, that

7

would strike me as a more persuasive argument if

8

Congress hadn't -- hadn't delegated to the Secretary of

9

Labor specific rulemaking authority with respect to

10

specific provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and

11

does not have a similar provision in connection with

12

section 215(a).

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But not everything has to

14

be done through formal rules.

15

many ways of agencies determining practice.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

There -- there are many,

Right.

But -- agency

17

decisionmaking, but we don't have that either.

18

have here are certain enforcement actions that are being

19

brought by the agency and indeed, if you look at the

20

enforcement actions, they all ultimately tie to some

21

official action by some government entity.

22

actions that -- that you can go back to say I am going

23

to defer to this, go into the circumstance we are

24

talking about here, where it's a purely private action

25

as opposed to some kind of a public -

I would give it no weight at

But even if you gave it weight -

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not even Skidmore?

-- its persuasive weight, its

7

persuasive weight as applied on a private side is

8

nonexistent.

9

before -- if the -

10

You know, again, if -- if the issue were

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

Why would it be

11

different?

If an agency work out a system of deciding

12

when a person is really making a complaint, as opposed

13

to an offhand remark, and that is good enough to run the

14

government of the United States, where they have -

15

where they are in this business, why -- why couldn't

16

whatever their indicia are there, also be transplanted

17

to the private sector -

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Well, it might be -
-- and get that to work out

all right -

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but we don't have -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- in which case you would

23

be left, if you are going to say that might work,

24

then -- the you are left with the simple argument that

25

you don't think that this statute means to apply to
40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

complaints to an employer, written or oral?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I think the answer

3

to that question is you don't have anywhere near the

4

50 years of practice dealing with the specific

5

hypothetical you posed, Justice Breyer.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

think -- that a tenable interpretation?

8

is that written complaints are good enough to count as

9

filings where you complained to your private employer,

Would you accept -- you
What this means

10

but written or oral count as a filing where you deal to

11

-- with the government agency?

12
13

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, I don't think that's

the most natural way -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, it isn't.
-- to read this statute.

And

16

I think the right way to read the statute is to either

17

say -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, I agree with you.
-- that a -- that an oral

20

complaint is -- is not sufficient, but if -- but I don't

21

think you have to decide that issue.

22

way to decide this case and the more fundamental one; it

23

is the one Justice Scalia was coming back to, is does it

24

apply beyond the government agency context?

25

that isn't -
41

Alderson Reporting Company

I think the better

And if

MR. PHILLIPS:

It -- it's in

It wasn't brought up

5

specifically in the brief in opposition.

6

hand, it was clearly presented and decided by the

7

Seventh Circuit, so it was in the case as it came to

8

this Court; and this Court's rule is that you can defend

9

the judgment on any ground that's fairly presented.

On the other

10

-- and this ground seems to me more than fairly

11

presented, since it -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

On the ground itself, is

13

there anything in the legislative history of the statute

14

that says it's limited to the government?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the -- yes -- if you go

16

back to the legislative history there is a colloquy

17

between the two Senators, and I recognize some members

18

of the Court are unenthusiastic -- but -- but you know,

19

in that colloquy, they talk about malicious complaints,

20

and it seems to me malicious in that context is talking

21

about where you have essentially defamed your employer

22

through a government agency.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

That could be.

It could be

24

that they are thinking of malicious complaints and they

25

are thinking of government agencies at the time, but
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

neither their language nor their purpose, as history

2

later shows, requires that limitation on scope.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think if you are

4

going back and trying to figure out what the Congress of

5

1938 had in mind, the best way to do that is to look at

6

the language chosen and the company that that language

7

keeps.

8

you file a -- you talk about instituting a proceeding or

9

causing a proceeding to be instituted, or testifying at

And when you take about filing a complaint and

10

a proceeding that's formal, or belonging to a -- to a

11

company committee that is again, a governmentally

12

instituted methodology, the best way to read that is to

13

say what they have in mind is an official government

14

action of some sort.

15

And it makes perfect -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How would it -- how would

16

it relate to, say, an equal pay complaint?

17

equal pay is formally part of the Fair -

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because

It is tied to this.

-- Labor Standards Act.

20

But an equal pay complaint could also be brought as a

21

Title VII suit.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So a -- a worker just

24

complains about the denial of equal pay to the

25

supervisor.

Does that -- is that -
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

I have no doubt that an

2

employee under those circumstances if -- if discharged

3

would be able to make a claim under Title VII of

4

retaliation for that particular conduct.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And there's been -- you

6

said there was no evidence of the government for

7

60 years -- but there has been some 30 years or more

8

experience under Title VII of the statutes, with oral

9

complaints to the employer as being sufficient to ground

10
11

a retaliation claim.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And I -- I think the

12

key to this process, Justice Ginsburg, is what lens you

13

are looking at.

14

yellowed glass that I am looking through from 1938, or

15

the glass as it looks through in 2010, and the truth is

16

if you were going to adopt -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

Are you looking through the cracked and

But it really -- it

starts in 1970.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry?

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

It starts in the 1970s.

To be sure, Justice Ginsburg,

22

but the -- but the -- this statute was enacted in 1938,

23

and it was enacted as fairly radical and made an -- an

24

initial incursion from protecting people from

25

rehabilitation.

It doesn't purport to be as expansive
44

Alderson Reporting Company

1

as any of the subsequent -- and the truth is -- can I

2

make this point?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How long have collective

bargaining arbitration agreements been in existence.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Since the Federal Arbitration

6

Act -- well, it actually probably predates the Federal

7

Arbitration Act.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

How old?

Oh, it would have been back

around the same period of time, in the 1930s.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think that when

12

Congress wrote or caused to be instituted any proceeding

13

under or related to this chapter, that they intended to

14

exclude that proceeding and intended to exclude people

15

who testified in that proceeding about a violation of

16

the statute?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

I don't -- I believe

18

that proceeding is used in the Fair Labor Standards Act

19

consistently throughout the statute to talk about

20

Government -- official Government actions and not

21

simply -

22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you point me to

something in the act that defines "proceedings" -

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, nothing.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- "related" -- the

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

words "proceedings related to this chapter," as limited

2

only to Government proceedings?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, that -- in the

4

brief we identified a number of places where Congress

5

uses the word "proceedings," and every place where they

6

use the word "proceedings" they have in mind an official

7

Government activity.

8

reasonable -- logical way to read this particular

9

language as incorporating that.

10

And so I think it is the most

Of course, even if that were true, even if

11

you would preserve that, that still wouldn't be a basis

12

for going forward with this case, because there was no

13

proceeding that was instituted pursuant to the informal

14

actions that were taken.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then we're back to if

16

Congress meant filing any complaints, either oral or in

17

writing.

I'm asking a different question, which is -

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

I understand that, but I'm -

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That Congress's intent

20

was not to protect a worker who publicly took an oath in

21

front of an arbitrator and testified about a violation

22

of law, that they would not have considered that

23

retaliatory under the statute.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I do not believe they would

have regarded that as retaliatory under the statute
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because of the fact that the way this is all set up is

2

the -- and the -- it's just the narrowness of the Fair

3

Labor Standards Act.

4

And, Justice Ginsburg, to your question

5

about the subsequent legislation that has all been

6

enacted, it seems to me in a lot of ways that that

7

reinforces the core interpretive approach that I have

8

taken in this case, because if it were absolutely clear

9

that the language about filing a complaint and

10

instituting a proceeding were as broad as -- certainly

11

as the Petitioner proposes in this case, where any kind

12

of oral grumbling is sufficient, Congress never would

13

have needed to deviate from that template and all the

14

legislation that came afterwards.

15

And there are tons of statutes that say:

16

File a complaint, institute a proceeding, and otherwise

17

oppose.

18

Congress to do that if this language would have

19

accomplished precisely the same thing.

20

And there would have been no reason for

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's more of a question

21

for the Petitioner's counsel than you, but are you aware

22

of any cases in any other jurisdictions where there have

23

been proceedings, actions for retaliation, based on

24

complaints to third parties, like complaining to the

25

press?
47

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'm sure there are such

2

cases, Your Honor.

I mean, I doubt -- it probably

3

wouldn't come up so much in the Fair Labor Standards Act

4

process.

5

narrow sweep to it.

And that's the problem:

6

This has got a fairly

Obviously, wage and hours is not a

7

significant activity, but it doesn't tend to generate

8

the same kind of intensity that you might expect out of

9

Title VII or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act or

10

some of the other provisions.

11
12

If there are no further questions, Your
Honors, I would ask the Court to affirm the judgment.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Just one more question.

Sure.
It seems to me you are

16

saying the only complaint that counts is the one to the

17

Government.

18

Isn't -- in the work setting that's being

19

regulated, wouldn't there be every reason to want the

20

employee to complain first to the employer rather than

21

making a Federal case out of it by complaining to a

22

Government agency?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Intuitively, I don't disagree

24

with that, Justice Ginsburg, but we have to go, again:
