ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MS. MILLETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals in this case had

10
11

jurisdiction to adjudicate the appeal, but in doing so,

12

it decided the case wrongly.

13

Mr. Gonzalez's petition for habeas corpus

14

was timely because it was filed within a year of the

15

conclusion of direct appellate proceedings in the State

16

court and at the -- within a year of that court's ending

17

of his appeal process.

18

With respect to jurisdiction, jurisdiction

19

existed because a certificate of appealability was

20

issued.

21

denial of a constitutional right.

22

It rested upon a substantial showing of the

To be sure, the judge in issuing that

23

certificate did not identify the substantial

24

constitutional question required by 2253(c)(3).

25

a requirement.

It is mandatory, but it is not
3

Alderson Reporting Company

That is

Official

jurisdictional. 


2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if he had 


3

identified a constitutional issue, speedy trial issue? 


4

Does that give the court the authority to consider a 


5

different constitutional issue, a Fourth Amendment

6

issue?

7

MS. MILLETT:

Yes, it does.

Once -- this is

8

a gatekeeping function to identify which case, which

9

appeals should go forward and claim the attention of the

10

court.

11

page -- excuse me -- page 3a of the appendix to the blue

12

brief.

13

and if a certificate is issued, appeals may go forward.

14

The operative language here in (c)(1) is that this is

15

about an appeal going forward.

16

But the text of the statute and 22 -- that's on

It provides that an appeal may not go forward,

So, once the certificate identifies issues,

17

the appeal goes forward.

18

certification of questions comes to an appellate court,

19

and they decide whether to take interlocutory review.

20

Once they do, they're not bound to just those questions.

21

The entire order comes up for review.

22

It's much like 1292(b), where

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, what if it

23

identifies something that is not remotely a Federal

24

constitutional issue?

25

quite clear, you know, whether it is a State law issue or

There's no constitutional plausibility

2

on the face of it.

3

It -- it works in the sense

5

that it's not a jurisdictional bar to going forward.

provision is a requirement for the validity of the

24

certificate of appealability.

MS. MILLETT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MS. MILLETT:

Isn't that right?

I don't agree that the

5

so-called content validity of a document that is post

6

hoc certifying a gatekeeping requirement is itself

7

jurisdictional, because there is a --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, let's take the Fourth

Amendment, I mean, which says, "no warrants shall issue,

10

but upon probable cause."

11

on, "supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly

12

describing the place to be searched and the persons or

13

things to be seized."

14

does not meet those requirements of being supported by

15

oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the --

16
17
18
19
20

Okay?

So -- but then it goes

Is the warrant valid if indeed it

MS. MILLETT:

No, a warrant may well not be

valid if it doesn't -JUSTICE SCALIA:

It won't be valid.

It will

just be invalid.
MS. MILLETT:

But the certificate of

21

appealability is invalid as matter of law here.

22

incorrect -- it's an incorrect action by the court.

23

That doesn't make it jurisdictional.

24

warrants aren't jurisdictional, either, in that sense.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's an

It's just --

Just to take a kind of nutty

2

piece of paper and typed the words "certificate of

3

appealability" on top and issued it.

4

to take the appeal?

5

MS. MILLETT:

Still jurisdiction

Still jurisdiction to take the

6

appeal.

7

either the court of appeals judges or the State,

8

which -- both of which have every incentive to check on

9

these things, to raise the issue.

10

Of course, one would expect -- one would expect

But the question

is when something happens --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, what counts as a

12

certificate of appealability is I guess the question.

13

All you need is those three words, and then you have a

14

certificate of appealability --

15

MS. MILLETT:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

Well, I think it --- such that jurisdiction

attaches?

18

MS. MILLETT:

No, there's more to it.

I

19

mean, it's not issued by the clerk's office, right?

The

20

statute requires a judge to do this, a Federal judge,

21

circuit judge or justice -- circuit justice -- to issue

22

this.

23

sworn to uphold the law and the Constitution.

24

they do this, when they make these determinations, they

25

aren't handing these out like candy; they're deciding

And these are -- these are officials who are

1

that their court, their colleagues, maybe themselves,

2

should invest resources in this process.

3

So, the fact that a certificate is issued is

4

not simply a piece of paper coming out.

5

fair to presume that it is a deliberate determination by

6

a judicial officer.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

I think it is

Well, under Justice -Ms. Millett, suppose,

instead of having the statute broken down into (c)(1),

10

(2), and (3), Congress had written (c) as just one

11

paragraph that says:

12

appealability, and this is what the certificate must

13

contain.

14

maintain that only the first sentence of the paragraph

15

is jurisdictional and the rest is not?

16

You must have a certificate of

No division into (2) and (3).

MS. MILLETT:

Would you still

Well, my position would be

17

harder for precisely the reason you phrased.

And as

18

Justice Scalia was asking, how do we tell?

19

these are jobs of statutory construction, and the fact

20

that Congress broke these two steps out and broke (c)(3)

21

out by itself, and there's a noticeable turn in the

22

language by the time you get to (c)(3) -- (c)(1) says

23

"no appeal shall be taken."

24

(c)(3) says a document "shall indicate" issues after the

25

fact.

These are --

That sounds jurisdictional.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The important thing to understand here is

2

that you not only have the language shifting materially,

3

but your starting presumption, the starting presumption

4

here, is that we need a clear direction from Congress

5

before we decide that something is jurisdictional.

6

this Court has faced language far more emphatic than

7

(c)(3).

For example, in Reed --

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose the Petitioner asks

for a certificate of appealability on 10 issues, and the

10

circuit judge says, I'm granting it on issue 1, I'm

11

denying it on issue 2 through 9 -- 2 through 10.

12
13

Is there jurisdiction to consider 2 through
10?

14

MS. MILLETT:

There is jurisdiction to

15

consider.

16

court.

17

that, again, because the language talks --

18

And

It's obviously within the discretion of the

They could also determine not to.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I say

No, in that situation then,

19

if the State moves to dismiss the arguments that are

20

made by Petitioner on issues 2 through 10, would the --

21

would the panel be obligated to do that?

22

MS. MILLETT:

No, it wouldn't.

It would not

23

be obligated to, because what (c)(1) says is this

24

determines when an appeal comes forward, the whole

25

appeal comes forward.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

It could do that without

2

issuing a new -- without issuing a certificate of

3

appealability, without saying we think that the judge

4

who issued the certificate of appealability was

5

incorrect, that jurists of reason could disagree on

6

issues 2 through 10?

7

MS. MILLETT:

Well, I think -- I think

8

whether you have -- the panel would then have to do

9

the paperwork of doing a new certificate of

10

appealability or adjusting its own decision in the

11

course of its ruling, explain that we've decided to

12

reach these is not, I don't think, of jurisdictional

13

significance, which way they --

MS. MILLETT:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Millett --

I'm sorry.
-- it seems to me you beg

17

the question when you say that the issue is whether the

18

appeal will go forward.

19

the issue is here, whether it is that the appeal will go

20

forward or whether an appeal on an identified issue will

21

go forward.

22
23
24
25

That's precisely what -- what

That's exactly what we're talking about.
MS. MILLETT:

Well, it's a statutory

construction question, whether Congress -JUSTICE SCALIA:

structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward
10

1

on a particular issue, and not in -- not in general on

2

-- on who knows how many issues.

3

MS. MILLETT:

Well, Justice Scalia, with

4

respect, that's not what the statute says.

5

could have written the statute that way, but I think it

6

would be extraordinary to tell courts that an appeal

7

comes forward but we're only going to allow you to look

8

at this precise issue decided by one judge.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress

It says it doesn't come

10

forward -- doesn't come forward unless there is a

11

certificate of appealability.

12

MS. MILLETT:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And then it says the

14

certificate of appealability shall indicate which

15

specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required.

16

MS. MILLETT:

But in nowhere --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, I read that as

18

saying you -- we're going to have an appeal but just an

19

appeal on the issue that's identified.

20

MS. MILLETT:

First of all, I mean, courts

21

can certainly do that as a matter of discretion, but

22

6

just as a practical matter why this mistake happens

7

sometimes in this certificate of appealability process.

8

But the fundamental question here is one of

That would go back to the

So, that's one of the reasons I think

statutory construction:

Did Congress make clear, clear

10

at the level we require for jurisdiction, clear that we

11

-- at the level we would require for holding -- and I've

12

never seen this anywhere in this Court's precedent --

13

holding that an individual pro se prisoner who does

14

everything reasonably possible, fully and timely

15

complies with all obligations, will still have his right

16

to first habeas on a substantial constitutional claim

17

irretrievably jurisdictionally foreclosed because the

18

court of appeals judge miswrote a certificate

19

documenting a judgment that the officer made.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

Can you -- can you make

21

the argument -- does it help you, in distinguishing the

22

notice of appeals section, to -- to say that the notice

23

of appeal has to say the judgment or order that's being

24

appealed?

25

That's almost clerical.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

It doesn't require

Official

1

any -- any discretion on the part of the judge or

2

extensive review of the record, whereas in the COA,

3

there has to be an element of judgment in deciding what

4

the constitutional issue is.

5

distinguish the two?

6

Does that help you

You rely on the fact that the notice of

7

appeals cases were decided before our -- our case

8

indicating that it has to be clear language.

9

MS. MILLETT:

I think certainly that there's

10

that point.

11

that there's actually a similarity between this Court's

12

notice of appeal cases in something like Houston v.

13

Lack, the mail -- prison mailbox rule.

14

specific textual jurisdictional requirement in the -- in

15

the rules, that require filing a notice of appeal

16

with the clerk of the district court.

17

said, look, when it comes to prisoners who have done

18

everything humanly possible within their control to meet

19

the jurisdictional requirements, we are not going to

20

interpret these rules -- as part of the presumption, we

21

don't interpret rules to strip away jurisdiction from

22

individuals who have done everything humanly possible,

23

particularly when the facts on the ground are that the

24

statute was satisfied.

In Jimenez, we held that the most natural

reading of 2244(d)(1)(A) is to read it like we read

17

2255.

18

when direct review -- and direct review concludes when

19

the court affirms a conviction or denies a petition, or,

20

if the defendant forgoes direct review, when the time

21

for seeking such review expires.

And we read 2255 to say that finality is reached

argument there was that you've got to -- by the State, 


10

was you're only -- you stopped -- remember, Jimenez had

11

stopped at the intermediate court of appeals as well.

12

And the State's argument was you stopped at the

13

intermediate court of appeals originally; so, you're

14

only in the expiration of review prong.
And this -- but then he went back 4 years

later, I think it was, and got the court to reopen,

on.

two ways by which a judgment can become final.

It says the

two ways are basically you lose or you quit, right?

MR. MITCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

20

the courts of appeal will have their own circuit rules

suddenly what's worrying me -- and I don't have the

If there are other habeas applicants who are

their habeas petitions from being crowded out in a sea

of meritless petitions, all of which can go up on

The only ones that come up are merit --

MR. MITCHELL:

Well, it would have to be

procedural obstacle, which is the problem that plagues

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh no, if there's an

19

insurmountable obstacle -- although, as in this case

20

perhaps we don't reach the constitutional issue -- there

21

is one there, so it is appealable, but we say we do not

22

reach it because there is this impossible procedural

obstacle that here blocks it.

There we have a system that seems more
efficient and seems what is being argued, and all we

Nobody has ever made that determination in

12

that in any case a court is going to have to make

13

this -- is going to have to ask itself whether a

substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional

issues a certificate of appealability on that question,

it should be presumed that it's been satisfied.

happen.

In most cases, it's not going to be an issue.

8

If somebody certified that it's debatable, then somebody

9

has made that showing.

If it turns out -- like, for

10

example, if there was, if the petitioner had said my

11

right to testify at trial was violated, they wouldn't

12

let me testify; and then that issue is certified and

13

then it turns out when it gets to the merits panel that

14

he did in fact testify and it was a totally frivolous

15

claim, yes, I think that the court of appeals should

16

dismiss the case at that point for lack of jurisdiction.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MS. MILLETT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

17

Justice Kagan, the question is whether State

18

prisoners now should be worse off than Federal

19

prisoners.

20

this gap; it is 99-plus percent of prisoners because in

21

Texas -- in Texas -- only about 1 percent file

22

discretionary petitions for review.

that -- 99.7, 99.8 percent -- do not seek cert on direct

The situation is not

Well, the question is what one

provision written for State prisoners by Congress, to

12

address State prisoners; and if the natural thing that

13

happens in the world is 99 percent do not even seek

14

review in the State's highest court -- and I'm

15

extrapolating from Texas; I don't know all 50 States,

16

but I have no reason to think that's anomalous.

Ninety-nine percent don't file petitions for

create a gap, that is going to cause prisoners who

wouldn't otherwise file to now file?
