CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in Case 12-418, United States v.

5

Kebodeaux.

Mr. Dreeben.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Convicted sex offenders pose a serious

12

threat to public safety.

13

entered under Federal law, Congress has the authority to

14

impose both a criminal and a civil sanction for that

15

conduct in order to protect the public.

16

When those convictions are

The Fifth Circuit in this case applied a per

17

se rule that once Respondent had completed his military

18

sentence, Congress lost authority to apply a civil

19

sanction for that violation of Federal law.

20

That per se rule is wrong.

21

Nothing in Article I prevents Congress from

22

legislating retroactively with respect to civil remedies

23

for past violations of Federal law.

24

Clause, the Due Process Clause, and Article I analysis

25

under the Necessary and Proper Clause all provide some

Alderson Reporting Company

The Ex Post Facto

Official
Page 4

1

degree of protection against retroactive provisions, but

2

no per se rule bars Congress from applying sex offender

3

registration requirements, which this Court has held to

4

be civil remedies not barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause

5

to past Federal criminal convictions.

6

Now --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What's the limit of that

8

power?

9

related to sex offense or anything else, Congress could

10

How -- for any Federal conviction, whether it's

impose any kind of registration requirement?

11
12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, certainly, Justice

Sotomayor --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could it ask every

14

convicted Federal felon to come in for a DNA test

15

because we know that people who have been convicted of a

16

crime are more likely to be recidivists?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, there

18

are independent constitutional limits both outside of

19

Article I and within Article I that mean that I will

20

answer your question no, it's not the case that my

21

position today means there are no limits.

22

limits.

23

There are

If we -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
Is it just safety?

So what -- what is the

24

limit?

It can't be just safety of

25

the public because you just said that it doesn't apply

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 5

to recidivist Federal offenders, generally.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

The -- the principal

3

limitation on retroactive legislation is the Ex Post

4

Facto Clause.

5

an Ex Post Facto Clause if the Fifth Circuit were

6

correct.

7

Indeed, there would have been no need for

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't understand.

I

8

just posited a civil registration for Federal offenders

9

of any kind.

10

theory, so --

11

That's not ex post facto under your

MR. DREEBEN:

So if -- if the Court agrees

12

that it's not a punitive measure and it is a remedial

13

measure --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I don't know if I

15

agree with that, but accept -- accepting that

16

hypothetical.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, if you don't agree with

18

it, then you'll be going on the Ex Post Facto Clause,

19

and you won't be getting to Article I.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

settled law.

22

issue.

23

No, you know, that's

Whether it's right or wrong is a different

MR. DREEBEN:

It is settled law, and that

24

means that sex offender registration provisions aren't

25

punitive.

The question here is, are they within

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 6

1

Article I.

2

went through an elaborate Necessary and Proper Clause

3

analysis --

4

And the Court in United States v. Comstock

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in Comstock,

5

it was very different than the situation here because

6

the analysis was that the Federal government basically

7

was the source of the problem in incarcerating sex

8

offenders away from the State so that no State felt an

9

obligation to do something with the problem of their

10

release.

11

You don't have anything of that sort here.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

This provision, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, rests on a different analysis than Comstock.

14

In Comstock, the problem was caused by Federal custody

15

that, as Your Honor has said, broke the relationship

16

between the individual and some State that might take

17

cognizance of him for purposes of sex offender civil

18

commitment.

19

The basis for the statute in Comstock was

20

that people in Federal custody, regardless of the nature

21

of their prior convictions, might pose threats if

22

released.

23

that the individual was in Federal custody.

24

custody is irrelevant to it.

25

in this case is that this is a sex offender in violation

The basis for the statute in this case is not
Federal

The basis for the statute

Alderson Reporting Company

1

of Federal law, and Congress has the authority to

2

impose, as was done in this case, criminal punishment,

3

but it also has the authority to impose civil regulatory

4

sanctions.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume that applies to

6

all Federal crimes, right?

Anyone convicted of any

7

Federal crime can thereafter be subjected to whatever

8

civil restraints Congress later decides are -- are a

9

good idea in order to prevent that crime, that type of

10

crime from reoccurring, right?

I mean, nothing peculiar

11

here about sex crimes.

12

later decide, you know, it would be a good idea if

13

when -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime

14

with the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all

15

sorts of different civil limitations.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Any -- any crime Congress can

Well, Justice Scalia, there is

17

no per se rule in Article I that forbids retroactive

18

civil regulations imposed on a Federal offender.

19

question --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, that's not the

21

point, that it's -- that it's retroactive.

22

that it is not in execution of a Federal power.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

So the

The point is

Well, I think the whole point

24

in this case is that it's retroactive because there

25

isn't any serious dispute that if somebody commits a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 8

1

Federal sex offense they can be placed on supervised

2

release for life so --

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be an execution

of a Federal power --

5

MR. DREEBEN:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

to prevent that crime and to punish it.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, so is this.
-- the power -- the power

Well, but Congress's power is

not limited to preventing and punishing crimes through

10

criminal law.

11

States v. Halper where this Court viewed double jeopardy

12

as precluding multiple criminal and civil sanctions, the

13

Court has recognized that when someone violates Federal

14

law they're exposed both to criminal punishment and to

15

civil sanctions.

16

with the Ex Post Facto Clause.

17

Except for a brief interlude under United

But they have to be imposed

21

22

years later the Federal government decides, oh, it would

23

be a good idea if people who have committed sex crimes

24

25

This is not a punishment for

MR. DREEBEN:

That's precisely --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

-- what makes it a civil

6

sanction.

7

presupposing that Congress can only react to a sex crime

8

through the criminal law and that it must have those

9

laws in place at the time of the punishment, and there

10
11

But, Justice Scalia, Your Honor is

is no such Article I precept.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your argument

12

depends in no way on the fact that he was convicted of a

13

Federal offense or -- or incarcerated for that offense,

14

nothing at all?

15

retroactivity under -- whether they have the authority

16

under Article I to impose punishment for not registering

17

under State law?

18

We're just here arguing about the

MR. DREEBEN:

This case turns entirely on

19

the fact that the defendant is a Federal offender.

The

20

source of power in question was the power to regulate

21

the armed forces.

22

sex crime while in the armed forces.

23

power to address that and to prescribe remedies for it

24

both civil and criminal is entirely tied to the Federal

25

nature of the offense.

This is an individual who committed a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, we start out with the

2

power under the Constitution to make rules to regulate

3

the military and we end up with a registration

4

requirement that applies to someone who's not in the

5

military and perhaps is not even living anywhere near

6

any military installation.

7

me is to start out with the constitutional provision,

8

identify a purpose of that that is served by this civil

9

registration that is imposed later, and trace this whole

10

So what would be helpful for

progress through the Necessary and Proper Clause.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Alito, I think the

12

most helpful way to do that would be for me -- for me to

13

progress through a series of examples that illustrate

14

how protecting the public against a Federal sex offender

15

is a legitimate aim under the Necessary and Proper

16

Clause to implement the underlying constitutional

17

authority.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.
So start with a sex offender

20

who commits a sex offense in the military, is tried,

21

court-martialed, and sentenced.

22

unusual punishment limitations, due process limitations,

23

et cetera, that individual can be incarcerated, placed

on supervised release potentially up to life.

Subject to cruel and

mandated by Federal law, is that that individual

register as a sex offender.

3

tied to Federal law is that when an individual violates

4

Federal law it is a legitimate purpose of Congress to

5

protect the public against recidivism by that

6

individual.

7

believe is undisputed.

8
9

And the reason that that is

So that's the criminal example that I

Now, suppose that the Federal government
didn't actually get the sex offender while he was in the

10

military.

11

comes to light still within the statute of limitations

12

that shows that while this person was in the military

13

they committed a sex offense.

14

States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles made clear that that

15

individual can be tried in an Article III court for his

16

criminal violation even though he's out of the military.

17

It's enforcing the rules that were impressed upon him at

18

the time while he was in the military.

19

It missed the crime, but later information

This court in United

Now let me give a civil example and then I

20

will bring it right back to this case.

Suppose that

21

Congress concludes that sex offenses in the military are

22

a very serious problem and that there are a lot of

23

people who have escaped prosecution because of lax

24

interest in pursuing those crimes.

25

of years, it sets up a board of inquiry and it says this

And after a period

Page 12

1

board of inquiry is going to look into sex offenses that

2

were committed at the time that people were in the

3

military, even if they're out of the military, and we're

4

going to subpoena people to testify, and if individuals

5

are determined in a civil proceeding to have committed

6

sex offenses they may have their military records

7

revised, they may lose military benefits, and they may

8

have other civil sanctions imposed upon them.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11
12
13

When you say in a civil

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, noncriminal.

Noncriminal.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's just by a

14

preponderance of the evidence we think this guy

That's an acceptable level of

And if Congress can do that in order to

23

protect the integrity of the military and to promote

confidence in the military, then it's a very small step,

25

if any step at all, to SORNA.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

do that.

Federal offense and the incarceration.

5

But that's not what they've done here.

MR. DREEBEN:

Your

Yes, absolute -- well,

6

Mr. Chief Justice, it's not linked to the incarceration.

7

This is the difference between this case and Comstock,

8

and this is why the Solicitor General's concession in

Comstock on which the Fifth Circuit heavily relied has

10

no applicability here.
In Comstock, it was irrelevant what offense

22

situation where I think at the time every State dealt

23

with the issue of whether the sex offenders should have

25

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

But Federal

2

This is actually a primary example of partnership

between State governments and the Federal government.

4

The Federal government offers financial support, it

5

offers logistical assistance, it offers tremendous

6

resources of the U.S. marshals to track down sex

7

offenders.

And as this Court said in Carr v. United
States, it was entirely reasonable for Congress to have

10

assigned a special responsibility for prosecuting

11

Federal sex offenders who failed to register.

Court --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this

The discussion so far has

23

assumed, your discussion primarily, that there's this

24

line between civil and criminal, we don't need to worry

25

about ex post facto.

Is that line made clear in our

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 15

1

precedents or is there some room to argue that if the

2

line is somewhat blurred that there may be ex post facto

3

concerns here and that that in turn is a reason for

4

constitutional avoidance when we evaluate your argument?

5

Is that -- is the civil -- a criminal

6

distinction with reference to Ex Post Facto Clause

7

absolutely foreclosed and clear in the facts of this

8

case?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, it is, I believe, Justice

10

Kennedy.

In an opinion that you wrote for the Court,

11

Smith v. Doe, which considered the retroactivity of

12

Alaska's sex offender registration and notification

13

provisions, which are similar but not identical, to the

14

Federal provisions, the Court went through the

15

established analysis to determine whether the

16

legislature had intended a punitive effect and if it

17

didn't, whether there was the clearest proof that it was

18

punishment in purpose and effect.

19

Notwithstanding the legislature's intent,

20

the Court upheld the retroactive applicability of sex

21

offender registration and notification, making clear

22

that it is not governed by the Ex Post Facto Clause.

23

Now, that's not to say that an individual

24

couldn't argue that SORNA is different or an individual

25

couldn't argue that the Due Process Clause makes it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16

1

either irrational or substantively off limits to impose

2

this kind of civil remedy.

3

argue that running this through the Comstock factors,

4

it's not reasonably adapted to fulfilling Congress's

5

aim.

The individual can also

6

But what the Fifth Circuit did is apply a

7

per se rule that it drew, I think, from the Solicitor

8

General's statement in Comstock that once an individual

9

got out of custody and was back in the control of the

10

State and within its jurisdiction and population, then

11

the Federal government couldn't reach out and commit him

12

as a sex offender.

13

And there are two main distinctions between

14

that concession and this case.

15

already alluded to, the government's argument in

16

Comstock was based on custody.

17

the consequences of the conviction itself.

18

distinction is that committing somebody civilly is a

19

massive intrusion on that individual's relationship with

20

the State.

21

The first is, as I've

The answer to all

of your questions is the same, which is that there is an

2

analysis that the Court went through in Comstock where

3

it took into consideration history, it took into

4

consideration the nature of the fit between the purpose

5

of Congress and the activity that it was regulated.

took into account the degree to which the State

7

interests were accommodated, and it took into account

the degree of attenuation between the regulation and the

underlying offense.

analysis except for believing that once the individual

15

had completed military service, once the individual had

completed his criminal sentence, Congress lost all

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm getting confused

19

between two different assertions of a Federal interest.

20

Earlier you talked about the integrity of the military

21

forces.

22

address the fact that people were engaging in criminal

23

activities when in the military, they weren't -- they

24

weren't found out, they weren't prosecuted.

25

they can go back.

They go back later, they think they should

Alderson Reporting Company

But then you say that the interest that's at

2

issue here is preventing recidivism, and that doesn't

3

seem to have anything to do with the integrity of the

4

military force.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, it does because when the

6

criminal law finds someone who has violated Federal law,

7

many of the purposes of the sanctions that are imposed

8

on that individual are public protection purposes and

9

anti-recidivism purposes.

Most of the things that are

10

done on supervised release fulfill those purposes.

11

those purposes were not validly connected to taking

12

someone who's violated criminal law and imposing a suite

13

of sanctions on them, then supervised release would

14

apparently be beyond Congress's authority.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If

It -- it seems to me that

16

when -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief

17

Justice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the

18

power to regulate the military.

19

some general Federal power to protect citizens against

20

people who have committed any Federal crimes.

21

I don't see that enumerated power in the Constitution.

Yes, I see a power to regulate the military, but your

23

description, it has nothing to do with regulating the

24

military.

crimes, military or not.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

As the Court has pointed out

3

numerous times, including in Comstock, there is very

4

little authority in the Constitution in an enumerated

5

way for criminal law at all.

6

the exception of a handful of instances that are

7

specified in the Constitution, comes in by virtue of the

8

Necessary and Proper Clause.

All of criminal law, with

12

of regulating the armed forces.

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right because it
The Federal -- the criminal

But part -But how does protecting the

15

public at large from people who have committed a crime

16

in the armed forces, how does that have anything to do

17

with regulating the armed forces?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

That is inherent in taking

19

somebody who violated Federal law and imposing

20

appropriate sanctions on them for that violation.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dreeben, it would help

22

me in answering some of these questions if you went

23

through the analysis on the assumption that this was

out of it, what would the necessary and proper analysis

MR. DREEBEN:

It would look essentially the

same, Justice Kagan.

Somebody who violates a Federal

law that's premised on the Commerce Clause, say a sex

offender who travels in interstate commerce with the

6

intent to commit a sex offense, has placed himself

within the regulatory authority of the Federal

government.

Now, that individual can be criminally

Mr. Dreeben, you say

nothing about the -- what was the opening argument in --

Page 25

in your brief, that the assumption that SORNA is

2

something new added after is wrong because there were

3

these predecessor laws that established a Federal

4

requirement to register.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, I believe

6

that the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that too.

7

describe in our brief, Title 42 Section 14072(i)(3) and

8

(4) did, in our view, impose criminal punishment on

As we

the time he was in the military.

11

We think the Fifth Circuit was wrong on that

12

statutory analysis, but, more fundamentally, the Fifth

13

Circuit was wrong in thinking that it mattered whether

14

he was under some sort of Federal criminal jurisdiction

15

at the time that he was released from Federal custody.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. CAROLYN FUENTES
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22

MS. FUENTES:

23

may it please the Court:

24
25

Thank you,

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

The government asks this Court to go beyond
its holding in United States v. Comstock to allow the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 26

1

Federal government to reach back, after a Federal

2

sentence has expired, to bring back into Federal control

3

a person who has returned to the authority of the State.

4

And I'm quite surprised to hear the

5

government say that this is not a Comstock analysis.

6

I'm not sure they stuck with that throughout the

7

argument, but I think the -- the Comstock factors are

8

factors that this Court looks at quite frequently in

9

doing any kind of a necessary and proper analysis.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I bo back to –

11

to a primary question, are you challenging – you

12

didn't on appeal, but it seems as if you're accepting

13

that the Federal government has the power to impose this

14

requirement as part of a Federal sentence.

15

MS. FUENTES:

I think that's correct.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Are you --

17

if it's not part of a Federal sentence, but part of

18

release, it's not announced at the sentence, but it's

19

announced at the time the prisoner is put into

20

supervised release or release from jail, do you think

21

the government has the power to impose it then?

22

MS. FUENTES:

In this case, on these facts,

23

and based on the Federal statutes that exist today, the

24

answer is yes.

25

way that SORNA works today.

And the illustration, I think, is the
As the government

becomes part of the supervised relief terms.

4

MS. FUENTES:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

Correct.

MS. FUENTES:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

I'm not talking about

SORNA today.

7

9

Well, SORNA today

Okay.
I'm talking about just

any prisoner who has been in jail, but it's not made,
has not been paid, part of the punishment.
MS. FUENTES:

I think the law permits a

12

sentencing judge -- I'm not talking about Congress, but

13

a sentencing judge -- to go back and impose additional

14

conditions of supervised release.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

that power, but do you have a statutory --

17

MS. FUENTES:

I -- I don't know of

It's 18 -- 18 United States

18

Code Section 3583.

19

judge to change conditions of supervised release based

20

on the factors that are considered important in

21

sentencing in 18 United States Code Section 3553.

22

And 3583 permits the sentencing

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So that

23

power -- I guess then what the government is saying, as

24

I understand their argument, if you have the power to do

25

it at that point, why can't you have the power to do it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 28

1

later?

2

MS. FUENTES:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

Well -Are the same factors

that compel permission for the government to do it then?

5

MS. FUENTES:

It's because the way the

6

statute works, even though it wasn't announced at

7

sentence, supervised release is considered to be part of

8

the sentence.

9

correctly, the reason the court can go back and impose

10

those conditions and possibly the reason that Congress

11

can go back and do it is because those statutes that

12

I've mentioned, 3583 and 3553, have given notice to the

13

individual.

14
15

So if I understand the question

JUSTICE ALITO:

We are not talking -- I'm

sorry.

16

MS. FUENTES:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

That's all right.
I didn't mean to interrupt

your question.

19

MS. FUENTES:

It's all right.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

We're not talking about

21

statutory authorization.

We are talking about

22

constitutional power.

23

example of registration for life being imposed as part

24

of supervised release, part of the criminal sentence,

25

then we go to an example where it is not part of the

So if we start out with the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 29

criminal sentence, but it is a civil requirement

2

triggered by a separate civil proceeding for every

3

Federal -- every person convicted of a sex offense under

4

Federal law.

5
6
7

Now, if that were the setup statutorily,
would that fall within Congress's power under Article 1?
MS. FUENTES:

I think not, but I want to

8

qualify that because it depends on what powers Congress

9

is relying on.

10

And let me give an example.

11

government was -- a lot of the government's argument

12

relies on this difference between criminal and civil

13

consequences.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I know the

Well, we know what -- and we

15

know what power they are relying on.

16

the power that they're relying on here.

17

to make rules for the regulation of the military.

18

part of their -- in the exercise of their power to make

19

rules for the regulation of the military, they impose a

20

civil sex offender registration requirement for someone

21

convicted of a sex offense under the Uniform Code of

22

Military Justice.

23

within Article I?

24
25

Let's just look at
It's the power
So

That does not, in your judgment, fall

MS. FUENTES:

It does if the person is still

in the military or if he has been -- or if he has

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 30

1

committed a criminal offense and the prosecutorial

2

power, the Federal power to prosecute him for that

3

offense, has not been exhausted, yes, that can be done.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about if he is on

5

supervised release?

6

entire sentence has not been completed.

7

He is not in the military, but his

MS. FUENTES:

I think if he is still being

8

supervised by the military, then I think it's likely

9

that power exists.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. FUENTES:

12

on supervised release.

13

Okay.

Then why not this?

Because Mr. Kebodeaux was not

No, I'm sorry --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -- why not?

I mean,

14

look, this is -- Thomas Reed Powell once said, "If you

15

can think of a thing that is inextricably related to

16

another thing without thinking of the other thing, then

17

you have the legal mind," and that seems to be this

18

case.

All right?

19

MS. FUENTES:

Yes, it does.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

So somehow I have to get

21

out of my mind the ex post facto part, the potential

22

violation of due process part, the equal protection

23

part, take that aside.

24

whether it has, Congress has the power under the

25

provision that Justice Alito said.

Now I've got to just think about

I'm trying to do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 31

1

that, and I've dissented in other cases on other

2

grounds.

3

All right.

But in -- in just trying to do

4

that, I think, well, the military, suppose they found a

5

certain number of -- of individuals, men or women, have

6

unfortunate problems in the military.

7

there is a mental illness problem.

8

the military.

9

local mental health authorities about this person even

10
11

They discover

The person's out of

But the law says you can go and tell the

though he's no longer there.
And suppose the person had a criminal

12

problem in the military and was in prison and suppose

13

the law said, you know, you're the ones who got the

14

situation where he unfortunately got into that problem,

15

and you, later on, can -- can go and tell authorities

16

about his problems so they can take appropriate action.

17

Now, if they can do that, why can't they

18

have the power under Article I to say really, you all

19

have to register.

20

but you got this problem in the military.

21

convicted in the military.

22

We turned you loose and there you are, and we want, as

23

part of our military regulation, to be able to tell

24

authorities about you and to make you register according

25

to State law.

Now, maybe there are other things,
You were

Now, no due process problem, I have to

2

assume that away.

problem, none of those.

4

Why not?

5

MS. FUENTES:

But it's a power, all right?

Well, the power can't go to

both of the examples that you've given.

7

I don't see any

That does not impose a
So there is no
They can have a

10

public -- a public protection purpose and they can

11

tell -- tell authorities who need to deal with the

12

individual, and those authorities may have the power

13

through State power --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where you're leading me

15

because I'm not so worried about this case, but where

16

you're leading me is down in Commerce Clause cases and

17

all kinds of other cases.

18

that Congress can, in fact, do all kinds of things

19

having Federal authorities do this and that, but you

20

couldn't make someone in a State -- you know, you can

21

imagine a few that are coming into my mind -- and so

22

what I'm worried about is following this distinction

23

into other areas.

24
25

MS. FUENTES:

Suddenly a distinction arises

I don't think that is a

problem, and I think the reason is I disagree

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 33

fundamentally with the government.

I think necessary

2

and proper analysis is important in each case and it

3

does bear similarities in each case.

4

the power being relied upon, the analysis can be quite

5

different.

depending on the Commerce Clause, would be right or

would be wrong.

10

Look at the power to make a uniform

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me -- let me try

11

this chain of reasoning out on you and -- and get your

12

reaction.

13

to make rules for the regulation of the military.

14

one of the things that they want to do in making those

15

rules is to make military installations acceptable to

16

the local communities where they are located.

17

We're starting out with the power of Congress
And

They know from experience, for example,

18

what's happened in Okinawa, that when have you military

19

personnel who go -- who commit sex offenses with people

20

off base, it can cause tremendous opposition.

21

is what happened here, not the opposition, but an

22

offense involving a 15-year-old girl who lived off the

23

base.

24
25

And this

So in order to ensure that there -- we don't
have excessive civilian opposition to the location of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 34

military bases, we are going to do a number of things.

2

One thing is we're going to criminally prosecute members

3

of the military who commit these offenses.

deter.

further assurance to the community that these people are

6

not going to be dangerous, we are going to require them

7

to register.

11

This will incapacitate.

This will

But also, to provide

Now, maybe that's too attenuated, but I'd
like to get your reaction.

Why could Congress not do

that under the Necessary and Proper Clause?
MS. FUENTES:

Well, I think while that

12

person is still within the criminal jurisdiction, or any

13

Federal jurisdiction, it could be done.

14

once that jurisdiction has been exhausted, once the

15

criminal prosecution power has been exhausted, once the

16

person has returned to the authority of the State, and I

17

think that analysis is important always.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that

You don't have to go that

19

far though to -- to distinguish the example that Justice

20

Alito just gave.

21

requires him to registrate -- to register if he hangs

22

around the military installation.

23

register anywhere, you know, in the -- in the wilds of

24

Alaska where -- it's just not this case.

25

This is not a statute which only

This requires him to

And even -- even if you would allow that,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 35

1

and say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable

2

connection to the power to regulate the military, to say

3

wherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different

4

question, isn't it?

5

MS. FUENTES:

I think it may well be.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But yet, now that's exactly

7

the problem for me because the -- the wilds of

8

Alaska you think I think, and I think I think, that --

9

that sure, if there's a post office there -- there's a

10

post office there, then what -- the military is all

11

right, they can mail a letter to the -- to be delivered

12

to the local doctor to say, look, he has a problem.

13

That seems to be okay.

14

But you say it's not going to be okay to

15

tell him he has to go and make that registration.

16

that point what you've done is like Madison.

17

it's an interpretation of the Commerce Clause that I

18

think Madison might have wanted, which is you're reading

19

a lack of power because of a civil rights problem.

itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can

impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and

Proper Clause.

14

necessary and proper for the Federal government itself

15

to do is not necessarily necessary and proper for the

16

Federal government to require private individuals to do.

Aren't there two different -- what is

MS. FUENTES:

I absolutely agree with that.

18

And I think that this goes back to something that the

19

government -- well, it gives me an opportunity to

20

address something the government has said about the

21

Fifth Circuit's opinion.

22

that is just incorrect.

23

that.

24

everything the Fifth Circuit said was limited by these

25

facts.

That it is a per se rule, and
I -- I have to disagree with

And I have to disagree with it because the --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 37

1

These facts are what controls the case.

And

2

the Fifth Circuit took great care to make a very narrow

3

ruling.

4

that it's unconstitutional, SORNA's requirements, as

5

applied to Mr. Kebodeaux and others like him.

6

effect on Congress's ability to impose conditions on a

7

prisoner's release from custody or on Congress's ability

8

to effect the registration requirements for anyone who

9

has been convicted after SORNA's enactment.

10

And that ruling, the Fifth Circuit said, is

It has no

So really, it is not a per se rule.

It is a

11

rule, maybe you call it per se as it -- as it affects

12

people in Mr. Kebodeaux's position, but I think that is

13

very different from what the government is arguing.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess, Ms. Fuentes, what I

15

don't quite understand about the argument, this goes

16

back to Justice Alito's original question.

17

say that if this -- if Congress passed a civil statute

18

like this one within the time that Mr. Kebodeaux was in

19

custody or within the time that he was under supervised

20

release, that that would be appropriate.

21

You seem to

But I guess what I don't get is why the

22

Federal interests change, whether it's the day before he

23

gets out of supervised release or the day after he gets

24

out of supervised release.

25

interests shift based on that?

What in the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MS. FUENTES:

I'll answer that question

first, then come back to another.

3

It's not a question, I don't think, of

4

Federal interest.

It's a question of Federal power.

5

And you have to look at the individual power being

6

exercised.

7

difference if the Federal government makes a rule for a

8

person in the military before -- when he's in the

9

military or after he gets out of the military?

And so the way I look at it is what's the

10

all the difference in the world.

11

argument.

12

That's

In -- in -- that's our

That is all the difference in the world.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I wasn't assuming that

13

he was in the military while he was on supervised

14

release.

15

MS. FUENTES:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

I didn't hear.

I was assuming that he was

17

out of the military in both these cases, but that you

18

said while he was still serving his sentence, it would

19

be appropriate for Congress to add this additional

20

thing, but not after.

21

MS. FUENTES:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

I think -In both cases, he's not in

the military anymore.
MS. FUENTES:

Constitutionally, it -- it can

be all right constitutionally, depending on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 39

1

statutory procedures that govern it.

2

the Federal law operates now, the statutes that I

3

mentioned, 3583 and 3553, the way those statutes --

4

statutes operate is they -- they give someone notice

5

that their conditions of supervised release can be --

6

can be changed.

7

problem with that.

8
9

And the way that

And so there isn't an ex post facto

And there isn't a power problem with that
because the criminal -- the power to make the criminal

10

offense and punish it still exists while that person is

11

Mr. Kebodeaux, and I think that is one of the most

important points in this case, and it goes along with

the Comstock analysis.

MS. FUENTES:

Can Congress

Not if -- not unless it was --

6

that provision was imposed as part of the sentence or

7

while he was still within the Federal power, before the

8

Federal criminal jurisdiction expires.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

See, I understand -- I can

10

understand why that might create -- that might raise all

11

sorts of constitutional arguments about notice and so

12

forth.

13

But I don't see how that -- how that

14

connects with the question whether Congress has the

15

power to do it under -- under Article I --

16

MS. FUENTES:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18
19

Well, I'm not sure --- under the power to

regulate the military.
MS. FUENTES:

Yes.

I'm not sure I'm

20

answering the question correctly, but that power doesn't

last forever.

23

the example I raised before was the rule of making

The powers -- there are some powers in

That's a broader power, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 41

And we see that in the cases the

2

government's mentioned and we've mentioned, the Toth

3

case and the Kinsella case.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you could be making

5

the argument that the power to make rules for the

6

military applies only to people who are in the military,

7

and that once you're out of the military that power does

8

not permit Congress to do anything special to you.

9

But you're not making that argument, I

10

gather.

11

MS. FUENTES:

No.

No, I'm not making that

12

argument.

13

and the power asserted and the way the power operates

14

always makes a difference.

15

And again, it goes to the individual facts

The example that the government gave with

16

that board of inquiry and being able to bring people

17

back in, I find that whole scenario very questionable.

18

But there -- there were people who were -- were

19

receiving military benefits, if I understood it --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How would you write this

21

opinion if you wanted to protect against what Justice

22

Breyer was concerned about, constricting the Commerce

23

Clause, which has been since Madison more broadly

24

defined than he did, or Justice Alito's example of

25

ensuring that you're not closing off other things that

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 42

1

can be done after someone leaves, that might be related

2

to, like punishing a crime that you find out about

3

afterwards.

4
5
6

How would you write this opinion?
MS. FUENTES:

Just the way the Fifth Circuit

did in its en banc opinion.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it wasn't really

7

helpful because it -- it doesn't give us a limiting

8

principle like -- I don't know if it's possible -- that

9

if you're relying on just recidivism, Congress has to

10

have an independent basis, a power for the imposition

11

of -- of criminal or civil sanctions on someone.

12

MS. FUENTES:

I'm not certain an opinion

13

like that could be written.

14

the limitations that exist, are on the narrowness of the

15

way the opinion is written.

16

think can be decided that way.

17

I think that the limits,

But future cases I don't

Certainly, principles can be articulated

18

which help to limit.

19

can say in terms of limiting principles is it's going to

20

depend on the enumerated power upon which the government

21

relies to impose this obligation.

22

And I think the -- the best you

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how -- I'm not

23

sure that makes much sense.

You're saying if they're

24

relying on the enumerated power with respect to the

25

military, they can do more than if they're relying on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 43

1

the enumerated power over interstate commerce?

2
3

MS. FUENTES:

No.

And if that's your

understanding --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MS. FUENTES: -- I -- I apologize.

6

So in what sense -I did not

mean that.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, in what sense

8

does it then depend on which enumerated power they're

9

invoking?

10

MS. FUENTES:

Well, let -- let me give an

11

example that goes to the collateral consequence cases

12

that the government raised.

13

The government raises, for example, the

14

Hudson case, where a person who is convicted of bank

15

fraud both can be punished criminally and then can be

16

debarred civilly from participating any more with

17

Federal government contracts.

18

were used in the Hudson case were, "no longer may have

19

business doings with an insured bank."

20

I think the words that

Okay, that has to be, I think, the spending

21

power.

The government can decide with whom it wants to

22

do business.

23

it can impose that civil consequence.

24

it -- I don't want to use the word "independently" of.

25

They may do it by reason of the criminal conviction, but

If it's dealing with an insured bank, then

Alderson Reporting Company

And it can do

Official
Page 44

1

there is an independent power to do it.

2
3

That power doesn't exist here, and so it
would have to be --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They say -- they say

5

it exists by virtue of the enumerated power to regulate

6

the military forces.

7
8

MS. FUENTES:

Well, I don't think it does.

Perhaps I don't understand the question --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm trying to

10

see why you're saying the enumerated power under the

11

Spending Clause allows them to take this subsequent

12

action, but the enumerated power under the Military

13

Clause does not.

14
15
16

MS. FUENTES:

Well, because the -- I'm

sorry.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

17

that if you're arguing under the Necessary and Proper

18

Clause, that you need an enumerated power that the

19

Necessary and Proper Clause is going to serve.

20
21

But I don't see how it makes a difference
which enumerated power you're talking about.

22

MS. FUENTES:

I think it all -- I think it

23

does turn on the nature of the power.

24

use the military power to say you, Mr. Bank Fraud

5

MS. FUENTES:

I get to ask the

Sorry.

You are so correct on

I apologize.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but it's the

8

military -- look, it's the military that they are

9

mostly -- that they're relying on.

10

MS. FUENTES:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it --

So they say -- I mean, the

12

famous statement -- I looked it up -- "Let the end be

13

legitimate, let it be within the scope of the

14

Constitution, and all means which are appropriate and

15

not forbidden are -- fall within the Necessary and

16

Proper Clause."

17

All right?

The end is to protect the

18

communities from those individuals in respect to those

19

matters that they became dangerous with when they were

20

in the military, okay?

21

That's the end.

And is the means appropriate?

They say yes.

22

They say, after all, the means here is, notify them when

23

we're -- you're moving around.

24

forbidden?

25

And therefore, is it

Well, we're not supposed to consider that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 46

1

part, but -- so leave that out.

2

they say is okay.

3

But the -- the others,

So that's the basic.

Do you think maybe we should send this back

4

to the -- to the Fifth Circuit?

5

that --

The government suggests

6

MS. FUENTES:

Well --

7

JUSTICE BREYER: -- because they didn't get

8

it right in respect to what the previous statutes

9

require.

10

What about all that?

11

MS. FUENTES:

Well, the Fifth Circuit did

12

get it right with respect to the previous statutes.

13

the reason that the government wants to send it back is

14

because they say that the Fifth Circuit relied on the

15

fact that Mr. Kebodeaux was unconditionally released.

16

And as a matter of fact, he was unconditionally

17

released.

18

release free from a registration requirement.

19

But they equate unconditional release with

We have gone over that in great length in

20

The government is simply wrong about that,

I -- I guess it depends on

The Fifth Circuit would not have

You can see the difference between

Mr. Kebodeaux's release and the release of a person who

12

is released on conditions that he comply with

13

requirements, and that is in 35 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your argument is he was

17

18

MS. FUENTES:

No.

Isn't your

It is dependent on

19

whether that release was conditioned on his

registration, and it wasn't.

That is not what happened here.

6

Mr. Kebodeaux was released, not on any conditions.

7

the State may have imposed an independent obligation to

register, but that was not a condition of his release.

9

And so it is not the case, as a matter of fact, that he

10

was released on condition.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The bottom line is you

don't think the Wetterling Act applied to him.

If you look at the rest of 14072 and parts

8

of 14071, there are provisions that say such and such

9

person shall register.

10
11

That is a registration

requirement.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I guess what I'm not

12

understanding, Ms. Fuentes, is -- I understand the

13

difference between a requirement of registration and a

14

penalty for failing to register, but it's a little bit

15

cutting -- slicing the baloney thin.

16

And if you think that he was in any event

17

while he was undergoing his sentence subject to a

18

penalty, it's a pretty minor exercise of Federal power,

19

isn't it, to say that, instead of making you just

20

subject to a penalty for doing something, we're going to

21

tell you, you have to do it?

22

MS. FUENTES:

I guess I don't.

And the

23

reason is it's not the degree of power exerted, it's

24

whether the power exists.

25

completed his Federal sentence, the military power,

And once Mr. Kebodeaux

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 50

which permitted him to be prosecuted and punished, had

2

expired.

3

And so in some ways it's like there's

4

Federal enclave jurisdiction on this side of the street

5

where the base exists, where the Navy yard exists, and

6

things that happened here can be punished by the Federal

7

government, but just across the street the exact same

8

things can occur and the Federal government cannot

9

punish it.

10

So I think it is very careful to draw those

11

fine lines, and I think it is essential when discussing

12

issues of the enumerated powers because they are

13

limited.

14

I don't mean to move on fast.

22

In the Sixth, Ninth and Third Circuits, he

could not be prosecuted under SORNA, and so that is an

alternative basis that I think the Court can decide this

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

As I understand Respondent's argument,

10

Respondent concedes that he could have been put under a

11

lifetime requirement to register with State authorities

12

and punished federally if he did not, if only that

13

requirement had been imposed on him either at the time

14

of sentencing or in a parallel civil proceeding that

15

occurred while he was in the military.

16

This case, therefore, reduces to a question

17

of timing.

18

making is that Congress had its -- had its authority

19

expire because it didn't exercise it.

20

of notion that Congress must speak now or forever hold

21

its peace.

The essential argument that Respondent is

timing too, isn't it?

2

MR. DREEBEN:

2

Congress could say it's important to us that people who

3

serve in the military behave correctly even after

4

they're released.

5

You've limited it to sex offenses, but the --

So it is a Federal offense to do anything

6

that violates State law for the rest of their lives, and

7

your argument would say, well, that's part of their

8

authority to regulate the military and so it's okay.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

10

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

condition of Federal supervised release is that the

12

individual shall not violate any Federal, State or local

13

law, and for many sex offenders, supervised release runs

14

for life.

15

Let me make two points about

It has relevance to other

So insofar as supervised release does

22

contemplate this longstanding, continuous jurisdiction,

23

that's a feature of Federal law that the Court ought to

24

keep in mind in the way that it writes this opinion.

25

But, second, if Congress passed such a law,

Alderson Reporting Company

it's not that it has carte blanche to do that, it's just

2

that there's no per se rule that says it can't.

question is yes, Congress can do that.

crime is a Federal crime.

9

Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not
