We'll hear argument in the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAMELA S. KARLAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MS. KARLAN:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:

10

Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this

11

Court emphasized once again that statutory interpretation

12

is a holistic process based on common sense, that the

13

reading of the statute should look at all the words to

14

avoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the

15

text does not dictate it and the statutory history

16

suggests otherwise.

17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:
wasn't it?

19
20

MS. KARLAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Yes, but -- but it is true you

have a strong textual -

23
24

Yes, but actually, Justice Scalia,

I think even you will find our case more appealing.

21
22

That was a case I dissented in,

MS. KARLAN:

We have an excellent textual

argument.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I was a little bit surprised

1

at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong

2

textual argument you're now defending.

3

MS. KARLAN:

We do.

A holistic reading of the

4

text shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy

5

Code -

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
mean?

Can you stay within the -

8

MS. KARLAN:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11

What does a holistic reading

MS. KARLAN:

Absolutely.
-- text and still be holistic?

I'm not going to look outside the

text at all.

12

A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of

13

the Bankruptcy Code, which is on -- in the petitioners'

14

brief at pages 1 through 2 -

15
16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What does the word holistic

mean?

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. KARLAN:

I think it means read all the words

19

in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than

20

plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word

21

artificially.

22

on account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in

23

North LaSalle, account means a lot of different things,

24

but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this

25

statute.

For example, when you look at a phrase like

parsimonious or something like that?

MS. KARLAN:

So the antonym would be

I think it'd be partial, but I'm

not sure.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MS. KARLAN:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let -- let me ask -

Sure.
-- ask you this.

The -- the

8

statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on

9

account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument

10

somewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the payment

11

has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way,

12

and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.

13

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, and I think payments are

14

triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a

15

statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of

16

retirement payments.

17

For individuals -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, the problem for the

18

court below was that the person covered can ask for it in

19

a lump sum and pay a penalty.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Right, and that's not And -- and that isn't then on

22

the basis of age.

23

problem the court had below.

24
25

Am I right?

MS. KARLAN:
had below.

Is that -- that was the

Yes, that's the problem the court

I think it's an illusory problem for the

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

following reason.

2

It's clear that the right to receive full

3

enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until

4

one of the triggering events occurs.

5

are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the

6

estate, death.

7

about here, and that's why -

8
9

The trigger events

And that's the right that we're talking

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, when you say full

enjoyment, you -- you think when -- when I'm taxed on

10

something, I -- I don't have full enjoyment of it?

11

only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell -- the

12

only thing triggered by age -- is your obtaining of a tax

13

benefit.

14

can withdraw it without -- without paying the 10 percent

15

tax.

16

That's all.

MS. KARLAN:

The

Once you reach a certain age, you

That's correct, but the 10 percent

17

tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a

18

deterrent and a penalty.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I'm sure it does, but -

20

but it's -- it's hard to accept the notion that simply

21

because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm

22

receiving the money on account of my age.

23

make any sense to me.

24

MS. KARLAN:

25

That doesn't

Well, Justice Scalia, the way that

I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

penalty.

2

the holistic sense, the full reading of section

3

522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement

4

savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled,

5

or ill people, once they get to the point where those

6

triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur.

7

Those are the same triggering events -

8
9

And Congress put that penalty in there because

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Karlan, the -- as long as

this money was in the plan, it was shielded from

10

bankruptcy, and there are -- there was not unlimited

11

access even with the penalty when it was in the plan.

12

thing that I don't know and may be of some significance,

13

did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their

14

employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would

15

be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it

16

over?

17

MS. KARLAN:

One

Northrop Grumman's policy is to

18

require individuals who leave the company's employment to

19

roll their pension plans into an IRA.

20

to get work in Arkansas when they moved there.

21

gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they

22

were unable to do because of their health, they could have

23

rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely

24

exemptible.

MS. KARLAN:

That's correct.

No.

But they could not have kept

This employer did not permit

5

individuals to keep the money in the plan.

6

they had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They were told

That was a term of the plan

8

that it -- you can remain in it only so long as you're

9

employed?

10

MS. KARLAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Apparently so.
Are there any other plans that

12

are -- are entities clearly covered by the statute in

13

which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a

14

tax?

15

MS. KARLAN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MS. KARLAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. KARLAN:

20

Yes, Your Honor.
All right.

Well, then -

Let me give you a couple -- then you might persuade me.

Let me give you a couple of

examples -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MS. KARLAN:

Okay.

-- that I think will be quite

23

familiar.

24

before you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and

25

you pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so.

A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The Federal Government's thrift savings plan for

2

Federal employees allows you to take a loan out of the

3

plan and to pay the interest back into your own account

4

before you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving

5

you free use of the money.

6

back, it's then treated as a -- as a distribution, and you

7

pay the 10 percent tax penalty on it.

8

If you don't pay the loan

So that if you read this statute to -- not to

9

include IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this

10

statute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern

11

forms of defined contribution pension plans or savings

12

plans.

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.

That was what I was

14

going -- aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock

15

bonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms

16

of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?

17

MS. KARLAN:

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
I thought they were all

19

in the same boat.

20

of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to

21

qualify -

22
23
24
25

So what the effect of this rule is -

MS. KARLAN:

Yes, that's correct.

You would

render section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit.

Excuse me.

MS. KARLAN:

I -- I can see why you might

have thought it was the Ninth Circuit.

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

(Laughter.)

6

MS. KARLAN:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -- it might be wrong anyway.

Yes, yes.
What is the percentage amount

8

of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before

9

people are 59 and a half?

10

MS. KARLAN:

Well, in the Cilek case from the

11

Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court

12

there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2

13

and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under

14

the penalty process.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the -- the payment here -

16

it says -- the statute uses the word payment.

17

you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out

18

of it.

19

So suppose

Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?
MS. KARLAN:

It would be because it's the right

20

to the future payments and not just the present payments,

21

Justice Breyer.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so -- but I'm trying -

23

what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take

24

-- just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person

25

were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and

10

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would

2

not be a -- a payment because of age, but one that he took

3

out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty

4

would be.

5

MS. KARLAN:

That's correct, Justice Breyer.

6

But in order to protect the ability to take money out

7

after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of

8

the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a

9

half, there won't be any money there for him to take out.

10

And that's why the exemption extends not just to present

11

payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also

12

to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the

13

debtor.

14

And I can't emphasize JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Ms. Karlan, let me ask

15

something about that very point because the statute says

16

that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of

17

the debtor it's allowable.

18

MS. KARLAN:

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
Are you aware of cases where

20

the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all

21

that money?

22

We'll just let you deduct X amount.

23

That's a big plan.

MS. KARLAN:

You don't need all that.

Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.

We

24

cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the

25

yellow brief on pages 19 through -- to 20, I think is

The claim was all that all of that

If I could give an example that I think

10

Justice O'Connor might find instructive here.

11

debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally

12

require turnover of the entire IRA because people have

13

time to earn the money back again.

14

other retirement savings, for example, in a case from

15

Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a

16

401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire

17

IRA.

18

in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of

19

at -- will also require turnover of at least part of the

20

IRA.

21

When a

When the debtor has

When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is

In this case -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what do the courts do

22

if they say, well, my client might be ill or something

23

like that?

It seems to me -

24

MS. KARLAN:

25

they get to keep it -

Well, if the client is ill now,

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no.

They -- they say my

2

client is able-bodied now, but we -- we need something

3

because -- I don't know -- there's a history of family

4

illness or something.

5

MS. KARLAN:

There isn't a reported case that

6

talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason

7

of exempting the money.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's -- I'm trying to figure

out how -- how -- what the theory is.

Is -- you say I

10

have a right to receive payments because of age.

11

say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent

12

comes out of it after you're 60.

13

before.

14

there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to

15

have a right to receive because of age because the

16

practical effect of the 10 percent is -- is -- stops the

17

-- the younger person getting the money.

18

And you

1 percent comes out

So it's very tempting to say that that corpus

So does the case then turn on that?

I mean,

19

suppose -- suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40

20

percent of the people took out the money before they were

21

60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it.

22

should I reach the other result?

23

of how does this analysis work.

24

analysis?

25

MS. KARLAN:

Then

I'm just trying to think
What's the right

I would say at the 1 percent and 80

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

percent of the people are taking the money out, it

2

wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore.

3

But if I can give another statistic that might

4

be helpful in thinking about this.

5

participants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age

6

of 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MS. KARLAN:

9
10

What percent?

18 percent in one of the surveys.

And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt
under the bankruptcy -

11
12

18 percent of the

JUSTICE SCALIA:
against it.

13

Well, they're taking out loans

They're -- they're not withdrawing the money.

MS. KARLAN:

Well, but the loans because -- for

14

example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest

15

is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially

16

as close to taking out the money as you can get.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I still don't have your answer

18

to the problem that bothered me at the first.

19

do you reconcile your positions with on account of

20

language?

21

just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why

22

is it on account of age?

23

How -- how

If the -- if your clients can take the money -

MS. KARLAN:

It -- it's not the -- if you look

24

at the statute -- and let me just work my way through it

25

with you.

It's the right to a payment under a stock

plan that is because of disability, and the like.

MS. KARLAN:

I don't -- I don't think you need

to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading
here, especially given that the statute JUSTICE KENNEDY:

reading is that it -- it modifies payment.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so then you're -

you're MS. KARLAN:

-- that that's actually a right.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under that, you're giving the

-- the language that follows it no meaning.
MS. KARLAN:

No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think

13

that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think

14

that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly

15

refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's

16

entitled to exemption.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But as purely English -- as

18

purely English, I read it as saying it's a right.

that right?

20

account of age.

21

What is

The right is a right to receive a payment on
That's the -- a plan.

That's the right.

Now, your argument, I take it, was -- is that

22

yes, it's true you also have a right under certain

23

conditions to take it without respect to age.

24

have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a kind that gives you a

2

right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it

3

because of age without a penalty.

4

is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of

5

rights covered?

6

So -

7
8

And thus, the question

And the language doesn't answer it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But under Justice Breyer's

hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MS. KARLAN:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

No.
No, because the savings account

12

doesn't have -- I mean, the savings account doesn't have

13

the -- the penalty.

14

to read the right as meaning a right without penalty,

15

because if you don't read it that way, then every one of

16

these other retirement instruments is likewise going to

17

fail?

Isn't your argument that you've got

Isn't that your -- your strong point?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. KARLAN:

That's your strong point.

MS. KARLAN:

Right.

Thank you.

No matter how you read the statute,

it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the

10

statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not

11

cover many of the other -

in IRA's along with the other things?

MS. KARLAN:

Why didn't Congress just put

They did, Justice Ginsburg.

did in the last line of the statute.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but that's sort of an

17

oblique way to get it there.

it together with the other string of plans?

19

MS. KARLAN:

They

I mean, why didn't they put

Well, my best guess as to why they

20

didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions

21

statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they

22

stuck it in at the end of the list.

some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw

until -- until you reach a certain age.

structured that way, they would be covered.

with that argument?

MS. KARLAN:

And if they're
So you had to

What's wrong

Well, what's wrong with that,

8

Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're

9

administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service

10

sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early

11

withdrawal.

12

not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in

13

the United States -

So under their theory, there has -- there is

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MS. KARLAN:

Well -

-- that had that inability to take

16

the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a

17

half.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do -- do we know that?

I mean,

19

couldn't someone -- I -- I don't think this is a very

20

plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a

21

technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or

22

brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want

23

the IRA to be, in -- in effect, like an irrevocable trust

24

in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific

25

conditions?

And couldn't someone, using both the IRA

2

an IRA that would be as restricted as -- as the circuit

3

suggested it might be?

4

MS. KARLAN:

I don't necessarily think so for

5

the following reason.

IRA's are off-the-rack products.

6

They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people

7

buy.

People don't usually negotiate the terms.

8
9

If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's
the second problem.

Anytime you deviate from the form

10

that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also

11

gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to

12

penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held

13

to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax

14

code.

You then lose the ability to

Now, to answer the last part of your question,

19

one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5

20

to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that

21

essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a

22

matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors.

Why do they do that?

25

Because they recognize that IRA's

There's a -- there's a weird

anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law

9

10

courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to

11

protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the

12

Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means

13

that you can only save up to $500.

14

That's correct.

The bankruptcy

22

court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably

necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't

come within the meaning of section 522.

Yes, Your Honor.
How did you come to that

conclusion, that the entire amount?
MS. KARLAN:

Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and

you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you

hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an

8

annuity that, I would guess -- you know, I -- I hate to do

9

math in my head like this.

10
11

I'd guess it would throw off a

couple of hundred dollars a month in additional income.
And so if you ask will the Rouseys need that

12

money for their support, I think the answer is yes because

13

their only other support -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MS. KARLAN:

Well.

Oh, yes.

-- is Social Security and a $2,000

16

a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and

17

against which their Social Security will be offset.

when they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about

to be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan

reduces their benefits.

Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the

11

not exempt unless two requirements are met.

12

right to receive the payment must be on account of

the right must come from a specified similar plan or

in this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.

Now,

of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none

those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.

none of the -- we'll call them kind of the paradigm

to be if you read it in a -- in a very literal way.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, why?

Okay.

Once you're

2

down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a

3

plan that says you get the money because of age but you

4

also can get the money without respect to age in certain

5

circumstances can be a plan covered by the act.

6

that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you.

7

So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the

8

language as the other that you want to say even though

9

that is literally true, this plan is very different from

Now,

10

the others in terms of the purposes of the act.

11

what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved

12

by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of

13

holistic.

14

That's

So -- so the -- the point that I would like to

15

know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as

16

pensions -- I do.

17

much about it.

18

when you're old and sick.

But there is this extra thing

19

in it which you point to.

So why, in terms of purposes is

20

this different from the others?

21

I think of it that way.

I don't know

It's designed to help in the future, help

MS. McKIEVER:

This is different because this is

22

the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at

23

any time for any purpose.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

you do it with a penalty.

It is also I know that, but -- but -- and
We agree about the facts.

MS. McKIEVER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I want to know why that

difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or

4

less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're

5

60, 59 and a half.

6

MS. McKIEVER:

Because the right to -- to

7

receive the payment, the right to access the money at any

8

time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it

9

does not meet the language of the statute.

MS. McKIEVER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry.

Yes.

My question is we all agree

16

that there can be plans where you can get the money not

17

having to do with age, and they fall within the language

18

of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered.

19

this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the

20

purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.

21

MS. McKIEVER:

connection between any of the factors that are enumerated

in the statute and the right to receive the money.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

2

Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an

3

absolute prohibition, would you agree -- on getting the

4

money before you're 59 and a half, would then that

5

qualify?

6

MS. McKIEVER:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9
10
11

Absolutely, yes, it would.
Now, what if there were a 50

percent penalty?
MS. McKIEVER:

Clearly, there's a point at which

it would qualify as a prohibition more than just JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what is it that makes it a

12

prohibition?

13

deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically

14

unacceptable?

15

line somewhere above 10 percent?

16

MS. McKIEVER:

Is it -- is it because the purpose is to

What -- what is the reason for drawing the

The reason for drawing the line

17

is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated

19

minimal penalty.

20

access that's available.

21
22
23

However, there is still the unfettered

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But what is the purpose of

imposing any penalty at all?
MS. McKIEVER:

I would assume as a disincentive

24

to -- to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition,

25

such as the -- the parking -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But 50 percent would not be a

prohibition and neither would 90 percent.

3

MS. McKIEVER:

It would not be a prohibition,

4

but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10

5

percent.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it's a matter of degree

7

rather than a difference in kind.

8

MS. McKIEVER:

9

difficult line to draw.

10

Clearly that -- it's a very

this moment, but -

It seems to me the easiest

puts it into the category of things that are -- you're not

supposed to have an absolute right to get.

But the fact that for a -- an important

MS. McKIEVER:

reason -

31

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with

2

regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose

3

of the statute is to make sure that people have money for

4

their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any

5

reason whatever, there is no security that that money will

6

be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the

7

reasons to sickness and -- and a certain other number of

8

emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for

9

the retirement are much higher.

10

MS. McKIEVER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that the answer?

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if that's the answer,

13

excellent.

Well, that -- that's -

So now we have --

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MS. McKIEVER:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- let's say Thank you, Justice Scalia.
Let's try -- let's try a

18

million percent tax and nobody in history has ever

19

withdrawn the money.

20

would fall within this.

MS. McKIEVER:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MS. McKIEVER:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Now, would -- that you would say

Yes.
Fine, yes.

Now, if that would fall

within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that

32

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice

2

Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar

3

that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from

4

withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old

5

age -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent

6

tax in a world that is imperfect?

7

MS. McKIEVER:

Because clearly the -- the access

8

of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement,

9

just as -- as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the

10

-- the debtors to -- to access freely for any purpose,

11

clearly not showing that -- that it would be for

12

retirement purposes.

12

that we're really looking to is that there has to be a

13

direct causation factor between one of the five specified

14

factors such as on -- on account of factors, age,

15

disability, death, length of service, and the right to

16

receive the payment.

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but typically these

18

plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and

19

other plans that are mentioned in the act allow

20

withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or

21

something like that.

endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what

doesn't.

And every plan that I know of

So I just don't see how your argument is going
to --

8

MS. McKIEVER:

Well, the -- the ability to

9

access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do

10

with the length of service, the years in service because

11

they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full

12

percentage.

13

They're not fully vested until that time.

Also, with the -- when there are multiple

14

factors existing in the right to receive the payments,

15

each multiple factor can be a cause of the -- of the

16

ability to reach the money.

17

factors imposed, though -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

When there are no meaningful

Isn't it simpler to just

19

recognize that these plans are covered despite the right

necessary for the support?

appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as

-- taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if

3

it is or is not exempt.

4

whether they are truly retirement accounts or -- or if

5

they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify

under this statute.

7

-- and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under

8

522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on

9

what can be potentially exempt under that statute.

10

Therefore, all types of accounts,

If -- if you want to open it up and

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

No.

Well, obviously, it's -

11

it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be

12

obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be

exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct
