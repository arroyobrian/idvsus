Mr. Farley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA D. FARLEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. FARLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before you today, of whether or

11

not police can impermissibly create exigent

12

circumstances, arises from the improper suppression of

13

reasonably seized evidence after a reasonable

14

warrantless entry.

15

Supreme Court is improper for several reasons, the first

16

of which is that this Court has routinely held that the

17

subjective intent of police officers when effecting a

18

warrantless entry is irrelevant.

19

The test set forth by the Kentucky

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where did the -- where

20

did the Kentucky Supreme Court -- where did the Kentucky

21

Supreme Court say that it was looking to a subjective

22

state of mind on the part of the police?

23

MR. FARLEY:

Well, the Kentucky Supreme

24

Court's first prong of their test -- and I believe it's

25

in our petition appendix on page 26 -- I'm sorry.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

Their -- their discussion starts on page 44a and carries

2

over to 46a.

3

whether or not the officers acted in bad faith in an

4

attempt to purposefully evade the warrant requirements.

5
6

The first question of their test is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That didn't -- that

didn't apply in this case?

7

MR. FARLEY:

8

The second prong of the Kentucky Supreme

9

That is correct.

Court's test is whether or not the actions of the

10

Respondent in this case or the occupant of the home

11

would have been foreseeable by the police officers

12

before they knocked and announced their presence.

13
14

Now, the problem with the foreseeability
test -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why is -- why is that

16

subjective?

17

to a reasonable police officer similarly situated?

18

Why isn't that -- would it be foreseeable

MR. FARLEY:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it -

19

it isn't directly a subjective inquiry.

However, police

20

officers are trained to expect and foresee illegal

21

activity so that they may carry out the duties of their

22

job in protecting the citizens.

23

foreseeability test, a reasonable officer will always

24

foresee illegal activity in response to his actions, be

25

it walking down the street or knocking on your door.

So under a

Alderson Reporting Company

A

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

reasonable officer will always foresee illegal activity,

2

and for that reason, the Kentucky Supreme Court's test

3

is completely unworkable.

4

Several of the other circuits and the lower

5

courts have adopted tests that also attempt to add an

6

extra exception, an unwarranted closure of the exigent

7

circumstances exception that narrows the use of that

8

exception by police officers.

9

Commonwealth would propose is a simple lawfulness test.

10

Now, under this test, as long as an officer

The test that the

11

behaves lawfully, there should be no suppression of

12

evidence seized after an otherwise reasonable search.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, you have an

14

apartment building where the police know from experience

15

there's a lot of illegal activity, a lot of drugs, drug

16

transactions.

17

knock on every door and wait for evidence of the

18

destruction of -- of drugs.

19

Every 2 weeks, they walk through and

MR. FARLEY:

Is that all right?

Well, there's -- I would say

20

"yes," if there's probable cause as well as exigent

21

circumstances.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the probable

23

cause, of course, comes when they hear the, you know,

24

flushing and the, you know, hiding or whatever behind

25

the door.

MR. FARLEY:

Well, I would assert that there

are -- there are two separate issues here.

3

have probable cause separate from the existence of

4

exigent circumstances.

5

cause due to the smell of marijuana.

6

You must

In this case, there was probable

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They go to the apartment

7

building, and they sniff at every door, and when they

8

sniff, when a strong smell of marijuana emanates from

9

the door, then they go through this routine, but they do

10

it as a matter of every 2 weeks, as the Chief said, as a

11

routine matter.

12

but they knock on the doors where they smell marijuana,

13

and they do that just as a routine, in all the buildings

14

where they suspect there may be drug -- drugs being

15

stashed.

16

They don't just knock on every door,

MR. FARLEY:

Justice Ginsburg, under a

17

simple lawfulness test, since the officers have not

18

violated the Fourth Amendment prior to the exigency

19

arising, there would be no need to suppress any

20

evidence.

21

to do that.

22

That would be perfectly fine for the officers
It may not be the most -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May we just go back

over -- you're putting in the fleeing felon, but as far

as I understand from this record, it was never shown

that the dealer that the police were following was aware

that he was following and that he was fleeing from them.

10

This is the -- it's not part of the question you

presented, because we granted only on the exigent

dealer wasn't called, and he wasn't asked did you even

There's nothing illegal about walking down the hall and

And if as a police officer

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in your view -
May I ask a question that

goes back to what you said?

nicely that there has to be probable cause to think that

14

there's something wrong going on in the -- the

15

apartment.

16

they -- the marijuana -- a strong smell comes from the

door, at that point the police could go and get a

18

warrant.

You have clarified very

preference for getting the warrant.

23

situation wouldn't the first response of the police

24

be -- instead of knocking, because once they knock they

alert the people in there:

So why in this

MR. FARLEY:

Well, the officers testified

3

under these circumstances that they believed that they

4

were in hot pursuit of this felon.

5

were at the door, they believed he had entered this

6

apartment and was aware of their presence and was

7

destroying evidence of his deal of crack cocaine, so

8

this is a fluid, evolving -

So at the time they

that was described by this police officer.

all it takes, any police officer will come in and say:

So if that's

Well -
Aren't we just doing

away with Johnson?

22

they can just walk in whenever they smell marijuana,

whenever they think there's drugs on the other side?

Why do we even bother giving them a -- a warrant?

And aren't we just simply saying

I think that when determining whether an exigent

to inform an occupant of a right to denial.

the officers could not have forced their way into the

That would have made this a case like Johnson.

simply knocked, said "We're going to kick the door in if

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, a person might not -
I mean, that's peculiar

behavior, isn't it?
MS. O'CONNELL:

A person doesn't have to

options are fine.

A person might come to the door; they

that's certainly a lawful option that somebody has when

But walk in the other

That's -
Strange.
I guess some people might do

19

that if they don't want to give consent to police entry.

20

I think that in order to go in, based on an exigent

21

circumstance, the police would have to be able to

22

articulate to a court that they objectively, reasonably

23

believed that there was destruction of evidence

24

occurring inside.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And what was that here?

Alderson Reporting Company

Because it was kind of vague.

2

What kind -- what kind of movement?

3

said nothing about a toilet flushing -

4

MS. O'CONNELL:

They heard movement.
It didn't -- it

Justice Ginsburg, it's our

5

position that the Court should assume that there was an

6

exigency in this case.

7

In the Respondent's brief in opposition, he

8

argued that there was insufficient evidence of exigency.

9

The Court nonetheless granted cert on the question of

10

whether a police-created exigency would be okay under

11

the Fourth Amendment.

12

that the Court should assume there was an exigency, and

13

if it agrees with Kentucky on the question presented and

14

then reverses, it should remand to the Kentucky Supreme

15

Court for a determination of whether an exigency

16

existed.

The Solicitor General believes

17

The trial court in this case certainly found

18

that the movement inside of the apartment was enough for

19

the officer to reasonably conclude that somebody inside

20

was destroying evidence.

21

assumed that that was so in order to reach the question

22

presented in this case that the Court granted cert on.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The Kentucky Supreme Court

Ms. O'Connell, if I could

24

ask you about the government's proposed standard:

25

say that as long as each step in the police conduct is
Alderson Reporting Company

You

Official - Subject to Final Review

22

lawful, that's sufficient.

2

way the Fourth Amendment works, each step -- we're

3

asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable.

4

And each step would -- the

What some courts have done, in addition to

5

that -- and this was not the approach of the court

6

below -- but what some courts have done is to say we

7

also ask a more holistic reasonableness question.

8

say:

9

with respect to this person reasonable?

We

Is the whole process by which the police operated
So, for

10

example, we might say, you know, was there time to get a

11

warrant, or did it look like the police were just -

12

they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate?

13

So what's wrong with that sort of standard?

14

In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable,

15

to say, look, is the whole pattern here of what the

16

police did to come up with this evidence reasonable?

17

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think the problem with

18

that test, Justice Kagan, is that police officers have

19

options of how they can conduct searches and seizures.

20

Getting a warrant is one way that they could do that.

21

Getting consent to conduct a search or a seizure is

22

another way.

23

precedents for requiring police officers to choose one

24

of those options over another if both options are

25

lawful.

There's no justification in this Court's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
In this case, the police officers knocked on

1
2

the door, not sure which apartment the person that they

3

were pursuing fled into, in order to determine whether

4

that was the correct apartment.

5

they needed to get a warrant before knocking on the door

6

and seeking cooperation of the people inside.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

There's no reason why

Is it your position that

8

the police can do anything that's lawful, even if the

9

purpose of doing so is to create exigent circumstances?
MS. O'CONNELL:

10

Yes, I think that under this

11

Court -- the way that this Court has interpreted Fourth

12

Amendment warrant exceptions, as long as there is no

13

violation of the Fourth Amendment, that is okay.

14

police officers can rely on any ensuing exigency.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

The

The -- the question

16

presented in the blue brief used the word

17

"impermissible," and we're talking about "unlawful."

take it that there is a difference in those -- or no

19

difference?
MS. O'CONNELL:

20

I

Well, yes, there is a

21

difference.

I think that that comes up in Respondent's

22

argument that if there was an impermissible demand for

23

entry -- for example, if the police officer said "I have

24

a warrant, let me in," even though he didn't, as in

25

Bumper v. North Carolina -- that that could still be

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are the objections to

adding in the alternative "or in bad faith"?

7

MS. O'CONNELL:

Justice Breyer, the

8

objection to that is simply that in all cases that are

9

founded upon probable cause that are not programmatic

10

searches that are conducted without any individualized

11

suspicion, this Court has repeatedly rejected prongs of

12

a Fourth Amendment test that -- that rely on the

subjective assessment -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Objectively?

I mean, what

we're trying to rule out is they -- they hitch -- they

So what about that, objectively

19

MS. O'CONNELL:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry.

I don't -

My point is a solely

21

unlawfulness test would allow the police to get into the

22

habit of just knocking at every door, but if you say

23

that also it has to survive a bad-faith test, where bad

24

faith is objectively, not subjectively, determined, then

25

you will rule out the possibility of the police

hatching -- which I don't know if they would, but

hatching such a plan.

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

I guess that it's not

4

totally clear what bad faith would mean in this

5

context -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, there are circuits

7

who have adopted a bad-faith test in the alternative

8

with other things than the word "unlawful."

9

Circuit uses only the word "unlawful," and I thought we

The Second

10

took this case to iron out that discrepancy.

And if we

11

did, I'd like to know your objection to ironing it out

12

by taking the Second Circuit test but adding on an

13

objectively determined bad-faith rule.

14

MS. O'CONNELL:

Justice Breyer, I don't -- I

15

don't know what it means to act in bad faith in a case

16

like this as a police officer.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Maybe it could mean having

18

no reason for knocking on the door other than to create

19

exigent circumstances.

20

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, Justice Alito, I think

21

that it would be difficult to determine objectively

22

whether that was the case.

Certainly -

MS. O'CONNELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think that -
Hey, great idea.

Now suppose that's the record.
I think that there's already

a significant risk built into the Fourth Amendment that

10

police officers, if they knock on the door and they

11

don't hear somebody destroying evidence inside, they're

12

going to have to leave and get a warrant.

that's enough of a deterrent.

There's a hypothetical in

marijuana.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.

That's what I

mean, and I don't always spell it out.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. O'CONNELL:

Perfectly okay?
Right, and I think that

12

there's -- the Court shouldn't be concerned, and

13

certainly shouldn't be concerned enough to adopt a

14

bad-faith or a subjective motivation prong to a test

15

that it creates which is -

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what makes that

17

different than knocking on the door and saying "Open the

18

door or I'm going to kick it in"?

19

lawful because until the person submits, you're

20

suggesting there's no coercion in that whatsoever.

21
22
23

MS. O'CONNELL:

You're saying that's

That's true, and, Justice

Sotomayor, to be clear -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why wouldn't that

24

objectively be bad faith if what we find out is that

25

they now have a tactic which is they go through this
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

building, and every time they smell marijuana, hash, or

2

-- I don't know if crack cocaine smells or not when

3

they're smoking it -- but whenever they smell something,

4

they just do that.

5

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think the -- the fact that

6

if the person actually does what the police officer says

7

and answers the door will mean that the evidence would

8

be excluded as a coerced consent search is enough of a

9

deterrent to that sort of conduct.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there's no bad-faith

11

measure whatsoever in your analysis -

12

MS. O'CONNELL:

13
14

I don't think it's

necessary.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and lawfulness is

15

defined by actual physical seizure.

16

that suggest something else, a command to submit, your

17

argument would be lost, correct?

MS. O'CONNELL:

I think that's right, if the

19

person submits to the command.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MS. DRAKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

The odor of burnt marijuana, coupled with

4

Officer Cobb's cursory and equivocal testimony about the

5

sounds of movement he couldn't discern exactly and that

6

his training and experience led him only possibly to

7

conclude was consistent with the destruction of

8

evidence, is insufficient to establish exigent

9

circumstances.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Although you're -

The -- I'm sorry.
You're describing

13

what you think the evidence was to support exigency, and

14

the suggestion we've heard on the other side is that

15

that's an issue that can be addressed on remand once we,

16

according to the other side, correct the State court's

17

error in that this -- you -- the police cannot create

18

exigent circumstances.

19

So I -- I don't know that it's terribly

20

relevant what the underlying facts about what they heard

21

was.

22

depending on what our opinion says.

23

That will be relevant depending, or not -

MS. DRAKE:

It's relevant because it goes to

24

whether exigent circumstances existed.

25

question of whether a remand would be appropriate in
Alderson Reporting Company

And as to the

this case, the question of whether exigent circumstances

2

existed is logically antecedent in any created exigency

3

case.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

at all.

6

circumstances existed; you cannot create exigent

7

circumstances; so I don't care whether they were or not.

8

The court said:

No, it's -- it's not

I don't care whether exigent

The legal standard is antecedent to the
application of the facts.

10

MS. DRAKE:

There's no point in delving into

11

whether an exigency was created by the police if there

12

is no exigency to begin with.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I think the

14

Court is interested in taking the case on the question

15

whether or not the police may create exigent

16

circumstances and use those exigent circumstances to

17

enter.

18

circumstances here because of the sound is -- is, it

19

seems to me, a subsidiary question.

20

Now, whether or not there were exigent

MS. DRAKE:

The other problem with remanding

21

this case for further determination on this issue is, as

22

this Court is aware, the procedural posture of this case

23

is troubling.

24

There is no potential for further proceedings here.

25

There is no --

The case has already been dismissed.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, sure, there is.

2

It was dismissed because the State supreme court held

3

you can't bring this evidence in.

4

you can, then the issue becomes live again.

5

MS. DRAKE:

If we say, oh, yes,

That conclusion is dependent on

6

the notion that an indictment is merged with the

7

judgment such that a decision in the Commonwealth's

8

favor in this case would vacate the decision of the

9

Kentucky Supreme Court, which in turn vacates the

10

underlying suppression order.

11

for the notion that an indictment and a judgment merge

12

as a matter of Kentucky law, and so a decision -

But there is no authority

you presented to us in the letter, right?

This is the argument

Yes, Your Honor.
And yet, we

nonetheless decided to have argument.

18

MS. DRAKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So maybe it would

20

be -- it's your case, but maybe it would be best to move

21

on to the legal issue.

MS. DRAKE:

If we move to the question of

23

whether the police have created exigent circumstances,

24

it's important that we're all operating on the same

25

understanding, the facts in this case.

do?
MS. DRAKE:

Yes.

the penal code.

3

the question is whether it's reasonable.

21

And it seems to me the same thing is going on here.

22

We said that's perfectly okay.

These people could have answered the door -

23

there's a policeman knocking on the door; all he's

saying is "Open the door, open the door" -- and say

25

"Yes, what do you want?"

I have two responses to Your

Honor's question.

The first is that -- and along with

8

this notion that criminals are stupid and so that's why

9

we get all these criminal cases, there is no difference

10

between what happened in this case and how an innocent

11

person would respond.

12

Recall Officer Cobb's testimony is simply

13

that, after banging, he heard movement.

14

person at 10:00 at night would have to move in order -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Any innocent

Could I ask you this?

It

16

might -- it might make a difference to me whether the

17

police demanded entry prior to the time when the alleged

18

exigent circumstances arose.

19

this point that I am aware of is on pages 22 and 23 of

20

the appendix, when police banged on the door as loud as

21

they could and announced "Police, police, police," and

22

then Detective Maynard banged on the door and said "This

23

is the police."

24
25

And the only testimony on

Now, is there any -- anything more in the
record?

Any evidence that they -- prior to the time
Alderson Reporting Company

when they heard what they allegedly heard, that they

2

said "Open the door"?

3

MS. DRAKE:

The portion of the Joint

4

Appendix that I quoted to the Court -- we explained to

5

them we were going to make entry -- appears on page 24.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

MS. DRAKE:

8

Right.

So, if Your Honor keeps

reading -

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

It starts -- it says:

We

10

knew that there was possibly something that was going to

11

be destroyed inside the apartment.

12

Detective Maynard -- this is after they heard the

13

sounds, after they claim to have heard the sounds.

14

MS. DRAKE:

Yes.

At that point

Officer Cobb's testimony

15

suggests that the demand came after they heard the sound

16

of movement.

17

is that this was all happening simultaneously and in

18

very quick fashion.

But the chronology of the demand is not
dispositive in this case because the demand itself is

is there anything wrong with that?

MS. DRAKE:

It -- it depends entirely on

whether a reasonable person would interpret that

behavior as the officer conveying the impression that

entry was imminent and inevitable.

what is unreasonable about what the officers did here?

What was there here to make

2

case where they come in and, in effect, demand entry.

3

My understanding is that the issue in the case is

4

whether or not, after a request for entry, they can then

5

base probable cause in dispensing with the warrant based

6

on what they hear from behind the door.

7

I mean, this is not a

Now, I know you think that they -- whatever

8

they hear is perfectly innocent; but the issue is

9

whenever they knock on the door, "Police" or "Can we

10

come in" or whatever, and then they hear that, the

11

activity behind the door, they have reason and can -

12

can enter.

13

Now, what you're -- it seems to me what

14

you're arguing is, well, they did something else.

15

banged on the door, they yelled "Police"; it wasn't

16

simply knocking on the door and seeking entry.

17

may be right, again, on the facts, but it seems to me

that's for -- for later on.

19

They

I want to know what your position is on

whether they can assume, at least for me, they knock and

23

MS. DRAKE:

If I understand Your Honor's

24

25

call a true "knock and talk."

They're seeking --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

39
1

they're on -- the scenario is such that no one would

2

doubt they're attempting a consensual encounter.

3

Our position is because that behavior is

4

reasonable, it is not made unreasonable by the fact that

5

evidence may be destroyed, and so suppression would not

6

be the remedy.

7

Well, then, here -

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So you agree

8

that -- that the court below is wrong because what they

9

say, as I read it, is irrespective of how reasonably the

10

police behave, if it is reasonably foreseeable that

11

their tactic will create exigent circumstances -- and I

12

would think it's reasonably foreseeable, when you knock

13

on the door very politely and say "The police," that

14

somebody might shout out "Hide the pot"; all right?

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

That if that's reasonable

17

foreseeable, says the court, then that violates the

18

Fourth Amendment.

19

says as long as the police behaved unlawfully, it -

20

lawfully, lawfully -- it does not violate the Fourth

21

Amendment; and we have the First Circuit that has some

kind of bad-faith test plus an unreasonable or improper

And to the extent that "lawful"

extent that there does not need to be a completed

6

There is area of agreement between the Commonwealth and

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what took this outside of

the category of the ordinary knock and talk?
MS. DRAKE:

This is not a knock and a -

characterized it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I -- you -- you might

have considerable support on the Court for the

10

proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created

11

by unlawful activity by the police, which would include

12

conveying the impression that they are about to kick the

13

door in, then -- then you have a different case.

14

but I thought the case we had before us is what if the

15

police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and

16

they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they

17

smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion

18

inside, does that justify their going in?

19

But -

And that's what I thought we took the case

20

for, and that's a different question.

21

-- you're trying to make the police officers' actions

22

unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions

23

were unlawful you have a different case, and probably

the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't

MS. DRAKE:

these police officers were behaving as though they had a

I -- I grant you that attempting -- that there is

something troubling about the police attempting to

Now,

or not.

11

You're saying just a loud knock, a scream,

14

MS. DRAKE:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's how I'm

I -
Or -- or are you going

16

further and trying to say that, as a matter of fact, the

testimony's critically clear that they knocked loudly,

said "Police," and said "Let us in or we're going to

that point can they enter without a warrant?

Okay.

But you said -- just add on

to that.

answer that question.

unreasonably when he or she conveys the impression that

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

But the test

you're using there, the key word is "unreasonable."

5

MS. DRAKE:

Yes, Your Honor.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

And the reason you

7

choose the word "unreasonable" rather than the Second

Circuit's test of "unlawful" is?

9

MS. DRAKE:

Because, frankly, I'm not sure

10

what that means, and I think that's become clear in the

11

context of this briefing.

12

police have had to violate a portion of the penal code?

MS. DRAKE:

Yes.

question is, as is the case in every Fourth Amendment

case, did the officers act -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have any doubt that

4

it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst

into a home?

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why do you need

10

If, indeed, there -- there was a threat

that was the threat, then it's unlawful, surely.

11

MS. DRAKE:

Yes, and that's why my answer to

12

Justice Kagan's question was to the extent that

13

"unlawful" and "unreasonable" are synonyms, we would

14

agree.

15

Now, if the Court is not terribly -- does

16

not find our test convincing, the next-best test, we

17

believe, is a foreseeability test.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is your test is something

19

novel?

20

some five tests in the different circuits, and the

21

foreseeability test is the one that the Kentucky Supreme

22

Court used, but is your -- does your test coincide with

23

the tests of any other circuits, or is it different?

we're essentially saying the police shouldn't act as

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is -- what is

an example of conduct that you would consider

10

unreasonable resulting in suppression of the evidence

11

that would not be unlawful?

MS. DRAKE:

Well, it's very hard -- it's

very hard to conceive of where the daylight would be -

MS. DRAKE:

Right.

-- between those terms,

"reasonable" and "unlawful," so long as "unlawful"

doesn't mean violation of a penal code provision and so

18

long as it doesn't mean, as the Commonwealth is

suggesting, that there has to be -- that the defendant

would have to first demonstrate that the police were

seized in order to be able to convincingly argue that

the search was unreasonable.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The problem is that as

reasonable as the test is, it's not the test that was

used by the court below, and you want us to affirm the

6

decision below, which simply said if the exigent

circumstances are -- are the consequence of the police

action, whatever the police action was -- lawful,

9

reasonable, whatever -- the evidence has to be excluded.

10
11

How can we affirm that decision as you want
us to do, even -- even applying your test?

12

MS. DRAKE:

Well, the factual record in this

13

case is fully developed, and how a reasonable person

14

would interpret the scenario is a mixed question of law

15

and fact, which -- this Court would review the decision

of the Kentucky Supreme Court in that regard de novo

anyway.

Court is asked to review the record, make a

determination of how an ordinary person would interpret

In that regard, it's no different than any

It is simply unreasonable and unlawful for

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Farley, one of the

4

points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when

people search your home, they have a warrant.

6

course, there are exceptions to that.

7

one place where the warrant requirement has real force,

8

it's in the home.

And, of

But if there is

9

And I think that the concern here -- and you

10

have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern

11

here is that your test is going to enable the police to

12

penetrate the home, to search the home, without a

13

warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very

14

wide variety of cases, that all the police really have

to say is:

there was some criminal activity going on for whatever

reason, and we heard noise.
