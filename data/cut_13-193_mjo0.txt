 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

4

first this morning in Case 13193, Susan B. Anthony List 

5

v. Steven Driehaus. 

6

 Mr. Carvin? 

7

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN 

8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

9

 MR. CARVIN: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Under this Court's straightforward precedent, 

12

this case presents a clearly ripe and justiciable 

13

controversy.  All agree that the test is whether or not 

14

there's a credible threat of enforcement.  Here we know 

15

THAT there's a credible threat of enforcement because 

16

the Commission's Probable Cause panel in 2010 said that 

17

the speech at issue probably violated Ohio's false 

18

statement law. 

19

 Since an enforcement agency has already told 

20

us that this statement probably violates their law, we 

21

obviously face a clear and very credible threat of 

22

enforcement if we repeat those statements as we alleged 

23

we would do. 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Are you making that 

argument on behalf of the other organization?  Susan B.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Anthony List, you have accurately described what 

2

occurred.  But the other organization has never been 

3

charged before the Ohio Election Commission.  Is there 

4

any reason to believe anybody's going to lodge a 

5

complaint against it? 

6

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, Your Honor, when they 

7

filed their complaint, they alleged that they had not 

8

spoken those words because Susan B. Anthony had already 

9

been drawn into the Commission's procedures and the 

10

Commission had already found probable cause.  So 

11

since 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How is that any 

13

different from  how is that any different from the 

14

people in Younger, who the Court dismissed as having no 

15

standing because they hadn't been prosecuted despite the 

16

same identical claim?  They were chilled, they might 

17

intend to do something similar, et cetera. 

18

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, as Justice Brennan put it 

19

in Younger, the  the speech that the other three 

20

speakers were going to engage in was not even of the 

21

same genre as that of the person who would be  was 

22

being prosecuted, which is why the Court, quite 

23

correctly said, that their chilling effect was based on 

24

an imaginatory or speculative fear of enforcement. 

25

Whereas here, COAST was going to say precisely the same

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

words that SBA had already been found to have probably 

2

violated the FalseStatement Law.  So it's hard to 

3

imagine or 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that the Court 

5

in Younger said with respect to those other three, that 

6

they had never been threatened with prosecution.  I 

7

don't recall it made a distinction on the basis of 

8

what they wanted to talk about. 

9

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, two of the people were 

10

labor picketers that had never been threatened and one 

11

was somebody who was simply teaching Marx in a classroom 

12

environment.  They were quite distinct from the speaker 

13

who had been prosecuted under the incitement to violence 

14

law.  And, again, Justice Brennan looked at their 

15

statements, compared them to the statements of the 

16

person who had been prosecuted and said they're not even 

17

of the same genre. 

18

 So we're not arguing that somebody could 

19

come in here and argue that anything that's 

20

controversial creates a credible threat of enforcement, 

21

but we've got a very specific concrete example.  Speaker 

22

A says X, that's found to have a probable cause. 

23

Speaker B quite reasonably thinks if they've just 

24

dragged Speaker A in front of this Commission and the 

25

Commission has found probable cause, there's no reason

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1
2

in the world to think that we won't be brought in. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the one question is 

3

who is the "they"?  Now, it might be that Susan B. 

4

Anthony List is considered a group with real clout.  So 

5

a candidate might be really concerned about Susan B. 

6

Anthony's speech.  But the other organization maybe is 

7

not as well funded and the candidate says, well, a lot 

8

of things are said in political campaigns.  I'll let 

9

this one go.  This one doesn't hurt me as much. 

10

 MR. CARVIN: 

Two points, Justice Ginsburg. 

11

First, Driehaus had shown a very  he was in the middle 

12

of a very tough reelection campaign and he had shown he 

13

was going to take all the steps he could to squelch this 

14

notion that he supported taxpayer abortions.  He had 

15

already spent all the money in terms of SBA list.  So it 

16

literally  all he'd have to do is Xerox it to  to 

17

come after COAST. 

18

 But I think the key point here is we don't 

19

have to negative every conceivable hypothetical on why 

20

Driehaus might not do this, and the Commission might not 

21

do that.  There's a presumption that if you have 

22

violated the laws as the Probable Cause Panel said we 

23

probably had, that the agency is going to enforce the 

24

law.  If you require us to negative every hypothetical, 

25

then the only way to test that hypothesis is to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1
2
3

engage in the speech and 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do you square this 

with Clapper? 

4

 MR. CARVIN: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I apologize. 
Why isn't this as 

6

speculative as Clapper?  You have to assume first that 

7

there's a candidate who is going to react by initiating 

8

an action, you have to assume further that a panel is 

9

going to render the same decision, and you have to 

10

assume even further that a Federal prosecutor  that 

11

the prosecutor is going to agree and actually bring the 

12

case. 

13

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, those are the steps that 

14

are required to put my clients in jail.  But we suffer 

15

Article III injury well before any prosecutor prosecutes 

16

us.  Once a complaint is filed, then we are subjected to 

17

very serious costs and risks of litigation in front of 

18

the Commission, and in the middle of an election 

19

campaign during the crucial weeks when we're trying to 

20

get our speech out. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And I take it that's 

22

that's enforced by subpoenas.  If the speaker doesn't 

23

want to appear before the Commission, he can be served 

24

with a subpoena, which is judicially enforceable. 

25

 MR. CARVIN: 

There's  there's two things,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

Justice Kennedy.  At the initial stage, if we don't 

2

respond to the complaint, the Commission's regulations 

3

make it clear that they may well view that as a default 

4

judgment and  and enter a judgment against us right 

5

away. 

6

 Once the probable cause determination comes 

7

down, you have all of these kinds of subpoenas and very 

8

intrusive discovery of the sort you had in our case 

9

where they ask for our communications with everybody on 

10

the right wing of the political aisle, where we have to 

11

reveal our internal communications as well as those of 

12

others. 

13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Now, the State can 

14

characterize its own position, but do you understand the 

15

State to say that well, the existence of the Commission 

16

means that frivolous claims can be washed out, that they 

17

can actually get some protection by an advance ruling. 

18

Is that the State's position? 

19

 MR. CARVIN: 

No.  Neither the Commission has 

20

argued that, and the Attorney General's amicus on our 

21

side makes it quite clear that there is no provision for 

22

doing it.  If you read their rules, they have to go to a 

23

probable cause hearing in three days.  There's literally 

24

no opportunity to wipe out socalled frivolous claims. 

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But I mean, I thought  I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

thought their position was that this would  would 

2

sharpen the controversy and make it more concrete or 

3

something like that. 

4

 MR. CARVIN: 

That's precisely right. 

5

They're arguing  the whole point of this statute is 

6

some kind of truthtelling function, so they want us 

7

to 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There is a provision for 

an advisory opinion, unless the question is if you are 

10

arguing strenuously that this statute violates the 

11

Constitution.  You could have asked the Commission for 

12

an advisory opinion saying that the statute can't be 

13

enforced, but you didn't do that. 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

No, we didn't because we think 

15

that's unconstitutional.  Our constitutional claim here 

16

is the ministry of truth has no ability to judge our 

17

political speech as falsity.  So obviously, we wouldn't 

18

have subjected ourselves voluntarily to the ministry of 

19

truth before we decided to challenge their 

20

constitutional validity.  Then we would have been 

21

inflicting the constitutional injury on ourselves. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

23

 MR. CARVIN: 

Mr.  please. 
I was just going to say, even 

24

the Commission recognizes that the declaratory judgment 

25

advisory opinion procedure doesn't work in the heat of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1
2

an election campaign as it was here.  But please 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Is  is your argument 

3

dependent on the following two facts:  The first that 

4

there was a probable cause determination, and the second 

5

that the Susan Anthony group and the other group wanted 

6

to repeat the exact same statement?  Are those the two 

7

things that  that ground your argument? 

8
9

 MR. CARVIN: 

We  we think that makes it 

all  all but dispositive, yes.  That it's possible not 

10

to find a credible threat given those two facts.  They 

11

had found this speech probably violated the Ohio 

12

election statute.  And two, we were going to say exactly 

13

the same thing.  So 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

15

 MR. CARVIN: 

So if  I'm sorry. 
Well, I just want to make it 

16

clear that the threat of enforcement is particularly 

17

acute here because not only is  is enforcement power 

18

handed to a group of elected officials with certain 

19

ethical and political accountability things.  Any one of 

20

our political opponents is  is empowered under the 

21

statute to bring us in front of the Commission.  So all 

22

they have to do is Xerox the Driehaus complaint, Xerox 

23

the probable cause finding, and Xerox a district court 

24

finding that said our speech was untrue.  So since there 

25

is millions of people who were deputized under the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

statute, who have every political motivation to squelch 

2

our speech in  before a campaign, then I think 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But that would suggest 

4

something even broader.  That would suggest that even in 

5

the first instance, before the probable cause 

6

determination was made, Susan Anthony would know that 

7

it's going to be speaking about a very controversial 

8

subject in which some people will think it's telling the 

9

truth and other people will think it's lying, and that 

10

there's a very good chance that somebody is going to 

11

bring this to the Commission.  So that would suggest 

12

that they have standing even at that moment before the 

13

initial probable cause determination is made. 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

Justice Kagan, we can agree 

15

that given the amorphous nature of this prohibition in 

16

the false statement, it's difficult to predict in 

17

advance who and when is going to do it.  But to return 

18

to my prior answer, all of that ambiguity is gone once 

19

the expert agency has already told you that there's a 

20

probable cause to believe it violates it. 

21

 So this separates us from every other 

22

speaker who is simply concerned that they will be 

23

brought in front of the Commission.  We have an 

24

identifiable track record that we have been brought in 

25

front of the Commission.  And in that regard, I would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

point out that the Secretary of State is obliged to 

2

refer anything to the Commission if he has  should 

3

know that there's a violation. 

4

 Well, in the wake of the Probable Cause 

5

Panel's prior probability determination, it would seem 

6

that he's either ethically obliged to file a complaint 

7

against us or at least there's a very high likelihood 

8

that he would.  And, again, I don't want us to lose 

9

sight of the other side of the calculus, which is that 

10

if  if we have to prove all of these hypotheticals 

11

with certainty, if we have to engage in more the 

12

presumption that the State will enforce its own laws, 

13

you have created an insoluble dilemma for speakers, 

14

because you have  you have conditioned their access to 

15

the political marketplace of ideas on a very serious 

16

threat of being dragged into this process. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, let me ask you 

18

something going back in part to Justice Kagan. 

19

Basically, as a bottom line, you think there's nothing 

20

that could be salvaged from this process.  Presumably, 

21

you think that even if your client speaks a falsehood, 

22

it still chills improperly. 

23

 MR. CARVIN: 

We think that if the commission 

24

is going to drag us in front of them to justify our 

25

political speech to a bunch of State officials that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

they  that is, A, Article III cognizable injury, and 

2

B, unconstitutional.  I was explaining to 

3

Justice Ginsburg 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You're  you're not asking 

5

us to resolve the constitutional question, just the 

6

question of whether you can raise the Constitution. 

7

 MR. CARVIN: 

All we're trying for is our day 

8

in court so that we can make this argument.  And I was 

9

just explaining to Justice Ginsburg that that's a reason 

10

we wouldn't voluntarily invoke a procedure that we are 

11

about to challenge as constitutional.  It would be 

12

cutting off our nose to spite our face. 

13

 And  and I also would like to point out 

14

that this is election speech.  And  and that has two 

15

very significant components to it.  One is that it's 

16

obviously the core of the First Amendment.  This is how 

17

we choose our representatives in our democracy.  But it 

18

also has an extraordinarily short shelf life.  No one is 

19

listening to election speech hardly at all 60 days 

20

before an election, and the day after the election no 

21

one either speaks or listens.  So you have about a 

22

2month window where you can make these election speech 

23

points, which means two things.  One is any distraction 

24

during that crucial period, as this Court noted in 

25

Wisconsin Right to Life, really does constitute a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1
2

serious Article III injury. 
 But the other point is you're never going to 

3

be able to adjudicate it within that 60day window, 

4

right?  You're never going to go from complaint to final 

5

judgment, which means that the speech will become 

6

arguably moot after the election, in which case you go 

7

to the capable of repetition yet evading review 

8

exception to mootness, which is essentially the same 

9

kind of prediction of future activity that's implicated 

10
11

here. 
 If you adopt the extraordinarily Draconian 

12

requirements that the Sixth Circuit imposed on credible 

13

threat, this means that you will literally never be able 

14

to challenge restrictions on election speech, right? 

15

Before the campaign it will be premature.  During the 

16

enforcement proceeding, Federal courts have to abstain 

17

under Younger.  And afterwards, it'll be deemed moot, 

18

and then no  no possibility of capable of repetition 

19

yet evading review.  So you have this  this regime 

20

which has existed for decades in Ohio, where they 

21

continue to impose very serious burdens on speakers on 

22

what we consider a facially unconstitutional law, yet it 

23

has consistently evaded judicial review precisely 

24

because of the short time frames of the election 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why did  why did you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

say it would be found capable  not capable of 

2

repetition?  It seems to me that you were quite right to 

3

say before that this is most capable of repetition. 

4

 MR. CARVIN: 

Oh, if you accept our view of 

5

credible threat, then  then you're  you're entirely 

6

right, we would  we would satisfy both the ripeness 

7

standard and the capable of repetition yet evading 

8

review standard.  What I was trying to point out was 

9

that if you adopt the what we consider absurdly high 

10

straitjacket that the Sixth Circuit imposed on speakers 

11

trying to bring preenforcement challenges in the First 

12

Amendment context, that will essentially guarantee that 

13

these things are never brought, because by the time the 

14

election is done then you will have a mootness argument 

15

and you won't be able to satisfy the capable of 

16

repetition yet evading review standard.  So you will 

17

you will have put us in this Catch 22 endless cycle of 

18

suppressing speech, deterring speech, chilling speech, 

19

but never being able to get to a court to adjudicate our 

20

First Amendment 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Your best cases you think 

22

are Steffel and Thompson and Babbitt?  Are there others 

23

that are more 

24
25

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, Babbitt is certainly the 

most on point because there the prohibition was, like

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

ours, was saying something untrue, something false.  And 

2

it's very important to note that the plaintiff in 

3

Babbitt neither specified what they were going to say in 

4

the future; it didn't specify what company it was going 

5

to bring this consumer publicity campaign against; and 

6

it expressly disavowed any intention to say anything 

7

false.  But nonetheless, the Court found that "a 

8

credible threat was certainly impending," was the phrase 

9

they used. 

10

 And I also think the Court's recent decision 

11

in Holder is  is quite on point there.  There the 

12

plaintiffs didn't say that they were subject to the 

13

statute.  They adamantly denied that the statute even 

14

read  reached them.  They weren't bringing a facial 

15

challenge as we are.  They were bringing an asapplied 

16

challenge to the statute and there had never been a 

17

prior threat by any expert agency that their activities 

18

were going to be monitored. 

19

 I think American Booksellers is an excellent 

20

case as well, Justice Kennedy.  There there had been no 

21

argument  there had been no prior threat of 

22

enforcement.  The State absolutely denied 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So please  please 

24

define for me the rule you'd like us to announce? 

25

What's a credible threat?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

 MR. CARVIN: 

The narrowest rule, and the 

2

only rule we need to survive, is that if the enforcement 

3

agency has previously announced that your speech 

4

probably violates the law at issue, then you have a 

5

credible threat of future enforcement if you repeat that 

6

speech.  I think 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do we need them to say 

8

they are going to, even though the person who they said 

9

it against is not running again? 

10

 MR. CARVIN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12
13

Oh.  Well, two points on that. 
And how do you deal with 

Golden, in other words? 
 MR. CARVIN: 

Oh, yeah.  Well, Golden was 

14

very simple.  All the speaker there was concerned about 

15

was that one representative.  We are not concerned about 

16

Representative Driehaus as such.  We're concerned about 

17

people who supported the ACA's taxpayerfunded abortion, 

18

which is a politically salient issue to this day.  We 

19

mentioned Representative Kaptur as well as 

20

Representative Driehaus in one of the false statements 

21

that's already been brought in front of the commission. 

22

And in 2010, Sherrod Brown was on the ballot for the 

23

Senate and he also was an ACA supporter. 

24
25

 So our complaint was not candidate specific. 
It didn't turn on any personal attribute of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

Representative Driehaus.  It turned on people who were 

2

supporting the ACA because of its taxpayer funding 

3

abortion provisions.  And that remained politically 

4

salient and candidates who had engaged in precisely the 

5

same act as Representative Driehaus were on the ballot 

6

again in  in 2012.  So that  that is our basic 

7

argument. 

8
9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So that you've been 

prosecuted before and that you are intending to do the 
identical speech against others. 
 MR. CARVIN: 

A preliminary finding and 

12

identical speech we think more than satisfies the 

13

credible threat thing for the reasons I was articulating 

14

to Justice Kennedy a few moments ago.  We think this far 

15

exceeds the showing that was required in Holder, 

16

Babbitt, American Booksellers, and a number of other 

17

cases as well. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Do you think this is a 

19

matter of standing or ripeness?  The Sixth Circuit said 

20

ripeness. 

21

 MR. CARVIN: 

In all candor, Justice 

22

Ginsburg, I can't figure out the difference between 

23

standing and ripeness in this context.  No question that 

24

we are being subject to something.  I think the question 

25

is whether or not the threat is sufficiently immediate.

Alderson Reporting Company

I think people tend to think about that as a ripeness 

2

issue, but I think all of the Court's teachings on 

3

standing and immediacy of injury from the standing cases 

4

apply equally here.  So I would view standing and 

5

ripeness in this context as essentially coextensive. 

6

And I think the Sixth Circuit was wrong for both 

7

reasons. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you want us to 

just forget about the disclaimer issue and the 

10

commission procedure issue or even the asapplied issue? 

11

I got the sense from particularly footnote 7 in your 

12

reply brief that you're happy to just have those taken 

13

off the board. 

14

 MR. CARVIN: 

Well, can we take them one at a 

15

time?  The disclaimer issue, Ohio agreed with us.  So I 

16

think they took that off the table. 

17

 The procedure issue is inextricably 

18

intertwined with our Alvarez argument, that being 

19

subject to a process where the  the State is 

20

determining the truth of our speech, we weren't saying 

21

the procedures in the abstract were problematical. 

22

 In terms of the asapplied challenge, we do 

23

disagree with the Solicitor General.  We think that's 

24

certainly fit for review just as the asapplied 

25

challenge was in Holder and in American Booksellers and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

20
1

in Babbitt.  I do in candor, and I think this is what 

2

the footnote the Chief Justice was referring to goes to 

3

 as a practical matter, we don't care.  Frankly, the 

4

asapplied challenge was basically saying, look, even 

5

if  even if the law is constitutional as applied to 

6

basic assertions of fact, it's not constitutional as 

7

applied to opinions. 

8
9

 We think Alvarez has essentially eliminated 
that distinction because the speech at issue in Alvarez 

10

was a pure assertion of fact.  Frankly, the district 

11

court that we're going to go back to if we prevail here 

12

has already ruled that our interpretation of the ACA was 

13

an assertion of fact.  So as a practical matter, it has 

14

no consequence.  We're going to go back, make a facial 

15

challenge that (B)(9) and (B)(10) are facially 

16

unconstitutional under Alvarez.  There's no  we're not 

17

asking for any savings, constructions or  or limited 

18

application.  So it will be a pure question of law that 

19

is fit for immediate review.  And as I say, we need 

20

if we do prevail here on justiciability, we need to get 

21

relief right away because we have yet another election 

22

cycle approaching. 

23

 Unless there are further questions, I'll 
reserve the remainder of my time.  Thank you.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN 

3

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

4
5
6

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PARTIAL REVERSAL 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 

7

 I'd like to begin, if I could, by addressing 

8

Justice Kagan's question, which Justice Sotomayor then 

9

followed up on.  We think that the probable cause 

10

finding and the fact that they want to repeat 

11

essentially the speech that was made earlier are the two 

12

critical factors in this case and without that, none of 

13

their claims would be justiciable.  As it is, we think 

14

that their purely legal First Amendment challenges are 

15

ripe for those particular casespecific reasons. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you  you 

17

insist that they  there has actually been a probable 

18

cause finding that their speech would violate the law 

19

before they would have standing? 

20

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Not necessarily that their 

21

particular speech would violate the law, but that there 

22

have been  without the probable cause finding, it 

23

would simply be speculative whether particular speech 

24

would actually result in any sort of enforcement 

25

proceeding.

Alderson Reporting Company

 One critical aspect of this case 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Even in a case like 

3

this, where the procedures can be triggered by any 

4

citizen in the State? 

5

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, again, we 

6

don't think that someone can come into court and say, I 

7

want to make some speech, I don't think that speech 

8

would be violating the statute, I don't have any good 

9

evidence that anyone else thinks my speech would violate 

10

the statute or that some sort of enforcement action 

11

would be brought against me, but nevertheless, I want to 

12

get into court 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is that a realistic 

14

proposition?  I mean, first of all, in the first place, 

15

surely you don't expect them to come in and say, I'm 

16

going to say something totally false and I'm afraid I 

17

might be prosecuted for that.  But then you have to say 

18

they have  you would never imagine that somebody else 

19

might think in a hotly contested election that their 

20

speech is false? 

21

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, we may be 

22

simply debating how similar the previous speech that was 

23

a subject of a probable cause finding, or that there's 

24

some other reason to believe will be the subject of an 

25

enforcement proceeding has to be to the speech that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

plaintiffs allege that they intend to make.  But we 

2

definitely don't think that a plaintiff can simply come 

3

into court and say, look, I want to make this speech, I 

4

don't think it violates the law. 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, what would happen, 

6

Mr. Feigin, what would happen if a candidate knew  it 

7

seems actually quite plausible that Representative 

8

Driehaus would know  that this was something that 

9

Susan Anthony or some other like group would talk about 

10

in his campaign, and he were to write letters to all 

11

these groups saying, if you start advertising in this 

12

way, if you put up billboards, I'm going to take you 

13

before the Ohio Commission.  Would that be sufficient? 

14

 MR. FEIGIN: 

That would at least be 

15

sufficient, Your Honor, to bring a suit against 

16

Driehaus.  That would be kind of similar to the 

17

situation in MedImmune v. Genentech, which was a civil 

18

suit that the putative defendant had standing to bring a 

19

declaratory judgment action to prevent 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm not sure I understood 

21

that.  Is it sufficient that somebody has said, I'm 

22

going to bring an action against  before the 

23

Commission, but there's been no prior Commission 

24

determination as to this speech.  And it's just somebody 

25

saying, I'm going to go to the Commission and raise this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

with them if you start speaking in this way.  Would that 

2

present a credible threat? 

3

 MR. FEIGIN: 

That specific threat would be 

4

enough to allow for a lawsuit.  And, Your Honor, I think 

5

there'd be a significant question whether the suit could 

6

only be brought against Driehaus, who brought the 

7

threat, or whether you could also join in the 

8

Commission.  But as a practical matter, that wouldn't 

9

really make much difference because if constitutional 

10

claims were raised in that proceeding, the district 

11

court would be obligated to inform the State of Ohio and 

12

the State of Ohio would be entitled to intervene in the 

13

litigation. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Now, take it just a step 

15

further.  Surely, there are some kinds of statements or 

16

 I don't know.  Maybe "surely" is the wrong word.  Are 

17

there some kinds of statements where, even though the 

18

the representative doesn't say, I'm going to do this, 

19

you know that somebody is going to do this, whether the 

20

representative or somebody else?  It's the kind of 

21

statement that, given this process, it's just going to 

22

require too much fortitude to resist the temptation to 

23

bring this in front of this Commission. 

24
25

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Well, Your Honor, I think in 

the absence of good evidence of an enforcement

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

proceeding, it would simply be too speculative.  But I 

2

would add that in this particular case, the credible 

3

threat of enforcement test might be relaxed to a certain 

4

extent, because this is a private attorney general 

5

statute.  And the entire point of private attorney 

6

general statutes is to allow for enforcement in a wider 

7

range of circumstances than would be possible under most 

8

Federal laws, for example, which are enforced solely by 

9

the executive.  That might be a reason, a casespecific 

10

reason why your hypothetical might have more salience 

11

here than it would in the Federal context. 

12

 Another difference between this and the 

13

Federal context is we don't have any potential statutory 

14

barriers to bringing this action.  Congress hasn't 

15

decided to provide a cause of action only for a  for, 

16

for example, final agency action, as it did in the 

17

Administrative Procedure Act, and it's not attempting to 

18

channel these claims through a particular agency. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Are you arguing that the 

20

other organization, COAST, also has standing?  Because 

21

you  you seem to require for the credible threat for 

22

there to have been a proceeding before the Commission 

23

and there's been nothing with regard to the other 

24

organization. 

25

 MR. FEIGIN: 

Your Honor, we don't think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

the proceeding before the Commission has to involve the 

2

entity that wants to make the speech in the future. 

3

It's enough that it involves speech similar to the 

4

speech that the plaintiff is alleging that the plaintiff 

5

intends to make. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So how do you distinguish 

7

the three in Younger v. Harris that the Court said 

8

didn't have standing? 

9

 MR. FEIGIN: 

I think in the same way the 

10

Petitioners do, Your Honor, and I think that's how we 

11

reconcile the case with Steffel, where one of the 

12

factors the Court looked to, to find a credible threat 

13

of enforcement in that case was the actual prosecution 

14

of the plaintiff's handbilling companion. 

15

 One thing I would emphasize about this case 

16

is that in this particular context, this unique Ohio 

17

scheme, the administrative proceedings before the Ohio 

18

Elections Commission are the relevant enforcement 

19

proceedings.  It wouldn't normally be the case that 

20

administrative proceedings that can result only in 

21

government speech would be considered enforcement 

22

proceedings for that purpose.  But in this particular 

23

circumstance, not only can the Ohio Elections Commission 

24

recommend a case for further prosecution, but a decision 

25

by the Ohio Elections Commission is a decision by a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

neutral decision maker following a fulldress adversary 

2

proceeding that someone has violated Ohio criminal law 

3

by knowingly misinforming the electorate in the context 

4

of a political campaign. 

5

 In that particular context, and particularly 

6

as to entities like Petitioners that engage in political 

7

advocacy on a regular basis, that kind of finding is a 

8

significant sanction.  And, in fact, the State itself 

9

views it that way in two relevant ways.  First of all, 

10

such a finding by the Commission is treated as an 

11

adverse effect for purposes of the statute that allows 

12

for judicial review.  And second of all, if you look at 

13

actual orders by the Ohio Elections Commission, they 

14

sometimes refer to the finding of a violation in 

15

particular cases as a penalty. 

16

 Before my time is up, I would like to 

17

address a few things Petitioner said about the 

18

justiciability, for example, of asapplied challenges 

19

under this Court's decision in Holder.  I think it's 

20

very significant that in Holder, the Court noted that 

21

there were  Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project  the 

22

Court noted that there had been 150 prosecutions brought 

23

under the statute that the plaintiffs in that case were 

24

challenging and that many of them had involved the same 

25

provision.  And we think that's a circumstance in which

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

there would be a credible threat of prosecution because 

2

the plaintiffs had showed a pattern or practice of 

3

prosecution of similar conduct. 

4
5
6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

How many proceedings 

have been brought under this Ohio statute? 
 MR. FEIGIN: 

So under the Ohio statute 

7

between 2001 and 2010, according to the statistics in 

8

the green brief by the Ohio Attorney General, it's a 

9

little bit over 500.  And that's just for violations of 

10

this FalseStatement Law or asserted violations of this 

11

FalseStatement Law. 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Any  any breakdown of 

13

whether those were brought by candidates or just 

14

interested citizens? 

15

 MR. FEIGIN: 

The  we don't have statistics 

16

on that, Your Honor.  The brief doesn't break it down. 

17

 If the Court has no further questions, we'd 

18

ask the Court to partially reverse and allow only the 

19

purely legal ripe, legal challenge to these laws to 

20

proceed.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

22

 Mr. Murphy? 

23

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC E. MURPHY 

24

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 

25

 MR. MURPHY: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1
2

please the Court: 
 The Court should affirm the Sixth Circuit's 

3

judgment in this case because Petitioners have not 

4

established a credible threat of criminal prosecution 

5

and any other injury, to the extent it is adequately 

6

alleged, is not certainly impending.  And I'd like to 

7

begin with the prior probable cause finding. 

8
9

 Petitioners repeatedly characterized the 
prior probable cause finding as a finding by the prior 

10

panel that the  the speech at issue there was probably 

11

criminal.  That's not what the finding indicated.  It's 

12

a very, very low standard.  It's not a standard that 

13

it's  it's well below a preponderance of the evidence, 

14

so "probably criminal" is way too high.  It's just 

15

it's analogous in the civil context to  to a malicious 

16

prosecution case; one of the elements is to establish 

17

that a prior case lacked probable cause. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20
21

Are you ready 
But you have to admit 

that 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Are you prepared to 

22

represent to us that if they do the exact same thing the 

23

next election that they did in the last one, that you 

24

will not take action against them? 

25

 MR. MURPHY: 

No, I'm not  I have not  I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

do not have authority to disavow.  But their  their 

2

argument that you need to disavow is inconsistent with 

3

some of the Court's cases suggesting that the threat 

4

implied by the existence of a law itself is not 

5

sufficient.  And so they  they fall back on this 

6

probable cause finding as suggesting that it creates the 

7

objective evidence necessary.  But because  because 

8

the probable cause finding is so low and because there 

9

are so many steps between the probable cause finding and 

10
11

the potential criminal prosecution 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, but the criminal 

12

prosecution isn't all that they're complaining about. 

13

They're complaining about having  having to be dragged 

14

through this same  this same proceeding next time in 

15

the midst of an election campaign, and however minimal 

16

the finding that is ultimately made may be, they are 

17

going to be subject, for sure, to that proceeding in the 

18

next election campaign. 

19

 And I don't care if all the commission says 

20

is, you know, there is some reason to believe that they 

21

were lying.  Even if it's that minimal, you are forcing 

22

them, and it is pretty sure that it's going to happen 

23

because somebody will complain, the candidate they are 

24

criticizing, you are forcing them to go through this 

25

procedure in the midst of an election campaign, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, with respect, Your Honor, 

2

I think there is a couple of answers.  First off, I 

3

think it's speculative.  If you look at the complaints, 

4

the SBA List complaint simply says they would like to 

5

engage in substantially similar activity in the future. 

6

Now, you have to keep in mind what that activity was. 

7

They weren't challenging anybody who voted for the 

8

Affordable Care Act.  They were challenging specific 

9

congressmen.  At JA113, it says certain congressmen. 

10

That's in their complaint. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

Their organization is not 

an antiDriehaus  is that his name, "Driehaus"? 

13

 MR. MURPHY: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
That's not what they are 

15

about.  They are about opposition to the abortion 

16

funding portion of the Affordable Care Act and they're 

17

going to make the same, the same contentions against 

18

anybody else who runs for office who has voted for that 

19

Act, whether it's Driehaus or anybody else. 

20

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, with respect, the people 

21

that they targeted in 2010 were only prolife Democrats 

22

who originally voted against the Act and then changed 

23

their vote in response to the executive order.  This is 

24

at JA52 when they announced their Votes 

25

Have Consequences Bus Tour.  It wasn't against everybody

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

32
1

who voted for the Act. 

2

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But your very argument, 

3

Mr. Murphy, to the effect that, well, probable cause is 

4

a very low standard, seems to me to work against you. 

5

It means that more complaints are more likely. 

6

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, it depends on what you 

7

are talking about the relevant injury is.  If the 

8

relevant injury is a criminal prosecution, I think it 

9

very much shows that a prosecution is entirely unlikely. 

10

And if your relevant injury is some of these preliminary 

11

injuries that they're asserting, I do think that the 

12

credible threat test is probably not even the test 

13

because, as the Court said in Clapper, injuries in that 

14

context had to be certainly impending. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but this is a point 

16

brought up by Justice Scalia's question as well.  Don't 

17

you think there's a serious First Amendment concern with 

18

a state law that requires you to come before a 

19

commission to justify what you are going to say and 

20

which gives the commission discovery power to find out 

21

who's involved in your association, what research you've 

22

made, et cetera? 

23

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, remember that the issue 

24

here is standing, so setting aside the  the First 

25

Amendment concern should have no impact into whether an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

 Article III case or controversy exists.  They would 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

3

 MR. MURPHY: 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why?  Why? 
Because 
Why can't a person say, you 

5

 know, there are things I want to say politically, and 

6

 the Constitution says that the State does not have the 

7

 right to abridge my speech, and I intend to say them. 

8

 And if I say them, there's a serious risk that I will be 

9

 had up before a commission and could be fined.  What's 

10

 the harm?  I can't speak.  That's the harm.  Right?  So 

11

 why isn't that end of the matter? 

12

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, the Court  the Court 

13

 the Court  has repeatedly said that chilling effect by 

14

 itself is not the harm.  The relevant harm in your hypo 

15

 would be 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why shouldn't it be the 

17

 harm?  That is, whatever  has any case said when 

18

 somebody says, we're going to take an extreme, you want to speak in a 

19

campaign, and we 

20

 have a law here that if you do we will throw you in jail 

21

 and you really do want to speak and the law really does 

22

 prevent you from speaking, why shouldn't that be the end 

23

 of it? 

24
25
26

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, remember the test has to 

 be a credible threat of prosecution.  What the Court 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I'm saying is there a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

 statute  not a statute.  Is there a case which says 

2

 the little syllogism I just went through is not the law 

3

 of the United States?  Now, there may be.  That's why I 

4

 asked the question. 

5

 MR. MURPHY: 

So I think the closest case 

6

 would be Golden, for instance, where the Court clearly 

7

 indicated, and I quote, "The constitutional question, 

8

 First Amendment or otherwise, must arise in the context 

9

 of a specific live grievance." 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But that was a very 

11

 special situation.  In Golden they were going out after 

12

 a particular candidate.  It was not  it was not a 

13

 political view that an organization is taking, and they 

14

 are not targeting this particular candidate, but they 

15

 are targeting that issue, any candidate who supports 

16

 that issue. 

17

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, with respect, Your Honor, 

18

 in Golden the plaintiff clearly indicated that he was 

19

 targeting that congressman because of the congressman's 

20

 votes on  for a particular care package. 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But didn't the Court say 

22

 that there wasn't  once that congressman wasn't going 

23

 to run for office any more, there was no suggestion that 

24

 they wanted to talk about somebody else. 

25

 MR. MURPHY: 

So he did have suggestions that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

 he wanted to engage in substantially similar leafletting 

2

 in the future, and the Court found them too speculative 

3

 because he had only identified that one congressman. 

4

 And so I think that's significant because I think by 

5

 analogy that would suggest that the only single 

6

 forwardlooking allegations in SBA List's complaint at 

7

 JA122 are that it plans to engage in substantially 

8

 similar activity in the future, but they don't identify 

9

 any other candidates, just like they didn't identify any 

10

 other candidates in Golden, just like they didn't 

11

 identify any candidates in the Renne decision, which was 

12

 part of the reason why the Court found the decision 

13

 that case right there. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Murphy, you said 

15

 there was no credible threat of prosecution, but what 

16

 about the harm that is occurring?  Mr. Carvin said it's 

17

 a very short time.  They're brought before the 

18

 commission, they have to answer this charge that they 

19

 lied, that they made a false statement.  And that just 

20

 that alone is going to diminish the effect of their 

21

 speech because they have been labeled false speakers, 

22

 and it costs money to defend before the commission, 

23

 right?  That's not 

24

 MR. MURPHY: 

25

Well, keep in mind that the 

 reputational harm they have essentially asserted for the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

 first time in this Court.  They didn't assert any type 

2

 of reputational injuries in the Sixth Circuit.  And I 

3

 think it would be entirely speculative to suggest that 

4

 those would exist here with respect to these 

5

 organizations. 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I'm not sure it's a 

7

 reputational harm.  I mean, why isn't, as Justice 

8

 Ginsburg suggested, the relevant harm the probable cause 

9

 determination itself?  There are voters out there and 

10

 they don't know that probable cause is such a low bar as 

11

 you describe it.  They think probable cause means you 

12

 probably lied, and that seems a reasonable thing for 

13

 them to think and that's a relevant harm and we 

14

 should just  you know, we don't even need the 

15

 prosecution to serve as the relevant harm.  That seems 

16

 quite enough. 

17

 MR. MURPHY: 

They  they did not rely on 

18

 any type of that type of harm below and I think  a 

19

 harm flowing from the misrepresentation of what the 

20

 probable cause finding means  I would think you would 

21

 have to allege more than they have here with respect 

22

 to  that it would exist in this case. 

23

 There was no  they hadn't  there was no 

24

 misrepresentations by SBA List, for instance, that this 

25

 probable cause finding meant that they probably lied.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

 They told their supporters  it's in the joint appendix 

2

 at 74 and 75  that all it meant was that you go 

3

 that they found that you have to go before the full 

4

 commission.  They didn't say to their supporters that 

5

 you probably lied. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I guess it was in 

7

 the case of COAST; the problem is other people are going 

8

 to be intimidated from helping them engage in their 

9

 political speech.  What was it, a billboard?  The 

10

 billboard company said 

11

 MR. MURPHY: 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No more advertising. 
 I'm not going to 

13

 let you put your sign up on my billboard, I might be 

14

 liable.  So, I mean, they may have a certain fortitude 

15

 and proceeding based on all the reasons that you've 

16

 given, but they need third parties to help carry out 

17

 their message and there is no reason to think those 

18

 third parties have any commitment to their political 

19

 message at all and the slightest whiff of, oh, this is 

20

 going to be legal trouble, they say, forget about it. 

21

 MR. MURPHY: 

I guess two responses.  Keep in 

22

 mind that at JA27 in the letter to Lamar, Driehaus 

23

 indicated essentially that we reserve the right to 

24

 proceed against you in the commission or in a court of 

25

 law, indicating that he was already contemplating a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

 defamation action.  So if this statute  talking about 

2

 the redressability prong of standing or the directness 

3

 test with respect to ripeness, he could have said the 

4

 exact same thing and it would have chilled them Lamar 

5

 from 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, no, but a 

7

 defamation action, people sue everybody all the time. 

8

 No one's going to take that seriously.  In fact, it's 

9

 probably going to redound to the benefit of SBA and 

10

 COAST to say the congressman is, you know, bringing a 

11

 defamation action.  It highlights it, but it's another 

12

 thing to have the State involved making a determination 

13

 that there's probable cause that you lied. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The mere fact that a 

15

 private individual can chill somebody's speech does not 

16

 say, well, since a private individual can do it, you 

17

 know, the ministry of truth can do it.  That's not 

18

 that's not the law. 

19

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, the law  so that's the 

20

 First Amendment question, it seems to me.  On the 

21

 standing question, it's whether this harm would have 

22

 come up  can't come about absent this law, and the 

23

 fact that he notified the company that they might be 

24

 thinking about a defamation action suggests that it's 

25

 entirely speculative that it would have come about

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1
2

 absent this law. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

There's a curious 

3

 inversion here.  Usually we're concerned about citizen 

4

 suits, too many people can challenge  challenge the 

5

 law.  Here we're concerned that many, many citizens can 

6

 bring the challenge against the candidate.  So it's 

7

 somewhat reversed.  In other words, you have tens of 

8

 thousands of private attorney generals waiting to pounce 

9

 and get these people before the commission and have to 

10
11

 follow discovery orders. 
 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, I mean, that's true.  But 

12

 keep in  keep in mind that there  when you  when 

13

 you think about the fundamental Article III purposes 

14

 here, separation of powers and federalism purposes, it 

15

 seems to me that a finding in  in this case that they 

16

 have standing would undermine those.  With respect to 

17

 separation of powers, the Court has repeatedly said that 

18

 courts are not  in our constitutional system are not 

19

 roving commissions designed  assigned to pass judgment 

20

 on the validity of the nation of laws, and 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you know of the 500 

22

 cases that you mentioned earlier, how many actually 

23

 ended up in full prosecutions? 

24
25

 MR. MURPHY: 

So there's  since 1996, when 

 the statute was amended to allow for this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

 preenforcement process, there have been five referrals, 

2

 and then of those five referrals, three plea agreements. 

3

 So there's only been three 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

5

 MR. MURPHY: 

Three what?  I'm sorry. 
Three plea agreements at the 

6

 end of  so there was five referrals from the 

7

 Commission to the relevant prosecutor, and then  and 

8

 of those five cases, three charges were brought and plea 

9

 agreements were essentially entered immediately. 

10

 So that  that just also goes to show that 

11

 the credible threat of any criminal prosecution is very 

12

 unlikely. 

13
14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, how many of 

 those do you know were mooted out by the election? 

15

 MR. MURPHY: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well 
In other words, the 

17

 proceedings are going on and people's speech is being 

18

 chilled and it's back and forth, then the election is 

19

 over, and people say, oh, forget about it. 

20
21
22

 MR. MURPHY: 

How many of the overall number 

 of 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

500.  You gave us 

23

 some answers about how many of the 500 resulted in 

24

 criminal prosecutions.  And all I want to know is how 

25

 many of the 500 proceedings were mooted out by the fact

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1
2

 that the election took place. 
 MR. MURPHY: 

So I  so roughly 40 

3

 percent  60 percent, there's a finding of no probable 

4

 cause.  That leaves 40 percent.  And of those, I  you 

5

 know, Your Honor, I don't know the statistics on the 

6

 number of dismissals.  I would say that there are 

7

 substantial number of 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What would you say as a 

 lawyer  you're now a lawyer for the Commission.  You 

10

 understand it better than I.  I'm just making up an 

11

 example.  Do you think they'd prosecute this or not? 

12

 Somebody walks in front of the House of a political 

13

 opponent has a big sign that says murderer.  Now when 

14

 asked, you said but he voted for legislation that led 

15

 to the death of many cats.  Would they prosecute that or 

16

 not? 

17

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, I think, Your Honor, it 

18

 might fall within  it  it depends on the scope of 

19

 the statute 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I just want to know your 

21

 opinion as the lawyer for the Commission, do you think 

22

 that's going to be prosecuted or not? 

23
24
25

 MR. MURPHY: 

I think the  I would say 

 probably not, but  but that's just my 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Probably not.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

 MR. MURPHY: 

 personal opinion.  Because 

2

 they would say that you  you would adopt the rule from 

3

 the defamation context, that if  if it can be 

4

 interpreted under  either as a hyperbole or either as 

5

 a reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statement or 

6

 were the  but if  if there's any interpretation of 

7

 the statement that is ambiguous, where it's true, it 

8

 would fall within the defamation rule that it can't be 

9

 considered false within the meaning of the statute.  So 

10

 the murder hypo, if it's actually he is a murderer of 

11

 cats, it might  it might mean that it's misleading. 

12

 But by 

13
14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But why did they prosecute 

 this here? 

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yeah.  Why wasn't that 
I mean, we've heard in 

17

 other cases, you know, just recently, a very major case, 

18

 where people really believed about the same thing and 

19

 they were sincere in their beliefs.  So why 

20

 MR. MURPHY: 

The commissioner has now fully 

21

 conceded that it would be a difficult proposition in 

22

 this case, certainly.  But I  I think it's the very 

23

 nature of the probable cause finding that is 

24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why don't the 

 statistics that you provided us portray a system that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

 really limits core First Amendment speech without 

2

 providing much of an opportunity for a judicial review 

3

 if you're correct about  about Article III here 

4

 where  you have a system where thousands of complaints 

5

 are filed, and yet in the end, there's very few 

6

 prosecutions.  And you say, well, the filing of the 

7

 complaint isn't enough and the probable cause 

8

 determination isn't enough.  So you have this system that 

9

 goes on and on, year after year, where arguably there's 

10

 a great chilling of  of core First Amendment speech, 

11

 and yet you're saying that basically you can't get into 

12

 Federal court. 

13

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, we're not saying that, 

14

 Your Honor.  I think we're just saying you can't get 

15

 into Federal court in this case.  And I do think that 

16

 this  those chilling effect concerns should not play a 

17

 role in the Article III cases or controversy 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but how would you 

19

 get into Federal court?  I mean, your own office 

20

 expresses grave concern about the constitutionality of 

21

 this statute.  So that suggests somebody should be able 

22

 to get into Federal court to do this.  But I don't see a 

23

 way where you would allow a preenforcement challenge. 

24

 One would have to go through the entire process and get 

25

 to the end of it and get a judgment to enable a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1
2

 challenge under your theory; is that right? 
 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, I think under our theory, 

3

 it really depends.  There's two types of cases that are 

4

 brought.  One is a case like Babbitt, where they're 

5

 saying the law is ambiguous, it could mean A or it 

6

 could  it could mean B.  If it means A, my speech is 

7

 covered within it.  There, all you essentially have to 

8

 do is allege you want to engage in the speech that would 

9

 fall within the rule.  But that's not what they're doing 

10

 here.  They're saying their speech falls completely 

11

 outside this law, this unambiguous law, the distinctions 

12

 between false and true, but we're going to get 

13

 prosecuted anyways.  And in that context, I think you do 

14

 have to allege what the government suggested is more 

15

 objective evidence that you're going to be prosecuted 

16

 outside 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I had a reason for asking 

18

 what sounds like a silly hypothetical, but a possible 

19

 one.  We understand how people take different views on 

20

 that.  And then you have a hard time, it seems to me, 

21

 distinguishing this case from that one in terms of their 

22

 exercising their authority.  And so at least it must 

23

 raise a question, a First Amendment question on the 

24

 merits.  It seems pretty serious.  So if you lose on 

25

 this procedural matter, how quickly can you get this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

45
1

 decided?  I mean, there are elections coming up.  People 

2

 would like to know.  They want to know what they're 

3

 supposed to say.  And how long is all this procedural 

4

 skirmishing going to take, which in and of itself is an 

5

 obstacle to what they might say in the next election? 

6
7
8
9

 MR. MURPHY: 

So procedural skirmishing, 

 you're talking about within 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, you're saying, 

 well, they don't have standing  you know, I was 

10

 interested in this field, administrative law, and even 

11

 my class, despite the scintillation, would sometimes go 

12

 to sleep when I got to such questions. 

13

 (Laughter.) 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So  so I'm saying that 

15

 these seem to be preliminary questions on a matter in 

16

 respect to which there seems serious doubt.  I'll repeat 

17

 myself.  The elections are coming up.  And people have 

18

 to know what they're supposed to say and what they can 

19

 say and what they can't.  So how do we get this decided? 

20

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, it seems to me your 

21

 question is the  your question is suggesting that the 

22

 underlying law is  is  there's serious doubts about 

23

 the constitutionality of the underlying law. 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

 MR. MURPHY: 

It is suggesting that. I agree, it is suggesting that. 
And that provides  that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

 doesn't provide any basis.  The entire purposes of 

2

 Article III's case or controversy requirement is to 

3

 ensure that courts only decide constitutional questions 

4

 in concrete cases.  And to allow the merits to slip into 

5

 the Article III question fundamentally undermines 

6

 the separation of powers 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I would say one of 

8

 the purposes of standing is to allow people who are 

9

 really going to be hurt to be able to be heard in 

10

 court.  Well, of course, if they're not going to be 

11

 hurt, there's no reason.  And what the merits 

12

 discussion is designed to suggest is that there are real 

13

 people who would really like to speak in an election 

14

 campaign.  And if they feel they can't, they are really 

15

 being hurt.  That's what the other side is arguing.  And 

16

 I've listened to the argument.  I'm curious as to the 

17

 practicalities.  If they're right, when is this going to 

18

 be heard and decided in your opinion? 

19
20

 MR. MURPHY: 

 there's a remand in the district court, or 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

 MR. MURPHY: 

23
24
25

So the  are you talking if 

You tell me how to do it. 
Well, I think that case should 

 be dismissed, obviously. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm saying if you were to 

 lose on the 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

 MR. MURPHY: 

Okay.  If I was to lose?  Oh, 

2

 you could  frankly, if you remanded finding a concrete 

3

 case here, you could instruct the district court to 

4

 certify to the Ohio Supreme Court, for instance, which 

5

 could give an immediate authoritative interpretation of 

6

 the law and it could  it could include all the 

7

 relevant narrowing constructions that this Court has 

8

 adopted 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

10

 speed things up. 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that will 

You don't even 

13

 want  you don't even want the district court to decide 

14

 it.  You want to go through a certification process that 

15

 will bring in a whole another court system. 

16

 MR. MURPHY: 

But it has to decide the scope 

17

 of a law.  As the United States v. Williams said, to 

18

 determine the constitutionality of the law, you need to 

19

 know its scope.  And  and the entire suggestion here 

20

 that their speech is covered suggests that the scope 

21

 or the scope of the law is much broader than the Ohio 

22

 Supreme Court could interpret it to be. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, what  what narrowing 

 construction would be consistent with Alvarez? 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, what?  I can't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

 understand what that would be.  It has to be really 

2

 false.  Is that it? 

3

 (Laughter.) 

4

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, I think  I think  I 

5

 think Alvarez is completely distinguishable as being 

6

 about false statements in the abstract.  This Court 

7

 already held in McIntyre that the State has a compelling 

8

 interest in policing fraud and libelous statements 

9

 in the election context because of the risk to the 

10
11

 public from those statements.  And Mark Twain 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Alvarez wasn't about 

12

 false statements in the abstract.  It was a criminal 

13

 prosecution for making particular false statements.  And 

14

 they were as hard factual statements as you will ever 

15

 find.  Did somebody receive the Congressional Medal of 

16

 Honor or not? 

17

 MR. MURPHY: 

No, I agree with that.  There 

18

 was a false statement of a verifiable  verifiable 

19

 fact, but it was a false statement anywhere, anytime; 

20

 even like at home, if you make the statement, it could 

21

 be covered.  What we're saying here is that false 

22

 statements in the election context, the State has a much 

23

 more compelling interest in that context because, as 

24

 the Court said in McIntyre, the  the false statements 

25

 can have an impact on the election.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

 Of course, there's false positives if the 

2

 commission gets it wrong.  But think about the false 

3

 false negatives that slip through when somebody is 

4

 making a false statement, and that actually impacts a 

5

 campaign, leading to somebody voting for somebody else. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But how are you going to 

7

 prove  how are you ever going to prove that one false 

8

 statement cost somebody an election? 

9
10

 MR. MURPHY: 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What's that? 
How are you ever going 

11

 to prove that one false statement cost somebody an 

12

 election? 

13

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, I don't think we  I 

14

 don't think we have to prove that to get a conviction in 

15

 any case.  I think we just prove that their false 

16

 statements can have impacts on elections, and that shows 

17

 the interest in this case, as compared to the interest 

18

 in Alvarez, in which the false statements could be made 

19

 at any time, under any circumstances.  It wasn't  it 

20

 wasn't narrowly tailored to the election context. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Do you think that the 

22

 allegedly false statement here was a false statement of 

23

 fact? 

24
25

 MR. MURPHY: 

I think there's a good argument 

 that it was not, that there was a false statement of 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

 that there's reasonable interpretations of this 

2

 ambiguous Affordable Care Act, and if so 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There's a good argument on 

4

 the other side.  But it's an argument over a fact, isn't 

5

 it, whether this person was responsible for the 

6

 Affordable Care Act.  I mean that was the charge, you 

7

 know, that this person made the decisive vote, right, in 

8

 the 

9

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, that's a different case. 

10

 This charge was he voted for taxpayerfunded abortion, 

11

 was the  was the charge.  And so it's whether this 

12

 Act 

13
14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But by voting  by voting 

 for that Act. 

15

 MR. MURPHY: 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

 MR. MURPHY: 

For the Act, yes. 
Yes. 
So it's whether the Act covers 

18

 taxpayerfunded abortion, and that's a complex question 

19

 that if the court were to  if the Ohio Supreme Court, 

20

 through certification, were to adopt the Bose standard, 

21

 it would suggest that it might not be covered because 

22

 the Bose standard suggests that speech about an 

23

 ambiguous topic cannot be false under the actual malice 

24

 standard.  So this whole  this whole speech could be, 

25

 through certification, eliminated and the statute

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

 narrowed to cover only false statements of verifiable 

2

 fact. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And then all you have to do 

 is litigate it.  That's all. 

5

 (Laughter.) 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You  you make the 

7

 statement, and then, you know, you can litigate it on 

8

 the basis of whatever the Ohio Supreme Court says. 

9

 Right? 

10

 MR. MURPHY: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well 
I mean, let's litigate 

12

 whether it's factually inaccurate or legally inaccurate, 

13

 right?  It's a lawsuit. 

14

 MR. MURPHY: 

So we're talking about the 

15

 scope of the law, correct? 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, we are.  But I mean, 

17

 we're talking about whether this law imposes limitations 

18

 upon the freedom of speech.  And if you say whenever you 

19

 do it, you are going to have a lawsuit, you're going to 

20

 be hauled before this commission.  You may have a good 

21

 case, you may not have a good case, but you have to 

22

 justify yourself to this commission before you can 

23

 before you can make the assertion. 

24
25

 MR. MURPHY: 

Well, that's not true.  That 

 doesn't happen in every case.  It makes  you're making

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

52
1

 it sound like the commission hears every political 

2

 statement out there.  But it has to be filed by a 

3

 person, and only one person filed a complaint against 

4

 the SBA this last time, and he is in Africa now.  So I 

5

 don't think he'll be filing complaints any time soon. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

7

 (Laughter.) 

8

 MR. MURPHY: 

9

He really lost, didn't he? 

I see my time is up.  Could I 

 just ask the 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

11

 Mr. Carvin, you have 5 minutes. 

12
13
14

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. CARVIN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. CARVIN: 

A few brief points.  I think 

15

 the key point to take away from the colloquy with 

16

 Mr. Murphy is that when he was asked, How do you bring a 

17

 preenforcement challenge, his only solution was to 

18

 admit you're lying before you speak.  Well, obviously 

19

 that completely defeats the value of your speech.  No 

20

 speaker is ever going to do it.  You're not going to 

21

 confess to a crime before you speak.  And I would point 

22

 out in Babbitt they didn't say they were going to lie. 

23

 They said just the opposite, and they nonetheless had 

24

 standing. 

25

 On the certification point, further delay in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the Ohio Supreme Court for a limiting construction that 

2

 we don't want, that can't possibly do it.  After 

3

 Alvarez, this fact/opinion distinction is of no legal 

4

 relevance.  We don't want a limiting construction.  We 

5

 want to say that anything, fact or opinion, is 

6

 unconstitutional to limit under the false statement law. 

7

 I point out that we did litigate in front of 

8

 this very same district court judge the fact/opinion 

9

 issue in the libel case, where it does have some 

10

 resonance, and he's already found that our assertion was 

11

 factual.  So we don't want to go on that tangent. 

12

 If the Court would just look at them, 

13

 Browskins and Citizens United, those cases articulate as 

14

 well as any can, when you are making a facial challenge 

15

 to a First Amendment, the last thing you want to do is 

16

 abstain to State court judges because you actually 

17

 exacerbate the constitutional injury through the delay 

18

 and the fact that you've got to go through declaratory 

19

 judgments, when our entire point is it's 

20

 unconstitutional for us to say, "Mother, may I?" before 

21

 we speak. 

22

 As to Mr. Murphy's attempt to downplay the 

23

 probable cause finding, on 7A attached to their brief 

24

 they have what the probable cause finding is.  And it 

25

 says that there is probable cause to believe that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

 there's been a violation of the law alleged and that the 

2

 complaint has occurred. 

3

 Under this Court's probable cause 

4

 determination, that means reasonable people would 

5

 believe that a violation has occurred, even though you 

6

 need to show it by clear and convincing evidence, and 

7

 even though my opponent claims that any reasonable 

8

 interpretation of this law is not false.  Well, that 

9

 means that they've already found that through clear and 

10

 convincing evidence we are advancing not only a false, 

11

 but an unreasonable interpretation of the ACA, which 

12

 simply, of course, exacerbates the credible threat. 

13

 And I think my final point will be, he 

14

 says  well, two things.  One is he says we didn't 

15

 allege with specificity the kind of speech that we were 

16

 going to say in the future.  We said we're going to 

17

 engage in the same or similar speech.  I don't think the 

18

 language, the English language, permits a more direct 

19

 and precise articulation of what we're going to say in 

20

 the future. 

21

 The only difference will be, instead of 

22

 Representative Driehaus, we will substitute 

23

 Representative Kaptur, another prolife Democrat in Ohio 

24

 who we have already criticized for her vote on the ACA 

25

 and which we would have repeated in the 2012 election

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

 cycle but for the chilling effect. 

2

 This is obviously completely different from 

3

 Golden, which my opponent continues to raise, where 

4

 the Court found that the only interpretation of the 

5

 facts is that the plaintiff's, quote, "sole concern" was 

6

 with the representative at issue, who had gone off to a 

7

 judgeship. 

8
9

 It is blazingly obvious that our sole 
 concern is not Representative Driehaus.  It is any 

10

 legislator that voted for an Act that we believe 

11

 devoutly has "taxpayerfunded" and "abortion" in it. 

12

 So we're facing a credible threat. 

We ask 

13

 the Court to lift this yoke so that we can become full 

14

 participants in the next election cycle. 

15
16

 Unless there are any further questions, I 
 thank you.
