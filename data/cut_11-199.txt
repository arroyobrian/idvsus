ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU B. BRINDLEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BRINDLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When determining whether an error affects

12

substantial rights pursuant to the harmless-error

13

statute, courts should first begin the analysis with the

14

error itself, consider it in the context of the entire

15

record, determine what potential impact it may have, and

16

then ask the question:

17

requisite degree of certitude -- in this case, fair

18

assurance -- that the error did not substantially impact

19

the verdict of the jury that heard the case?

20

Can the government prove to the

It is impermissible for the reviewing court

21

to merely ask the question of whether some other jury, a

22

reasonable jury that didn't hear the error that this

23

jury heard, would convict him and determine harmlessness

24

on that basis.

MR. BRINDLEY:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

My problem --

Yes.
-- is I can accept that

4

formulation certainly for purposes of this case.

5

don't see where in the opinion -- I have the opinion of

6

the court of appeals -- it focused on the wrong test.

7

I just

It didn't use the magic words, and it

I just -- I just don't see that you have

16

supported your theory by what the -- by what the court

17

says.

18

MR. BRINDLEY:

Before the harmless-error

19

analysis, the question the Court asks is, what we have

20

to decide is whether a reasonable jury would convict him

21

absent the error.

22

doesn't require any consideration of the error.

23

conclusion they reach that he would be convicted without

24

any consideration of the error also doesn't consider the

25

error.

And so, the question that they ask

They do not address the error or its impact

2

at all, despite a robust dissent, which set forth the

3

extraordinary prejudicial possible impact of this error.

4

They don't disagree with the dissent; they simply don't

5

address it at all.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what

7

the error actually was?

I see -- and you can add

8

another -- three potential things about these calls or

9

three potential errors:

One, that they proved as a

10

matter of fact that she was biased.

11

majority points out, she already said she was before the

12

tapes were played.

13

occasioned by the jury using the tapes as for the truth,

14

it really was cumulative to an already admitted bias.

15

But, as the

So, whatever error may have been

The second is some sort of ambiguous

16

statement by her that all of them were in trouble,

17

meaning all the defendants, and a similar statement by

18

the -- by Petitioner's lawyer.

19

error that affected or influenced the jury among these

20

three choices?

21

MR. BRINDLEY:

So, what was it that was

The -- the statements from

22

counsel, two statements:

One, that everyone was going

23

to lose the case, which was repeated several times by

24

government counsel during the cross-examination of Ms.

25

Perez.

It was never referenced

8

it -- who was going to lose the case only referred to

They didn't reference that specific

that clear.

When the witness suggested that

And then they played the tape to make

12

They also played a portion of a recording

13

where it said that counsel was talking to Mr. Vasquez

14

about pleading guilty.

15

statements together for their truth, what they mean is

16

that counsel believes he's guilty and was telling him he

17

should plead that way.

18
19

Now, if you take those two

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that you think --

20

MR. BRINDLEY:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

So, that's the error

I think that's --- influenced this

trial?
MR. BRINDLEY:

I think that's the most

substantial one.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BRINDLEY:

Well --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The fact that they asked

for her testimony -- well, she was your client's entire

5

defense.

6

show that they were interested in that particular part

7

of the transcript?

So, what does the asking for her testimony

8
9

MR. BRINDLEY:

Well, asking for her

testimony shows that they were focused on the -- they

10

were asking for a transcript that would have contained

11

that part of the record.

12

and we don't have the burden -- I think that's

13

important -- to prove that she -- they were focused on

in the case, which is -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

transcript of her testimony?
MR. BRINDLEY:

Her testimonies, both on

21

direct -- and then they asked for both, plural,

22

indicating they wanted the rebuttal testimony, which

23

would have included these statements.

24
25

And I don't think there's any way for the
government to prove on this record to any degree of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

assurance that they weren't concerned about that error,

2

an error that I think if they took these things for

3

their truth, then they could have thought he essentially

4

confessed to his lawyer.

5

Those are fair inferences if taken for their truth.

6

then they could have disregarded all arguments that were

7

made on his behalf.

8

infect the entire proceeding.

9

His lawyer knew he was guilty.
And

That's a sort of error that could

And when you ask --

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is it correct that the

11

difference between your position and the Government's

12

position is that the Government says the focus should be

13

on a rational jury, and you say the focus should be on

14

this particular jury?

15
16
17

MR. BRINDLEY:
differences.

That is one of the important

I think -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that I understand.

18

But beyond that I really don't understand the difference

19

between the two positions.

20

MR. BRINDLEY:

I -- well, in the

21

Government's brief, at some times, as we indicate in our

22

reply, it seems that they support a very similar test to

23

ours, and at others, it seems like they want to say that

24

you can just look at a reasonable jury and how they

25

would view the evidence.

What is the difference?
The difference is one of them

the error.

in the record without the error, and that's important,

15

particularly with an error like this, an error that

could have a pernicious effect that could affect a

large, substantial part of this evidence, everything the

I -- where in the Government's brief do you

Yes.

23

see the statement that the analysis should not look to

24

the error, should not include the error?

25

MR. BRINDLEY:

Part of the Government's

Alderson Reporting Company

brief asserts that you can look at whether a reasonable

2

jury would convict him absent the error.

3

assessment doesn't require a consideration --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. BRINDLEY:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That

Where -- where --

-- of the error.
Where exactly is

7

that in their brief?

That the -- the question is

8

whether a jury would convict him without considering the

9

error.

Because I look at the Government's brief, and

10

they have fairly extensive analysis of -- of the error,

11

why they think it's not important, why they -- you know.

12

But I don't see them saying you don't look at the error

13

at all.

14
15
16

MR. BRINDLEY:

I think there's a

significant -- I don't have the exact citation.
On page 29, Your Honor, it indicates:

17

"Although the Court's analysis often has not focused

18

exclusively on the overall strength of the government's

19

proof, its decisions demonstrate that a court's

20

determination of harmlessness can properly rest on the

21

conclusion that the admissible evidence of guilt is

22

sufficiently strong such that the prejudicial effect of

23

erroneously admitted evidence can be deemed not to have

24

altered the outcome."

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

Yes, exactly.

In

Official

11
1

other words, you look at the prejudicial effect of the

2

erroneously admitted evidence and see if that altered

3

the outcome.

4

MR. BRINDLEY:

If that's the -- and there's

5

parts of -- the Government's brief, I think, agrees with

6

us in large part on what this test should be.

7

far as that goes, I think the problem is the majority

8

below asked a different question and appeared to do a

9

different analysis.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And as

What would you point at in

11

the majority opinion below that suggests that they did

12

an analysis that didn't look at the error and its

13

possible prejudicial effect?

14

MR. BRINDLEY:

15

question that they asked.

16

was whether a reasonable jury would convict him absent

17

the error.

18

the case or this verdict.

Two things:

5

7
8

"On appeal, the burden lies on the

That's the question they're asking.

That

question doesn't --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but in the context

10

of the opinion -- and this was my first question -- they

11

then proceed to analyze -- and that's toward the very

12

end of its discussion -- what happened in this

13

particular case.

14

we believe -- "This evidence we believe would have moved

15

the jury to convict."

16

And it concludes, from this evidence

MR. BRINDLEY:

I think the problem is they

17

asked that question, which I think is the wrong

18

question.

19

because you can't strip the error from the whole.

20

That's the question they ask.

21

question, you don't have to consider the error.

22

Kotteakos says you can't ask that question

And to answer that

Then I think it's important they didn't

23

address the error at all; they didn't address its

24

potential impact, despite that dissent which laid out

25

that this is one of the most prejudicial errors you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

could have in a trial.

2

They ignored it.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They say --

3

immediately after the sentence you gave us, they say

4

"looking at the evidence as a whole."

5

MR. BRINDLEY:

They do say that.

But then

6

later on, in that same paragraph, they indicate that

7

here's where the evidence was.

8

important that the only evidence they talk about is the

9

government's evidence, and they talk about it in a way

10

that views the evidence in the light most favorable to

11

the government.

12

And I think it's

In their harmless-error analysis, they don't

13

address Mrs. Perez's testimony, and they -- the more

14

important thing is they don't address the error at all.

15

They don't even disagree with the dissent's contention

16

that it's this terribly prejudicial error.

17

Instead, they do what many of the courts

18

below have been doing when they do this guilt-based

19

approach to answer this question.

20

government's evidence viewed in the light most favorable

21

to the government and then find, well, he could be

22

convicted on that basis by a reasonable jury.

MR. BRINDLEY:

I think that actually what

21

they're talking about was whether Mr. Perez's lawyer had

22

talked to me, Mr. Vasquez's lawyer.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:
All right.

Oh, they're talking about

24

the lawyer.

And what you're trying to do,

25

as far as I can read this, is they think what you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

trying to do is you want Perez to plead guilty.

2

the fair thrust of this?

3
4

MR. BRINDLEY:

There's some discussion

between them --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. BRINDLEY:

7

What do you think it means?
There's -- it's hard for me

to tell exactly what --

8
9

Is that

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, it's hard

to tell what they're talking about, I grant you that.

I

10

thought they were talking about trying -- that you

11

thought it would be better if everybody got some kind of

12

agreement worked out.

13

And then she says, Perez's wife:
He says:

"How can I

14

not worry?"

"I don't understand what's going

15

on."

16

Beau -- he's putting it two different ways.

17

didn't explain to you the way, then, either -- then it's

18

a different story.

Which is fair comment.

If he

If you don't ask him" --

19

Then she says:

20

everybody's going to lose.

21

he wants to say.

22

"But it's not the way

"Yes, he's saying that
He's saying that whatever

I don't believe him."

Well, by the time I got through reading

23

that, I wasn't certain what they were talking about, and

24

I thought it sounded like they're talking about:

25

all make an agreement or everybody's going to lose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Let's

Official

16
1

And -- and I could see that you could say

2

that's prejudicial.

I could also see that the

3

government could say it isn't prejudicial.

4

pretty hard for me to read their opinion as thinking

5

they were really not thinking about that error.

6

that was -- or not an error.

7

be thinking about that; that was the issue.

8

And as I read the opinion, they

9

said, well, there's so much other evidence in the case,

And it's

I mean

I mean, of course, they'd

10

and in our opinion, this is weak enough that it didn't

11

-- wouldn't have made a difference and -- and if you

12

didn't, say, take it for the truth.

13

And the other, dissenting judge, common, is

14

thinking:

15

to understand what it means, but there's an implication

16

there the lawyer thinks he's guilty of some kind, and in

17

context that might have made a difference.

18

to a different conclusion.

19

No, I don't know; you know, it's pretty hard

That's what I saw going on.

So, he comes

And I didn't

20

see some big war of standards.

21

disagreeing about a fairly tough question in an

22

individual case.

23

my mind and think this is a war of standards that we

24

ought to --

25

I just saw judges

So, what can you say to make me change

MR. BRINDLEY:

Well, because -- I think -- I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

think the most important thing is what I've already

2

said, is the question they ask isn't about the error,

3

and they don't address it at all.

4

a dissent with that robust of language, the idea that

5

they wouldn't address it at all is problematic.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And when you consider

So, would it satisfy

We aren't finding your

have the right to send cases back to you on that basis.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, therefore, we would

13

like you to clarify whether you do or did or did not

14

take in the actual transcript page there, when you

15

reached your conclusion.

16

MR. BRINDLEY:

I don't think that would be

17

sufficient, because I think the important thing here is

18

that they be required to ask the right question, to

19

focus on this jury that heard the case.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Brindley, I mean,

21

I guess one difficulty -- and this is really repeating

22

Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you're

23

parsing things pretty closely.

24

whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I'm

25

asking pretty much the same question as whether without

If I ask the question

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

that verdict the -- whether without that error, the

2

verdict would be the same.

3

ways of saying the same thing.

4

That seems like just two

Now, if what you're saying is put aside that

5

formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing

6

something wrong, which is that they're not looking at

7

the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all,

8

then I understand the argument; but then I ask the

9

question, well, is that what this court did?

10

MR. BRINDLEY:

And I think that the -- by

11

asking the question in that way and talking only about a

12

reasonable jury absent the error, when you start saying

13

absent the error and you start looking at the evidence

14

without the error, you're looking at a case the jury

15

didn't hear.

16

If you're looking at a case the jury didn't hear, then

17

the reviewing court sort of makes its own guilt judgment

18

about a case they didn't hear.

And I think that's the biggest problem.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

win, your client will get a new trial.

21

that the new trial is exactly like the trial that took

22

place.

23

is corrected.

harmless-error analysis?

25

Well, look, if you -- if you

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. BRINDLEY:

No?
I don't think so, because I

3

think if you do the analysis that way and you say the

4

error is corrected, you don't take into account its

5

impact.

6

contributed to the jury's verdict, not whether the

7

verdict would be the same in another trial.

8

where that Sixth Amendment problem that this Court was

9

worried about all the way back in Kotteakos, and even in

The question has been to be whether it

That's

10

Neder, where this Court said to safeguard the jury's

province, we have to do an exacting review of the entire

obviously, and its impact.

14

And here this court didn't address the error

15

or its potential impact, and I think --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you -- are you saying

17

that it doesn't matter that the verdict would have been

18

the same by this jury if the error had not been made?

19

You're --

20

MR. BRINDLEY:

21

saying that the question --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I am saying that.

I'm

You're saying that the test

23

is whether it contributed to the verdict, and if it did,

24

it doesn't matter whether the same verdict would have

25

been pronounced absent that evidence?

Alderson Reporting Company

2

MR. BRINDLEY:

That is correct, Your Honor,

yes.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then, what is

4

harmless error?

Every error is harmful.

Every error

5

that's -- that's there contributes to the verdict.

6

There's no such thing as harmless error.

7

MR. BRINDLEY:

I think -- I don't think that

8

should be the formulation of the test.

9

to have a -- what the government has to be able to do is

I think it has

10

prove to the necessary degree of certitude that the

11

error doesn't substantially impact the verdict.

12

reason I --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the

What -- what does that

14

mean?

15

verdict means the verdict would have been the same

16

despite this evidence.

17

not the test; you have to ask whether it contributed to

18

the verdict.

19

verdict would have been the same anyway.

20

22

To say that it doesn't substantially impact the

But you're saying, no, that's

The Government says, well, it did, but the

That's what harmless error is, it seems to
me.
MR. BRINDLEY:

I think what the -- when you

23

ask the question about whether the verdict contributed

24

substantially to -- or, I'm sorry, whether the error

25

contributed substantially to the verdict, what you're

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

21
1

doing is you're -- you have to then look at the entire

2

record and you have to look at the error's impact.

3

when you do that, you can make a determination whether

4

there's anything in the record that would allow the

5

government to prove to the right degree of assurance

6

that it didn't.

7

And

Now, you could -- it could be the case that

8

you look at all of the evidence and you can say, well,

9

in light of all the other evidence, the error was

10

cumulative, or it was essentially uncontested.

11

you can find that error is harmless.

12

contributed to the verdict, and we know that to the

13

right degree of certitude.

14

And then

It couldn't have

I think the problem comes in when you're

15

talking about this reasonable jury and whether they

16

would convict without the error.

17

trial.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's some other

Could we get a little

19

more practical here?

I think I understood your basic

20

argument, which is:

My defense was by this one woman,

21

the wife of one of the codefendants.

22

and if the jury had believed her story they would have

23

acquitted your client.

24

MR. BRINDLEY:

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

She tells a story,

Yes.
All right.

Alderson Reporting Company

So, I am

Official

22
1

assuming what you're saying -- and you can correct me if

2

I'm wrong -- which is if we believe that the error

3

committed affected her credibility in a meaningful way,

4

that that deprived you of a defense.

5

you're saying?

6

MR. BRINDLEY:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

Is that what

Yes.
Of the potential of

convincing the jury.

9

MR. BRINDLEY:

Yes, absolutely, in addition

10

to the fact that the error -- if those things are taken

11

for their truth, they serve as an independent basis for

12

conviction, believing he had essentially confessed.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

Now, assuming

that's your argument --

15

MR. BRINDLEY:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- I go back to my

17

question.

18

it wasn't about believing her or not; it was about

19

believing the defense attorney when -- whether the

20

defense attorney thought the defendant was guilty or

21

not.

22

Okay?

Yes.

Because what you said to me earlier,

MR. BRINDLEY:

I think that -- well, I think

23

the two go hand in hand.

I think that if they take these

24

statements for their truth, they could disbelieve her

25

and the defense attorney who called her because the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23

defense attorney knew he was guilty and then called this

2

witness to say otherwise.

3

situation make it appear as if she wasn't telling the

4

truth.

5

analysis --

I think that would in that

And I think the important thing about this whole

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. BRINDLEY:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Let's -- let's --

Okay.
Are you -- are you

taking the position in this case that a reviewing court,

10

under no circumstance, could conclude that this error

11

was harmless?

12

case that the court here, the Seventh Circuit, I think,

13

committed review error and we should send it back for

14

them to do it the right way?

15

Or are you taking the position in this

MR. BRINDLEY:

I -- I am first saying that

16

the court committed review error.

17

also saying on top of that if you do the error -- review

18

properly in these cases, as we've asked the test to be

19

formulated, then what this -- this case is going to come

20

down to is really one question, and --

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I think -- I'm

Well, you're -- and

22

you're agreeing with the dissenting judge, who I think

23

did say this error is harmful.

24

MR. BRINDLEY:

Yes, of course.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so, you're not saying

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

24
1

that it's just that they didn't use the right formula,

2

but you would say, given what occurred here, the

3

importance of this witness, that -- that this was a --

4

this was a harmful error?

5

MR. BRINDLEY:

Yes, absolutely.

I -- I

6

think if you do the test appropriately and do the proper

7

analysis focused on this jury and the potential impact

8

of the error, then this is a harmful error.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Back to Justice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is your argument something

11

like this?

Let's assume there are 10 pieces of

12

evidence.

13

Evidence item 10 is (a) wrongfully admitted and (b) so

14

prejudicial that that's all the jury looked at.

15

is a substantial likelihood of that.

Evidence 1 through 9 are properly admitted.

There

16

I think this is your argument:

17

was so obsessed, focused, transfixed by item 10, which

18

was improperly admitted, what would happen if we

19

concluded that this jury in this case on these facts, if

20

they had looked at 1 through 9, would have convicted?

21

What result?

22

MR. BRINDLEY:

If the jury

I think if you did the

23

examination that way and didn't consider 10 at all, what

24

you're saying is it's possible to convict on 1 through

25

9, but you're not considering the possibility that you

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

25
1

could convict as an independent basis on 10.

2

government would have to --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the

We're not only saying it's

4

possible to convict, but that likely, probably would

5

have happened.

6

MR. BRINDLEY:

I don't -- well, if the error

7

is the error in this case, that's number 10, then I

8

think when you consider the possible impact, sweeping as

9

it might be, I don't think there's any way on this

10

record that the government can prove with fair assurance

11

that that didn't infect the jury.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, my hypothetical is

13

that the court of appeals says that if the jury had

14

looked at 1 through 9, which was properly admitted

15

before them in this trial, they would have convicted,

16

likely.

17

Now, we -- then the hypothetical is:

We

18

don't think they did because this item was so

19

prejudicial that all they looked -- that's all they

20

looked at.

21

me that's stronger than the argument you're making.

22

not sure even that works for you.

23

Is that what your argument is?

MR. BRINDLEY:

It seems to
I'm

I -- the formulation you've

24

stated, I agree with that.

If number 10 is such that

25

there's no way that they can prove that it didn't impact

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

26
1

the jury's verdict substantially -- and I don't think

2

they can in this case -- then, yes, that's -- that's our

3

argument.

4

important in this case is because this case comes down

5

to -- at the end, we have -- you know, you have --

6

essentially it's a circumstantial case.

7

Harrington or Schneble or the cases with direct evidence

8

where this Court has found harmless error.

9

And the one reason I think it's most

This isn't like

This is a case where the ultimate question

10

is, if you believe Mrs. Perez is credible, he's not

11

guilty; if you don't, he is.

12

harmlessness, you have to have a reviewing court on a

13

cold record making that credibility determination,

14

something that this Court has continually said a

15

reviewing court is not in a position to do.

16

case can be ground down to the point where it's going to

17

come to a credibility determination about a witness the

18

reviewing court did not see --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And in order to find

And when a

Well, maybe the majority in

20

the court of appeals was wrong in its application of the

21

harmless-error test.

22

why we took this, why we took this case.

23

concerned about is the test.

24

the only thing that I understand that really

25

differentiates your position from the Government with

I didn't think that was the reason
What I'm

Now, the only aspect of --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

27
1

respect to the test is whether the focus is on a

2

rational jury or on this particular jury.

3

And when you say the focus should be on this

4

particular jury, aren't you calling for a speculation by

5

the -- by an appellate court?

6

supposed to tell whether this particular jury was

7

different from a hypothetical rational jury?

8
9

MR. BRINDLEY:

How is an appellate court

Because this -- the reviewing

court has to look at everything in the entire record.

10

That includes in this case the jury note.

It includes

11

in this case the split verdict.

12

And when you look at all of those things, you can get

13

insight into the jury that heard the case and how they

14

viewed it.

All of those things.

15

You can also look at how a reasonable jury

16

would view the case as heuristic device to get back to

17

what this jury thought.

18

But --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought -- I thought

19

your main point -- yes, you said "this jury" rather than

20

a hypothetical jury.

21

that what's wrong is to say strip out the infected

22

testimony, take that out, look at the rest of the

23

record, and if the rest of the record warrants

24

conviction, no harmless error.

25

But I thought your main point is

I thought that what you're saying is that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

28
1

the basic mistake is what -- what are they looking to;

2

are they looking to all of the evidence, or are they

3

just asking the question, let's take out the tainted

4

evidence, see if there's enough to convict?

5

MR. BRINDLEY:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

I

6

agree with that.

The problem is the question asked by

7

the majority strips out the error and it also focuses on

8

the reasonable jury rather than this jury.

9

And with that, if there aren't any further

10

questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my

11

time.

Thank you,

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY A. YANG

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18
19

MR. YANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The harmless-error inquiry, as this Court

20

explained in Neder and prior decisions, turns ultimately

21

on one question:

22

a quote -- "whether a rational jury would have found the

23

defendant guilty absent the error."

24
25

Whether a rational jury -- and this is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now --

Mr. Yang, that does raise

the question that I think most separates you and Mr.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

29
1

Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito

2

suggested.

3

So, let me give you a hypothetical.
Let's say that this jury was not out for 8

4

hours but was out for 8 days.

5

note came from the jury, and the note said we really

6

think that these tape recordings are extremely

7

important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how

8

important they are, and we'd like to listen to them

9

again.

10
11

And on the 7th day, a

And they do that, and then they come back with

this compromise verdict.
Now, what you are suggesting is that we

12

cannot look at any of that.

13

that's available to us about whether the error in fact

14

affected this jury's decision, you would have a court

15

close its eyes to.

16

Essentially, the best proof

And I guess -- why would that be?

MR. YANG:

Well, I don't believe our view is

17

quite so firm.

I think, as a general matter, our view

18

is that indications mid-deliberation of what a jury

19

might or some subset of the jury might be considering is

20

generally very unreliable.

21

Court shouldn't shut its eyes to that question, but what

22

it should do is redirect the court back to the evidence

23

that was before the jury.

24

rational jury, there often is some correspondence; it

25

should be an indication to go back and look again.

And that, in your case, the

Because if we're assuming a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

If the Court were to conclude, wow, the

2

evidence was so overwhelming, so overwhelming that no

3

rational jury would have, you know, had a problem with

4

convicting absent the error, it's very unlikely that the

5

situation that your hypothetical poses would result.

6

So --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, let me make sure I

8

understand what you're saying to me, that you're saying

9

to me:

No, we didn't mean to say that that was

10

irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court

11

should be cautious about it and look at that kind of

12

evidence in the -- in light of everything else that

13

happened at the trial.

14

MR. YANG:

Ultimately, the appellate court

15

should look back at what the jury was supposed to

16

consider, the evidence in light of the instructions.

17

should be a cautionary note but ultimately should

18

redirect the court back to the evidence.

19

It

And I think that focuses on, again, one of

20

the two related legal points that Petitioner made in

21

argument that I think there's real disagreement between

22

the Government and Petitioner on:

23

reasonable jury or a rational jury, which is the

24

Government's view, versus this particular jury; and the

25

related claim that the inquiry is how this influenced

one, the inquiry of a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31
1

the deliberative process, if it was like a factor that

2

this jury might have considered in reaching its

3

verdict --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know how to

5

separate out an admitted error situation.

And let me

6

explain why, okay?

7

but instead of this tape recording, the improperly

8

admitted evidence was a confession by the defendant.

9

Would you be prepared to say that in a circumstantial

Let's assume the facts of this case,

10

case of guilt -- now, we've already said that

11

confessions are one of the most powerful pieces of

12

harmful error -- that in this, in a confession, that

13

somehow this was still harmful -- harmless?

14
15

MR. YANG:

Are we taking Marina's testimony

out now?

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. YANG:

Okay.

Yes.

Yes.

If Marina's testimony was

18

not in and you had the evidence here -- now, an

19

unconstitutional confession, of course, would raise the

20

bar, right?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. YANG:

about it under the Kehota standard.

Alderson Reporting Company

Let's talk about

the standard we're assessing.

2

MR. YANG:

If you're -- all you're asking is

3

a fair assurance, then I think you could get to the same

4

result here, because what you -- when you take Marina's

5

testimony out of the picture, there was really no

6

defense at all.

case --

8
9

What the government had was a strong

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, no, no.

He

testifies, but he testifies to everything Marina said.

10

Meaning, he -- when I used the word "confession," I'm

11

sorry, I misspoke.

12

He takes the stand.

He -- or doesn't take

13

the stand.

14

And that confession that he was there, et cetera --

15

He says everything he said to the police.

MR. YANG:

So, he testified to the substance

16

of Marina's testimony, that he happened to just drive

17

there?

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

MR. YANG:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And then the error is the same

My hypothetical is not

11

working for this reason, and I understand what you're

saying.

error sort of vary with the strength of the government's

15

case?

It's hard to identify a comparable mistake.

Undoubtedly. I think that's right.

Now, let --

If he had not run away,

We would have a weaker case, and

20

advocated is that this jury, as opposed to the

reasonable jury, and that looking at this jury, you must

22

look at the thought process of this jury to decide

23

whether the error might have had some influence.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, you look at how the

case was tried.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

35
1

MR. YANG:

Well, no, I think the position

2

about this jury versus a rational jury, in looking at

3

the deliberative process, is entirely foreclosed by this

4

Court's decision in Shinseki.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Yang --

Well, you just told me it

7

wasn't, Mr. Yang.

Because -- well, I think that the --

8

that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury

9

is important is whether you're going to take into

10

account what you know about what this jury did:

11

long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court,

12

what eventual verdict it reached.

13

how

And you just suggested to me that that was

14

fair game to consider in this analysis, although one

15

should be cautious about doing it.

16

MR. YANG:

I should qualify that.

I didn't

17

intend to give the Court the misconception that we're

18

looking at this jury.

19

a rational jury would have convicted absent the error.

20

The ultimate question is whether

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, a rational jury is not

21

the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back

22

a note on the 7th day.

23

MR. YANG:

That's this jury.
And the reason that I believe

24

that the Court can use that as a benchmark to look back

25

at the evidence is it is some indication of perhaps what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36
1

the evidence should be saying to a rational jury.

2

the ultimate question is the rational jury.

3

But

And let me give you a few examples from the

4

Court's case law, because I think this really puts it

5

beyond dispute that the real question is the question of

6

a rational jury, what they would do absent the error.

7

First, in Neder the Court explained that

8

erroneous admissions of evidence or exclusions of

9

evidence, just like an erroneous instruction on an

10

element of the offense, or failure to instruct on a

11

necessary element of the offense as was the case in

12

Neder, will infringe on the jury's factfinding role and

13

will affect the deliberative process in ways that are

14

not readily calculable.

15

The error in Neder was that the jury was

16

instructed not to consider the question of materiality,

17

which was an essential element of the defense.

18

Court specifically rejected that the -- that the fact

19

that this jury didn't actually make a finding based on

20

the evidence was not -- did not foreclose harmless-error

21

analysis.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the

You're going back then to

23

your position in your brief where you said that you

24

would not include, in the harmless-error calculus, that

25

the jury requested to hear Marina's testimony again, the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

37
1

length of their deliberations, the divided verdict?

2

said in your brief, at pages 32 to 35, that you would

3

not include those.

4

MR. YANG:

That's right.

You

Those types of

5

indications are entirely unreliable and --

MR. YANG:

What I think the court should do

is when you have a -- what is a much better indication

example --

9

And let me give you an

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's starting to look, Mr.

10

Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the

11

government on the part of a judge, because you're so

12

abstracting it from this case and this jury and what

13

this jury's reactions to everything that happened was

14

that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict

15

route?

16

MR. YANG:

This Court has repeatedly

17

rejected that.

18

is you have a jury verdict.

19

that beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury has factually

20

determined that this defendant is guilty of the offense

21

charged, on proper instructions.

22

What remedy do you have?

23

The reason it's not a directed verdict

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You have a jury verdict

Then the question is:

You do have a jury -- excuse

24

me.

You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a

25

formulation of the test that essentially pretends that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

the jury is not there and that we know nothing about how

2

it reacted to various things.

3

MR. YANG:

The reason --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. YANG:

Sorry.

A question mark.

This I think can be answered if I

7

could just get out a few of the Court's cases, because I

8

think this shows the Court's rationale here and shows

9

that our view has to be the right view.

10

For instance, in a series of cases, this

11

Court has concluded that the unconstitutional admission

12

of a confession, either of the defendant or the

13

codefendant, can be harmless when there is overwhelming

14

evidence such that a rational jury would convict without

15

the evidence.

16

Now, if we're looking at what a jury would

17

have considered, whether they were brought to tears or

18

whatever, when you're talking about a confession,

19

there's no doubt that a rational jury or any jury is

20

going to have that far in the forefront of their minds

21

when they are deciding guilt or innocence.

22

question --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the

Counsel, I just don't

24

see how you can do it without the error.

25

back to this point.

I keep going

How about if the prosecutor had

whatever the wife told you disbelieve because the lawyer

3

said he was guilty.

MR. YANG:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I'm sorry.

I just --

The lawyer -- the

6

prosecutor got up at the end of trial and said:

Disbelieve everything the wife told you, because the

8

lawyer said the defendant was guilty.

9

go through all the other evidence I have that might

All right?

I'll

10

prove that she was not telling the truth, but the

11

central, most important piece of evidence in this case

12

about his guilt is that the lawyer said he's guilty.

Can you say that this jury was uninfluenced
by that error?

No.

You can't --- a rational jury would

have convicted absent the lawyer saying that.
MR. YANG:

That's right.

But this Court has

22

repeatedly said, for instance in Rose, where the

23

question was the jury was told to presume certain malice

24

in a -- in a homicide, the fact that the error may have

25

altered the basis on which the jury decided the case is

not the question; you look to the reasonable juror.

2

Similarly in Pope, the Court said the

3

question does not turn on whether the jury did not, in

4

fact, have this error in mind when it found the

5

defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, because --

You would -- you would

take into account that the prosecution apparently

thought this was important, so important.

The prosecutor said:

The trial was

back so these tapes can be introduced.

11

14

Cruz never spoke to this defendant, to Vasquez.

We have no direct evidence, because

And an explanation, an

that the government itself thought this was very

22

important?

23

He's at

MR. YANG:

I -- I think it's a factor that

24

you consider, again, in directing the courts look at

25

really what the trial evidence was.

2

hypothetical.

3

develop, prosecutors don't focus on a fleeting, you

4

know, sentence in a series of -- series of long tapes

5

that weren't transcribed --

6

But when you look at how cases really

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But my point to you is it

7

wasn't fleeting if the government says we want to extend

8

the trial so that we can play these tapes, all of them.

9

And they contain not just the one statement.

There's

10

the one statement that the trial will be bad, a trial

11

will be bad for all of them, and they all -- that --

12

they should take a blind plea.

13

MR. YANG:

I think when you look at what

14

happened at trial, you see that the tapes were played

15

for two reasons:

16

because she was told by Petitioner's counsel that

17

Petitioner's counsel -- well, she thought this --

18

Petitioner's counsel would be able to make motions and

19

arguments on behalf of her husband at sentencing.

20

And --

21
22

one, to show that Marina had bias

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

that she admitted that before the tapes were played.

23

MR. YANG:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

The dissent pointed out

Correct.
That she was testifying

in the hopes of getting a lesser sentence for her

43

husband.

2

that.

3

So, she -- the tapes weren't necessary for

MR. YANG:

Well, the tapes certainly were

4

reinforcing of that.

And, in fact, when the

5

government's closing argument -- it did not reference

6

anything about this -- what I think you and

7

Justice Breyer correctly identified as a very ambiguous

8

sentence in a series of long tapes.

9

these --

And, remember,

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. YANG: -- the transcripts that are in the

12

What was --

record are only one portion of the tapes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So --

What was your second -What was the line that

15

the government, the prosecutor, repeated three times

16

while she was on the stand, the exact line?

17

MR. YANG:

The exact lines?

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. YANG:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

This is -The government thought --

21

thought it was important for the jury to hear it,

22

because they said it three times.

23

MR. YANG:

Well, to be fair, I think you

24

need to look at what's before and after it.

25

government is focusing on three different statements

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

44
1
2

that are at issue in the case.
The first one is that -- with some

3

profanity, suggesting that her husband is not likely to

4

succeed at trial.

5

counsel suggested -- that she said that defense counsel

6

suggested that everybody was going to lose.

7

third, she thought everybody was in, again with

8

profanity -- I'm going to paraphrase -- a bad situation.

9

The second one is that defense

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And then,

Mr. Yang, why does any of

10

this have to do with her credibility?

11

say that the way this affected the jury was that it

12

rendered her less credible?

13

MR. YANG:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did the dissent

I thought --

The --- that the dissent just

15

said it's bad to tell the jury that even the defendant

16

thought he was guilty -- or even the defendant's lawyer

17

thought he was going to lose.

18

MR. YANG:

The reason that this was in --

19

and I don't -- it's not contested here -- is because the

20

argument was made that these statements equating

21

Petitioner and Perez in terms of their level of guilt or

22

their likelihood of being convicted is inconsistent with

23

Marina's subsequent testimony that all of us -- you

24

know, Vasquez just -- or Petitioner just showed up

25

unknowingly because she asked him.

Alderson Reporting Company

That was the theory.

Official

45
1

It's not contested.

And, in fact, nothing

2

that the jury heard in this case under Petitioner's

3

theory would be different.

4

a limiting instruction that would simply say you can't

5

take these statements for the truth of the matter.

6

The only difference would be

So, nothing that the jury heard would have

7

been different.

When you read the short passage in the

8

context of these tapes -- and the tapes, again, are not

9

fully transcribed.

Petitioner asked for the entire

10

tapes to come in at the -- at the tail end of the trial,

11

which -- which was -- based on the government's showing

12

that was uncontested that Petitioner was at the scene,

13

he drove the $23,000 there, he waited with Perez and

14

Cruz while the informant was coming back, he was there

15

when the call was made to the informant that said they

16

had the money.

17

Now, there's some dispute over whether he

18

said that, but certainly he was there when that call was

19

made because that's what triggered the raid.

20

that was basically undisputed.

21

calls that tie Petitioner to Perez -- to Perez,

22

27 calls --

23

All of

You've got all these

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're going over

And I may simply be asking the same

25

question Justice Kennedy asked earlier.

Alderson Reporting Company

But let's say

Official

46
1

you have a situation where it's the same thing, and at

2

the -- you, know, and the improperly admitted evidence

3

has the defendant saying:

4

the evidence is the same as all you've set forth at

5

pages 2 through 9, very complicated, who's driving what,

6

you know, kind of car where, and where they're meeting.

7

And the jury goes out and comes back in 2 minutes:

8

know, the guy said he was guilty.

9

I'm guilty, I'm guilty.

And

You

Is that a situation in which we're supposed

10

to then go back, look at all the complicated evidence,

11

and see if a jury would have convicted?

12

a fair degree of confidence say that the error is what

13

led the jury to convict?

In Neder, the jury never found

The district court told the jury this is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

view in that case was that the -- the defendant could

24

not have contested that element.

25

MR. YANG:

Well, but if we're -- again, if

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

we're focusing on the legal dispute between us and the

2

other side about whether we're looking at this jury or

3

what a rational jury would do when you excise the --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I would like very

5

much to know what your answer is to Justice Kennedy's

6

hypothetical and the Chief Justice's.

7

those hypotheticals, they're trying to imagine a case --

8

MR. YANG:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

As I understand

Right.
-- where the particular

10

piece of improperly admitted evidence -- we know from

11

how the jury reacted, or the kind of evidence -- it's

12

the kind of thing that could really make a difference.

13

I mean, they were in tears, et cetera.

14

MR. YANG:

And --

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, in my

16

reading of this, which I once had to read about 100

17

harmless-error cases, and it seemed to me -- and you can

18

confirm or deny this -- that in cases like that, the

19

judge who knows this is a tough case when the jury's

20

feeling this way, asks himself or herself the question,

21

could this illegally admitted evidence make a

22

difference?

23

case?

24

"no" where that judge thinks a reasonable jury would not

25

have thought it made a critical difference.

Could it have made a difference in this

Could it have?

And the answer is going to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

And that's just putting the same thing I

2

think slightly differently.

3

Justice Kennedy's case would be a judge just isn't going

4

to think it has nothing to do with rationality.

5

jury's in tears, they're going to think it's a close

case.

7

difference, the judge says, yes, it's not harmless.

10

If the

And, therefore, if in fact this could have made a

9

But the answer in

And if the judge thinks, no, it couldn't
have made a difference to any rational person, he's
going to say "harmless."

11

Period.

Now, that was my impression reading those

12

cases.

And I felt that those hypotheticals were getting

13

at that.

14

because that's what I'm interested in.

And -- use them.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. YANG:

Answer them rather than me,

The answer is that in a case

17

where the jury -- where you have some very provocative

18

evidence, but there's also a very strong case that

19

exists -- it may depend on the level of certainty that

20

you need to get to, whether it's a fair assurance or

21

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

22

cases, you can -- if the court looks at the evidence as

23

a whole and says that there was so much evidence before

24

this stuff came in, this bad -- this error came in, that

25

a rational jury would have gotten to the same result,

Alderson Reporting Company

But even in those

Official

49
1

that it would have convicted, then --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose -- suppose the

3

judge concludes that both this jury that I had and some

4

hypothetical rational jury would have been so focused on

5

this evidence that that's all they would have looked at,

6

but if they had looked at 1 through 9, the admissible

7

evidence, they would still have found guilt.

8

Is that -- is that what you're -- is that --

9

MR. YANG:

10

an example.

11
12

I think so, but let me give you

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- a proper application of

the -- of the framework?

13

MR. YANG:

I think so, but it's not, again,

14

what a -- what this particular jury was doing, because

15

we know, for instance, from Neder or in the confession

16

cases, the jury hears a confession, an

17

unconstitutionally obtained confession,

18

unconstitutionally admitted, from the defendant, that is

19

going to be -- right there.

20

juror could say:

21

It's out of his own mouth.

debate.

23

You know?

A jury -- a

Let's go home, we have a confession.
There's very little else to

But when the evidence is beyond that

24

confession, so overwhelming that no rational jury would

25

have gotten to a different result, and you could say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

50
1

that with a fair assurance or if there's a

2

constitutional error as it would be with a confession

3

beyond a reasonable doubt, the Court says that this is

4

harmless.

5

And the reason that the Court's taking that

6

inquiry is because it recognized -- the Court's long

7

recognized that no trial is perfect, that there are very

8

significant costs of retrial.

9

there --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so, the premise

But you -- you are

11

essentially saying, as I understand you, that if there

12

was such a thing as a directed verdict in a criminal

13

case, if the judge would say, you know, I will direct a

14

verdict here because there's only one way a rational --

15

rational jury could come out.

16

MR. YANG:

This -- that argument was

17

specifically rejected by this Court in Neder.

18

question came up, and in fact, Neder is a much -- more

19

difficult case for the government than this, because at

20

least in Neder, the defendant had the argument that this

21

jury could -- did not find guilt beyond reasonable doubt

22

because it was never instructed to find an element of

23

the offense.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

The same

Mr. Yang, I think you may be

taking a harder position than you really need to.

Alderson Reporting Company

Why

Official

51
1

shouldn't the rule be that the -- the appellate court

2

should look at what would be done by a rational jury,

3

except in the kind of extraordinary circumstances that

4

have been posited by Justice Kagan's hypothetical and a

5

few of the other questions, simply because it's so

6

difficult to determine what a -- what the jury was

7

actually doing?

8
9

We have a rule that prohibits consideration
of what goes on in the jury room.

But suppose we didn't

10

have that.

11

jury didn't know what was going on, so you could -- you

12

could watch it and see.

13

surely the rule would be what would this jury have done?

14

But most of the time, it's just speculation to tell what

15

a jury -- what they -- did they come back quickly?

16

Well, that shows that this evidence was so bad that it

17

caused them to render a quick verdict in what otherwise

18

would have been a difficult case.

19

Suppose that it was all videotaped, and the

If that were the case, then

Did they take a long time?

Well, it shows

20

it was a close case, and, therefore, any error might

21

have tipped them one way or the other.

22

You just can't tell.

23

MR. YANG:

I'm -- I don't want to resist

24

this too much, because I think we're fighting about

25

things at the very extreme.

Most of the times that

Alderson Reporting Company

jury, it's entirely ambiguous.

rightfully influence a court's consideration in a case.

And the -- so, there may
And I think those would

5

But, again, when you have harmless-error

6

cases in which we know for a certainty, as in Neder,

7

that the jury did not find an element of the offense,

8

the inquiry has to be, it has to be, on what the Court

9

has repeatedly said in -- this is I believe on pages 19

10

of our brief -- that the focus of the harmless-error

11

inquiry is bringing the court's attention to the fact

12

that the primary purpose of a trial is the factual

13

question of guilt or innocence.

Again --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask you a different

9

question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference

10

in the formulation of the test, which I find it hard to

11

wrap my mind around, but -- and it strikes me that

12

there's two different ways of saying the same thing.

13

But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out

14

there which suggests that courts that use one

15

formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that

16

use the other formulation tend to come out the other

17

way.

18

And I'm just wondering what your view of

19

that is, that somehow one formulation seems to put the

20

emphasis on the entire case, whereas the other

21

formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the

22

government's evidence, and that that makes a difference

23

in the end.

24
25

MR. YANG:

We don't think that there is this

deep -- there are some disagreements or some things we

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

disagree with about what courts of appeals do in any

2

particular cases.

3

of the -- I think Petitioner calls it the guilt-focused

4

versus effect-of-the-error-focused approaches, the

5

scholarship -- I think he relies principally on Judge

6

Edwards' opinion about harmless error.

7

1995, when it was already swimming against -- upstream

8

against this Court's harmless-error decisions.

9

But with respect to this formulation

That came out in

10

decision, which was admittedly a structural-error case,

to do.

Then we have Neder and -- I can't pronounce

making --

3

MR. YANG:

No.

The Court, even in -- I

4

think most recently, the Court explained in Shinseki,

5

talking about Kotteakos, that you don't use these kind

6

of presumptions or rigid rules.

7

do, that you're kind of looking from the perspective of

8

a reasonable jury, is the jury has in fact found the

9

defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

And the reason that you

And then

10

the question is, are you setting aside that verdict

11

because -- do you think that this error was the thing

12

that tipped the scales from not guilty to guilty?

13

so, taking a look at the evidence, kind of with all

14

presumptions favoring one side or the other, is not how

15

this Court has conducted the --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, what does it mean

17

that the government has the burden?

18

19

MR. YANG:

And

What does the

The government has to show, as --

20

this is the formulation in Neder and which the Court has

21

said in Neder is the same thing that applied in

22

erroneous admissions or exclusions of evidence, that a

23

rational jury would have found the defendant guilty

24

absent the error, and that involves the three core

25

elements we explained in our brief.

Alderson Reporting Company

And then the Court

takes into account --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

that means -- wait.

4

that's not tainted?

5

The absent error.

So,

You look at just the evidence

MR. YANG:

In some cases you can do that,

6

where the evidence is so overwhelming -- if I -- if I

7

may finish.

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

MR. YANG:

Briefly.

Briefly.

In some cases, you

10

might do that.

11

evidence is not so strong, you need to look at the error

12

to see if that error was going to be a dispositive thing

13

in getting to guilt.

14

In other cases where it's close or the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The Chief Justice allowed

15

me to ask one question.

16

that you would say a rational jury in all the

17

circumstances of this case, given what this jury heard,

18

would have?

19

MR. YANG:

Could I amend your statement so

Yes.

It's -- in the position of

20

this jury, based on the evidence presented to the jury,

21

correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BEAU R. BRINDLEY

25

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

MR. BRINDLEY:

I first want to address

2

Neder, which Government counsel continually referenced.

3

Neder talks about the reasonable jury, but Neder also

4

limits itself to situations where the evidence is

5

uncontroverted and inconvertible, I think because in

6

those situations the difference between the reasonable

7

jury and this jury would be deemed to be nonexistent

8

because it would be impossible for the error to have an

9

impact.

10

Secondly, I think it's important to note

11

from Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, if you don't

12

consider the error, then even that extreme case, that

13

would have to be ignored.

14

Government's formulation and the formulation used by the

15

appellate court below would justify -- would lead to

16

that bad conclusion.

17

And so, I think the

I also think that when you do that

18

formulation, where you're talking about the reasonable

19

jury and absence of error, the reason those cases come

20

out different is because those courts think they don't

21

have to address the error, which is I think what

22

happened in the majority below, why they didn't address

23

it despite the dissent.

24
25

The other thing I think it's important to
note is the reason you have to look at the error and its

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

possible impact and not just whether you could be

2

convicted on the other evidence is because you say,

3

well, he could be convicted on the other evidence.

4

that's all that you're saying and you -- and it's not on

5

the evidence which could independently in this case be a

6

reason to convict, then I think you're making that guilt

7

determination that this Court says is not supposed to

8

happen.

9

consistent with that approach, and there's nothing in it

10

If

And I think the majority's opinion below is

to suggest that's not exactly what they did.

11

I also think that in the end -- there was a

12

mention of the limiting instruction; a limiting

13

instruction would have cured this problem.

14

juries would follow it.

15

concluded that his lawyer thought him guilty and then

16

put Mrs. Perez on the stand and concluded she wasn't

17

telling the truth.

We assume

That means they wouldn't have

18

What this error allows, what -- if taken for

19

its truth, a jury could believe that he confessed to his

20

lawyer.

21

on his behalf.

22

his lawyer knew he was guilty; we can convict him on

23

that basis.

24

entirety of the proceedings.

25

They could disregard everything that was said
They could say we know that he's guilty;

That's an error that can infect the

And if you look at this jury and what they

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

59
1

heard, and the question comes down to whether Mrs. Perez

2

is credible or not, there is nothing in this record the

3

Government can point to that would allow a reviewing

4

court to make that determination.

5

that didn't see --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

A reviewing court

Did the panel majority in --

7

did the panel majority in this case say anything that

8

differs from what this Court has said about harmless

9

error?

10

If we were to reverse, what would we point to in

the panel majority's opinion that was erroneous?

11

MR. BRINDLEY:

I think you would point to

12

that first statement of the test where they say whether

13

the reasonable jury would convict him absent the error,

14

because Kotteakos says you can't strip the error out.

15

This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.

16

The other thing --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Hasn't this Court said

18

exactly what Seventh Circuit said there?

19

cases?

In other

20

MR. BRINDLEY:

This Court has used, I think,

21

dicta that has language of that sort.

22

cases, what the Court does -- like in Harrington, they

23

look at what the error was; they put it in the context

24

of the whole case, and they can say the government could

25

prove the jury didn't look at this to the right degree

Alderson Reporting Company

But in those

Official

60
1

of assurance, because it was cumulative, because --

2

there's no -- there's nothing --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

You want us to say -- you

4

want us to say we're reversing you, Seventh Circuit

5

panel, because you said what we have said in prior

6

cases, but we were wrong?

7

MR. BRINDLEY:

I think the reason to reverse

8

them is because that formulation has proven to lead to

9

the wrong analysis, in all of these lower courts, this

10

guilt-based approach; and it is not the law of

11

Kotteakos.

12

This Court has never overruled Kotteakos.
And to focus on it allows a guilt

13

determination by a reviewing court that would be

14

violative of the Sixth Amendment that this Court was

15

concerned about in Kotteakos, that this Court was

16

concerned about in Sullivan, that this Court was even

17

concerned about in Neder, outside the scope of cases

18

where the evidence is uncontestable.

19

Because if you took these statements as true

20

and then you came down to a question, well, is Marina

21

credible or not, Mrs. Perez, there's nothing the

22

government can do on this record to prove that the jury

23

would have found her credibility differently because

24

this Court can't figure that out on a cold record.

25

It said so, many times.

Alderson Reporting Company

It's not possible

to do, especially in a case that's based on

circumstantial evidence like this one.
