CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 08-1423, Costco

Wholesale Corporation v. Omega.
Mr. Englert.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. ENGLERT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is a repeat of Quality

11
12

King v. L'anza with only one pertinent difference.

Both

13

cases involve goods not authorized for importation into

14

the United States.

15

the first sale doctrine must be narrowly construed, thus

16

the Copyright Act's importation ban, section 602(a), be

17

given less than its supposedly intended scope.

18

difference is place of manufacture of the goods.

19

Quality King involved U.S. manufactured goods; this case

20

involves goods made in Switzerland.

Both cases involve arguments that

The only

According to the Ninth Circuit in Omega,

21
22

Congress intended to treat foreign manufactured goods

23

better in this respect than goods made in the United

24

States.

25

such intent.

It is wildly implausible that Congress had any

From 1790 to 1891, foreigners were

2

categorically ineligible to hold U.S. copyrights.

From

3

1891 to 1986, the United States discriminated against

4

foreign manufacturing of copyrighted goods through a

5

series of so-called manufacturing clauses, including

6

section 601 of the 1976 Act.

8

foreign manufacturing at the same time, one would expect

some note to be taken of that fact in the legislative

11

that Congress in 1976 altered the long-established first

12

sale doctrine to make it uniquely favorable to foreign

manufacturing of copyrighted goods and did so through

14

the obscure phrase, "lawfully made under this title," in

15

section 109.

And yet the Ninth Circuit held

20

Act, and they never mean what the Ninth Circuit said

21

they mean in section 109.

22

Moreover, the words "lawfully made

Most instructive is the very next section

23

after section 109, section 110, which governs

24

educational use of copyrighted works and was enacted

25

contemporaneously with 109.

In describing the kinds of

2

without fear of copyright liability, Congress referred

3

to works lawfully made under this title.

4

have pointed out the absurdity of construing the phrase

5

in section 110 to mean made in the United States, and

6

it's very revealing how Respondent and its amici have

7

tried to answer that point.
Omega says "lawfully made under this title"

distribution rights but retains U.S. rights, that the

22

importation.

23

25

MR. ENGLERT:

If it grants exclusive foreign

distribution.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why does it matter?

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Because your blue brief says that "lawfully made" means

2

anything that was made with Omega's consent or

3

authority.

So why the difference at all?
MR. ENGLERT:

4

It matters, Your Honor,

5

because of the underlying rationale of the first sale

6

doctrine and the underlying rationale of the import ban

7

in section 602.

8

The purpose of the first sale doctrine is to

9

make sure that the copyright owner gets one and only one

10

recompense for each copy, for each lawfully made copy.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

So if he sells his

12

rights to a foreign manufacturer and distributor, he

gets paid for those rights.

in Quality King?
MR. ENGLERT:

Oh.

The Quality King has a

3

paragraph, much discussed in the briefs, which cites to

4

the legislative history of section 602 and in

5

particular, cites to witness statements that are in the

6

committee prints that are part of the legislative

7

history of section 602.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So do you think that

there is a difference between assigning a copyright to a

10

foreign entity or merely licensing a foreign entity?

11

One of the criticisms of your approach is that you would

12

draw a line between those two.

13
14
15

MR. ENGLERT:

We don't draw a line between

those two, Your Honor.
The line is -- depends on whether the

16

copyright owner has given exclusive foreign rights to

17

someone else.

18

foreign rights matters is because that is the example

19

given in the legislative history of 602 and in the

20

paragraph in Quality King.

21

And the reason the exclusivity of the

And to give meaning to section 602 and to be

22

completely consistent with the rationale of the first

23

sale doctrine, one must draw some line.

24

between the U.S. manufacturer and the foreign

25

manufacturer makes no sense.

Drawing a line

It's not consistent with

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

the purposes of anything.
Drawing a line between the exclusive grant

3

of rights, whether by license or assignment to a foreign

4

manufacturer -- or a foreign distributor, rather, and

5

not granting such exclusive rights is perfectly

6

consistent with the rationale -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are talking about the

8

first sale doctrine.

The perfectly consistent rationale

9

would be whether there is a first sale.

So -- so 109,

10

though it doesn't say it, but if you look at the history

11

and title, there has to be a transfer.

12

So in fact, if a British publisher with a

13

British right given by an American author or publisher

14

makes this, 109 doesn't apply -- I mean, 109 doesn't

15

apply until there's a sale.

16

Now, that makes -- you -- you haven't

17

adopted that.

19

sensible and I find no authority against it.

The first sale doctrine has always

It meant that in 1792, when I took Phil

Arita's antitrust course, and he used to bring it up.

6

You go back to the 18th century.

everything, and there is just no problem?

It's always meant
So why don't we

Now, I raise that not because -- I raise it

10
11

because since there's only a few people really

12

supporting this, there must be some problem with what I

13

say.

So what is it?
MR. ENGLERT:

14

Well, the issue, Your Honor -­

15

and you're putting me in a position of arguing against

16

myself a little bit, but the issue is a fair reading of

17

the legislative history of section 602 -- not the text,

18

but the legislative history -- is that Congress did

19

intend to allow certain blocking of imported goods when

20

there had been -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, if you say there

MR. ENGLERT:

Okay, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, no, I'm putting

3

that to you, because since you haven't advocated it, I

4

must be missing something, and I'm not an expert in

5

copyright law.

What am I missing?

MR. ENGLERT:

6

Well, there is a dictum in

7

this Court's opinion in Quality King that suggests that

8

if a publisher and a -- an American publisher gives

9

exclusive rights to a British publisher, if an American

10

author or a British author gives exclusive territorial

11

rights to two different publishers, then 602 retains

12

meaning in that -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

Exactly, and that's what

14

it does under my theory, because there has been no first

15

sale.

16

MR. ENGLERT:

No, but -- with respect, Your

17

Honor, it's my understanding of both the legislative

18

history and this Court's dictum that they refer to

19

second and subsequent sales.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, you mean you are

21

talking about jobbers?

Somebody goes and buys, and so

22

they're -- and so then you lose, because if that's what

23

we are supposed to follow, those excerpts in the

24

legislative history, then it would mean that a person

25

who buys from the British publisher cannot import into
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the United States because 109 doesn't apply.
MR. ENGLERT:

2

No, that's not what the

3

example means.

It doesn't say categorically all second

4

sales from British publishers are not subject to the

5

first sale doctrine.

6

which rights have been divided and exclusive territorial

7

rights have been given in two different countries, or to

8

put it in copyright language, in the language you also

9

used in the legislative history, when the copyright

What it says is in a situation in

11

the '76 act, the Copyright Act, the copyrights became

divisible.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where do you get that in

the text?

Go back to 1792.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

I didn't think

Mr. Englert, also talk

13

about what, if anything, 602(a)(1) does, then.

14

602(a)(2) is dealing with infringing goods, with pirated

15

goods.

16

it, what does 602(a)(1) protect?

17

It seems

So given the first sale doctrine as you construe

MR. ENGLERT:

602(a)(1) is limited to

18

imports and doesn't confer a private right of action.

19

602(a)(2), which was enacted after the Ninth Circuit

20

ruled in this case, adds a private right of action and

21

adds exports.

22

It was not part of the 1976 Copyright Act.

23

is a subsection in which Congress expanded on what was

24

already prohibited in 602(a)(1).

25

But it is -- 602(a)(2) is a new statute.
So it -- it

Now, with respect to text, the text that the

Court is construing is five words, "lawfully made under

3

places in the Copyright Act, including section 110, "for

4

educational use."

5

under this title" can mean two different things in

6

section 109 and section 110, provisions of the same

7

chapter of the Copyright Act enacted contemporaneously.

8

As a fallback position, the government says

9

And those five words are used several

20

unintended consequence."

21

is no evidence that such liability has ever been

22

imposed, but that argument misses the point.

law clause, which means:

Lawfully made according to

In that respect, this case is no different from

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

You don't really mean -­

11

your position is that "lawfully made under this title"

MR. ENGLERT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that

Yes.
Okay.

But there is another

provision of the statute -- I forget where it is -­

MR. ENGLERT:

Not quite, Your Honor.

11

with the language Congress enacted, but it is language

12

that Congress uses at least four different places in the

13

Copyright Act, and we have a pretty good idea that it

14

doesn't mean "made in the United States" and it doesn't

15

mean what Omega says it means, which is "made in the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we are left

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, Your Honor, as you know,

24

there is no reference in the legislative history to the

25

interaction between 602(a) and 109, and therefore, this
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court had to address that question for the first time in

2

Quality King, and the Court rejected the argument that

3

109 is inapplicable to imported goods altogether.

4

The Court did say in a dictum which has been

5

discussed already this morning that if a British and an

6

American publisher divide rights, then section 602(a)

7

does have a role to play.

8

books manufactured in Britain are not subject to the

9

first sale doctrine.

10

But the Court did not say

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was a concurring

opinion that says -- that said this case is about a

13

MR. ENGLERT:

Correct, and the concurring

opinion cited two distinguished copyright treatises that

suggested there was some concern about

extraterritoriality in this case.

extraterritoriality in this case, so the rationale of

those treatises, learned though they are, is undermined.

Well, even the

If one looks more closely at those

21

treatises, they argue the language is so plain that it

22

can only be construed one way.

23

that's not true.

24

I've already said, and they argue that this court's

25

dictum in Quality King -- the later additions to those

The government concedes

They argue extraterritoriality, as

16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

treatises argue that this Court's dictum in Quality King

2

drew a distinction based on place of manufacture, but

3

it's only the concurring opinion, not the dictum in the

4

court's opinion that mentions place of manufacture.

5

it's a vert thin reed to say that the case turned on

6

place of manufacture.

7

in the Quality King dictum, nothing in the legislative

8

history of 602, nothing in the legislative history of

9

109 that talks about place of manufacture.

11

And again, one can find nothing

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

So

And nothing in the text

that supports your position.
MR. ENGLERT:

12

No.

What supports our

13

position, Your Honor, is the text of 109, the use of the

14

phrase "lawfully made under this title," and the use of

15

that phrase "elsewhere in the Copyright Act."
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

You pulled out of the sky

necessarily broad reach, and we have tried to

accommodate the legislative history and the dictum in

Let me write that down.

Justice Breyer, we do know

23

that section 602(a) has some role to play.

24

this Court was trying to figure out in Quality King what

25

role it had to play it did look to the statements of

3

that the Court said in dicta presumably reflected

4

congressional intent, and so I am relying on those

5

statements for the limitation of section 109 to

6

accommodate section 602.

And those are the statements

7

But again, if the Court disagrees with me

8

and wants to give less of a role to 602 and more of a

9

role to section 109, that is, of course, further

10

assistance to my position.
I would like to reserve the balance of my

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. PANNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section -- section 602(a)(1) allows the

21

distribution of foreign-made copies abroad without the

22

U.S. copyright holder forfeiting the exclusive right to

23

distribute copies domestically, which is guaranteed by

24

section 106(3), and that provision applies in this case.

25

And unlike in Quality King, section 109(a) provides

Costco with no defense because the copies at issue were

2

not lawfully made under this title.

3

of the copies was not subject to or governed by U.S.

4

copyright law.

That is, the making

The decision of the court of appeals should

5
6

not be affirmed for three basic reasons, and the first

7

depends on the plain language of section 109(a), which

8

applies only to copies that were lawfully made under

9

this title.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11

What do you say "made"

means?
MR. PANNER:

12

Well, "made" certainly includes

13

the creation of the physical copy.

It also includes the

14

addition of any necessary intellectual property rights

15

that would permit distribution in the United States.

16

So that is to say that we understand section

17

109(a) should be read to reach a situation in which copy

18

has been subject to an authorized sale in the United

19

States.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

See, I'm with you, and I

21

think you -- the text supports you up to the point where

22

you add the qualification.

23

qualification, I think you're -- you're outside the

24

text, just as Costco is outside the text with the

25

qualification that they had.

But once you've added that

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PANNER:

I don't think so, Your Honor,

2

and let me try to explain why.

Section 202 of the Act

3

draws a -- a distinction between the material object and

4

the intellectual property rights that are involved in

5

the copyright.

6

not -- does not correspond to the word "reproduced" in

7

section 106(1).

8

to the addition of these necessary intellectual property

9

rights.

And it makes sense.

The word "made" is

It's a broader term that can also refer

10

And the -- what is, I think, important is

11

the decision whether the copy was lawfully made under

12

this title will, of course, be made at the time of the

13

sale.

14

at the time of -- of manufacture, because the question

15

is:

16

apply to that particular copy?

17

It is not -- the decision doesn't need to be made

How should section 109(a) or another provision

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in their brief, the

18

brief for the National Library Association indicates at

19

the bottom -- the American Library Association indicates

20

at the bottom of page 38 that "made" might mean cause to

21

exist, cause to appear, and so that it applies the first

22

time that U.S. copyright law lawfully could apply; so

23

that if you lawfully import it into the United States,

24

it would then apply at that time.

25

MR. PANNER:

Well, I think that that
23

probably gets us to pretty much the same place,

2

Justice Kennedy.

3
4
5

I think the point is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it makes the exemption

work, then, too.
MR. PANNER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

6

And the -- that also gives effect to the language of

7

602(a)(1), because section 602(a)(1) is actually written

8

in a very broad term.

9

that have been acquired outside of the United States.

It's written to apply to copies
I

10

think -- that is, I think, an answer, Justice Breyer, to

11

your objection that any sort of sale ought to suffice.

12

Section 602(a)(1) is designed to permit a

13

U.S. copyright owner to exclude legitimate copies, and

14

if you ask where Congress said that, it's right in the

15

House Committee report, in the legislative history.

16
17

JUSTICE BREYER:

And it can.

It can exclude

legitimate copies before there's a first sale.

18

MR. PANNER:

But the -­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the -- the -­

20

question is -- I mean, the text seems to say 602 expands

21

or falls within 106.

22

All right?

So that's what it says.

It says -- it says

23

it's an infringement of the exclusive right to

24

distribute copies.

25

That's the 106 right.

MR. PANNER:

That's correct.

from 602.

And then 109 is an

So it's automatically an exception

4

MR. PANNER:

And I think -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, that's the text.

And

6

therefore, you are back at what the meaning of 109 is,

7

if I understand your argument.

8

that's the choice.

9

literally, then everything that comes into the United

10

States can't, without the permission of the copyright

11

holder, but for the exception in (a)(3), and a library

12

that brings them in under (a)(3) cannot even lend out

13

the books.

And it seems to me

If you are going to take 109

That's one choice.
And the other choice is to say that

14
15

"lawfully made" means it's made without contravening any

16

provision of the Act, if the Act were applicable.

17

MR. PANNER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

Well, Your Honor -­
What's a third choice?

Maybe you want a third choice.

Well, a small qualification,

pursuant to that section.

purposes.

25

The exception in section 602(a)(3) does

It's for archival or lending

But in any event, I think that that's -- I
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't want to get caught up on the small point.

The

2

more significant point is that section 602(a)(1) is

3

designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner -- as Costco

4

admits, it's designed to permit a U.S. copyright owner

5

to exclude legitimate copies that are made overseas.
If the only issue were one of contract,

6
7

there would be no need for section 602(a)(1) because

8

there would be no need to create a copyright remedy

9

where contractual remedies are sufficient; that is, in

10

circumstances where there is privity between the U.S.

11

copyright owner or the U.S. copyright owner's direct

12

party and the foreign copyright owner.
JUSTICE BREYER:

13

That's why I started with

14

the first sale doctrine, because if you apply the first

15

sale doctrine as it traditionally has been applied and

16

if you believe that 109 incorporates that, there is

17

loads of room for 602(a)(1) to act.

18

instances where the British publisher published -- makes

19

the book.

20

try to send it to the United States and they can't

21

without permission because of 602(a)(1), and then 109

22

doesn't come into play because there's been no first

23

sale.

24

hardest, because, literally, 109(a) -- as you correctly

25

point out, 109 doesn't say that literally.

That's all the

What they do is they have a license and they

That's the part of this case that I'm finding the

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, section

2

602(a)(1) refers specifically to copies that have been

3

acquired outside of the United States.

4

make sense to say that it's limited to the publisher,

5

because the publisher hasn't acquired the copies.

6

has produced the copies.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. PANNER:

9

So it does not

It

That's all right.

So I think that the difficulty

with Costco's reading, by contrast -- and I think that

10

some of the Court's questions brought that out this

11

morning -- is that either they -- Costco's reading tends

12

to eliminate any practical effect for section 602(a)(1)

13

by making it not apply to legitimate copies or it makes

14

substantive rights turn on formalities of title, which

15

is quite inconsistent with the structure of the

16

Copyright Act, which actually goes out of its way to

17

make clear that the nature of the rights that are held

18

by the copyright owner, which is defined to mean the

19

owner of any of the many rights that comprise the

20

copyright, are the same regardless of whether there's

21

been a transfer.

22

And so when Costco says, for example, that

23

Omega would have the right to exclude foreign-made

24

copies that were produced by a transferee, but cannot do

25

so if it manufactures the copy abroad itself, it really
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

draws a distinction that has absolutely no basis in the

2

text of the Copyright Act and that would make

3

substantive rights, the value of the rights under

4

602(a)(1) and 106(3), turn on formalities and, again,

5

transfers that really should make no difference in terms

6

of the substantive rights that are available to the

7

copyright owner.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me -- why

didn't they say -- instead of "lawfully made under this

MR. PANNER:

16

Well, Your Honor -­

That is not our position, Your

17

Honor.

Our position is that "lawfully made under this

18

title" would include a copy that was manufactured in the

19

United States, but that it is not so limited, and that

20

if you look at section 1(e) of our brief, we discuss the

21

fact that an interpretation of "lawfully made under this

22

title" to include a copy that includes the necessary

23

licenses for distribution in the United States is a

24

consistent reading -- is consistent with the language of

25

that provision and gives -- and is consistent with the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

traditional understanding that section 109(a) is

2

intended to reflect an exhaustion principle.
So where a U.S. copyright owner has

3
4

exhausted rights with respect to a particular copy by

5

having been compensated for a right that has been

6

invested into that copy, that can be included in the

7

making.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's just not in the

I mean, like the other side, in order to make

10

your theory of the text appear reasonable, you have to

11

bring in a skyhook with a limitation that finds no basis

12

in the text.

13

MR. PANNER:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

14

Again, there is -- because the textual evidence is that

15

there is a distinction between reproduction, which is

16

the narrow term used in section 106(1), and the broader

17

term that is used in section 109(a), which is "made" -­

18

and again, that inquiry is always going to occur at the

19

time of the challenged sale in the United States.

20

And so the question is as to that topic.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Then you are trying to

22

rewrite Quality King.

23

entire premise of Quality King is wrong.

in Quality King, what the Court held was that a copy

this title.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

you see anything Quality King turning on where the goods

5

were made?

6

MR. PANNER:

Well, Your Honor, the reason -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I read the decision and

8

it barely mentions that, if at all.

9

was on what the owner did:

10

Its whole premise

Did the owner sell this

copy?
MR. PANNER:

11

I don't think so, Your Honor.

12

What -- there was no challenge in Quality King to the

13

idea that the copy was lawfully made under this title,

14

precisely because the copy was made in the United States

15

where the Copyright Act governs.
This Court said in our Descani case that the

16
17

natural reading under this title is subject to or

18

governed by this title, and therefore it is a perfectly

19

straightforward reading of the text.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21

But you don't say that.

I

mean, you bring in this other qualification.
MR. PANNER:

22

But Your Honor, again, the

23

distinction is between the question whether -- what the

24

conduct that is being addressed is simply the

That's the case here.

exercise of the exclusive right that the copyright

that that copy is lawfully made under this title,

that is why it makes perfect sense to say -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So you are saying -­

14

you are saying that whether or not it's lawfully made

15

depends on something that happens after it's made?

16

MR. PANNER:

In a particular case, it might

17

be, Your Honor, but in the typical case -- let's say the

18

Heartland case -- if a manufacturer has a license under

19

U.S. copyright to distribute in the United States, it

20

could be lawfully made at that time.

21

But I think, Justice Alito, you were going

22

to ask a question about how often the situation arises,

23

and I think it's important to point out that there is no

24

case that Costco has pointed to, and we are not aware of

25

them, where a U.S. copyright owner has sought to
32

then the right for a lawful owner to resell it.

that's consistent with the language of "made" and it

gives proper effect both to section 602(a)(1), which is

16

clearly intended to allow the owner of the U.S.

it says -- and -- and -- and it emphasized that to

is what matters.

to say anything about that?

25

MR. PANNER:

Do you want

It was on the other side.

Well, I think that the -­
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the -- the tracing of the language is -- is helpful,

2

actually, to understand how section -- the current

3

section 60 -- excuse me current section 109(a) differs

4

from section 27, which is, in section 27, what happened

5

was is that Congress codified in 1909 the idea that the

6

material object is different from the copyright.

7

when it did that, it added that language as a tag-on to

8

that principle to ensure that it did not end up

9

overruling legislatively Bobbs-Merrill.

And

10

And when the -- when the Congress recodified

11

the provision in 1976, it actually took section 202, put

12

it separately, and it -- it codified 109(a) in a way

13

that is significantly different and then it says

14

notwithstanding the rights under 106(3) the owner of a

15

copy lawfully made under this title is entitled to

16

resell it.

17

And that needs to then be read in harmony

18

with section 602(a)(1), which after all, was part of the

19

same act in 1976, it must be read in such a way as to

20

give section rule 602(a)(1) sufficient room to perform

21

the function that it was intended to perform, which is

22

to ensure that a U.S. copyright owner could protect

23

domestic distribution rights against competition from

24

legitimate foreign copies.

precisely what's at issue here.

And that's what it -- that's

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART,

4
5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MR. STEWART:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If the government's interpretation of

9
10

section 109(a) is a little bit different from either of

11

the parties, since I want to make clear precisely what

12

it is, in our view, the words "lawfully made under this

13

title" mean made subject to and in accordance with Title

14

17.

15

in order for a copy to be made subject to Title 17, it

16

would have to be created in the United States.

17

And because the Copyright Act doesn't apply abroad,

Now, I think our interpretation of the

18

statute still gives it a slightly different meaning from

19

the alternative "lawfully made in the United States,"

20

because at least in theory, it would be possible for the

21

creation of a copy to entail a violation of

22

environmental laws, workplace safety laws, minimum wage

23

laws, et cetera.

24

characterize a copy made in that way as lawfully made in

25

the United States, but it would be made -- it would be

And it wouldn't be accurate to

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lawfully made under this title, because it would be made

2

subject to and in a manner consistent with the

3

requirements of the Copyright Act.
Now, with respect to the types of copyright

4
5

materials at issue here, the watches are clearly very

6

different from what Congress had in mind when it enacted

7

section 602(a)(1).

8

was trying to do in this case was exactly what Congress

9

intended to allow when it expanded the importation

But in other respects, what Omega

10

provisions beyond restrictions on importation of radical

11

copies.

12

segment markets either to give -- either retain for

13

itself or to give to another entity exclusive rights

14

within the United States, but give other rights abroad

15

to other producers.

16

The ideal was to allow a copyright owner to

And consequently, we argued in Quality King

17

and we are arguing here that the Court should construe

18

section 109(a) in a way that doesn't prevent section

19

602(a) from performing that function.

20

And the Court in Quality King grappled with

21

the question of whether applying the -- section 109(a)

22

to the labels that were at issue in that case would have

23

the effect of negating 602(a)(1) and the Court said no

24

it wouldn't, because section 109(a) applies only to

25

copies that are lawfully made under this title.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court specially said it wouldn't apply to copies that

2

were made -- lawfully made under the law of the foreign

3

country.
Now, the Court didn't refer specifically to

4
5

the place of manufacture.

In giving the example of the

6

British publisher who would be creating copies under the

7

law of Great Britain, it didn't specifically say that's

8

because British law would apply when the copies are made

9

in England.

But I think that's the necessary inference,

10

because the Court's analysis made quite clear that it

11

viewed a particular copy as being lawfully made under

12

the law of one and only one question -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is your answer to

14

the argument that if "lawfully made under this title"

15

means basically made in the United States, that provides

16

a great incentive to manufacture goods abroad and that

17

can't possibly be what Congress intended?

18

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think there are -- I

19

think we would say a couple of things.

The question has

20

been raised whether this gives favored status to a

21

foreign manufactured goods.

22

reading -- from -- from the perspective of the copyright

23

owner, it's true, that this creates something of

24

potential incentive to manufacture abroad.

25

the perspective of the potential importer, you could say

And in one sense our

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, from

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this makes foreign manufactured goods disfavored because

2

they were harder to get into the country than would be

3

the case if they had been manufactured within the United

4

States and had then been sent abroad and -- and

5

reimported.
I guess the best we can say about the

6
7

treatment from the copyright owners' prospective, the

8

differential treatment of foreign and domestic

9

manufactured goods is that at least with respect to

10

goods that were made within the United States, the

11

copyright owner has exercised rights under United States

12

law.

13

produce the copies in the first instance, whereas the

14

manufacturer in Omega's position by creating and then

15

selling the watches abroad, never exercised any of its

16

Title 17 rights.

He has -- it has exercised its exclusive right to

17

And the theory underlying the first sale

18

doctrine tracing it back to -- to Bobbs-Merrill, the

19

first articulation by this Court of the -- the doctrine

20

of the copyright context, the theory is that a copyright

21

owner who sells the goods, places them in the stream of

22

commerce, has exercised, as the Court put it in

23

Bobbs-Merrill, its exclusive right to vend, and

24

therefore it can claim no more rights under the

25

copyright laws.
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Omega with respect to the

2

watches at issue here, never exercised any its rights

3

under title 17, not -- not when the watches were made

4

and not when they were sold.
I do also want to address the question of

5
6

what happens in the circumstance where Omega

7

manufactures watches abroad, but then voluntarily

8

imports them into the United States, sells them here;

9

can it place restrictions on resale because I think it's

10

an important policy question and here again we get to

11

the same point in the end as the Respondents do, but we

12

have a somewhat different textual route to get there.
Our view is that in that circumstance

13
14

section 109(a) still would not apply, because even

15

though the goods were imported into the United States,

16

they were made abroad, and that's what counts for

17

determining whether they were lawfully made under this

18

title.

19

doesn't prohibit anything.

20

conduct falls within these contours then what you are

21

doing is legal, whether or not it would otherwise

22

violate the copyright act.

23

But section 109(a) is simply a safe harbor.

It

Section 109(a) says if your

But if there is a dispute as to whether

24

section 109(a) applies, and a court held that it

25

doesn't, the consequence is not necessarily that the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

conduct is unlawful.

The consequence is that you look

2

to other provisions of title 17 to see whether it is

3

lawful or not.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Well, in your example, if

5

there is a lawful importation of the foreign-made good,

6

then if you interpret "made" as causing to exist of

7

appear or under these laws, as the library brief

8

suggests, the first sale doctrine would operate.
MR. STEWART:

9

I think we would say the first

10

sale doctrine as articulated in Bobbs-Merrill would

11

operate, but we wouldn't place this within section

12

109(a).

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's the

14

problem I have with your position.

You are suddenly

15

saying a copyright -- these issues have to be resolved

16

not within the confines of the Copyright Act, but then

17

you have to look to -- to common law as well, which is a

18

very confused situation.

19

MR. STEWART:

I think we would still be

20

looking to other provisions of the Copyright Act rather

21

than to common law.

22

describe, clearly there could be no violation of

23

602(a)(1), because the copies would have been imported

24

by Omega itself.

25

them within the United States and the buyer attempts to

That is, in the hypothetical I

And so the question is if Omega sells

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

resell them, would that be an infringement of Omega 17's

2

rights?

3

that -- Omega could plausibly make in that circumstance

4

would be to say, that is a violation of my exclusive

5

right to distribute copies to the public protected by

6

section 106(3).

And the only claim that Omega could -- I mean

7

And I think the response would be under

8

Bobbs-Merrill, the Court already held that once the

9

copyright owner exercised its exclusive right to vend -­

10

the word which appeared at the statute at the time -­

11

once it had exercised its exclusive right to vend the

12

copies, it was done with them and had no more rights to

13

assert.

14

And there is no reason to give the right to

15

vend -- the right to distribute under the current law a

16

broader reading than the right to vend had at that time,

17

simply because Congress has enacted section 109.

18

And -- so I think that the -- it would still

19

be the case that in order to prevail in a copyright

20

suit, Omega would have to show that not only that

21

section 109 was inapplicable, but there was a violation

22

of the exclusive rights and I don't think it would be

23

able to do that here.

24
25

Now in Bobbs-Merrill, the Court was
certainly drawing on common law principles but it said
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in the end, its words:

2

of statutory interpretation."

3

holding on the language of the Copyright Act as it

4

existed at that time, specifically the exclusive right

5

to vend; and the exclusive right to distribute copies to

6

the public is no different for these purposes under the

7

current statute.
JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9

"This is exclusively a question
It -- it based its

I found the brief I was

looking for which is the American Intellectual Property

10

Law Association.

11

Nimmer's 1965 letter, and they say that the point there

12

was that they were reading Bobbs-Merrill as it was a

13

pre-emption question, that they thought that the

14

copyright law was not pre-empting State law of contract,

15

and State law of contract had the exception in it which

16

applied the first sale doctrine.

17

reasoning, that reasoning would seem to me to apply.

18

could look up what the State law is, but my guess is

19

that the first sale doctrine applies just as much to

20

goods that come from abroad as to goods that are here at

21

home.

22

And they trace this back to Professor

MR. STEWART:

Now if that's the
We

I -- I think with -- with

23

respect to the pre-emption question, what they had in

24

mind was a situation in which Omega sells the watch to a

25

reseller -- to a retailer on condition, for instance,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the retailer only sell them in a particular way, or

2

do particular types of advertising, and the reseller

3

sells them in violation.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What Nimmer said is, he

5

said we want to be sure in his -- in bill back in '64,

6

'65 -- not to invalidate any State law contractual

7

restriction on the right of the owner of the particular

8

copy to dispose, exhibit, et cetera the same.

9

MR. STEWART:

Exactly.

I think the language

10

was chosen in part at least to make clear that although

11

Omega under in that hypothetical circumstance would have

12

no remedy under the Copyright Act, it might potentially

13

have a breach of contract suit against the retailer if

14

the retailer had breached the agreement with Omega, and

15

that nothing was -- in the Federal law was intended to

16

preempt the State law contractual remedies that would

17

otherwise be available.

18

adequately accomplishes that purpose.

And I think the language

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROY T. ENGLERT, JR.,

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. ENGLERT:

13

Justice Ginsberg asked Mr. Panner what

Thank you, Your Honor.

14

policy Congress could have had in mind to give this

15

different status to foreign-made goods than to U.S. made

16

goods, and Mr. Panner's answer, and Mr. Stewart said

17

something similar, was that in one respect Congress is

18

disfavoring foreign goods under their interpretation by

19

making them harder to import.

20

That's not true.

Under both of their theories, as long as the

21

manufacturer chooses to authorize importation, which is

22

Omega's test, or as long as an authorized first sale

23

takes place in the United States, then the first sale

doctrine does apply.

25

control under their theory and it's not harder to import

So the copyright holder has

Alderson Reporting Company

the goods.
In the briefs in this case you will not find

2
3

anyone making any policy argument as to what Congress

4

could have had in mind to favor foreign-manufactured

5

goods.

6

The heart of Mr. Panner's argument was that

7

Costco's position either eliminates any significant role

8

for section 602(a)(1) or makes section 602(a)(1) turn on

9

formalities of transfer of title.

Neither of those

10

propositions is true.

11

addressed the role that section 602(a)(1) has to play if

12

section 109 is applicable to imported goods, and the

13

answer was it still applies to nonowners.

14

Court's first answer.

15

This Court in Quality King

That was the

The dictum that has been much discussed this

16

morning was another answer but the Court's first answer

17

was that it still applies to nonowners, and because, for

18

example, software is licensed there is a very live issue

19

about whether the first sale doctrine applies to

20

lawfully acquired copies of -- of software.

21

602(a)(1) has a role to play under anyone's

22

interpretation.

23

So

Now Mr. Panner asserts that our answers to

24

some of the questions that the Court has asked in our

25

efforts to harmonize our position with the dictum in

Alderson Reporting Company

1

2

transfer of title.

3

criticized and has been criticized this morning not for

4

having a textual basis, but it cannot be criticized for

5

making anything turn on formalities.

6

Our position can perhaps be

Our position turns on the economic realities

7

of the situation.

If the copyright owner gets its one

8

reward, the first sale doctrine applies; if the

9

copyright owner doesn't get its run reward, because for

10

example it has given the exclusive foreign manufacturing

11

rights to someone else, and retained or assigned or

12

licensed the exclusive U.S. manufacturing rights, then

13

602(a)(1) has a role to play.

14

Panner's criticisms of our position is correct.

15

So neither of Mr.

Mr. Panner asserted that section 109(a)

16

differs from section 27, the predecessor statute in the

17

1947 Act, which in turn was Section 41 of the 1909 Act.

18

This Court said the exact opposite in Quality King.

19

It said there is no evidence of any attempt

20

to narrow the first sale doctrine through the language

21

of section 109(a).

22

report -- again, getting into legislative history, which

23

some members of the Court do not like to get into -- but

24

if one looks at the House report, the first sentence of

25

the relevant part of the House report is section 109(a)

And if one looks at the House

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

restates and confirms the principle that where the

2

copyright owner has transferred ownership of a

3

particular copy or phonorecord of a work, the person to

4

whom the copy or phonorecord is transferred is entitled

5

to dispose of it by sale, rental or other means.

6

hint that using "lawfully made" under this title to

7

narrow the doctrine.
The last sentence of the relevant part of

8

No

the House report:

To come within the scope of section

10

109(a) a copy or phonorecord must have been lawfully

11

made under this title though not necessarily with the

12

copyright owner's authorization.

13

resale of an illegally pirated phonorecord would be an

14

infringement, but the disposition of a phonorecord

15

legally made under the compulsory licensing provisions

16

of section 115, would not.

For example, any

So what does the House report on section 109

17
18

tell us?

It tells us that lawfully made under this

19

title was intended to expand the category of covered

20

works beyond just those made by the copyright owner, or

21

with the authorization of the copyright owner.

22

under Omega's and the government's position, that phrase

23

is used to contract the scope of the first sale doctrine

24

in derogation of the common law, imposing a restraint on

25

alienation for foreign-made goods that is not imposed on
