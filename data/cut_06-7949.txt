CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first today in Case 06-7949, Gall v. United States.
Mr. Green.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. GREEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When Judge Robert W. Pratt of the Southern

11

District of Iowa sentenced Brian Michael Gall on May 27,

12

2005, he found Mr. Gall to be an individual who had

13

fully rehabilitated himself by having voluntarily

14

withdrawn from a conspiracy five years earlier, by

15

remaining crime-free throughout that period, by having

16

rid himself of his addictions, by having graduated from

17

college, by having learned a trade, by having built a

18

successful and thriving business.

19

Judge Pratt carefully weighed the Section

20

3553(a) factors and in a ten-page sentencing memorandum

21

set forth cogent reasons why a sentence of probation

22

would better fit the purposes and factors specified in

23

Section 3553(a) than a sentence of incarceration.

24
25

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
that judgment on the basis of the extraordinary
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circumstances test that we would ask the Court to

2

overturn today.

3

The Eighth Circuit substituted its judgment

4

for that of Judge Pratt, saying that Judge Pratt had

5

placed too much weight on Mr. Gall's voluntary

6

withdrawal from the conspiracy and in so doing had not

7

satisfied or overcome the extraordinariness barrier.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If it had been the other

way around and the district court had said what

10

appellate court said and the appellate court had said

11

what the district court said, what would you be arguing?

12
13

MR. GREEN:

would probably be arguing something of the reverse.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. GREEN:

16

Certainly, Justice Kennedy, I

It is -- it is an abuse of

discretion -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you can see the

18

systemic concern.

19

be the case that the district judge is the one to give

20

more leniency.

21

I mean, it's just not always going to

MR. GREEN:

Yes, that's certainly true, but

22

in this instance an abuse of discretion standard

23

applies.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought it was your

argument that if any rational judge could impose the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sentence that's imposed, then that sentence has to be

2

sustained.

3

court or the Eighth Circuit here was irrational?

4

So you're saying that either the district

MR. GREEN:

No.

I wouldn't say -- well, let

5

me -- the district court was certainly not irrational in

6

our view.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

But in answer to

8

Justice Kennedy's question, you hesitated in saying

9

that, if the district court had taken the approach of

10

the court of appeals, that would also have to be

11

sustained.

12

be unless you're going to argue -

13

MR. GREEN:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15
16

But under your analysis wouldn't it have to

Yes.
-- that that approach is

irrational?
MR. GREEN:

It would have to be.

I

17

hesitated because there -- there might be instances in

18

which, as indeed the government admits in its brief,

19

that the reasons and the facts and circumstances don't

20

logically cohere with the sentence that's given.

21

In other words, if all of the circumstances

22

and facts point a certain way -- in this instance, for

23

example, they point to a downward departure -- and

24

suddenly the judge goes up to the statutory max, that

25

might be an instance in which a court of appeals could
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

say no reasonable judge would have imposed that

2

sentence.

3

so.

4

There doesn't seem to be a reason for doing

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the Eighth

5

Circuit, laying aside the extraordinary circumstances

6

test, saying the judge, the sentencing judge gave credit

7

for his leaving the conspiracy, but he didn't blow the

8

whistle, so the conspiracy continued.

9

stopped the conspiracy.

10

He could have

And, similarly, yes, he rehabilitated

11

himself, but he earned some 30 to $40,000 in the drug

12

business, and that aided his rehabilitation, and maybe

13

there's some kind of obligation to pay back.

14

So could a court of appeals try to instruct

15

district judges and say:

16

conspiracy, we want district judges to be aware of the

17

difference between one who leaves and blows the whistle

18

and one who lets it continue; and, similarly, one who

19

uses the ill-gotten gains to set himself up in business.

20

MR. GREEN:

Now, in this factor, leaving a

Justice Ginsburg, when someone

21

leaves the conspiracy and blows the whistle, typically,

22

that individual is not charged.

23

Justice, for example, in its Antitrust Division says

24

that if a corporation or individual comes to it and

25

blows the whistle on, say, a price-fixing conspiracy,

The Department of

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that individual is never charged to begin with.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm sure

3

that's not always true.

4

vast conspiracy is the one who blows the whistle, I

5

suspect he may well be charged anyway.

6
7

I mean, if the leader of some

MR. GREEN:

That's true, Your Honor.

There

are instances in which -

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. GREEN:

Lex Luthor might.

Yes, but the point is that

11

blowing the whistle is -- is not only a voluntary

12

withdrawal, but also something so far beyond the bounds

13

of what prosecutors typically see that that individual,

14

typically or generally is the individual that receives

15

immunity or amnesty in the case.

16

To respond to the second part of your

17

question, with respect to the amount of money that

18

Mr. Gall made, he did not use it, and there's no

19

information in the record that indicates that he built

20

his business on the basis of the use of that money.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is no indication

22

that he gave it back, or there was no fine attached to

23

it.

24
25

MR. GREEN:

No, there was not, and in part

because, as the sealed volume of the appendix
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

demonstrates, Mr. Gall did not at that point have money

2

to pay a fine.

3

Remember that he was -- he left the

4

conspiracy in September of 2000.

He was not approached

5

by agents until late 2003.

6

2004 and was not sentenced until 2005.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He was not charged until

Well, you don't -- you

8

don't have to answer all of these things for your case,

9

do you?

10

MR. GREEN:

No.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not saying that a

12

reasonable person couldn't have found the opposite.

13

You're just saying that a reasonable person could have

14

found what this district judge found.

15
16
17

MR. GREEN:

That's exactly right, Justice

Scalia.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why don't you just

18

swallow all these things and say, yeah, I suppose the

19

court of appeals could say that, but -

20

MR. GREEN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. GREEN:

23

I -- I -- but my point stands?

Yeah, well, I'm happy to swallow

in that sense.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. GREEN:

There's no doubt about the fact
8


Alderson Reporting Company

1

--

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well then, what's

3

left of the appellate review?

4

is there any substantive review for the appellate court

5

or is it all just procedural under -- putting aside your

6

logical coherence point, which -

7

MR. GREEN:

I mean, under your theory

There is -- there isn't much

8

left besides the fact that it is abuse of discretion

9

review.

That there is no robust substantive component

10

to -- to reasonableness review of sentences, is really a

11

complaint about abuse of discretion review.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that's the problem.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In a typical abuse

14

of discretion review, you still have -- for example, if

15

you have a judge in -- well, let's say you have a judge;

16

in one case he says because this is a -- a young

17

defendant, I'm going to give him a lighter sentence; and

18

in the next case says, you know, I don't think age is a

19

factor that I should consider in the case; in the next

20

case he says it is and then not.

21

cases, I take it, are upheld under your view on

22

appellate review.

23
24
25

MR. GREEN:

Each -- all of those

Not necessarily.

I think if -

if a judge CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
9

Alderson Reporting Company

So there can be

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

substantive review for consideration of age?

2

MR. GREEN:

Not necessarily for

3

consideration of age, but a court of appeals could say

4

to -- to such a judge -- and I am sure that one of the

5

parties would point this out, would say you considered

6

it last time; you didn't consider it.

7

seesawing back and forth on this.

8

could say -

9
10

You've been

The court of appeals

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay, so at the same

time -

11

MR. GREEN: -- explain why -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you have two

13

district judges in the same courthouse and the one says,

14

when I have a young defendant I always -- I forget

15

whether the term is "vary" or "depart" -- but I always

16

go down, and the next judge says, I never consider age.

17

Those -- both of those are upheld under your view, I

18

take it?

19
20

MR. GREEN:

Yes, both -- both would be

upheld.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

22

MR GREEN:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, why -

If somebody said Why wouldn't the judge in,

24

as it were, the second case give some consideration, be

25

required under abuse review to give some consideration,
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to what is sort of the norm in that circuit so that he

2

doesn't stand out as either a "let-them-loose" judge or

3

a hanging judge?

4

require a broader view than simply the -- literally the

5

case before the court?

6

MR. GREEN:

7

Well, it does require a broader

view, and certainly a judge could -

8
9

Doesn't abuse of discretion at least

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And wouldn't there be at

least under the Chief Justices's hypothetical, wouldn't

10

there be a possibility of looking to those other cases

11

rather than just automatically affirming on -- on abuse

12

review?

13

MR. GREEN:

There would be.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MR. GREEN:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

And I was about to add Would the judge have to

17

consider the cases from the judge's district or from the

18

circuit or from the whole country?

19

MR. GREEN:

I would -- I would imagine a

20

judge would want to look at -- at cases from the whole

21

country.

22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't that exactly

--

24

MR. GREEN:

Certainly they have -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Isn't that exactly

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what the Sentencing Commission did in establishing the

2

Guidelines?

3

MR. GREEN:

It did in establishing the

4

Guidelines.

5

commissioners actually modified the guidelines on the

6

basis of what judges have actually done.

7
8
9
10

There are disputes about whether the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It looked at them.

It

didn't necessarily follow them.
MR. GREEN:

Exactly.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

With white collar crime,

11

for example, it went vastly higher than what had been

12

the practice.

13

MR. GREEN:

That's -- that's exactly right,

14

Justice Scalia.

15

which a judge might want to look through legal database,

16

for example, or even a blog or something like that, and

17

look and see -

18

So there is a component to this in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Going back to the Chief

19

Justice's hypothetical and the colloquy you had with him

20

with the hypothetical, the two different judges in the

21

statement district or the same circuit that treat age

22

differently, if the Congress saw that would the Congress

23

be able to say anything about that, do anything about

24

that to stop the disparity?

25

MR. GREEN:

Certainly.
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Consistently with the

Sixth Amendment?
MR. GREEN:

Certainly.

And one of our

4

responses, Justice Kennedy, to the issue of there not

5

being a robust component of substantiveness -- or -

6

excuse me -- of substantive review of sentences if that

7

Congress can fix that.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

MR. GREEN:

How?

If the unwarranted -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How can it fix the One question.

Why

12

couldn't, if there is some kind of substantive standard

13

of reasonableness, why couldn't a court of appeals in a

14

particular circuit say that -- if one judge relies on

15

age, 19, and the other judges do not, why couldn't the

16

court of appeals say that one of those two positions is

17

unreasonable?

18
19
20

MR. GREEN:
think it could that.

A court of appeals could, yes, I
They could ask an explanation.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There could be a common -

21

sort of a common law of reasonableness developed through

22

the public process?

23
24
25

MR. GREEN:

I think that's correct.

A

common law JUSTICE SCALIA:

And another circuit would

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

develop the opposite.

2

that 17 is unreasonable.

The other circuit would say

3

that 19 is unreasonable.

And we would have to sort out

4

all those things ultimately, right?

5
6
7
8
9

MR. GREEN:

I mean, this circuit would say

That's -- that's correct Your

Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

In kind of a sentencing

review court?
MR. GREEN:

Yes.

Yes, and that is -- that

10

is one danger of the extraordinary circumstances test.

11

In fact, there's two dangers in that -

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could Congress pass a

13

statute that says age is not relevant in sentencing

14

except in extraordinary circumstances?

15

violation of the Sixth Amendment?

16

MR. GREEN:

Would that be a

I believe that Congress could

17

pass such a statute, yes.

18

add that, to the extent that there is a constitutional

19

grounding for individualized sentencing and age is a key

20

factor with respect to individualized sentencing, I -- I

21

want to hesitate and I want to waver.

22

But -- but -- I hesitate to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not sure -

But you said -- you said

23

before that, and very definitely, that Congress could

24

fix the case of where one judge said, I'm always lenient

25

on 17-year-olds and the other said, I throw the book at
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

him.

You said yes, Congress could fix that.

2

other than in the way that Justice Alito just proposed?

3

MR. GREEN:

Well, how

Well, in response to that

4

question and your earlier question, Justice Ginsburg,

5

certainly Congress could, to fix the entire problem

6

here, could adopt the solution that we proposed in

7

Booker and in Fanfan that to say that -- that in order

8

to enhance a sentence at all, that has -- it has to be a

9

fact found by the jury, what's so-called Blakelyizing of

10

the Guidelines.

That's one way to do it.

11

Congress could also, as has been suggested

12

and I believe legislation has been introduced on this,

13

they could make the Guidelines essentially topless, so

14

that there -- so that there was complete -

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

If Congress can pass a

16

statute without violating the Sixth Amendment saying age

17

is ordinarily not relevant, then could Congress delegate

18

to an expert agency the authority to make that decision

19

without violating the Sixth Amendment?

20
21

MR. GREEN:

No, I don't think that it could.

Any time Congress -

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Based on what?

Why could it

23

-- why can't it delegate the authority if it can do it

24

itself?

25

MR. GREEN:

Well, it could delegate the
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority.

2

has said it's all right for Congress to delegate the

3

authority to the commission.

4

Alito, comes whenever we limit the statutory continuum

5

from zero to the statutory maximum sentence, if we

6

overlay a consideration.

7

circumstances test we make the Guidelines the benchmark

8

and we tether or we measure from the Guidelines, we have

9

then set a kind of statutory range.

10

There's no doubt about it.

And this Court

But the problem, Justice

If on the extraordinary

If Congress says to a commission, we want

11

you to develop a kind of mini-guideline based upon age,

12

we think that there might be departure in some

13

circumstances but not other circumstances, that might be

14

an instance where we are setting a kind of ceiling and a

15

floor and a range within the otherwise broader statutory

16

continuum.

17

That's CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Green, I

18

understood you to respond to Justice Souter's question

19

that courts of appeals could consider a broader range of

20

cases in deciding whether it's an abuse of discretion in

21

a particular case.

22

MR. GREEN:

Certainly.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, if they can

24

consider a broader range of cases, what's so bad about

25

suggesting that if a particular case is way out of what
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

their broad review shows, if the broad review shows that

2

in most cases this type of defendant gets 5 years and in

3

this particular case, the judge gave him 30 years or

4

gave him zero, what's wrong with suggesting that that is

5

a factor they should at least start with in saying

6

something's unusual about this case, we ought to take

7

closer look?

8
9

MR. GREEN:

In that instance, though, we run

into the problem that Justice Scalia identified and that

10

problem is we start to get limitations based upon

11

certain factors, and the courts of appeals -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well then, what's

13

the point of looking at the broad range of cases if they

14

can't do anything about it?

15

MR. GREEN:

To see whether -- the point is

16

to see whether or not the reasons that are offered in

17

those cases turn out to be valid, cogent -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is it right to

19

say if the broad range shows that most of these

20

defendants get a sentence of 10 years in jail and in

21

this case the person got probation, that the court

22

should look for some reasons to explain what the

23

difference, to justify the difference?

24
25

MR. GREEN:

Certainly the court should look

at the reasons and should look to see whether or not the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reasons are rationally grounded in Section 3553(a).

2

our position is once they are, that's -- that's the end

3

of the matter.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

Of course, all these

5

questions only -- only apply to departures downward from

6

the Guidelines, and if you ask the same question with

7

regard to departures upward you do run into

8

constitutional problems when the -- when courts of

9

appeals begin to establish certain facts that have to be

10

found in order to move upward or -- yes, certain facts

11

that justify moving upward.

12

So you end up with a quite skewered system

13

in which there is -- there is vigorous hearty review of

14

departures downward, but -- but very, very slight review

15

of departures upward.

16

MR. GREEN:

That -- that's correct, and

17

that's essentially the kind of system that we've got

18

now.

19

throughout the range of sentencing.

20

This is not a fulsome abuse of discretion review

What we have now is a -- on this

21

extraordinary circumstances test is a -- and this case

22

is a perfect example of substitution of judgment.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What in your view would

24

be -- would fail the abuse of discretion test?

25

have a sentence of -- what was the guideline range?
18
Alderson Reporting Company

If we

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MR. GREEN:

30 to 37 months, Justice

Ginsburg.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the judge gives no

4

prison time, three years probation.

5

to be -- describe what an abuse of discretion would be?

6

MR. GREEN:

What would it take

Well, there are a couple of

7

examples out there.

One, this case Poynter out of, out

8

of the Sixth Circuit, where the judge went all the way

9

up to the absolute statutory max in a child

10

pornography -- or rather, a child molestation case, on

11

the ground that, first, the statutory max will take care

12

of any unwarranted disparity.

13

really a cogent reason and that would be an abuse of

14

discretion.

15

That's not -- that's not

We have another case out of the -- recently

16

out of the Eleventh Circuit, Valdes, in which -- in

17

which the court departed upwards on the ground of the

18

fact that the check that had been written that -- the

19

fraudulent check that had been written, had been written

20

to the district court.

21

its own court had been -- or the neighboring court had

22

been duped.

23
24
25

And so the court was angry that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You think that's

unreasonable?
MR. GREEN:

I do think that's unreasonable,
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Your Honor.

Certainly that's not like the famous Yankees and Red Sox

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

You're saying

they can't disagree with the policy.

They can only -

Okay.

The yes part is -

The yes -- the yes part

is that -- that it is in accordance with the -- the

Isn't that what you are saying?

facts of this case that is crucial to the appropriate

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

Thank you.
Mr. Dreeben.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Appellate courts confronted with the task of

19

conducting reasonableness review need some benchmarks

20

for how to distinguish between sentences that are

21

outside the Guidelines and reasonable and sentences that

22

are outside the Guidelines and are not.

23

The question presented here is whether an

24

appellate court can reasonably decide that it should

25

take a harder look at a case that is significantly or
29
Alderson Reporting Company

extraordinarily outside the Guidelines and look to see

Here you have a

It could be couched in the number of levels
that the judge has JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you do not rely on a

percentage as kind of the magic basic test?

24

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I would say -

I think some of the courts

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

of appeals seem to.
MR. DREEBEN:

The courts of appeals have

3

generally relied on a "I know it when I see it" kind of

4

approach, which I think is reasonable in this area of

5

the law, because you see sentences that are simply out

6

of kilter with what the Guidelines range is, and it

7

raises a question in the court's mind, why?

8
9

If you saw a judge who said the Guidelines
range here is 30 to 37 months for petitioner and I'm

10

going to sentence him to 24 months and the judge gives

11

the same reasons as he gave here, no court of appeals is

12

going to think this requires a particularly hard look or

13

any greater justification than what the judge did.

14

court will understand that that's what abuse of

15

discretion review means in an advisory system.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The

What if -- what if the

17

sentencing judge simply disagrees with the Guidelines?

18

He just simply disagrees with the severity of the

that, isn't he?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He's free to do

He is, Justice Scalia.
And so long as that

23

disagreement is reasonable, so long as another

24

sentencing commission might indeed have imposed a lower

25

sentence -- for antitrust violations, if indeed all the
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal Courts before -- before the Guidelines came into

2

effect were rarely imposing any prison sentences, how

3

could you say it would be unreasonable for a district

4

judge to say, I simply agrees with what the

5

Guidelines -- with what the Sentencing Commission did,

6

and I agree with all of those sentencing courts before

7

then, which thought -- which thought only in a rare case

8

should there be jail time?

9

that that's unreasonable?

10

MR. DREEBEN:

How could you possibly say

Because, Justice Scalia, I

11

start with a fundamentally different concept of

12

reasonableness review than merely is it possible to

13

articulate a reasoned basis for sentencing the defendant

14

that way.

15

I start with the proposition that this Court

16

adopted reasonableness review in Booker as a means of

17

helping to achieve Congress's objective of increased

18

uniformity without attempting to attain the degree of

19

uniformity that had prevailed under the mandatory -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we also made it very

21

clear that the Guidelines are advisory, and there is -

22

there is no way to a maintain that with the -- with the

23

kind of approach that you're offering.

too much and you'll be called to account.

MR. DREEBEN:

I think there's a difference,

Justice Scalia, from saying that the Guidelines are

advisory and therefore a court can give a different

sentence than what the Guidelines call for, and saying

that basically advisory guidelines means the judge can

do whatever policy judgment the judge wants, without

JUSTICE SCALIA:

From -

You cannot disagree on

fundamentally?
MR. DREEBEN:

No, you can disagree

fundamentally, and I think at one level every variance

13

is a disagreement with the sentence that the Guidelines

14

would produce.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

that fits in with your prior statement.

17

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't know how that -

It fits in with my prior

18

statement because what'S at issue in a case like this is

19

not whether the judge can disagree with the judgment of

20

the Guidelines and say youth matters, but whether the

21

judge can do so to such an extent that the result is

22

unwarranted disparity beyond what needs to be tolerated

23

in order to achieve a system that complies with the

24

Sixth Amendment.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're saying that there's

33
Alderson Reporting Company

a fairness component to the Guidelines in reasonableness

2

review.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm saying that -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

When you start talking

5

about disparity, you're talking about a fairness across

6

a range of sentencing that is actually imposed.

7

So you're saying -- I think you're saying,

8

there's got to be a kind of substantive fairness

9

component to it.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

There has to be a substantive

11

fairness component, Justice Souter, and I think that

12

there has to be a substantive excessiveness component.

13

In other words -

14
15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that's kind after

subset, isn't it?

MR. DREEBEN:

I actually view it as the

17

broader category but I think the two of them work

together.

MR. DREEBEN:

Okay.

This is the fundamental

21

difference that I think exists between what Petitioner

22

is offering and what the government is offering.

23

agree that irrational sentences and procedurally

24

defective sentences are to be set aside on

25

reasonableness review.

We all

But where we disagree, I think,
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is whether a judge on a court of appeals panel can look

2

at the results reached by the district judge and

3

conclude, this is an excessive sentence on the facts of

4

this case.

5

We think that the judge can do that on a

6

court of appeals and that in order to determine whether

7

a sentence is excessive, a starting point is to compare

8

what the judge did to what the Guidelines range does.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then -- then you're

10

just blowing smoke when you say that the Guidelines are

11

advisory.

12

fairness is the Guidelines and if you go too far one

13

side or the other of the Guidelines, you're not being

14

fair.

15

That's the Guidelines as a criterion of sentencing.

What you're saying is the criterion for

That -- that's not -- that's not advisory.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Unless, Justice Scalia, the

17

judge offers sufficiently cogent, persuasive reasons so

18

that the court of appeals concludes that this is indeed

19

a reasonable sentence, given the reasons that the judge

20

has articulated as a matter of policy and the facts

21

before him.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, he did that here.

He

2

MR. DREEBEN:

He -- he did say that Justice

3

Scalia.

But appellate review is conducted through the

4

lens of 3553(a) and 3553(a) directs the judge to

5

consider a variety of things in addition to the history

6

and characteristics of the defendant, which is where

7

youth comes in.

8

the severity of the offense and the need for just

9

punishment.

It also directs the court to consider

It directs the court to consider deterrence

10

considerations, and it directs the court to consider the

11

need to avoid unwarranted disparities between similarly

12

situated defendants, and that's where this court fell

13

down.

14

It's not that what the court said was wholly

15

unreasonable, although in one respect, I think, with the

16

emphasis on withdrawal for the reasons that Justice

17

Ginsburg mentioned, the judge did overstate the point.

18

But the judge lost sight of the fact that this is a

19

defendant who over a 7-month period engaged in a

20

sustained drug conspiracy at age 21, not as an

21

adolescent, and made 30 to $40,000 for that.

concluded that defendant JUSTICE STEVENS:

between the facts in this case and the ones which you

would find acceptable?

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the ones that, I think,

11

have been the most appealing for probation sentences are

12

cases in which the defendant's culpability is very low.

13

The defendant played a minor role in the offense,

14

perhaps assisting a boyfriend or a friend -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm asking about whether

16

in cases exactly involving the crime we have here,

17

whether any such cases would justify probation, where

18

the culpability was exactly the same as there was here.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

The only cases that I can

20

think of -- and I was trying to get to this point,

21

Justice Stevens -- are ones in which courts conclude

22

there are compelling family circumstances where

23

individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant's

24

family if no one is available to take care of them, and

the defendant has really devoted his activities to doing

I'm not saying that Petitioner is the most

culpable defendant that could be sentenced under this

statute.

7

This is a statute that carries a range JUSTICE BREYER:

This is exactly the kind of

8

case, though, that I think would give tremendous

9

discretion to the district judge.

Because, as I just

10

listened to you, you are listing a whole lot of features

11

of it that are very case-specific, that require thorough

12

knowledge of fact and thorough knowledge of the kind of

13

judgment, a kind of individualized judgment, that

14

sentencing judges are supposed to do.

MR. DREEBEN:

Let me try to draw one

distinction and make a point about proportionality that

I think is not encompassed within what you said.

19

There is a distinction between a judge

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We're trying to development

3

a rule here that can be applied sensibly by all the

4

courts of appeals when they are reviewing the

5

innumerable sentences of federal district judges.

6

And you have -- you haven't given me a rule.

7

I have no idea -- if I were sitting on the court of

8

appeals, I would have no idea when I can do it and when

9

I can't do it.

10

The notion of reasonableness, you know,

11

whether a reasonable person could have given a sentence

12

of this sort despite the fact that it is not what the

you can work with, but I don't understand what your rule

have to affirm both.

But if you are trying to get a narrow range

of sentences out of the guidelines, it seems to me

9

you're just working in opposition to what our opinions

10

have said which is that the guidelines are advisory.

11

And they're not mandatory.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the question I think

13

here is how advisory do they have to be in order to

14

comply with this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence

15

and the remedial opinion in Booker, as I understand it,

16

answered that question by saying they're not mandatory,

17

but the features of the appellate review and continued

18

existence of the sentencing commission are going to work

19

significantly to achieving Congress's objectives of

20

increased uniformity.

21

that have adopted proportionality review, even if they

22

may have used slightly different words to express it,

23

are -- I think, responding to a fundamental intuition,

24

which is how do I know if the sentence in front of me is

25

likely to be significantly outside the norm.

And the nine courts of appeals

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And second, if it is, should I not look for

2

more to sustain it than a sentence that's co-extensive

3

with the guidelines sentence.

4

I think this case is really the counterpart

5

case to the Rita case that the Court decided last term

6

when that judgment of the sentencing court and the

7

district judge -- the sentencing commission and the

8

district judge coincide, courts of appeals can assume

9

it's likely, although not definitely true -- but likely

10

that the sentence is a reasonable one.

11

sentence is significantly outside what the guidelines

12

would call for on an average case of that type -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But when the

Mr. Dreeben, you are

14

saying that you admit there's no presumption of

15

unreasonable merely because it is outside but there is a

presumption of reasonable if it dramatically or

significantly is outside and you don't define

dramatically or significantly?

Just the word dramatically.

I don't treat what I'm arguing
45

Alderson Reporting Company

for as a presumption, but if the Court wants to conclude

2

that it does function like a presumption, I would still

3

submit it is a perfectly valid presumption under these

4

circumstances.

5

It is not that the court of appeals -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you should -

7

I'm sorry.

But I mean -- the only purpose of the

8

presumption under your view is to trigger some inquiry

9

into the reasons.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Correct.
Under 3553(a),

district courts have to provide reasons anyway, right.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

They do.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if there is no

15

explanation of the reasons it is going to be invalid

16

under the statute, quite apart from any presumption of

17

unreasonableness.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the presumption of

19

unreasonableness goes a little bit farther than that,

20

Mr. Chief Justice, because it allows the court of

21

appeals to take notice that this is a sentence that if

22

upheld holds the potential for unwarranted disparity.

23

And it may be that the sentence doesn't pose that risk

24

at all.

25

that sentence should be somewhat commensurate or

But the reasons that the judge gave to justify

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proportionate to the degree of the variance, otherwise

2

you're basically back to a system where so long as the

3

judge can go through the facts of the case and give a

4

rational explanation of why a sentence should be at that

5

level, there's nothing for the appellate court to do but

6

to affirm.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why isn't that always true?

8

A judge should always give reasons commensurate with the

9

problem.

So what if we added by saying remember give

10

reasons commensurate with the problem?

11

we've lost.

12

across the screen here a rather murky curtain called

13

"something of a presumption," which we can't quite

14

define, which will lead to lawyers making endless

15

arguments about whether this murky curtain -- they're on

16

one side of it or the other.

17

Let's get to the underlying facts.

18

I see something

What we've lost is we've sort of pulled

MR. DREEBEN:

So let's sweep its aside.

What you'd be doing I think,

19

Justice Breyer, is sweeping aside the approach that nine

circuits have taken.

They didn't select

They selected the standard because they
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

considered it essentially a rule of reason.

The rule

2

being that under an advisory guideline system, we must

3

accept that there will be considerably less uniformity

4

than under a mandatory system.

5

we don't have to accept the proposition that materially

6

outlier sentences that are not supported by an adequate

7

explanation should stand.

8

are told, you go back to the drawing board now, you

9

can't use any kind of proportionality test, I think

That's appropriate.

And if the courts of appeals

10

unless the Court gives them something that will allow

11

them to distinguish between a materially out of

12

guideline sentence that is reasonable and one that is

13

not, the ultimate result will be every district judge

14

knowing that in their courtroom, they can decide

15

whatever they like about the fundamental policies of

16

sentences, and it will stand.

17

The reason why the sentencing guidelines

18

system was originally adopted was to eliminate each

19

district judge operating purely on that judge's

20

philosophy.

21

But

JUSTICE BREYER:

We were making progress?

22

thought our last discussion -- we were making progress

23

on this very point, where we have the judgmental

24

matters, the fact finding matters, and the pure policy

matters, and we distinguished the latter from the first

two?
If you were a district judge, wouldn't you
find it more enlightening to talk in those terms?
MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I think that what the

5

district judges need to understand is that they're not

6

bound by the guidelines, but the guidelines remain

7

something that is a reference point, that if deviations

8

or variances are warranted, they should be explained,

9

and they should be explained in a way that's consistent

10

with the degree of the variance.

11

alternative of wholesale abdication to the district

12

judge to assess the individual facts of the case means

13

that one district judge can conclude that a defendant

14

like Mr. Gall warrants probation, and another one can

15

conclude that he warrants 10 or 15 years, and there'll

16

be no remedy on appeal because it will all be very

17

case-specific.

18

Most of what goes on in Federal sentencing is not

19

fundamentally a deep-rooted policy disagreement of the

20

nature of the kind that Justice Scalia and I were

21

discussing, about whether white collar defendants should

22

go to jail at all.

Is the judge supposed to put a percentage

MR. DREEBEN:

And if not, aren't you

It is more of a wholistic and

15

judgmental process than a mathematical one, Justice

16

Stevens.

17

because I don't want to be mistaken for saying there is

18

some litmus test with superguidelines, ranges -- but I

19

can say that courts of appeals that find a variance to

20

warrant a substantial or extraordinary justification are

21

typically looking at 40 to 50 to 60 percent away from

22

the guidelines range, not sentences that -

23
24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Does that call for a 40 to

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But don't you read the

3

court of appeals opinions as in effect saying we've got

4

to get a percentage that matches the percentage of

departure?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

Linguistically, the words used

7

are, you need a compelling reason for an extraordinary

8

departure -- an extraordinary reason for an

9

extraordinary departure or variance.

So in that sense,

10

I agree with you.

attempted to create a mathematical grid, because such an

exercise would be both contrary to the notion of

unfortunately more in the nature of, I know it when I

16

see it, but I don't think that this is as bad as the

predicament the Court found itself in in obscenity

cases, because it really isn't that hard to tell the

19

difference between a variance that is a few months

Mr. Dreeben, you're -

you're arguing hereby in a case where the departure was

11

would apply for upward departures as well?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't there get to be a

14

constitutional problem where -- where the court which is

establishing these -- these ranges that you want has

cannot get 30 percent over -- over the guideline range

18

unless particular facts exist?

those -- those facts in prior decisions.

20

in order to go 30, you know, 30 percent above the

you would need the jury to find it.

5

question about whether this sentence was excessive or

6

not on the basis of the -- of the facts, that the

7

government is blowing smoke with respect to its

8

statement that the guidelines is purely advisory.

9

it's not only doing that; it's removing the exercise of

10

Well,

discretion by the district judge.

11

It's saying to the district judge, you must

12

demonstrate to us facts.

13

that not only consist of explanations of reasons but are

14

sufficiently persuasive or compelling to overcome our

15

natural resistance to an outside-the-guidelines

16

sentence.

17

You must come to us with facts

That I submit is, as articulated earlier,

18

making the guidelines presumptive.

19

fact-finding requirement that is in violation of the

20

Sixth Amendment.

21

And it imposes a

Justice Ginsburg, you asked about whether

22

the prosecutor had, in fact, heard all of the evidence

23

with respect to -- or stated all the evidence to the

24

district court with respect to Mr. Gall.

25

that question is he most certainly did.

The answer to
And I agree

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with my colleague that this case is the mirror of Rita.

2

In Rita, the district judge was presented with a wealth

3

of facts about Mr. Rita's prior good works, his military

4

service, et cetera.

5

Here, the district judge was again presented

6

with a wealth of facts with respect to Mr. Gall's

7

voluntary rehabilitation, with respect to his having

8

grown, developed, and established a business and rid

9

himself of crime and drugs.

And this district judge

10

exercised his discretion to go down on the basis of

11

those facts and imposed a sentence of probation.

12

And, Justice Stevens, the Eighth Circuit,

13

even before the Guidelines, even before the Booker case,

14

in 1993, in 1999, in cases called One Star and Decora

15

respectively, went down from even higher levels to

16

probation based upon the particular facts of the case.

17

We would ask the Court to overturn the

18

judgment of the Eighth Circuit and abandon the

19

extraordinary circumstances test.

20

Thank you.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22
23
24

Thank you Mr. Green.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:04 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
