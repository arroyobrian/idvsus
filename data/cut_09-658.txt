CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

Moore.

Mr. Kroger.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL JOHN R. KROGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KROGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The court of appeals held that Arizona v.

12

Fulminante was the clearly established Federal law to

13

control and govern the outcome of this case.

14

an error, because this Court has never applied

15

Fulminante's direct appeal harmless error standard,

16

which places the burden of proof on the government, to a

17

collateral ineffective assistance of counsel claim,

18

where the burden of proof is on the inmate.

19

This was

In Boyer, unlike Fulminante, there is no

20

trial transcript to review because the defendant pleaded

21

no contest or guilty before trial.

22

appeals' decision conflicts with both

23

Strickland v. Washington and Hill v. Lockhart and will

24

have grave negative consequences for our criminal

25

justice system.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't -- isn't

2

Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that

3

a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight,

4

leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in

5

Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime,

6

that carries heavy weight?

7

MR. KROGER:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it's

8

relevant to that extent, that a confession from a

9

defendant is significant evidence.

However, it

10

certainly does not imply, as the court of appeals

11

proceeded to do here, that it controls the prejudice

12

prong of Strickland, that it sets a new standard of

13

review of harmlessness, that it shifts the burden of

14

proof onto the government, or that it limits the

15

prejudice analysis to that question of the potential

16

impact of the confession at trial.

17

And so for all those reasons, I -- I think

18

the -- the court of appeals has gone well beyond any

19

potential relevance of the Fulminante decision.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it -- if I am

21

understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred

22

in assuming that if the confession had been

23

suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against.

24

I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position

25

that we have to get to the question of what would have
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all

2

circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a

3

defendant should never plead guilty.

4
5
6

You are saying that that conclusion is what
the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong?
MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, we're -- we are

7

suggesting that the court was wrong both in stating

8

Fulminante provided the standard of review, as well as

9

holding that you can, in effect, assume prejudice simply

10

because defense counsel failed to file a motion which

11

defense counsel believed was not -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's another way of

13

saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead

14

guilty if it's a suppressible confession?

15
16
17

MR. KROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So now, what

18

is the other information that would have made a plain

19

guilty in this case inevitable?

20

higher standard than you need to meet, but -­

21

MR. KROGER:

However, that's a

As -- as Your Honor noted, that

22

is a much higher standard than we have to meet under

23

Hill v. Lockhart.

24

defense counsel's advice that this defendant plead

25

guilty was sound and reasonable advice.

There were very good reasons why

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

First of all, the defendant faced a very

2

strong government case, even at that stage of the

3

investigation.

4

Second, there was a potential charge of

5

aggravated murder that could be brought if the case were

6

taken to the grand jury.

7

Third, the plea offer that was extended to

8

the defendant and which the defendant took was very

9

favorable to the defendant, both in terms of -- of

10

capping the amount of time that the defendant would

11

serve, as well as dismissing two additional mandatory

12

minimum charges of assault and kidnapping.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

the minimum he pled to?

15

higher?

16
17
18

MR. KROGER:

So -­

Were those higher than

Were those mandatory minimums

No, Your Honor, but they could

have been run consecutive rather than concurrent.
I -- I think more significant is the fact

19

that when the defendant himself testified about the

20

reasons he pled guilty, none of the reasons he provided

21

had anything to do with the strength of the government's

22

case or the failure of counsel to file the motion.

23

What the defendant said motivated his guilty

24

plea was a concern about an aggravated murder charge, a

25

desire not to have to testify against his brother, which
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

he believed would be the outcome of a guilty plea.

2

those factors were in the defendant's mind when he

3

decided to take the guilty plea.

And

4

So in this case, even if one were to shift

5

the burden onto the government -- and I do not believe

6

that -- that that is consistent with Strickland -- the

7

government would prevail here.

8
9

This case raises, I think, significant
consequences for application of Strickland and

10

Hill v. Lockhart.

11

burden of proof in a collateral proceeding on the

12

inmate.

13

Strickland and Hill clearly place the

The court of appeals here shifted the burden

14

of proof, pursuant to Fulminante, onto the government.

15

One can see this in the petition appendix at page 48

16

where the court states that there is not enough evidence

17

in the record to prove that the defendant would have

18

pled guilty had the confession been denied.

19

As I stated to Justice Sotomayor, I believe

20

the government actually could meet that burden, but that

21

is certainly not the burden that either Strickland or -­

22

or Hill requires.

23

Second, the Court's application of

24

Fulminante transforms the Hill v. Lockhart analysis.

25

narrows it to one degree, because it's focused on one
7

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue, what the government's evidence would be at trial,

2

rather than looking at the broad array of issues which

3

might motivate a defendant to plead guilty which the

4

courts will look at under -- under Hill v. Lockhart.

5

For example, under Hill v. Lockhart the

6

court will not only look at the defendant's testimony

7

with respect to the estimate of the strength of the

8

government's case, but also look at the potential for an

9

additional sentence that is higher or additional charges

10

that carry a higher sentence if the defendant proceeds

11

with litigation rather than pleading guilty.

12

It will look at the investigation risk that

13

additional evidence would be found in, if the case

14

continued rather than terminating in an early plea.

15

it will look at personal factors such as the ones that

16

were evident in this case that might motivate a guilty

17

plea.

18

For those reasons, the Hill v. Lockhart

19

standard encompasses a broader array of factors in

20

determining whether there is prejudice than a simple

21

application of Fulminante's direct appeal post-trial

22

standards.

23

And

It is also the case that the application of

24

Fulminante will substantially increase the amount of

25

speculation which courts have to engage in compared with
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

applying the proper Hill v. Lockhart test.

2

Hill v. Lockhart limits the amount of

3

speculation by focusing on the defendant's motive in

4

pleading guilty and whether the ineffective assistance

5

could have influenced that decision to plead guilty.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about Judge Berzon's

7

test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common

8

sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you

9

have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea

10

bargain?

11

the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on

12

the prosecution's side.

13

MR. KROGER:

The confession certainly -- it -- this serves

Your Honor, I would say two

14

things:

15

Berzon in the concurrence has never been recognized or

16

promulgated by this Court.

19

required to follow.

20

So in a collateral

And second, application of that standard, as

21

Judge Bybee noted in his concurrence, would require an

22

immense amount of speculation.

23

majority in the Ninth Circuit hypothesized that filing

24

the motion to suppress the confession would strengthen

25

the defendant's position in negotiation vis-à-vis the

In this case, the

Government.

2

It is also very possible, however, that the

3

Government would respond to filing a motion as opposed

4

to taking an early offer of guilty plea by taking the

5

case to the grand jury, seeking an aggravated murder

6

charge, and thus, putting the defendant in a worse

position in the case.

8

tools to be able to speculate years after the guilty

plea whether a particular motion may have increased or

11

may have decreased the amount of leverage that a

defendant has, or what kind of response that that motion

might have drawn from the prosecution.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you have to, don't you?

15

I mean, what's the alternative?

16

where it's clear there was a malpractice or an

17

inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago

18

and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or

19

not?

20

would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded

21

guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to

22

figure out whether that's so?

It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he

2

So -- so what's the alternative?
MR. KROGER:

I think the alternative, Your

3

Honor, is application of Hill v. Lockhart, which looks

4

not at speculation about how this could or could not

5

have affected the plea bargaining process, but looks

6

very concretely at the defendant's pretrial

7

decision-making process and examines the record to

8

determine why the defendant pled guilty and whether they

9

can prove with a reasonable probability that he would

10
11

not have pled guilty -­

I -- I think the difference,

17

Your Honor, is that when you are applying

very concrete pieces evidence to show the defendant's

state of mind.

So you always have a -- a concrete record
11

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the court years later can review in order to

2

determine what motivated the -- the decision to plead

3

guilty.

4

If one were applying Judge Berzon's proposed

5

alternative prejudice finding, one would have to engage

6

in a great deal of speculation.

7

have defense counsel and the government make claims

8

about what they might have done in response to

9

hypotheticals, which does not seem to be a -- a -- a

10

reasonably judicable standard.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

One would, I presume,

As a -­
Without any

girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession,

14

wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that

bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would

MR. KROGER:

20

Government prior to the confession and whose -- whose

22

cooperation was known to the defendant.

23

And then, of course, there was a

So, with all of those pieces, even if one

24

stripped the three confessions out of the case, you

25

would still have a situation where the Government 's
13

Alderson Reporting Company

case was strong, where there was a very severe risk the

2

Government would go to the grand jury and obtain an

3

aggravated murder charge, and where there was

4

significant advantages to pleading early and locking in

a lower sentence to a felony murder charge.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kroger, from -­

7

General Kroger -- from everything you said, and I take

8

it -- from your brief, too, that you are not urging

9

the -- that -- that counsel's assistance was adequate?

10

You are not contesting that the confession was

11

involuntary?

12

prejudice issue; is that right?

13

You seem to be putting everything on the

MR. KROGER:

No, Your Honor.

We -- we

14

concede and forfeited the issue that the -- the motion

15

to suppress would have been meritorious, but believed

16

the district court got it right when it held that on

17

both prongs of Strickland, both on deficient performance

18

and on prejudice, the defendant has failed to make

19

his -- his -- meet his burden of proof.

20

I think the -- the prejudice argument here

21

is extraordinarily strong, but I think the deficient

22

performance, even if one concedes that the motion would

23

have been meritorious, the deficient performance prong

24

is strong as well, because the defendant can't meet his

25

burden of proof that defense counsel's representation
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was unreasonable, given the strength of the government's

2

case, given the quality of the plea offer that was made,

3

and given the defendant's own reasoning for why he pled

4

guilty.

5

The case has significant practical

6

consequences for the criminal justice system.

One is

7

that if the Ninth Circuit's opinion stands, it will be

8

much easier to challenge guilty pleas years after the

9

fact on collateral challenge, and this will undercut the

10

principle of finality.

11

see fewer Government plea offers in cases like this, if

12

the Government believed years later it would have to

13

present all of its trial evidence in a collateral

14

proceeding in order to rebut the presumption under

15

Fulminante that there was prejudice.

16

One would certainly expect to

Second, it has severe implications for the

freedom of defense counsel to exercise its discretion

19

Strickland recognized was necessary.

20

stated that it's a mistake to hem in defense counsel

21

with strict rules about what should or should not be

22

done, because defense counsel needs that wide latitude.

23

If there is a -- a virtual presumption that motions to

24

suppress must be filed, even where defense counsel

25

reasonably believes it will not resound to the advantage

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- if he had gone to

trial, what's the sentence -- what's the range of

7

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, if he had gone to

trial on the charges that were pending, and these -­

these were not charges from the grand jury, he would

10

have faced at least the mandatory minimum of 25 years

It could have been a capital

This could have been an aggravated
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

murder case because the facts involved a very severe

2

beating to the extent perhaps of torture where a

3

Defendant who was very vulnerable who had a protruding

4

hernia that was in a truss was savagely beaten, his nose

5

was broken, he was locked in the trunk of the car, taken

6

to a remote location and shot in the temple with one

7

shot of a revolver.

8
9

It is distinctly possible that the state
would have come from the Grand Jury as a capital case

10

and at the very least have been an aggravated murder

11

carrying a life sentence, not a 25-year sentence.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about his argument

13

that his failure -- the Defendant in the case arising

14

out of this episode, if Salyer did go to trial and he

15

ended up getting that exact same sentence that this

16

Defendant did?

17

MR. KROGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Salyer

18

did receive the same sentence after he went to trial.

19

His case, though, was very different from that of the

20

Petitioner, because the Petitioner was the individual

21

who cocked the pistol and fired the round into the head

22

of the victim killing him.

23

that the other two co-conspirators would have found

24

themselves charged with an intentional murder based on

25

the facts of this case.

And so it is very unlikely

But because this pistol could
17


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only be fired if it were cocked and because the round

2

went into the temple, it would have been a reasonably

3

strong aggravated murder case against this Defendant who

4

was the triggerman.

5

The final point I would like to make to the

Court is that this case involves or should involve

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not quite sure what to

do with the State court's case, assuming we have to

22

presume, because of the posture of the case, that the

23

confession was inadmissible.

24
25

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, I would say two

things with respect to that.

First of all, the State

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court's decision, even if it were incorrect in its

2

ruling that the confession would not have been

3

admissible, the State court's conclusion that the motion

4

would not have assisted the Defendant in any way, the

5

finding that it would have been fruitless because of the

6

other confessions, the other two confessions in the

7

case, is a reasonable decision that the Court made and

8

is dispositive and thus under AEDPA should receive

9

deference.

10

I would also suggest the case is somewhat

11

similar to Yarborough v. Alvarado.

12

issue at stake and this Court explicitly held that one

13

might come out one way or the other on the custody

14

issue, that reasonable jurists might split, but that

15

that fact alone rendered the State court's opinion on

16

voluntariness or on custody in that issue as reasonable.

17

There was a custody

And again, as here, though we are not

18

asserting that this confession was admissible, should

19

the Court consider it, it's clearly a close question on

20

voluntariness and somewhat factually similar to

21

Yarborough where even if the State court were was wrong,

22

it was still a reasonable adjudication of the claims.

23

If there were no further questions from the

24

Court, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the remainder

25

of my time for rebuttal.

erroneous position on his part.

So what made the case so weak that the

Government was never going without the confession to

prove felony murder?

7

MR. WAX:

the case is not as the State would have it, a strong

9

case in the absence of this confession.

10

We also believe that the proper focus is not

11

under Hill it is necessary to look at the totality of

this situation, all right, a client is indicted in

Federal court and you anticipate that there are all

sorts of motions that you might make if this case is

going to trial, but at an early point the prosecution

offers you what looks like a really good plea bargain.

MR. WAX:

Your Honor, the answer is

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if you take the deal,

then you want it later to be open to the Defendant if

9

he's not, you know, after the Defendant has spent some

MR. WAX:

And the issue here is not as we

22

that the statement was suppressible.

that there is in the record his self-description of

And while in some

circumstances the court will equate a nolo plea with a

plea of guilty, in these circumstances the fact that he

entered a nolo plea only is highly significant on the

4

question of whether or not he would have rolled the

5

dice.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And a competent -- and a

7

competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational

8

client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let

him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought

10

against him, or a capital murder charge brought against

11

him, and not -- and just go ahead?

because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to

trial, take the plea, because you're irrational?

are saying, that a competent attorney would not
