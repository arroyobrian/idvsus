ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

The fundamental question in this case is whether

11

the common law doctrine of equivalence between defendant

12

negligence and plaintiff negligence applies under the

13

FELA.

14

clearly stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts,

15

which is reproduced on page 19 of our blue brief in the

16

middle paragraph.

17

second to read it.

The doctrine of equivalence is, I think, most

And I think it is worth taking a

18

The rules which determine the causal relation

19

between a plaintiff's negligent conduct and the harm

20

resulting to him are the same as those determining the

21

causal relation between the defendant's negligent conduct

22

and resulting harm to others.

23

that has been in effect long before the Federal Employers

24

Liability Act was enacted.

25

of the law in 1965, and it is an absolutely clear

That is a principle of law

It is obviously a restatement

statement of the law as it applies today.

2

There is nothing in the Federal Employers

3

Liability Act that remotely modifies the doctrine of

4

equivalence.

negligence resulting from -- or negligence in whole or in

6

part.

8

negligence attributable to.

from any kind of common law doctrines.

10
11

The two provisions, section 51 talks about

And section 53, which describes the contributory

Negligence

inherently calls for an analysis of proximate causation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except that the -- what was it,

12

the Rogers case, which said that the -- well, you debate

13

whether it said that, but let's assume that it said that

14

the rule of proximate causality doesn't apply to the

15

negligence of the defendant.

16

The basis for that holding was that in whole or in

17

part language which is used for the negligence of the

18

defendant, but not used for the contributory negligence.

19

So if you believe that that case was at least decided for

20

the right reason, it seems to me there's a good argument

21

that it changed it for the one, but not for the other.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, even if that were true, we

23

would still, of course, be entitled to -- I mean, it

24

doesn't change the doctrine of equivalence.

25

say that we're not entitled to the same rule with respect

to take issue with the interpretation of Rogers, if you

6

want, at this point.

7

equivalence is fundamentally different from the doctrine

8

of proximate causation.

9

without affecting the other one whatsoever.

10

Now, I'd like

But it seems to me the doctrine of

And therefore, you can change one

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips, the fundamental

11

problem, at least for me, in this case is that there was

12

no objection at all at trial to the instruction that the

13

judge gave on negligence.

14

requested by the defendant on contributory negligence,

15

which read, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in

16

whole or in part to cause his injury."

17

only instruction objected to, because the refusal to

18

give that instruction.

19

a lever to attack the instruction on negligence to which

20

no objection was made.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

There was an instruction

That was the

But you seem to be using that as

That's not our attack, Justice

22

Ginsburg.

Our objection, which is reproduced in 28A of

23

the cert -- of the petition's appendix, that says -- and

24

I think the current MAI instruction has a different

25

causation standard for comparative fault, meaning that
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under Missouri's rules, we must prove that such

2

negligence of plaintiff directly contributed to the cause

3

-- to cause the injury.

4

because of the doctrine of equivalence.

5

And that misstates the law,

That's our initial argument, is that no matter how

6

you analyze this, whether you do it from a proximate

7

cause or a slightest cause standard as the appropriate

8

way to evaluate our negligence, that same standard has to

9

be applied in evaluating the plaintiff's negligence.

10

That's the core doctrine.

11

certiorari on.

12

That's what we sought

The argument with respect to Rogers was not an

13

argument we put into this case, Justice Ginsburg.

14

an argument that the Respondent put into this case.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's

I take it you would be satisfied

16

-- not wholly satisfied, but substantially satisfied if

17

we said, yeah, we accept the doctrine of equivalence, and

18

we think the instruction on contributory negligence was

19

correct.

20

would get a proximate cause instruction on defendant's

21

negligence.

22

Because that would mean in the next case, you

MR. PHILLIPS:

We would regard that as certainly

23

at least half a loaf, maybe more than half a loaf.

24

at the end of the day, I think the right answer in this

25

case is that the Court ought to go ahead and decide

What we're saying is, in response to the

doctrine of equivalence based on an overreading, I would

22

argue, of Rogers, that that interpretation is incorrect.

23

And if we're right that that interpretation is incorrect,

24

we would win on the doctrine of equivalence for two

25

different reasons.

The first one that Justice Souter described.

And

the second one would be that to the extent that there's

any equivalence, there's no problem here because

proximate cause is required in every case.

that that's an issue that the Court doesn't have to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we think

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

12

that said, "such negligence of plaintiff contributed in

13

whole or in part to his injury."

14

that was -- what you asked for was an incorrect charge.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

You didn't want the direct
You asked for one

Now you are saying that

No, what we're saying, Justice

16

Ginsburg, is that we were entitled to the same -- if they

17

were going to use slight negligence with respect to our

18

negligence, then with respect to the plaintiff's

19

negligence, we were entitled to slight negligence as

20

well.

21

That's our fundamental argument.

That's the issue

22

we have put on the table.

And candidly, I don't think

23

there's an answer to that that's been offered in this

24

case, other than a harmless error argument, which I think

25

is candidly without substance.
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The issue, then, is whether in evaluating the

2

doctrine of equivalence, do you want to then entertain

3

the plaintiff's or the Respondent's counter argument,

4

which is that somehow Rogers requires this fundamental

5

change, and indeed overrules the doctrine of equivalence

6

as it applies to FELA.

7

And I would say, one, Rogers doesn't speak to the

8

doctrine of equivalence at all.

9

it does speak to it, it was never meant to change the

10

fundamental rule with respect to proximate causation.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, two, to the extent

Except we've rejected petitions

12

for certiorari on that issue at least a couple of times.

Eleven circuits are in agreement as to what Rogers

required.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, at least one circuit clearly.
Do you really expect to get five

17

votes for the railroad on this, what would be a massive

18

change of what is assumed to be the law for, what, 50

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the -- well, the

21

answer is yes, of course, I expect to get five votes for

22

that.

ask for that.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

But you know, the basic -- the

2

point here is that if you look at the decisions that have

3

analyzed this Court's opinion in Rogers, I don't think

4

any of them has analyzed it with much care.

5

reality is the Third Circuit has analyzed this case with

6

care, and reached the opposite conclusion.

And the

7

We think there is a split in the circuits.

And at

some point, if not through this vehicle to address that

issue, then through another vehicle to address that

11

of all, there were at least 20 decisions of this Court

12

dealing not only with the sufficiency evidence, but also

13

with the adequacy of the jury instructions prior to

Rogers that refer specifically to proximate causation.

Rogers said, in whole or in part.

20

Now, I agree with you, that I don't see how that does it.

21

But Rogers said that it did it.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

But what Rogers saying in whole or

23

in part eliminated was the specific proximate causation

24

standard existing in Missouri.

25

cause standard talked about sole causation.

And Missouri's proximate

10

Alderson Reporting Company

And this

Official

1

Court said, no, in whole or in part means sole causation

2

can not be the right standard for proximate cause.

3

The Court was not asked to decide, and I don't

4

think it did decide, that proximate causation, as it is

5

traditionally understood, was also thrown out the door,

6

or more fundamentally, that you can never ask for a jury

7

instruction that calls for proximate causation to be

8

given to both parties -- I'm sorry.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Phillips, I may be

10

lost a bit here.

11

instructions that were given.

12

hard to take issue with the instruction on the railroad's

13

part because it tracks the statutory language.

14

15

says in whole or in part.

16

But I mean, which -- I'm looking at the
And it seems to me it is

The

So if you're pushing the doctrine of equivalence,

17

your objection seems to be to the directly contributed

18

language with respect to the employee, the plaintiff.

19

Now, but doesn't directly contributed, isn't that a

20

typical proximate cause instruction?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, that is a typical proximate

22

cause instruction, and that meant that our burden was

23

heavier than the plaintiff's burden, which is why we're

24

saying that under the doctrine of equivalence, we're

25

entitled to the equivalent instructions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Whatever they

If it is slight cause or proximate cause.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

That's not the argument we made.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not -- we

The argument -

How is the blue brief in

response to Respondent's argument?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Because if you look at the

13

opposition to the cert petition, which took us to task

14

for not discussing Rogers in our petition, it says on

15

page 6, "inexplicably, petitioner does not cite, let

16

alone discuss Rogers, an omission that enfeebles its

17

entire discussion of FELA's causation standards."

18

Against that kind of an attack, we felt it

19
20

incumbent on us to deal with Rogers.
JUSTICE BREYER:

As we're supposed to decide the

21

case, in your view, there was instruction 13.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You then argued to the lower

courts, 13 should use the word in whole or in part.

4

then you say you've argued that here.

5

saying is now we're supposed to decide, should

6

instruction 13 use the word in whole or in part. That's

7

what it is.

8

And

So what you're

I have to admit, I didn't quite get that out of
the blue brief.

I thought you were arguing something

10

else about railroad negligence.

But you're not now, you

11

say, arguing about railroad negligence.

12

about plaintiff negligence.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're arguing

Right, we're arguing both.
All right.

So if I reread the

15

blue brief, what I'll discover on closer examination,

16

that your real objection, not responding to the other

17

side, has simply been about the standard to use in

18

respect to plaintiff's contributory negligence.

19

you want this Court to say is, you're right about that,

20

we want the more relaxed standard used for contributory

of equivalence is the principle that should apply.

4

you know, it is not specifically before the Court whether

5

that means slight cause or proximate cause.

6

Because what we say is that the doctrine

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

I would say it sure is before the

7

Court, because what we are considering before the Court

8

is your objection to instruction 13.

should use the words in whole or in part.

admit, I don't know why it shouldn't.

11

ask them that.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you said it
And I have to

But I'll have to

That's fair.
You're going to say yes.

14

So all this other stuff is quite extraneous about whether

15

-- the railroad standard of negligence, the railroad

16

should be in a relaxed standard of negligence, in whole

17

or in part.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't know that it's Causation.
I don't know that it's extraneous.

21

It clearly is not something that the Court needs to

22

decide.

23

Respondents, to my mind at least, put into the case.

24

then we responded, to be sure, somewhat aggressively in

25

urging the Court to rethink whether Rogers was right --

On the other hand, it is something that the

1

whether Rogers really decided this issue as some courts

2

of appeals have.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Perhaps my memory is faulty,

4

but as I recall your opening brief, many pages were

5

devoted to what instruction should have been given on

6

railroad negligence.

7

what seems to be the question presented, that is, was the

8

instruction on contributory negligence wrong, because it

9

said -- it didn't use the in whole or in part language.

10
11

You were dealing not simply with

Instead it said directly caused.
So that's the limit of what we can deal with,

12

whether the in whole or in part should have been in the

13

15

the railroad's negligence.

MR. PHILLIPS:

But it was your brief that

19

part because so much of the doctrine of equivalence

20

itself is based on proximate cause as the standard.

21

so if you go back and look at all of the common law

22

analyses here, which are the predicate -

23

But the point is that we made both

And they are in some ways intertwined, in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that should be out of the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Except to the extent that the

3

Respondents are asking you to interpret Rogers as a

4

mechanism for getting at the doctrine of equivalence.

5

Now, it seems to me you can answer that in one of two

6

ways.

7

You can say simply, as I said to Justice Scalia,

8

Rogers doesn't speak to the doctrine of equivalence, and

9

therefore, you don't have to entertain that, you should

10

just reaffirm a doctrine that every court except the

11

courts in Missouri have recognized for a very long time.

12

Or alternatively, you can say, well, look, they say that

13

in order to properly analyze the doctrine of equivalence,

14

you should examine whether or not Rogers worked a sea

15

change in the law.

16

And we took them up on that argument, and said, we

17

don't think it did.

18

change in the law, then there is no basis at all for

19

doubting that you would grant equivalent instructions in

20

these two cases.

21

to the lower courts on remand.

22

have to go back for a new trial.

23

And that if it didn't work a sea

And that's the guidance you would give

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because this case would

24

any argument when you spent half your brief arguing about

25

negligence.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I would add to that that we

3

don't usually look at a BIO to see the issues that the

4

Petitioner is presenting.

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

And you know, Justice Kennedy, I

6

understand that.

But the reality is we raised the

7

doctrine of equivalence as our question presented.

8

other side raises and uses a substantial amount of its

9

pages for the issue of the meaning of Rogers.

The

We answer

10

that in the reply brief.

The Court grants certiorari.

11

We decided under those circumstances that the sensible

12

way to proceed was to address the Rogers issue.

13

Now, to be sure, I suppose we could have said,

14

here's -- section one is the doctrine of equivalence.

15

That's a 10 page brief.

16

just write a 15 page brief, wait for their 47 page brief

17

on Rogers, and then 20 pages on Rogers.

18

Maybe the better way to do it is

But we anticipated that they were going to do

19

precisely what they did, which is -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you would have us

21

announce a decision on the doctrine of equivalence

22

without saying which way it should be made equivalent?

23

Raising the railroad's standard or lowering the

24

employee's?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, because -- courts of appeals
17


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have been doing that for years.

2

you know, a lot of them assume that there's a lower

3

standard, and they say that the doctrine of equivalence

4

requires that if the plaintiff gets to go with slight

5

cause, then the defendant gets slight cause.

6

ruling that's been rendered for years and years.

7

There have been a lot --

Is that the most sensible way?

So that's a

Assuming you're right on the doctrine of

Now, you said earlier in your argument, it is

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
It seemed to me that a possible

22

interpretation of the record -- and I'd like you to comment

23

of the record -- is that the jury either believed the one --

24

25

thing really didn't have an impact on the calculation of

And that the direct causation

Alderson Reporting Company

And I was going to ask you to comment on that and

3

to tell me whether during the argument of the case before

4

the jury, did the plaintiff's lawyer argue, in effect,

5

that he had -- the railroad has a much heavier burden of

6

proving a causation than we do?

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

Let me take the first question

8

first, and then I'll address the second one.

There were

9

three theories that the plaintiff put forward of the

10

negligence of the railroad.

11

drove the other driver off the side of the road.

12

was also a claim that the road wasn't constructed

13

properly, and there was a claim that he wasn't given

14

adequate safety instructions.

15

Not just that the one driver
There

And there's no way, given that this was a general

16

verdict, to remotely figure out which of those theories

17

was the one the jury thought was correct, and how that

18

theory might line up with a causation theory, based on

19

the plaintiff's own particular view and the defendant's

20

arguments in this particular case.

21

So it is not as cut and dried as he said, he said,

22

and that's it.

They were more theories in it.

23

know, if you accept the idea that jury instructions

24

count, and there's clearly a very different burden that's

25

imposed on one as opposed to the other, then it seems to
19

Alderson Reporting Company

And you

Official

1

me the answer is there's no way for the Court to make a

2

harmless error determination.

3

It is also a question of State law.

It ought to

4

be decided by the Missouri courts in the first instance

5

in any event, I would think, rather than this Court

6

trying to sort through the record.

7

With respect to the argument at the close of

8

the case, I don't remember any specific arguments that

9

either side made with respect to the burdens, because the

10

jury instructions were what they were.

11

side was saying, you know, we really didn't do anything

presented.

14

And I think each

And so that's basically the way that it was

But I think given the way the jury instructions

15

played out, that there's no way at this time to

16

unscramble that.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think I'm seeing now, I think

18

the structure of your brief is -- perhaps a gloss put on

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it is not an adequate

I mean,

Mr. Phillips, may I interrupt on

exactly the point that I think you're addressing with

10

Justice Breyer?

As I understand your argument, you're

11

saying one view of Rogers is that the in whole or in part

12

language eliminates the proximate cause instruction.

13

all agree that that is one view of Rogers.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

24

Justice Breyer, and the problem that I have with the

25

instruction that your side requested on contributory

1

negligence is this:

It seems to me that the in whole or

2

in part language would be wrong on contributory

3

negligence, or at least it would be very misleading, for

4

the simple reason that you never get to contributory

5

negligence unless you found the defendant was negligent

6

in the first place.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

Right.
And therefore, if the plaintiff

is also negligent, it will necessarily be in part.

It

10

couldn't be wholly or in part.

11

negligent, you would never have found the defendant was

12

negligent in the first place.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

If it were wholly

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Therefore, if you are not going to

Is that

Well, I think it is wrong on two

23

levels.

One is, I don't know why you would need to have

24

proximate cause as your fallback, the last comment you

25

just made, because it seems to me if you're saying slight
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cause, which is what Missouri thinks the in whole or in

2

part means, then you can just say slight cause when

3

you're describing the contributory negligence.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But the instruction that your

5

side asked for, as I understand it, was not a slight

6

cause instruction, it was an in whole or in part

7

instruction.

8
9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

What we asked for was an

equivalence.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, and that -- all right.

But

11

if you're asking for the in whole or in part instruction

12

on contributory negligence, it seems to me the judge has

13

got to have been correct in saying no to that, because to

14

the extent that it addresses multiple causation, it would

15

be addressing a problem that couldn't even occur in

16

contributory negligence which will always be in part.

21

consider it in deciding whether to reverse it.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the point here that remains

23

is we said we are entitled to an equivalent instruction.

24

Now, if there's some variant of that, we could certainly

25

argue about that.

said equivalence instruction was not on multiple

They don't have to have

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.
Okay.

That's our argument.
But because the

14

instruction addresses both, in one view, proximate cause

15

and multiple cause, it would have been misleading so far

16

as the multiple cause issue was concerned, and a request

17

for an instruction in whole or in part on contributory

18

negligence really should have been denied.

19

correct?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Is that

Well -- I think -- I think the

21

argument would be that that cuts it too fine, candidly.

22

I think you can make an argument that what, you know,

23

what we were entitled to was some variant.

24

our objection here is not -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that --

You were entitled -- your

argument is you were entitled to an equivalent

That's your basic argument.
That's our basic argument.
Okay.
And we didn't get that.
And I don't think you could have

12

gotten where you want to go with the instruction that

13

your side requested, which was an in whole or in part

14

instruction.

15

That's my only point.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it may be that the in whole

16

part of this may have been slightly misleading, although

17

I think you can make an argument that you can end up with

18

in whole on both sides as a conceptual matter.

19

that's not the -- that wasn't the complaint at trial.

20

wasn't the basis for the trial judge's decision, wasn't

21

the basis for the court of appeals decision.

But
It

If the Court wants to send it back and say, is

20

Thank you, Mr. Phillips.

ON BEHALF OF THE Respondent
MS. PERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The controlling question raised here is whether

21

instruction 13 accurately states Federal law.

That's

22

exactly what petitioner said in their reply brief to the

23

Missouri Court of Appeals.

24

clearer that their challenge was to instruction 13.

25

John versus Poulin, this Court said that State courts

They could not have been any

28

In

1

have the authority to prescribe the rules of procedure in

2

their courts even when Federal issues are at stake.

3

The requirements in the Missouri courts were not

4

complied with here.

5

The sole question presented and preserved was with

6

respect to instruction 13.

7

their opening brief in the Missouri Court of Appeals,

8

which specifically says the trial court erred in giving

9

instruction 13 based on MAI 32.07(b).

10

No abstract question was presented.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that can again be seen in

Is the question whether

11

instruction 13 is flawed viewed in isolation, or whether

12

it is flawed when it's viewed together with the

13

instruction on employer negligence?

14

MS. PERRY:

It is viewed in conjunction with the

15

instruction on employer negligence, but a fixed concept

16

of what it was, they did not challenge the language of

17

instruction 12.

18

language constant, what should we do to instruction 13?

They accepted that.

Holding that

19

They could have objected to instruction 12 and 13,

20

and they could have said, here are a pair of instructions

21

both in proximate cause, and here are a pair of

22

instructions both in -- resulting in whole or in part,

23

and then they could have preserved this issue.

24

But they

They accepted instruction 12 as a

29

Alderson Reporting Company

instruction 13.

2
3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you agree that they set out

different causation standards, 12 and 13?

4

MS. PERRY:

Yes, they do.

Rogers concluded that

5

50 years ago and the courts in the Federal and State

6

system have nearly uniformly interpreted Rogers as

7

reaching that decision.

8
9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if the causation standards are

in fact the same, then instruction 13 is defective; isn't
that right?

11

MS. PERRY:

Yes, if you can reach that decision

12

without interpreting instruction 12, or the propriety of

13

instruction 12, particularly since instruction 12

14

contained the exact language of the statute.

15

judicial gloss has been put on that language was not told

16

to the jury.

17

Whatever

Justice Stevens, the question you asked, whether

18

there was any argument about the different standards, the

19

answer is no.

20

which the jury learned of this difference was in the

21

language of the instruction.

22

There was no argument.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The only way in

And instruction 12 -

Let me ask you this question, if

23

I may.

Perhaps I should have asked Mr. Phillips.

24

there such an animal as the doctrine of equivalence?

25

understand the restatement describes what the plaintiff's
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Is
I

Official

1

burden is on proving causation, and then it says the same

2

rules apply to defendant's contributory negligence.

3

But that doesn't sound to me like any overriding

4

doctrine of equivalence.

5

the restatement, the rules were the same.

6

a thing as the doctrine of equivalence?

7

MS. PERRY:

It just says when they wrote
Is there such

There wasn't in the early 1900s for

8

certain, Your Honor, because at that time, even

9

petitioners recognized the doctrine was emerging.

And if

10

we look at the language of 53, it talks about the type of

11

contributory negligence that used to be a bar.

12

certainly was a type of contributory negligence that only

13

arose with the traditional proximate cause.

14

wasn't on the slightest cause standard.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that

It certainly

Well, doesn't there have

16

to be a doctrine of equivalence when you're running a

17

comparative negligence regime?

18

talk about the plaintiff's negligence causing the harm to

19

a certain degree and the defendant's negligence causing

20

it to a certain degree.

21

apples and apples, it seems to me you can't conduct the

22

comparison.

23

MS. PERRY:

Because, you know, you

And if you're not dealing with

No, Your Honor.

You can conduct the

24

comparison, and it happens all the time in cases where

25

one party has committed intentional misconduct and
31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

another party has had negligent misconduct.

2

causation standards are different in that instance.

3

There's a -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

The

But we're talking

5

about comparative negligence here, where there's

6

negligence on both sides.

7

say one party's 20 percent -- contributed 20 percent to

8

the harm and the other 80 percent, if you're using

9

MS. PERRY:

Well, the causation standard is used

11

to decide what negligence you use in the balance and in

12

the comparison.

13

but the negligence had no causative effect, that

14

negligence falls out of the analysis.

15

For example, if a party is negligent,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah, but your example of other

16

instances including having to compare a defendant who did

17

the tort intentionally with negligent -- contributory

20

non-intentional has nothing to do with causation.

21

We have here a

Intentional or

But once you say that there's a difference in the

22

causation, it seems to me you cannot compare the two.

23

You cannot compare the two sensibly, unless you are using

24

the same kind of a standard.

25

I mean, let's assume that you find that the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

because it's comparative negligence.

It seems to me that
If you can

10

would be wrong with saying in whole or in part in

11

instruction 13?

12

MS. PERRY:

Well, I think Justice Souter hit the

13

nail on the head on that one, in that it does create

14

confusion and it can mislead the jury that the railroad

15

worker is responsible for other parties' culpability as

16

well.

17

Moreover CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

I thought Justice

18

Souter's point was that taking it out of the railroad's

19

instruction might cause confusion because of it.

20

don't see how adding it to both of them when you're

21

dealing with comparative negligence, and it's necessarily

22

the case that partial negligence on either of their parts

23

can enter into the verdict, I don't see how that can be

24

confusing.

Yes or no.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The point that I was trying to

6

make about it being misleading is that if you use the in

7

whole or in part language for a contributory negligence

instruction, you are misleading the jury into thinking

9

that at least there might be whole contributory

10

negligence.

11

contributory negligence unless you've already found the

12

defendant was negligent, at least to some degree.

13

Therefore, if the plaintiff is negligent, it can only be

14

in part.

15

There never will be.

You don't get the

That's all I was trying to say.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under that scenario, then,

16

what objection could there be to a recognition that the

17

negligence of the plaintiff can contribute in part to the

18

accident?

19

MS. PERRY:

If petitioner had asked for an

20

instruction that said directly contributed in part, the

21

inclusion of the phrase in part there might not have any

22

impact.

23

they were seeking not just to add the words "resulting in

24

whole or in part," but remove the word "directly" because

25

it connoted proximate cause, and that they felt proximate

It could still potentially mislead the jury, but

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Well, you just told me, a

20

good reason for not putting in whole or in part in

instruction 13 is because it doesn't make sense, the

22

whole part doesn't make sense with contributory

23

negligence.

24

Section 53 either.

25

That's a good reason not to put it in

is that it's a different standard.

slight causation.

I don't see how you can read Rogers -- maybe later cases,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15

MS. PERRY:

Absolutely right.

And he, you know, definitely clearly

16

said that a railroad worker does not have to prove common

17

law proximate causation relying on Rogers.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He did, but he was also pointing

19

out, just to make it simpler, he was pointing out in

20

Crane that the liability arose in Crane out of -- I

21

forget the full name of it -- the Appliance Act.

22

Appliance Act had its own set of standards.

23

therefore, you cannot, from an Appliance Act case, you

24

cannot infer anything one way or the other about the

25

general standard in FELA.

And the

And

And to make it even more

complicated, as I recall, Rogers was an Appliance case,

2

too, but he didn't get into that there.

3

But my only point is, you are right about the

4

two Brennan opinions, Rogers and the -- Crane.

5

the fact that it was an Appliance case, I don't think you

6

can infer one thing or another about an ultimate FELA

7

standard in the absence of an Appliance action.

But given

What remains is that the citation in Rogers was to
Coray, and Coray spoke about there still being proximate
cause.

11

MS. PERRY:

Yes.

But if we look at those earlier

12

cases, particularly Coray, we can see that Rogers

13

articulated what was meant by that proximate cause

14

language.

15

scope of liability or legal cause, as the restatement

16

says.

17

Coray, the Court found -

Proximate cause is, in a sense, a label for

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And in

Well, it is understood by

19

everybody, isn't it, that at least it has the conception

20

which is captured by using the word "direct" as in

21

instruction 13, and at least it has that core of meaning

22

whenever it is used, doesn't it?

23

In other words, it may not have a lot of bells and

24

whistles associated with it in the prior law, but at

25

least it requires some direct causation as opposed to
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indirect, right?

2

MS. PERRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

And that's -- I don't know

4

that Justice Brennan's citation to Coray, or Coray's use

5

of the language carries you any further than that.

6

that's as far as Mr. Phillips wants to go.

7

MS. PERRY:

But

We don't accept that, but even if

8

that's the case, the Rogers -- the parties to Rogers

9

immediately interpreted that decision as affecting

10

proximate cause.

11

that in Crane.

12

uniformly interpreted Rogers in a certain way.

13

this point, stare decisis suggests that this Court should

14

not overrule.

15

Twelve years later, this Court did say
The lower courts have uniformly, nearly

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That may be.

And at

That may be.

But

16

it seems to me that that's a different argument from

17

saying Rogers requires it, because I don't think you can

18

get that out of Rogers.

19

MS. PERRY:

Well, and I also think, though, that

20

by lightening -- by saying the slightest cause possible

21

or, you know, a slight cause would create liability, that

22

does affect proximate cause.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't have to say

24

that.

I mean, you know, when in doubt, we ought to

25

follow the words of the statute.

And so whole or in part

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

makes sense with the railroad, but directly doesn't

2

appear in Section 53.

3

the instruction just say, "such negligence of the

4

plaintiff contributed to cause his injury."

5

going to be a complete bar because we know the

6

immediate -- the next instruction talks about reducing

7

the award by the amount of the negligence.

8

that be preferable to introducing extraneous terms?

9

MS. PERRY:

Why don't we just -- why shouldn't

It's not

Why wouldn't

Because Section 53 refers to

10

contributory negligence that created a bar.

11

the type of negligence that required proximate cause.

12

Moreover, the type of instruction you are positing is not

13

at all what petitioner requested in this case.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that was

Well, no, but he requested

15

that the instructions be the same, and the directly is

16

what causes the problem, and directly doesn't appear in

17

the statute.

18

MS. PERRY:

But under Missouri procedures, you

19

have to be clear in the nature of your objection, and the

20

objection was that we want the same language, we want the

21

language resulting in whole or in part.

22

And out of respect for the State courts and their

23

right to create the rules that govern in those courts,

24

that was not satisfactory under Missouri rules.

25

rules also have specific requirements for what you have
41

Alderson Reporting Company

Missouri

Official

to do in the court of appeals.

There's a "Point Relied

2

On" which is the argument heading in the brief, and it's

3

required by Rule 84.04.

4

specific format, and it's supposed to start with "The

5

trial court erred in," and then you give your reasons.

And it sets forth a very

6

And it says that negligence -- it erred in

7

instructing the jury to find plaintiff negligent only if

8

it concluded that his negligence directly contributed to

9

cause his injury, rather than cause his injury in whole

10

or in part.
You know, there is no issue that was preserved in

12

the Missouri courts other than that challenge.

13

versus Caldwell which we cite in our brief, in Missouri,

14

not only do you have to object, but you have to keep

15

consistent with the basis of the objection.

16

just object to instruction 13 on one ground, go up to the

court of appeals, and raise a completely different

challenge to instruction 13.

And out of respect -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you think they raised

an objection based on the doctrine of equivalence?
MS. PERRY:

That was a justification for rewriting

23

instruction 13 to include the words "resulting in whole

24

or in part."

25

argument about equivalency; that in order to do that,

I do not think they raised an abstract

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they would have had to object to instruction 12 and

2

instruction 13, because equivalency in the abstract would

3

require modification of both instructions, and they

4

clearly chose to accept the language of instruction 12

5

and only object to instruction 13.

6

So no, not in the abstract, it hasn't been raised.

7

It was a justification for one particular result, and

8

that was a result that would have modified instruction

9

13.

10
11

And in a particular way, too, modified it in a way

of including the words "resulting in whole or in part."
JUSTICE BREYER:

I guess they want to make the

12

argument now, whether they did or not, that if we look at

13

Section 53, which I think is the part dealing with

14

contributory negligence.

15

doesn't speak of causation at all.

16

MS. PERRY:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't see anything else.

It

Exactly, Your Honor.
It just says if there's some

18

contributory negligence, the damages will be diminished

19

according to the negligence attributable to the employee.

20

So I take it their argument was, maybe with

21

hindsight, Judge, don't give this direct language,

22

because nothing requires it.

23

being equal, nothing requires it, you ought to give the

24

same language you gave for the other side.

25

And since, other things

like that.

MS. PERRY:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you -

Well, I mean, should we answer

7

the question he now -- perhaps in his minimalist

8

position -- might want to raise, or maybe did, that

9

Section 53 doesn't speak of causation, the judge gave a

10

causation instruction.

11

in their view was wrong, and the law requires the judge's

12

causation instruction on contributory negligence, if

13

there is one, to be the same as it was on direct, the

14

defendant's negligence.

15

happened, we objected to it, we produced arguments, one

16

of them was this equivalence thing.

So he's saying to us:

We disagree with petitioner.
I'm not surprised.

for that reason.

One reason it was wrong is because it speaks of

But if the question goes to the fact

22

that Section 53 doesn't have an express causation

standard in it, what you fall back on is traditional

proximate cause, that Congress departed from the

traditional proximate cause standard by using the words

2

create the same departure in Section 53.

3

It didn't

In fact, by referring to the kind of contributory

4

negligence that creates a bar, it was pretty much

5

pointing right back to proximate cause.

6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you have more than one

proximate cause?

8

MS. PERRY:

I believe the treatises that say yes.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course.

So then how can "in

10

whole or in part" possibly eliminate the proximate cause

11

requirement, because it could be in part and still be a

12

proximate cause.

13

interpreted to eliminate the proximate cause requirement?

14

How can that language possibly be

MS. PERRY:

Because when a cause that -- when a

15

slightest cause can give rise to liability, that has

16

effectively reduced or relaxed that causation standard.

17

There is still a legal cause requirement, yes.

18

direct cause, which is Justice Scalia's point.

20
21
22

But it could be the slightest

MS. PERRY:

Well, but if we look at like the first

-JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, it may mislead the jury if

23

that's all you say.

But as a matter of analyzing the

24

statute or even of analyzing what the Court meant in

25

Rogers, you can have a slight but direct cause, and that
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be proximate cause in the traditional analysis;

2

isn't that so?

3

MS. PERRY:

Well, no.

The Restatement, for

4

example, at the time of Rogers talked about substantial

5

factors, and talked, in other words -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How can you say no when you

7

acknowledge that the prior law when there was

8

contributory negligence used to require proximate cause

9

for both the negligence of the defendant and for the

10

contributory negligence of the defendant?

11

situation could not exist unless proximate cause doesn't

12

have to be the sole cause.

13

part, right?

14

MS. PERRY:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Such a

It can be just the cause in

Right.
So the mere fact that we had

16

contributory negligence statutes that were applying

17

proximate cause requirements demonstrates that a

18

proximate cause can be a cause in part.

19

MS. PERRY:

Yes, Your Honor, but what Rogers and

20

the statute recognizes that it can be a very, very slight

21

cause.

22

--

23

And what it was understood, for example, in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's what Rogers might

24

have said, but the statute doesn't say anything about

25

slight cause.

It only says in whole or in part.
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. PERRY:

And neither did the instruction.

It

2

just used the words "resulting in whole or in part" also.

3

But Rogers did interpret the language "resulting in whole

4

or in part" as meaning playing any part, even the

5

slightest.

6

it would be a massive change in the law, as Justice

7

Scalia said earlier, for this Court to depart from that

8

at this point in time.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that has been the law for 50 years.

It doesn't seem to me that slight

10

is the opposite of proximate.

11

proximate cause.

12

MS. PERRY:

And

It could be a slight

The Restatement at the time of Rogers

13

talked about substantial factors, and in the comment to

14

that, it explains that sometimes the other causes can be

15

so predominant that one causation is just not

16

sufficiently significant or of sufficient quantum to

17

constitute a legal cause.

18

So there is a component of quantity within the

19

concepts of proximate cause.

I believe their reply brief

20

talks about substantial factor, and to talk about

21

something as being a substantial factor does have a

22

quantum component to it, just as slight has a quantum

23

component to it.

substantial factor, or oftentimes would not be a

substantial factor.

A slight cause could not be a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But under the old rule that

3

plaintiff's negligence in whatever degree was an absolute

4

bar to recovery, wasn't the rule customarily stated that

plaintiff's negligence, however slight, was a total bar

6

to recovery?

about that.
MS. PERRY:

I am not aware of that.

So that would

be a pretty harsh remedy if that were the case.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's what I thought.

Yes, I

thought it was a pretty harsh rule.
MS. PERRY:

And clearly, Congress in this statute

16

was trying to move away from the common law in many

17

respects to protect the railroad worker.

18

interpretation of Section 51 as lightening the causation

19

standard for the defendant's negligence, but leaving

20

intact the traditional proximate cause standard for

21

plaintiff's contributory negligence completely comports

22

with the purpose of Congress in enacting the statute.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the

Why isn't "in whole or in

24

part" simply the logical corollary of introducing

25

comparative negligence?

Why do you have to read that as
49

2

recognizing that under 53, negligence on the part of the

3

employee can reduce recovery which -- without barring it?

4
5
6

MS. PERRY:
of Rogers.

I reach that conclusion on the basis

And in the petitioner's brief -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Beyond that, if the plaintiff's

7

negligence was in whole the cause of the action, then the

8

-- there was no reason to get to comparative negligence

9

or contributory negligence, because by hypothesis, there

10

would have been no negligence by the defendant.

11

MS. PERRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's why you don't have

13

"in whole or in part" in 53, not because they wanted to

14

depart from proximate cause there, but because, as

15

Justice Stevens pointed out, you wouldn't have it in

16

whole or in part.

17

MS. PERRY:

Even the petitioner's brief describes

18

the language "resulting in whole or in part" as an

19

elaboration of proximate cause.

They recognize that it

20

has bearing on proximate cause.

And so if it has bearing

21

on proximate cause in Section 51, it certainly would have

22

bearing on proximate cause if it was incorporated into

23

the language of the instruction on contributory

24

negligence.

25

So that may be one reason for not including the
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

language, but another reason is that it does affect the

2

causation standard and Congress did not incorporate it in

3

Section 53, whereas it did have it in Section 51.

4

when it modified the statute in 1939 for assumption of

5

the risk, to abolish assumption of the risk, it did not

6

equate proximate cause and "resulting in whole or in

7

part" necessarily as the same thing because one version

8

had proximate cause and it was not adopted.

9

"resulting in whole or in part" was used in its place.

10

And

The phrase

So suggesting that Congress may, in fact, have

11

seen a difference, just as Rogers concluded, and I think

12

rightly so.

13

Moreover, as I said, that has been the law for 50

14

years, and it's pretty settled in this country and it

15

would create a massive change if this Court were to

16

depart from that.

17

to decide that because the language in instruction 12

18

said, "resulting in whole or in part."

19

has never -

20

Moreover, this is not the right case

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And petitioner

It is not the kind of change

21

anybody would have relied on, is it?

22

hard to see reliance interest on this interpretation.

23

MS. PERRY:

Is there anybody doing something differently because they

2

believe that the railroad does not have to be accused of

3

proximate causality?

4

MS. PERRY:

Does anybody act differently
I don't think so.

Well, for Mr. Sorrell in particular, I

used, and now they're attempting to disrupt this

judgment.

I suppose employee associations,

on it.

15

MS. PERRY:

Yes, you're absolutely right, Your

And there is employees' compensation for railroad

like to address just sort of two issues.

One is the

2

minimalist issue that Justice Breyer asked about.

3

seems to me that the minimalist way to look at this case

4

is we raised the question of whether or not the Missouri

5

standard which says that you cannot deviate from our

designated instructions creates a disparity in the way

7

you approach negligence and contributory negligence, that

8

disparity is inconsistent with the common law doctrines,

the issue that Justice Souter addressed, then the

question is, what does Rogers mean and what do you do
