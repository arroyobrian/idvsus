CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

5

Johnson.

6

Mr. Parkhurst.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH L. PARKHURST

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. PARKHURST:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

Petitioner asks that this Court apply the

12

principles established in Pennsylvania v. Mimms to

13

uphold the pat-down search of a vehicle passenger seized

14

during a lawful traffic stop.

15

traffic stop satisfies Terry's first prong as to

16

suspicion of criminal activity, and it also established

17

that a pat down of a driver is justified if the officer

18

has a reasonable suspicion that the driver is armed and

19

dangerous.

Mimms established that a

20

Fourth Amendment searches must be

21

reasonable, and the pat down in this case was

22

reasonable.

23

principle that the principles in Mimms also apply to

24

passengers in the context of a traffic stop.

25

And it is common -- it's a commonsense

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I didn't hear your first

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- in your opening.

2

that it's likely that he's armed and dangerous?

3

missed that.

4
5
6
7

9

Did you say that Mimms established

MR. PARKHURST:

No, no.

I

That's not what I'm

saying JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sure it wasn't, but I

missed what you said on that point.
MR. PARKHURST:

What I said is that Mimms

establishes that a pat down is justified in the context

10

of a traffic stop if the officer believes that the

11

driver is armed and dangerous.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Thank you.

13

MR. PARKHURST:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
Do you agree that

15

there's a point in an interaction that begins with a

16

traffic stop, begins with a seizure, at which the nature

17

of that interaction is changed so that it's no longer -

18

so that it becomes a consensual interaction?

19

MR. PARKHURST:

That -- yes, Chief Justice.

20

That can happen in a traffic stop.

21

in this particular case that there was any kind of

22

evolution to a consensual encounter.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's no evidence

Maybe I should

24

rephrase the question.

Do you agree that it would be

25

unconstitutional for an officer to conduct a pat down
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

after an initial seizure while that same interaction

2

still continues?

3

MR. PARKHURST:

No, I disagree with that,

4

Your Honor.

5

it is reasonable in light of factors that the officer

6

may notice about the individual.

7

presents an immediate danger to the officer or to the

8

public, a pat down may be reasonable under the broad

9

Fourth Amendment principles, even if this happens to be

10
11

An officer can conduct a pat down any time

If the individual

a consensual encounter or a JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So in your view, or I

12

suppose the government's view -- well, I'll let the

13

government argue for itself.

14

officer is just looking for the man in the gray overcoat

15

and he stops someone on the street and says, have you

16

seen a man with a gray overcoat, and the person says,

17

well, I saw something like that, can he just suddenly

18

spin him around and pat, and pat that person?

19

MR. PARKHURST:

In your view, if the

If the officer possesses

20

articulable facts that this person is immediately

21

dangerous to that officer.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you're doing away

23

with the first Terry factor altogether.

Do you think

24

all you need is reasonable suspicion that the person is

25

armed and dangerous?

What happened to the reasonable
5


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

suspicion that a crime has just been committed or is in

2

the course of being committed?

3

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, the first prong of the

4

Terry analysis, justice Ginsburg, is whether the

5

officer's action is justified at its inception, and one

6

way that it may be justified is if the officer possesses

7

suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.

8

know from other case law that another way the officer's

9

actions may be justified is during a traffic stop where

10
11

But we also

there's no criminal activity.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, for a Terry -

12

for a Terry pat down you don't need, do you, articulable

13

suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous?

14

long as you have a suspicion of unlawful activity, you

15

can stop the individual and pat down.

16

have, in addition to stopping the individual, an

17

articulable suspicion that he is armed and dangerous?

18
19

MR. PARKHURST:

So

Do you have to

I believe that's what Terry

says, that you -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. PARKHURST:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Both armed and dangerous?
Yes.
Well, in your view if an

23

officer was going down the street and he saw an

24

individual as to whom he had no suspicion a crime was

25

being committed, had been or was about to be, but he
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

said that guy looks like trouble for anybody who has

2

anything to do with him, so he goes up to him and he

3

says, I want to talk to you, and because he has

4

reasonable suspicion that the individual looks like

5

trouble, he pats him down.

6

MR. PARKHURST:

Is that a good pat down?
Well, he would also have to

7

possess articulable reasons that a prudently -- a

8

reasonably prudent person would be satisfied with that

9

this person is an immediate danger to him.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The individual gives him -

11

gives him mean looks and he has a bulge of something on

12

his hip.

13
14

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, that could very well

support a pat down.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then you are doing away

16

with the first Terry factor.

17

recognized:

18

a crime is afoot; and two, this person is reasonably

19

suspected of being armed and dangerous.

20

Justice Souter suggests that you don't need the first

21

one, you don't need to have any suspicion that a crime

22

is afoot; it's enough that you reasonably suspect that

23

the person is armed and dangerous.

24
25

There are two factors

One, reasonable, articulable suspicion that

MR. PARKHURST:

Your answer to

What I'm suggesting, Justice

Ginsburg, is that the first prong of Terry is much
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

broader than just suspicion of criminal activity.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but in my hypothesis

3

there was nothing that would satisfy the first prong of

4

Terry.

5

indication that the individual has committed a crime or

6

is about to or is doing so.

7

blank in my hypothesis, and you nonetheless conclude

8

that as a result of dirty looks and the bulge of a

9

probable gun on the hip, the officer can in effect

There is no lawful traffic stop, there is no

So, so -- so Terry one is

10

initiate the action with the individual and pat him

11

down.

12

MR. PARKHURST:

What I'm suggesting, Justice

13

Souter, is that in the officer's community caretaking

14

function the officer is authorized to approach an

15

individual that he thinks is trouble, and in the course

16

of asking neutral questions, if the officer believes

17

that this person is immediately dangerous to the

18

officer, then a pat-down would be appropriate in that

19

instance.

20

I'm not JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't the officer need -

21

justification for a stop, for a Fourth Amendment

22

seizure, whether because of a traffic violation or

23

because of suspicion of criminal activity; and then in

24

addition to that, reasonably believe that the person is

25

dangerous?

I thought that would be -- I thought that
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was your argument.

2

MR. PARKHURST:

Well -

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

In the context of a traffic

4

stop, you don't need, as to the passenger and the

5

driver, you don't need suspicion of criminal activity.

6

The person has been seized as a result of the stop, and

7

then if you add on to that the reasonable suspicion of

8

danger to the officer, that would be sufficient.

9

MR. PARKHURST:

What I'm saying, Justice

10

Alito, is that in this particular case we certainly have

11

a legitimate stop, and under Brendlin we also know that

12

the passenger is seized during a reasonably routine

13

traffic stop until the passenger is released.

14

we have here is a presumption that the officer has the

15

authority to control the passenger during the routine

16

traffic stop, and we also have an instance in a traffic

17

stop where an officer cannot avoid the individual, be it

18

a driver or passenger.

19

the easy case where Mr. Johnson and Officer Trevizo were

20

placed in close proximity, she detected things about him

21

that she believed made him a threat to her, an immediate

22

threat, and therefore all we're asking in our case is

23

that she be -- she have the entitlement under the Fourth

24

Amendment to pat him down.

25

So what

So in our case it seems like to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But Officer Trevizo

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

herself testified that she thought the seizure part was

2

over.

3

then she said -- I think she used the word "consensual"

4

herself, that it was a consensual encounter.

She asked him would he get out of the car, and

5

MR. PARKHURST:

Well -

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That after the initial

7

seizure was over, and then she wanted to question him

8

about gang, his gang affiliations -- and didn't she

9

testify?

10

I seem to remember she did, and she said it

was voluntary.

11

MR. PARKHURST:

She said that he could have

12

refused to get out of the car.

13

that, Justice Ginsburg.

14

necessarily the officer's own subjective beliefs as to

15

the -- whether the subject was free to leave or not.

16

The second thing is, we know from Brendlin that unless

17

the officer has given or the individual has asked for

18

permission to leave, there's -- there is really no

19

release.

20

enter a consensual conversation with Mr. Johnson during

21

the lawful seizure, but there was no indication that he

22

was free to leave.

23

free to leave, it's irrelevant to whether he reasonably

24

posed a danger to the officer.

25

There's two things about

One is we don't need to credit

So Officer Trevizo was certainly entitled to

Moreover, even if he reasonably felt

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I guess what you're saying

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is that if there is a stop of the passenger and an

2

interrogation of the passenger, the passenger can't say,

3

incidentally, this is consensual, and thereby avoid a

4

pat down?

5
6

MR. PARKHURST:

Correct, correct, and

whether or not -

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it seems to me there

8

is some indication that that's what happened here if you

9

credit the police officer's testimony.

10

MR. PARKHURST:

Right.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Certainly -

In other words, you can

12

have consent within the context of a stop that has not

13

yet ceased.

14

MR. PARKHURST:

Correct.

It would be

15

analogous to, say, a, an inmate in a prison offering to

16

give information to one of the prison guards.

17

no question that the inmate is still in custody, even

18

though the conversation itself is consensual.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's

May I ask if your view of

20

the law that, if the officer is pretty sure that the

21

person he's having a consensual encounter with has a gun

22

-- he could see the bulge or something -- is that

23

sufficient or does he have to have some proof that the

24

person is about to use the gun?

25

MR. PARKHURST:

It would be -- in the
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

context of a traffic stop because of all the unknowns

2

that an officer must face, a bulge is usually sufficient

3

to justify a pat down.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What about just meeting on

5

-- on the street, the officer meets the man on the

6

street and asks him where he's going or something like

7

that, and he sees a -- a bulge in the pocket that

8

convinces the officer he has a gun, but that's all.

9

That's the only evidence of a threat to the officer.

10

Is

that enough?

11

MR. PARKHURST:

In that instance, it may be

12

the prudent course to at least ask whether the person is

13

armed.

On a -- on a random -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. PARKHURST:

What if he says "yes"?
Well, then the officer could

16

ask something along the lines of whether he has a permit

17

to carry a gun.

18

permit to carry the gun or is lawfully in possession of

19

the gun, it's a matter of basically the totality of the

20

circumstances whether -

21

And whether or not the person has a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but I -- I thought

22

you said that there has to be an articulable suspicion

23

that he is armed and dangerous.

24

MR. PARKHURST:

Right.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A bulge would not be enough

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to conduct a pat down after a Terry stop, therefore.

2
3

MR. PARKHURST:
what I'm -

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PARKHURST:

7

was no bulge in this case.

8

all the factors.

9

Well, because -- well, there
However, it's a matter of

It's a weighing of all the factors.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PARKHURST:

Okay.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

-- Well, whether I believe?

15

a reasonable basis for -

16

MR. PARKHURST:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's a matter

Okay.

So the bulge alone

There has to be, you know,

Right.
-- an articulable basis for

the belief, right?

19

MR. PARKHURST:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

I weigh

of whether you believe that the person is dangerous.

13

18

No, I understand.

all the factors, and there's nothing but a bulge.

11
12

Well, then why should it be

enough to -- to justify a pat down here?

6

10

That's exactly -- exactly

Yes.
So I don't see why a bulge

alone would -- would satisfy.

22

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, in Mimms it was just a

23

bulge in the -- the driver's jacket that justified the

24

pat down.

25

and that person may or may not be a danger.

However, a person may possess a gun lawfully,

13
Alderson Reporting Company

For

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

instance, an off-duty police officer, they often carry

2

their sidearms with them.

3

They are not going to -- even if another

4

officer knows that they're armed, they don't perceive

5

them as a danger, and therefore no pat down is going to

6

ensue.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We have a whole separate

8

line of cases apart from the Terry stop cases which

9

allow officers to protect themselves by conducting a

10

search of the surrounding area when they arrest

11

somebody.

12

that they arrest also, doesn't it?

And that justifies a pat down of the person

13

MR. PARKHURST:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whether or not they think

15

that -- that he's about to -- to draw the gun and shoot

16

them.

17
18

MR. PARKHURST:

It's -- it's a

matter -

19
20

Correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't that line of

cases be extendible to this kind of a situation?

21

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, it's a matter of

22

during a traffic stop, Brendlin even says that officers

23

must be able to exercise unquestioned command of the

24

situation.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why during a traffic

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

stop shouldn't they be able to ensure their own safety

2

by -- by patting down the people who have been stopped,

3

whether or not they have an articulable suspicion that

4

they are about to draw and shoot?

5

you're proposing, is it?

6
7

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, what I'm proposing is

the -- the standard Terry test.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. PARKHURST:

10
11

But that's not what

That -

Yes.
-- the suspicion must be

that they're armed and dangerous.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why go the Terry

12

route instead of the route that -- that covers search of

13

the area around the person who is arrested?

14

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, I believe that this -

15

the facts of this case fall pretty much under Terry.

16

-- a traffic stop will -- will impose circumstances that

17

you're not going to get in a -- in a normal street

18

encounter, because basically an officer -- we presume

19

that an officer has the authority to control any of the

20

occupants of a car.

21

ordering them out as in Mimms and Wilson, but also

22

making sure that one of the occupants doesn't get behind

23

you while you're dealing with the traffic investigation.

24

It's -- it's -

25

A

And "control" means not just

You just said -- you said when the car is stopped

2

everyone is seized, the driver and the passengers as

The seizure ends at some point.

5

MR. PARKHURST:

Is that when the

That's the normal situation,

6

and usually that's the analysis that bears on whether

7

the driver has given valid consent to a search of the

8

automobile or something like that.

in mind that a pat-down search is not an evidence
This is not a full search.

We -- we must bear

It's just a search

General Parkhurst Then how did the -- how

15

did the officer come up with the marijuana as well as

16

the gun?

17

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, because once he was

18

arrested for the gun, then they did a search incident to

19

arrest.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Parkhurst, I -- I

21

seem to be a little confused about the facts of this

22

case.

23

thought the -- that the encounter had become consensual,

24

which meant that he was no longer -- in her view, no

25

longer under police custody.

I had the -- remember the testimony that she

But are you also saying

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

she also thought he was about to assault her; and,

2

therefore, she was in danger?

3

MR. PARKHURST:

She did not -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There is a substantial

5

difference between being both in danger and saying,

6

well, the arrest was all over.

7

MR. PARKHURST:

No, she -- she did.

She

8

believed that he posed an immediate danger to her based

9

on the numerous factors that she cited in her testimony.

10

So she was -- she was afraid.

11

outset, as a matter of fact, because of the way that he

12

made eye contact with the officers.

13

She was afraid from the

However, we don't want our officers to avoid

14

their law-enforcement functions just because they're in

15

contact with a possibly dangerous person.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why had this

17

descended from a -- a seizure to a post-seizure

18

consensual encounter?

19
20
21

Why was the seizure over?

MR. PARKHURST:

Well, we're arguing that the

seizure was not over.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it seems to me you're

22

-- you're acknowledging that she said that it was a

23

purely -- you're not arguing it as based on a purely

24

consensual encounter?

25

I thought that that's what you -

MR. PARKHURST:

No.

No, Your Honor.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

We're

Official - Subject to Final Review

suggesting that the seizure had never ended in this

2

case.

The Arizona court of appeals -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even though she said so?

4

MR. PARKHURST:

Correct, because we don't

have to necessarily take her word for that.

MR. PARKHURST:

Okay.
That's a -- that's a legal

--

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The white light is on.

10

don't want to -- but your opening argument that you

presented indicated that a seizure is not necessary.

You -- you wanted a further rule.

13

MR. PARKHURST:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I

I -- well If the officer believes

15

that a person is armed and might be dangerous, then they

16

can pat down.

proposed, I thought.

18

That's -- that's the rule that you

MR. PARKHURST:

We believe that that is

19

true.

20

the facts of this case, because we believe that there is

21

a seizure throughout the entire encounter, and that

22

there is really -- there is no question that, as a

23

seized passenger, Officer Trevizo could pat him down.

That's not the rule that necessarily arises from

questions, I would like to reserve the rest of my time.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

MR. HEYTENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

The decision in this case should be reversed

10

for one of two independent reasons.

11

that Officer Trevizo performed this frisk, the Arizona

12

Court of Appeals erred when it held that the seizure

13

that had been caused by the initial traffic stop was

14

already over.

15

time of the frisk.

16

First, at the time

This seizure was still ongoing at the

Second, regardless of the answer to that

17

question, under this Court's decisions in Mimms and

18

Wilson it is constitutionally reasonable for a police

19

officer to order any occupant out of a vehicle during a

20

lawful traffic stop and to frisk that individual if the

21

officer has a reasonable suspicion that that individual

22

is armed and presently dangerous to the officer.

23

this case -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In

Do you agree that

there is a point at which the encounter initiated by the
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

traffic stop changes in some way that a pat down is no

2

longer justified?

3

MR. HEYTENS:

We certainly agree, Mr. Chief

4

Justice, that at some point the encounter is over, and

5

that if it is in fact not over, the -

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if the

7

encounter is -- by "the encounter is over," do you mean

8

that they separate; they're no longer together?

9

question is whether or not it's a continuing encounter

My

10

but transforms somehow in its quality so that the pat

11

down is no longer justified.

12

MR. HEYTENS:

We agree that at some point a

13

seizure can morph into a consensual encounter.

We don't

14

have any dispute with that.

15

fundamental reality of this situation is what the Court

16

recognized in Brendlin, which is that at the time the

17

car pulls over a reasonable person would understand

18

himself to not be free to leave unless and until the

19

police officer says something that makes fairly clear

20

that the seizure is over and he's free to go.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We would say that the

I suppose there is

22

an argument, anyway, that even though the initial

23

seizure is over, the consensual encounter continues.

24

And at some point the officer, as a result of whatever

25

happens during that consensual exchange, becomes
20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

concerned for her safety.

2

MR. HEYTENS:

Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice,

3

and that's our second argument, which is at the end of

4

the day we don't think it matters whether he's seized.

5

Because whether he's seized or not, this is still a

6

roadside encounter with a person who was a passenger in

7

a vehicle that was -

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask you, suppose

it's a roadside encounter in which the driver is

10

changing a flat tire and the officer stops and wants to

11

talk to him for a while and then he suddenly thinks,

12

well, maybe this guy's armed.

13

ahead and search him?

14

MR. HEYTENS:

Is it okay for him to go

Well, I guess the first thing

15

I want to say, Justice Stevens, is that it's not okay to

16

think, maybe he might be armed.

17

articulable suspicion.

18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The officer has to have

Well, Maybe he has an

articulable suspicion.

20

MR. HEYTENS:

Okay.

Under those

21

circumstances we think absolutely, and we think your

22

hypo -

23
24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is that any different from

meeting somebody on the -- on the street corner?
MR. HEYTENS:

It is different in the sense

that -

2
3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The flat -- my flat tire

example.

4

MR. HEYTENS:

It is different because it's a

5

roadside encounter, and this Court has recognized again

6

and again and again -

7
8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But those are roadside

encounters after a traffic violation.

9

MR. HEYTENS:

I -- I agree with you, Justice

10

Stevens, which is why at the end of the day we don't -

11

we think that the officer, in basically those facts,

12

should be able to perform a frisk on the street as well.

13

I guess just -- again to say, I don't think the Court

14

needs to reach that issue, because I -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

the fact this is a traffic stop?

MR. HEYTENS:

19

You don't rely at all on

We do rely on the fact On your second point, that

is.

20

MR. HEYTENS:

We think this case is

21

substantially easier because it's a traffic stop,

22

because -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

MR. PARKHURST:

25

Why is it easier?
Because this Court has

recognized again and -- let me give you the example of
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Wilson.

2

it is per se reasonable for an officer to order a

3

passenger to get out of the car.

4

Wilson is the case where the Court holds that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but those are all

5

cases in which there is a violation of law that preceded

6

the activity.

7

nothing other than the officer's interest in patting

8

down the guy because he thinks he has a gun.

9

I asked you about cases in which there is

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Stevens, I think

10

Wilson is highly significant in this regard, because the

11

Court went out of its way in Wilson to point out that

12

there's no reason to suspect a passenger with any

13

illegal activity at all.

14

distinguish Mimms on the ground that with regards to the

15

driver you have suspicion that he's -

16

The Court said you could

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, I disagree with that.

17

The holding there was that the passenger was stopped,

18

the passenger was seized, so this was a pat down in the

19

context of an ongoing seizure.

20

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Kennedy, I guess I

21

would say we disagree with this.

The Court didn't hold

22

until Brendlin that a passenger is seized by virtue of

23

the initial traffic stop.

24

in Brendlin to say that none of its previous decisions

25

had answered the question of whether the passenger is

2

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

And the

Well, even if that's true,

why don't we accept Mimms with the gloss of Brendlin?

5

MR. HEYTENS:

We think that Brendlin is of

6

course absolutely correct, and we think the passenger

7

was seized, and we think fundamentally that's why this

8

case is fairly easy.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you say -- your brief

10

goes much, much further.

11

where you say:

12

officer's safety from a person reasonably believed to be

13

armed and dangerous whenever the officer encounters that

14

person in a place where the officer has a lawful right

15

16

And I'm looking at page 9

"Police have to be able to protect the

I read that to mean if the law -- the

17

officer is on the street, in a pub, any place where he

18

has a lawful right to be, that officer can, on the basis

19

of a suspicion of armed and dangerous, pat down, and you

20

don't need the first Terry.

point -- that point, excuse me, to resolve this case,

2

because there are two very important distinctions

3

between this case and that one.

4

The first one is that we know that Mr.

5

Johnson was seized.

6

encounter.

7

Brendlin that there was a seizure of Mr. Johnson in this

8

case.

9

this case to unseize him; and we think that the answer

10

This was not a consensual

We know under this Court's holding in

And the question is whether anything happened in

to that question is clearly no.

11

And then the second reason is this Court has

12

recognized over and over again that traffic stops pose

13

unique heightened dangers to police officers, and so

14

regardless of what the rule is outside the traffic

15

stop -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you'd apply the same

17

rule if the -- if the officer just stopped to help the

18

guy change his tire.

19

MR. HEYTENS:

We do think that at the end of

20

the day, Justice Stevens, the overriding command of the

21

Fourth Amendment is that a police officer's conduct must

22

be judged by a reasonableness standard, and we think

23

that overriding command allows police officers to take

24

limited and appropriate steps to protect their own

25

safety.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I take it, if I

2

understood your earlier answer, you would extend the

3

application of the rule as you understand it to the

4

encounter simply on the sidewalk by a police officer who

5

has no suspicion that the individual he wants to talk to

6

has been, is or is about to commit a crime, but if the

7

officer chooses to initiate the conversation, he then,

8

in effect, if he can articulate any suspicion, like

9

we'll say the dirty look and the bulge on the side, he

10

can go ahead and pat down.

view?

12

MR. HEYTENS:

Is that -- is that your

13

Souter, that is our view.

14

than this case, and let me explain why.

15

I think that case is harder

It seems like the argument on the other side

16

is predicated expressly on the notion that unless a

17

police officer has suspicion of crime, he can just avoid

18

dangerous people, like any of the rest of us can choose

19

to avoid them.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you if the

21

Department of Justice has ever taken this position

22

before?

23
24
25

MR. HEYTENS:

I'm not aware of whether we

have had to take this position before, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm asking you whether you

26
Alderson Reporting Company

1

have.

2

extreme position.

3

You don't think they have, do you?

MR. HEYTENS:

It's a rather

I'm not aware of whether we

4

have taken this position or not in any previous case,

5

because I'm not aware of any case that raises the issue

6

that's raised by the going up to someone on the street

7

hypothetical.

8
9

We have certainly consistently taken the
position that in the context of traffic stops it is

10

constitutionally reasonable for police officers to

11

perform Terry frisks whenever they have reason to

12

believe that their safety is in danger.

13

to Justice Ginsburg, I think -- excuse me, Justice

14

Souter, I believe -- I think the problem in the

15

hypothetical where the officer goes up to someone on the

16

street, it's predicated under the assumption that the

17

police officer, like you and me, should just avoid

18

dangerous people.

19
20
21

As I was saying

We think that's fundamentally wrong about
what the nature of a police officer's job is.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, there's something

22

fundamentally wrong probably about that, but the -

23

the -- I think the problem that sort of drives the

24

questioning is that if you extend the rule as far as you

25

want to extend it, we have to take into consideration
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the standard of articulable suspicion is the

2

standard that, in practical terms, can pretty well

3

always be met.

4

You can -- you know Benjamin Franklin's

5

remark, it's great to be a reasonable person because you

6

can think of a reason for anything you do.

7

what's driving, at least driving my questions.

8

MR. HEYTENS:

And that's

Well, I certainly would add,

9

Justice Souter, that it has to be a reasonable person.

10

It's not that a police officer can recite some reason.

11

It's whether a reason that a reasonable person in that

12

position would find reasonable.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but what the officer

14

cites is going to be a matter of fact, and the facts at

15

that point are gone, they're in the past.

16

you've got is the officer saying, you know, this is -

17

this is what I perceived.

18

defendant somewhere saying, oh, no, it wasn't like that.

19

But in a -- in a situation like that, if articulable

20

suspicion, in effect, can justify a sidewalk pat down

21

without any articulation of a basis to think crime is

22

afoot, then you've got a -- you've got a pretty wide

23

open standard in the real world.

24
25

MR. HEYTENS:

And all

And maybe you've got the a -

Well, I guess, Justice Souter,

to the extent you're concerned about that, I would say
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the same thing is true about whether you have

2

articulable suspicion of criminal activity, and the

3

Court has decided that that risk is worth, you know,

4

dealing with under the context of that question.

5

don't really understand why in principle articulable

6

suspicion of armed and dangerousness is any different.

7

So I

I would also say that in this case,

8

regardless of whether there will be hard cases, the

9

decision that this Court is reviewing is expressly

10

predicated on the view that Officer Trevizo had

11

reasonable suspicion Mr. Johnson was armed and

dangerous.

14

That's on pages 13 and 14 of the petition

It is also the predicate of the question on

The question which this

reasonable suspicion.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I think the other side made clear that its
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

principal argument is that Terry should be revisited and

2

that the two tests that Terry prescribed for a pat-down

3

search, that there be reasonable suspicion that crime is

4

afoot and reasonable suspicion of armed and dangerous,

5

should be revised so that all that is required for a

6

pat-down search is the second Terry standard.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if -- we've

8

been talking about the officer approaching somebody on

the street who has the bulge in his pocket, what if the

10

person with the bulge in his pocket approaches the

officer?

12

no suspicion that crime is afoot, conduct a pat down?

14

Can the officer at that point, even if he has

15

No, I don't think so, Your

I think that CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is -- this is

16

like the rule in the Old West that the sheriff has to

17

wait for the defendant to draw first?

18

MR. PINCUS:

No, I think the officer can -

19

it's -- I think it's important to make clear that the

20

sliver of cases we're dealing with here are cases where

21

there is a reasonable suspicion of armed and

22

dangerousness but not a reasonable suspicion that

23

crime -- criminal activity is afoot.

MR. PINCUS:

If there really is -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One moment.

In

3

response to my hypothetical, even though the officer

4

reasonably thinks he is in a situation where he could be

5

shot, he can't do anything about it, not even a simple

6

pat down, even though he did not initiate the contact,

7

somebody comes up to him?

8

MR. PINCUS:

If he reasonably believes he

9

could be shot, Your Honor, then probably there is

10

reasonable suspicion of criminal -- that criminal

11

activity may be afoot because he'll have -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, let's just

13

say it's like this case:

14

wearing the colors of the Crips gang and he has a bulge

15

in his pocket.

16

clothing; it may not be a crime to have a bulge in your

17

pocket; but he nonetheless has a reasonable suspicion

18

that he's being -- he's in a threatening situation, even

19

though he has no basis for thinking that a crime is

20

being committed.

The guy's coming up, he's

It's not a crime to wear that type of

goes a little bit to Justice Souter's comment in the

23

first part of the argument.

are somewhat -- are mutually reinforcing, as we discuss

25

in our brief.

These two standards are -

And if, indeed, as here, the State is
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only arguing armed and dangerousness, and not arguing

2

that criminal activity is afoot, it's clearly putting

3

itself at the low end of the armed and dangerous.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's not -- Mr.

5

Parkhurst said in his opening that the traffic stop is

6

the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a crime

7

is the equivalent of the articulable suspicion that a

8

crime is afoot.

9

have to have something further to justify the pat down,

10

but the car, the seizure of the car and its passengers,

11

that is the equivalent of the first Terry.

12

isn't that so?

13

It justifies this stop, and then you

And why

It's a stop; it's a legitimate stop.

MR. PINCUS:

I think that you're right,

14

Justice Ginsburg, that's the second argument that they

15

make, and our answer to that argument is that we don't

16

think that Mr. Johnson was seized at the time the pat

17

down occurred, as the court of appeals here found.

18

other side seems to ignore the fact that there is an

19

actual determination by the court of appeals, looking at

20

the facts of the situation, that there wasn't a seizure.

21

And so-

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

Can we pursue that for a

23

minute.

What -- I guess -- we -- we all start with the

24

common assumption that -- that there was at least a

25

legitimate stop to start with.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And my -- my question which

3

-- which goes to who was right about whether the

4

seizure, the legitimate seizure had stopped and the

5

consensual encounter had begun, my question is what is

6

it beyond the conclusory statement of the officer that

7

in effect justifies drawing that conclusion that the

8

stop was over?

9

MR. PINCUS:

Well, a couple of things, Your

10

Honor.

First of all, the Court has never discussed, but

11

in Wilson it actually reserved the question, of what is

12

the duration of the seizure of a passenger.

13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do we have -- do we have

any evidence about duration here?

15

MR. PINCUS:

We don't have any duration, but

16

the question -- I think an important question is does

17

the seizure of the passenger necessarily in all cases

18

coextend with the seizure of the driver?

19

in an urban area.

20

on a highway where there's really no place for the

21

passenger to go.

22

there are concerns about the safety of a passenger who

23

is allowed to wander off and the potential liability of

24

the police.

25

and if the Brendlin says that initially clearly the

This stop was

It might be one thing if it's a stop

This was a stop in a -- and where

Here the stop was in an urban area, and -

33
Alderson Reporting Company

2

-- that seizure last?

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If in my -- my problem in

4

this case, I guess, in taking your position is, I don't

5

think we have got an evidentiary basis to conclude that

6

what we start by assuming is a legitimate stop has in

7

fact run its course.

8

conclusion.

9

I don't see how we can draw that

That's what I'm getting at.
MR. PINCUS:

Let me pick up some of the

10

factors we rely on, Your Honor.

11

matter, the Court has said in Caballes and other cases

12

that the scope of a Fourth Amendment intrusion turns on

13

the purpose.

14

the passenger should turn on the ability to secure the

15

scene.

16

the facts that gave rise to the stop -- if it's clear,

17

for example, quickly that the passenger doesn't own the

18

vehicle, the reasons that -- the driver owns the

19

vehicle, the stop, the basis for the stop relates to the

20

passenger -- we don't see what the basis is for, in an

21

urban setting at least, for any further seizure of the

22

passenger.

23

First, just as a legal

Here we say the scope of the seizure of

If the passenger is not involved in what -- in

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, then, in other words,

24

you -- you are -- I -- I'll be candid with you.

25

have started with the assumption, based on Brendlin,
34
Alderson Reporting Company

I would

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that if the stop of the car and its driver also effects

2

a stop and a seizure of the passenger, that you start

3

out with the assumption that the seizure of the

4

passenger is going to last for the same duration as the

5

seizure of the car and the driver unless you have a good

6

reason to draw some line and say, no, it doesn't.

7

take it that you are not making that initial assumption;

8

am I correct in that?

9

MR. PINCUS:

10

-- on what I just said.

11
12
13

We're not relying entirely on
But -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think you're rejecting

it, aren't you?
MR. PINCUS:

No, we're not relying -- we're

14

rejecting that assumption.

15

the notion that the -- that the seizure of the

16

passengers as a matter of law has to end.

17

there are special facts here that show that -- that

18

support the idea that the seizure was over.

19

one of them -

20
21
22

And I

We don't rest entirely on

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We think

But I think

What are those -- what are

those special facts?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, basically there was this

23

interaction separate from the interaction with the

24

driver to the extent the passenger -- Brendlin says the

25

passenger, one of the reasons the passenger would feel
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that he or she is seized is because of his or her

2

relationship to the driver and to the stop here.

3

interaction proceeded separately.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This

Are you saying -- are you

5

saying if there are a driver and a passenger and two

6

police officers, and one police officer is dealing with

7

the driver, saying, you know, where's your insurance

8

papers and so on, and at the same time the other officer

9

is questioning the -- the passenger -- are you saying

10

that that independent questioning of the passenger in

11

effect eliminates the -- the passenger's seizure as -

12

as following from the seizure of the driver?

talking to the passenger, ultimately have anything to do

22

why does the conversation with the passenger have

2

anything much to do, have any bearing on the -- on the

3

length of the passenger's seizure?

4

MR. PINCUS:

To the extent -- I think the

5

question here is what's -- one question is what's

6

communicated to the passenger.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

MR. PINCUS:

9

Yes.

If the officer had said in

turn, would you mind stepping out of the car so I can

10

ask you some questions unrelated to the stop about your

11

hometown, it seems to us that that statement by the

12

officer would provide some pretty strong indication that

13

the seizure was over and that this was a separate

14

investigation, having nothing to do with the seizure.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But we accept as hornbook

16

law when they are -- when the police are questioning one

17

individual whom they stopped, let's say for a traffic

18

violation, that during that period of seizure, the

19

reasonable period of seizure, the officer can ask

20

questions about other subjects, and that doesn't end the

21

seizure.

22

MR. PINCUS:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

MR. PINCUS:

25

Well, the Court has said that.
Like the -- passenger.

The Court has said that the

officer can ask those questions, but the Court hasn't
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

said what the impact of that is on the seizure.

2

Here the officer certainly believed that her conduct and

3

her words and her conversation, which we don't know how

4

long it lasted or if there were a number of questions,

5

communicated to the -- to the individual, to Mr.

6

Johnson, the idea that this was a consensual encounter.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

I don't want to -- I don't

8

want to take up your whole argument on this hobbyhorse

9

of mine, but I mean my -- my only problem is, I don't

10

see that we have got an evidentiary basis here to say

11

that because of the duration or the mere fact of the

12

questioning, there is a reason to say that as to the

13

passenger, a reasonable passenger could say I am no

14

longer seized, and -- and this encounter is totally

15

consensual.

16
17
18

The -- the officer testified, no question
about it, but the test is subjective.
MR. PINCUS:

It is subjective.

And I guess

19

I would also point, Your Honor, to the Court's decision

20

in Drayton, which dealt with the question in a somewhat

21

different context, at a bus search, and whether or not

22

passengers on a bus would feel that they were seized

23

when there were officers in the front of the bus and

24

they were asking questions.

25

obviously the converse, a lot of the analysis in

And to us, although this is

Drayton, which showed that -- which concluded that there

2

wasn't a seizure there, because of the -- because people

3

ultimately would feel free to come and go, given the

4

nature of the interaction -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then don't you lose

6

under that line of cases?

This is the picture that the

7

officer was painting, or I thought was, to bring this

8

within the "Mind if I search your luggage" category of

9

cases.

10

MR. PINCUS:

Right.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- she's got consent.

12

She doesn't have to -- she says, he said okay, he would

13

get out and talk to me; he said okay when I began to pat

14

him down; it's only in the middle of it he began to

15

wriggle a little bit.

16

MR. PINCUS:

I think it's quite clear,

17

Justice Ginsburg, that there's no question here that -

18

that there was a consent to the pat down.

19

lower courts have concluded and the other side hasn't

20

sought review that there was no consent to the pat down

21

here.

22

I think the

I think the reason that Drayton is -- is

23

relevant is that that's a case where the question for

the Court was would these people feel free to terminate

the encounter; and the Court concluded yes, they would.

And we think, given the different

situation of the passenger, it's true that -- that

3

Brendlin found the passenger seized.

that was to give the passenger a shield, not to be used

as the sword for further interrogation of the passenger.

6

It recognized the reality that at the outset surely the

7

passenger is seized.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To some extent

You're giving up a

If instead of a pat down, the

10

officer said, where were you last night at 10:00

11

o'clock, without Miranda warnings, you would say, well

12

that's just -- that's just fine?

13

MR. PINCUS:

Well, you know, Berkemer says,

14

in the context even of a traffic seizure, Miranda

15

warnings aren't necessarily necessary.

16

saying is that, given the different basis for the

17

seizure here, it's that initial conclusion that at the

18

outset, yes, but that person, unlike the -- unlike the

19

driver, who is the target of the police activity and

20

therefore a reasonable conclusion for the driver is he's

21

seized until the end of that activity, the passenger is

22

not the target of the traffic stop.

a reasonable person would have found -- felt that he

could just say good-bye, and he would have felt this

to get out of the car, and she began to search him for a

that?

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, a couple of

22

things.

I don't think the question is at the moment -

23

clearly, at the moment she was conducting the pat-down

24

search, he was seized.

25

even in the -- in the Terry situation, the person is

But if that were the test, then

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obviously in fact seized at the time that the pat-down

2

search is conducted, but that's not -- the question is

3

whether there was, in the moments before, there was a

4

basis to immobilize that person.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm saying if the

6

question is whether the person reasonably thought at the

7

time of the search he could leave, there's certainly a

8

strong claim here that he could not reasonably or he did

9

not reasonably think he could leave.

As long as that is

10

so, the issue in front of us is when you stop a person,

11

a policeman in the course of your duties, and that

12

person thinks that he cannot reasonably leave, and you

13

believe reasonably that he's armed, can you pat him

down?

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I guess a couple of

18

answers to that, Justice Breyer.

First of all, if this

is just a case about whether the lower court made a

correct determination about whether there was a seizure

21

or not, there's not -- maybe there's not much to the

case.

determination for the reasons that I gave.

24

say, it seems -- it does seem to me, and I was trying to

25

get at this point in response to Justice Souter's

We think the lower court did make the right

44

And I should

question, there are two related questions here.

terms of the duration for which a passenger may be

seized?

One is what is the authority of an officer in

One answer -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if you look at

8

the first part of that, what somebody in Mr. Johnson's

9

position would believe, how does he tell?

I mean, even

10

if the other officer goes to the window and starts

11

asking the driver, "Can I see your insurance papers,"

12

there's no representation that's why we stopped you,

13

that's all we're interested in.

14

him because they have reason to believe that that car

15

was involved in criminal activity.

16

disclose immediately what's involved.

17

They may have stopped

They don't have to

So how can the passenger know why the

18

officer is stopping the person in the first place?

19

Hypothesize that he has been involved in criminal

20

activity.

21

they're just going through this charade to try to get

22

information about it and make the people feel

23

comfortable, whatever.

24

"You don't have insurance papers," that's -- I don't

25

think it's reasonable for the passenger to say, "Oh,

He may think, well, they've caught me and

I mean, just because he says,

2

this is not about me.
MR. PINCUS:

I can get up and leave."
Well, that may not be -- by

3

itself, it may not be enough.

We think, together with

4

the other factors here, the fact -

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. PINCUS:

Well, what else?

Well, the fact that the officer

7

believed, therefore her tone, we have to assume, the way

she -- that she spoke and the way her subjective intent

indicated, that she believed what was going on here was

that it was consensual because of her tone, because that

15

was her intent.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose we go beyond.

I

17

mean, once we go beyond, I become a little at sea as to

18

what the answers are because policemen do things other

19

than investigate crime.

aren't so hypothetical, and I become uncertain about

12

when the policeman can and when he cannot.

13

So, how do you respond?

14

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, I think that

15

-- first of all, a couple of reactions:

First of all, I

16

think that it is important, and I alluded to this

17

earlier, the sliver of cases we're dealing with here are

18

cases in which there is reasonable -- allegedly a

19

reasonable suspicion that someone is armed and

20

dangerous, but not reasonable suspicion that criminal

activity is afoot.

evidence that someone is armed and dangerous, you're

going to have a very -- almost certainly you will have a

Well, you keep emphasizing

3

that this is an urban area, and it seems to me that's

4

going to lead to a test that's impossible to administer.

5

I can think of a lot of circumstances in which the

6

passenger in a car that is stopped will not think for

7

practical reasons that there is much alternative but to

8

wait until the driver is permitted to get back in the

car and drive away.

10

All of those would fall under your urban

category, wouldn't they?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you agree that if you

-- if you lose on the seizure issue, you lose?
MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, we think if

4

-- if there was a seizure, then -- then we think there

5

is a -- a second question, which is even if the person

6

was seized, it's not clear to us that the Court's

7

precedents say that -- that that automatically permits a

8

pat down on armed and dangerousness.

9

My friends rely on Mimms.

The Court in

10

Mimms made very clear -- and, in fact, as we recite on

11

pages 31 to 32 of our brief -- footnote 5 in Mimms says

12

that the reason for the pat down there was that once the

13

driver alighted, the officer had independent reason to

14

suspect criminal activity and present danger.

15

was on that basis that the pat-down search was

16

permissible.

17

And it

So the Court hasn't said that in the context

18

of a roadside stop, once you are seized in this, at

19

least for a passenger, somewhat different sense than a

20

Terry seizure based on articulable suspicion about that

21

person's criminal activity, that is enough.

22

the relevant standard there is supplied by the Court's

23

decisions in -- in Summers and associated cases, which

24

say the officer can control the scene, and that might

25

allow a pat-down search if that's what the officer is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess what about -- I --

I guess if we held that you could do this, this pat-down

search here, it would probably carry forward to any

20

So this is a pretty dramatic

And as I was saying before, "armed and

21

dangerousness", "a reasonable suspicion that a crime is

22

afoot," are mutually reinforcing.

if the State, as here, is arguing that one isn't

your argument assumes a fairly bright line between the

He had admitted to the officer

that he had engaged in burglary.

out, relying only on that prong as the basis for

If they are "armed
