Mr. Crawford.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. CRAWFORD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRAWFORD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There is a significant disagreement between

12

the circuit court over what the government must prove

13

beyond a reasonable doubt to establish the violation of

14

Title 18, United States Code, section 1512(a)(1)(C).

15

This qualifying Federal criminal statute must be

16

construed clearly, consistently, and narrowly.

17

Eleventh Circuit's opinion in this case conflicts with

18

the rulings in factually similar cases:

19

Circuit, Lopez, and the Fifth Circuit, Causey and other

20

circuit precedent.

Yet, the

From the Second

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. CRAWFORD:

Are they all consistent?
It would be our opinion they

23

are all inconsistent, which is what we need from this

24

Court, Your Honor.

25

The Eleventh Circuit erred by placing the
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

word "possible" in the statute and, thus, significantly

2

modifying the plain language of the statute, and by

3

proposing a standard of mere possibility -­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Crawford, what's your

5

standard?

6

say "likely"; sometimes you say "plausible."

7

which is your standard?

8
9

Sometimes you say "certain"; sometimes you

MR. CRAWFORD:

Which -­

Justice Kagan, we would offer

the standard of realistic likelihood, which we cited in

10

our brief on page 17 and page 41, as the appropriate

11

standard in this particular case.

12

comes from Lopez, the Second Circuit case, and also

13

places a higher burden on the government, which we

14

believe is important in order to maintain the

15

Federal/State balance that is required in Federal

16

criminal matters.

17

That is language that

It is a reasonable standard, more reasonable

18

than what we would characterize the governor's -- the

19

government's standard of "reasonable possible."

20

their brief, page 9, 10, and 13, they propose that,

21

which, we would add, differs from what the Eleventh

22

Circuit said.

23

In

If you'll remember, in Lopez, the Eleventh

24

Circuit offered the standard "possible."

25

government, backing away from that a bit, in their
4

Alderson Reporting Company

And yet, the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

briefs, on page 9, 10, and 13, used the phrase

2

"reasonably possible."

3

an improvement on the Eleventh Circuit's mere

4

possibility standard, it still is vague.

5

upsets the -­

6

And while we would concede it is

JUSTICE ALITO:

It still

The statute speaks of the

7

intent of the defendant.

The defendant must intend to

8

prevent the communication of information about a Federal

9

offense or a possible Federal offense to a law

10

enforcement officer who happens to be a Federal law

11

enforcement officer.

12

So, it's all a matter of intent.

Where do you get this question of whether

13

it's possible or likely or certain or whatever that the

14

information will eventually get to a Federal law

15

enforcement officer?

16

is in the mind of the defendant?

17

Isn't it -- isn't it simply what

MR. CRAWFORD:

We believe that

18

subsection (g) of the statute precludes the -- or takes

19

the mens rea element of the defendant off the table with

20

respect to whether or not the person is a law

21

enforcement official or whether or not there's an

22

ongoing Federal criminal investigation.

23

We would agree with you that the law does

24

require that the defendant intend to prevent a

25

communication.

The Eleventh Circuit puts the word
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"possible" in there and says intent to prevent a

2

possible communication.

3

Alito, that we're asking this Court to address.

4

And that's the rub, Justice

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Going -- going back to

5

Justice Alito's question:

6

written to say the intent to preclude a witness from

7

talking to law enforcement officials.

8

simple about a Federal crime, then it wouldn't matter

9

whether it was likely, possible.

Obviously, the statute's not

If it were that

All that we have -­

10

know is that the witness was -- that the killing was

11

intended to stop them from talking to law enforcement,

12

period.

13

different than merely stopping from someone talking to a

14

law enforcement officer, because there has to be some

15

connection to that officer being a Federal officer.

So, clearly, (g) has to have a meaning

16

So, going back to Justice Alito's question,

17

how do you define the intent?

What is the defendant's

18

intent?

19

officer, what does he have to intend?

20

MR. CRAWFORD:

If he doesn't have to know it's a Federal

We believe that you define or

21

would find -- determine the defendant's intent based on

22

the circumstances and the totality of the circumstances

23

of the case.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Articulate what the

intent has to be.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. CRAWFORD:

The intent would have to be a

2

realistic likelihood that there's going to be

3

communication.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does the defendant have

5

to know that?

6

intend to stop the witness from communicating this

7

information to someone that's related to either a

8

Federal judge or a Federal law enforcement agent?

9

That's my question.

Does he have to

What does that have to do

with reasonable likelihood that it would occur?

15

he either intends it or he doesn't intend it.

16

MR. CRAWFORD:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean,
What -­

The reasonable likelihood

18

that this person who was killed -- now, you say

19

"realistic likelihood."

20

MR. CRAWFORD:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is correct.
The realistic likelihood

22

that this person who was killed might have gone to a

23

Federal officer doesn't at all establish that the intent

24

of the person who killed him was to prevent him from

25

going to that officer, does it?

MR. CRAWFORD:

We -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it seems to me you

have to stand on one stool or the other one.

4

it -- it relates to intent, as the statute says, or all

5

there has to be is a reasonable likelihood that this

6

person who was killed would have gone to a Federal

7

official.

8

MR. CRAWFORD:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Either

Well -­

MR. CRAWFORD:

Which is it?
It is our position that we

11

are trying to determine or the jury has to determine a

future act.

14

standard should we ask the jury to use in order to

determine whether the government has provided evidence

that there was going to be a future act prevented?

so, it is -­

your -- your realistic likelihood test would be quite

2

reasonable, but it doesn't say that.

3

the -- the killing has to be with the intent of

4

preventing him from going.

5

MR. CRAWFORD:

It says that

The intent to prevent the

6

communication, the communication in the future is what

7

is modified by the word "prevent."

8

we're -- that's what we're struggling with, Your Honor.

9

We're trying to come up with a standard as to what -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so, that's what

Mr. Crawford, do you think

11

this is right, that the statute says that the person has

12

to prevent the communication to a law enforcement

13

officer?

14

officer, in fact, has to be a Federal law enforcement

15

officer, but because of subsection (g), the statute does

16

not require that the person intend the communication to

17

be to a Federal law enforcement officer, and that's what

18

we're struggling over, correct?

The statute also says that the law enforcement

19

MR. CRAWFORD:

That is correct, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and in doing that -­

21

I mean, I guess my question to you is the same as my

22

question to the Government, which is where any of these

23

standards come from.

24

not provide a lot of guidance, but how does one pick

25

between a realistic likelihood or a possibility or a

And I agree that the statute does

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

theoretical possibility or any of those things?

2

MR. CRAWFORD:

We would urge the Court to

3

pick a particular standard, if you're going to, to help

4

us interpret this statute that would strike the

5

appropriate balance between State and Federal criminal

6

jurisdiction.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why don't we pick the

8

standard that is set out in the text of the statute?

9

Let me give you this example:

10

Let's -- let's hypothesize a very cold,

11

calculating, rational defendant who is planning a

12

Federal crime, let's say the hijacking of an airplane

13

over international waters, and this defendant finds out

14

that his mother has learned about the plot.

15

says, well, you know, I think there's a one-tenth of

16

1 percent chance that mom is going to go to the FBI and

17

turn me in, but in order to prevent that, I'm going to

18

kill her.

19

purpose of preventing her from going to the FBI, even

20

though I think very, very, very unlikely she's going to

21

do that.

Now, he

I intend -- I kill her with the -- for the

22

Hasn't that defendant violated this statute?

23

MR. CRAWFORD:

We believe the jury would

24

make that determination as to whether or not it was

25

likely, realistically likely that mom would report him
10

to Federal law enforcement officials.

trying to do, is give the lower courts or the -- or the

jury -­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's what we're

I don't -- I think Justice

5

Alito can protect his own question, but I don't think

6

you've answered it.

7

He's asked you whether or not as a matter of law,

8

assuming that you're a juror and you read the statute

9

and you were instructed on the words of the statute and

10

you have Justice Alito's hypothetical, what result?

11
12
13
14
15

You've put in realistic likelihood.

MR. CRAWFORD:
intent?

The result of the question of

Or what are you asking the result of -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The reliability under the

statute under Justice Alito's hypothetical.
MR. CRAWFORD:

Then we would say, yes, that

16

the defendant could be found to have violated the

17

statute under that particular hypothetical.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

Then Justice

19

Alito's next question -- again, he can protect his own

20

line of questioning -- but what does that have to do

21

with realistic likelihood?

22

likelihood; it was only a half of 1 percent chance that

23

the communication would be made.

24

realistic likelihood off the table, and if it's off the

25

table, you have to give us a different test.

There's no realistic

So, that takes

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. CRAWFORD:

Well, then, I would go with

2

the beyond a reasonable doubt that the government must

3

prove in any criminal matter.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what I wondered.

5

You haven't really argued that, so maybe I'm missing

6

something, and this question may be better for the other

7

side, but this statute, as you go through it, has some

8

elements.

9

The first are facts about the world, killing

10

people; the second has to do with intent, and then they

11

talk about all these different things to stop him from

12

going to a Federal officer; the third says no state of

13

mind need be proved with respect to the fact he works

14

for the Feds.

15

So, therefore, it's not part of intent.

Now, if it's a circumstance that is an

16

element of the offense and it is not part of the intent

17

of the defendant, then isn't it an element, like all

18

other elements, that you have to prove beyond a

19

reasonable doubt?

20

MR. CRAWFORD:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

We would agree.

That is -­

You didn't argue it, so

22

nobody's ever adopted this, so I feel I might be barking

23

up the wrong tree.

24

leaf on the tree that's going to give me the answer I

25

need, which is why I'm wrong, but -- but did you -­

Now, I grant you, you're not the

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you've researched this and haven't really argued this

2

point.

So, why not?

3

MR. CRAWFORD:

Well, we understand.

And -­

4

and we are assuming, of course, that all elements of the

5

offense have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

6

What we've tried to do is provide the Court with some

7

sort of standard that the jury could be instructed as

8

how to prove that fourth element, and that is this

9

future communication.

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You think a realistic

likelihood must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt?

12

MR. CRAWFORD:

We do.

underlying Federal offense?

Does the defendant have to know

MR. CRAWFORD:

No, Your Honor, they do not.

as you take your officer as you find him, and we believe

Why is that?

Correct.
I would have thought

you'd say there's a negative implication that intent has

to be shown with respect to everything else, including

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

whether or not this is a possible Federal crime.

2

MR. CRAWFORD:

Well, we -- we are willing to

3

concede that there was a possible Federal crime that was

4

occurring at the time of Officer Horner's death.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are you willing to

6

concede that the defendant knew that?

7

MR. CRAWFORD:

I'm willing to concede the

8

defendant -- it need not be proved that the defendant

9

knew that.

10

Now, if the government can establish

11

evidence of that, we believe that goes to the

12

defendant's intent and to a different element, but the

13

government need not prove that because we believe the

14

subsection (g) takes that off the table.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

The issue -- the issue here

16

is the sufficiency of the evidence.

17

question is whether a reasonable juror could adopt a

Now, what's wrong with that view of the
facts?
MR. CRAWFORD:

We believe, Your Honor, that

10

basically federalize murder, that there is always going

11

to be some overlapping Federal crime that is possible,

12

or the possible commission of, and if that becomes the

13

standard or the reading or the interpretation of 1512,

then every case is going to be allowed to be

it correctly, when you were serving on the Third

happen if you were dealing with a Federal offense that

was a distinctly Federal offense, that really didn't

Would that itself be sufficient to support a prosecution

under this statute?

MR. CRAWFORD:

It would be -- it would make

the government's burden easier, because it is more

we're looking for a rule from this Court that will

narrow that and keep that -- that balance of Federal and

State criminal jurisprudence where it needs to be.

you're taking the position that simply because we

the argument was made at the Eleventh Circuit, that

2

whether the sufficiency of the evidence issue was raised

3

there, and the Eleventh Circuit chose not to rule on

4

that, but chose to rule on a statutory construction of

5

1512 -- that then, when this Court granted cert, that

6

basically took that issue off the table.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, what you're

8

suggesting is that we announce the standard, hopefully

9

different than the courts below for your sake, and then

10

remand to then let the court apply the new standard?

12

MR. CRAWFORD:
Or -­

13
14

That is one possibility.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if it's not, what's

the other?

15

MR. CRAWFORD:

The other is, is to overrule

16

the Eleventh Circuit and with instructions to enter a

17

judgment of acquittal.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How could we do that

19

unless we found there was plain error?

20

say there's plain error when this question has vexed so

many courts?

MR. CRAWFORD:

And how can we

I don't know at this

particular point, but I do know that we have a problem

in the circuits, that the standards being applied are

across the board; and we need a bright line, hopefully a

bright-line rule, that will help us in the courts below

so we can do our job better.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have to say to you

4

that even if a bright-line rule is announced, the real

5

work begins in deciding what evidence is sufficient to

6

meet that burden.

7

MR. CRAWFORD:

Understood, but it's our

8

position that any of the rules that have been proposed,

except maybe the mere possibility, which is overbroad,

there still is nothing on this record that is going to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it please the Court:

2

When Congress enacted section 1512(a)(1)(C),

3

it sought to protect the integrity of Federal criminal

4

investigations and prosecutions.

5

the government to prove four things -- an actus reus, a

6

mens rea and two Federal nexus elements, one of which is

7

at issue in this case.

8

mens rea that's common to every prosecution under

9

section 1512(a)(1)(C) is an intent to prevent the

10

communication of information to a law enforcement

11

officer.

12

that information relate to the commission or possible

13

commission of a Federal offense; and the second Federal

14

nexus element, the one at issue in this case, requires

15

that there's a reasonable possibility that the

16

information would have been communicated to a Federal

17

officer if the murder had not occurred.

The statute requires

The actus reus is murder, the

The first Federal nexus element requires that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, where does that

19

reasonable possibility standard come from, Ms.

20

Harrington?

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, it comes from trying

22

to construe all the different relevant provisions of the

23

statute to make sense together.

24

specifies that a defendant has to have an intent to

25

prevent the communication of the relevant information to

Section (a)(1)(C)

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a law enforcement officer; section 1515 tells us that

2

the law enforcement officer has to be a Federal law

3

enforcement officer, that's the definitional section;

4

and then section 1512(g)(2) specifies that the

5

government doesn't need to prove any state of mind about

6

the fact that the officer is a Federal officer.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me give you a

8

hypothetical similar to the one that I gave your -- your

9

friend.

Two men are sitting on a park bench planning

10

the commission of a Federal crime, hijacking of an

11

airplane, and they think they're by themselves; so

12

they're talking about this, and then after they've had a

13

discussion they turn around and they see there's

14

somebody standing very close by; and so they say we have

15

to kill this person to prevent him from going to the

16

FBI, and so they do, and they're prosecuted under this

17

statute.

18

the person didn't speak a word of English, only spoke

19

Russian.

20

that this person was going to report that to the FBI or

21

any law enforcement officer.

22

or not?

23

But then at trial they bring out evidence that

So there wasn't any possibility whatsoever

MS. HARRINGTON:

Violation of this statute

Yes.

In our view there are

24

two different ways to prove a violation of the statute.

25

One is if you just read section (a)(1)(C), a natural
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reading of that section is that if a -- if defendant has

2

a specific intent to prevent a communication to a

3

Federal officer specifically, then that's a violation of

4

the statute.

5

What subsection (g)(2) tells us is that you

6

don't need to prove a Federal officer's specific intent

7

for every violation of the statute, but if you can prove

8

that, then that's enough.

9

no evidence that the Petitioner had a specific intent as

And so in this case there's

10

to a Federal officer, but, for example, if Officer

11

Horner had said, hey, I'm the FBI or hey, I'm calling

12

the FBI right now, and then he had killed him, that

13

would have been enough whether it were true or not.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So a realistic probability

15

relates only to the question of whether it would have

16

been conveyed to a Federal officer as opposed to some

17

other law enforcement officer?

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes, that's right, and in

19

section (g)(2) it's described as a circumstance that the

20

Federal, that the officer in question is a Federal

21

officer, and so that's -- that's a fact in the world

22

that the jury needs to make a determination about.

23

course, it's a fact in the world about -­

I interrupted you.
26

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's okay.

I was going

2

to say it's a fact in the world about something that by

3

-- by the design of the defendant is never going to

4

happen.

5

when you don't have the Federal officer's specific

6

intent, is a communication that's never going to happen,

7

and so the jury has to make a reasonable prediction

8

about what could have happened in the absence of the

9

murder.

The communication that's at issue when you -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What do you see -­
Suppose in Justice Alito's

12

hypothetical, two guys on the park bench, and they find

13

out that the man with the gray coat behind them was

14

listening.

They say, we have to get the man with the

15

gray coat.

They turn around and they shoot a man with a

16

gray coat, but it's a different man.

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

listening.

What result?

If they -- if they -­
It wasn't the man that was

They got the wrong guy.

20

MS. HARRINGTON:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MS. HARRINGTON:

But if -- if the same -­
The intent was there.
So they say, we have to

23

shoot this guy to keep him from talking to the FBI?

24

That's still a violation of the statute, because they

25

have the requisite intent as to a Federal officer.
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then your realistic

2

possibility -- the realistic probability standard just

3

falls out of your test.

4

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, just to be clear, the

5

realistic possibility part only comes in where the

6

defendant doesn't have a specific intent as to the

7

Federal officer specifically.

8

hypothetical, the intent was to prevent a communication

9

to the FBI in particular, and if a defendant has that

So, in Justice Alito's

10

specific Federal officer, a specific intent, it doesn't

11

matter whether it might have happened, would have

12

happened, could have happened.

13

Where the reasonable possibility standard

14

comes in is in cases like this one, where the defendant

15

has an intent to prevent a communication to a law

16

enforcement officer for sure, but doesn't have any

17

specific intent as to the Federal nature.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think it's very

19

difficult to instruct the jury, to say, now, sometimes

20

there's realistic probability, sometimes there isn't.

21

just don't know what this jury instruction is going to

22

look like.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think the jury

24

instruction would say, you know, you need to make a

25

determination about what could have happened if the
28

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

murder hadn't occurred, and if you find that there is a

2

reasonable possibility that there would have been a

3

communication with the Federal officer -- and that can

4

be proved in any number of different ways in any

5

particular case -- then you find that there's a

6

violation of the statute.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why do you -- why do you

8

need that?

I mean, we're always talking here about -­

9

about murders of a witness, right?

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're always talking

12

about a murder that was intended to remove somebody who

13

could incriminate the killer -­

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- for some other crime.

16

Why isn't it enough to say you killed that person to

17

prevent the disclosure of the crime, and if the crime

18

was a Federal crime, the disclosure you were preventing

19

was a disclosure to a Federal Court or to a Federal

20

police officer?

21

Why -- why do you have to create a -- a

22

reasonable likelihood that this person, this particular

23

person, would have gone to a Federal officer rather than

24

a State officer?

25

prevent disclosure of the crime that the crime was a

Isn't it enough to kill the person to

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Federal crime?

2

Why isn't that the test?

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think that's an

3

interpretation of the statute the government could live

4

with, but the effect of that -­

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

more than live with it.

7

it.

8
9

Oh, the government could

The government could wallow in

MS. HARRINGTON:

But that -- indeed.

But

that is a more aggressive reading than the reading we're

10

offering, because Congress went to the extra step of

11

defining "law enforcement officer" to mean "Federal law

12

enforcement officer."

13

positing would essentially read that out of the statute.

14

So the interpretation you're

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but the statute reads

15

it out of the statute.

16

the intent element does -- does not require that you

17

know it's a Federal officer or that you know it's a

18

Federal judicial proceeding.

It says in (g) that you don't -­

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

The reason -­

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why isn't it enough that

21

you -- you kill somebody to prevent the disclosure of a

22

crime that's a Federal crime?

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

I mean, Congress could have

24

written the statute that way, but when Congress defined

25

"law enforcement officer" to mean "Federal law
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

enforcement officer," presumably, they meant that to

2

mean something.

3

take the Federal nature of the law enforcement officer

4

out of the mens rea part of the offense, but they

5

describe it as a circumstance, and so that presumably

6

is -- has to relate to something that could have

7

happened in the world in the absence of the murder.

8
9

And in (g)(2), what they do is they

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't -- if you have

a Federal -- underlying Federal offense, and I gather

10

you don't think -- that just needs to be shown as a

11

matter of fact, right?

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Correct.
No intent with

respect to that.

15

Isn't it always likely that there's going to

16

be a reasonable possibility, reasonable likelihood, that

17

the communication is going to go to a Federal officer?

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

I -­

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's a Federal

20

offense.

21

that's the person who is going to try the case in every

22

case.

23

If the communication covers Federal judges,

MS. HARRINGTON:

Except that not all crimes

24

that could be prosecuted as Federal crimes are

25

prosecuted as Federal crimes.

For example, there are -­

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

most drug crimes are prosecuted by State authorities

2

rather than by Federal authorities, even though -­

3
4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, obviously not

all of them.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not all of them.

If -­

So you think that -­

7

that it's not an element of the crime, but that feature

8

of the prosecution depends upon what percentage of the

9

crimes are prosecuted Federally as opposed to by State

10

law?

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

No, it doesn't.

And I

12

think in a particular case, if the drug crime is the

13

underlying crime, that could serve as the predicate

14

crime.

15

has reason to conclude, and jurors generally don't

16

understand the way that the Federal system works

17

vis-à-vis the State system.

18

for the jury to think that the information might have

19

gone to Federal officers, then they wouldn't have a

20

basis for a conviction under the statute.

21

But I think that what matters is what the jury

And so if there's no reason

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can you instruct the

22

jury that the underlying crime here is a Federal crime

23

and then say the only thing they have to determine under

24

some standard is whether or not the communication would

25

be to a Federal officer?
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. HARRINGTON:

You could -- you could give

2

that instruction, but I -- I think -- I took the

3

hypothetical from Justice Scalia to be that you wouldn't

4

need to show that there's any -- any chance that the

5

communication would have gone to a Federal officer.

6

I think that would read the Federal officer definition

7

out of the statute, if all that was required was that

8

the offense be a Federal offense.

9

And then could you just say, well, you know,

10

in theory -- and it's true that anybody who has

11

information about a commission of a Federal offense,

12

theoretically, could someday choose to give that

13

information to a Federal officer, but that -­

14

And

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let's say the case -- that

15

this case arises -- exactly this case arises in two

16

different adjacent jurisdictions.

17

sheriff and the local district attorney hate the Feds.

18

They never talk to them unless they absolutely have to.

19

And so if Officer Horner had taken the information that

20

he learned to the local sheriff, there's no chance

21

whatsoever that they would have referred that over to

22

the FBI or the U.S. attorney for prosecution in Federal

23

Court, so no realistic possibility there.

24
25

In one, the local

In the other jurisdiction, right next door,
the local sheriff and the local DA don't want to be

2

those over to the FBI and the U.S. attorney, so there's

3

a very high probability the information would have

4

gotten to the Federal authorities.

5
6

They send all of

Now, would this case come out differently
depending on the jurisdiction?

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think it would, Justice

8

Alito.

I think in the first case, the jury wouldn't

9

have a reasonable basis to conclude that the information

10

might have gone to Federal officers in the absence of

11

the murder.

12

reasonable basis to make that inference.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

In the second case, they would have a very

I don't see what that has

to do with the defendant's intent.

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

It doesn't have anything to

16

do with the defendant's intent.

17

different ways, in our view, to prove a violation of the

18

statute.

19

about preventing communication to a specifically Federal

20

officer.

21

mind, that's one way to prove a violation of the

22

statute.

23

Again, there are two

One is if the defendant has a specific intent

If the Federal nature of the officer is in his

If he doesn't have that specific intent,

24

which is going to be in most cases, honestly, that are

25

prosecuted under the statute, then you have to prove
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that there's some reasonable possibility that that

2

communication would have happened -­

3
4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay, where do we get

this -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then you have to change

6

your answer -- right?

7

hypothetical where they shoot the wrong man.

8
9

Maybe you don't -- to my

MS. HARRINGTON:

But in your hypothetical,

which I think you borrowed from Justice Alito, there was

10

a specific intent to prevent a communication with the

11

FBI, and so there they have the Federal officer specific

12

intent.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't it rather strange,

14

trials?

15

in a criminal trial, you know, whether this witness who

16

was -- whether there's a reasonable likelihood that this

17

person who was killed would have gone to a Federal law

18

enforcement authority rather than the State law

19

enforcement authority?

20

It's such a weird issue to submit to the jury

MS. HARRINGTON:

But the reason it's weird

21

is because the design of the defendant in killing the

22

victim is to prevent something from happening, and then

23

the jury is asked to make a -- make a determination of

24

whether that thing might have happened or not.

25

And so you don't -- if you place too high a
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

burden on the government, you're basically giving a

2

defendant who acts efficiently and early in the criminal

3

process a leg up, because you're -- if you require the

4

government to prove that it's more likely than not that

5

the communication in question would have happened with

6

the Federal officer, then what you're doing is you're

7

not giving sufficient protection to those communications

8

to Federal officers that would cause a Federal

9

investigation to be initiated.

10

Right?

You're -- it's

not how -­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm a little bit

12

confused.

Tell me exactly why you see a difference

13

between "realistically likely" or "reasonably possible."

14

Tell me -- tell me what fine line exists between those

15

two and what quantum of evidence more you would need

16

under one as opposed to the other.

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I guess what we

18

see -- where we see the -- sort of the ballpark is,

19

either the government needs to prove that it's more

20

likely than not that it would have happened, or they

21

just need to prove that it's a reasonable possibility.

22

And so we would opt for the second of those two options.

23

You could -­

Tell me what the

difference in proof would look like.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. HARRINGTON:

The difference in proof -­

2

I mean, it depends on the particular case.

3

5

underway, and in those cases, this element -­

"Likely" is proven?

Easy to prove, yes.
Okay.

So the cases that are at

10

issue are cases like this, where the murder happens

11

almost contemporaneously with the Federal criminal

12

activity.

13

even think about initiating an investigation, and so -­

14

but those initial communications are vital to protecting

15

the Federal interest and protecting the integrity of

16

Federal investigations.

17

And in those cases, nobody's had a chance to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but you still had

to prove, didn't you, or wouldn't you have a measure of

19

obligation to have a witness get up on the stand and

20

say, the FBI always looks at bank robberies?

21

absence of that, aren't we asking the jury to speculate

22

that, merely because it can be a Federal crime -- bank

23

robbery can be both a State and a Federal -- that it's

24

reasonably possible it would go, not everything you

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

And if I -- I would

3

like to try to separate.

4

is the element of the crime, how -- how do we define it,

5

then what -- what is the evidence you would introduce to

6

satisfy that element.

7

There is the question of what

In this case, certainly the government could

8

have introduced evidence that -- that local law

9

enforcement officers report all evidence of bank

10

robberies to the FBI.

11

They didn't introduce that evidence.

12

That would have been enough.

What they introduced instead was that when

13

local law enforcement officers later got the information

Miss Harrington, we -­

we've gotten along for over 200 years without this

particular Federal law, and I, therefore, am not

inclined to give it a -- a sweeping broad

interpretation, and I think it's so weird to submit to

Why isn't an entirely satisfactory reading

2

of this statute the following, that if you -- if,

3

indeed, you have in mind specifically the FBI or a

4

Federal proceeding, you're done?

5

have in mind specifically a Federal proceeding, but you

6

have in mind a particular proceeding, which is a Federal

7

proceeding, or a particular officer who is a Federal

8

officer, then you're done, but anything else isn't

9

covered?

10

If, however, you don't

So the intent has to be the intent to stop a

11

particular proceeding or -- or to stop the person going

12

to a particular officer.

13

or if the officer is Federal, you have the -- but

14

otherwise, the laws that we've lived under for 210 years

15

will continue to apply, and -- and -- and this new

16

Federal statute will not apply.

17

If that proceeding is Federal

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, Justice Scalia, I

18

think it would be insufficiently protective of the

19

Federal interests to say that you could only -- that you

20

would look at what the defendant had in mind about what

21

the chain of communication might be if he didn't murder

22

the person who was witnessing the crime.

23

defendants don't think, wow, you know, if Officer Horner

24

is going to call the dispatch, the dispatch is going to

call, you know, the other person in the Haines City

2

they're going to call the Federal law enforcement

3

officers, most defendants wouldn't have -- wouldn't be

4

thinking down that -- sort of down the chain of

5

communication that way.

6

But the statute criminalizes killing someone

7

to prevent the communication, not a communication, not a

8

particular communication, but the communication by any

9

person of information relating to the commission of a

10

Federal crime.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suspect that what this

12

mainly addressed is -- is killing of witnesses, which

13

has become very common in some jurisdictions, witnesses

14

in criminal trials, and you know darn well what trial is

15

involved.

16

it's a Federal trial and you kill the witness, you're -­

17

you're liable under this statute.

It's a trial that's already underway, and if

18

What -- what is covered beyond that is if -­

19

if you know that the information is going to be given to

20

a Federal officer, then they have you also, but I don't

21

know why we should read the statute any more broadly

22

than that and -- and have these weird questions

23

submitted to the jury how likely was it that this -­

24

this dead person would have gone to a Federal officer

25

rather than a State officer and -- and inquire into the
40

Alderson Reporting Company

question that Justice Alito asked, you know, how is

2

there a friendly relationship between State and local

3

officials so that the State official would -- I don't

4

want to get into that.

5

I don't think the juries do.

MS. HARRINGTON:

I mean, many of these

6

things are not -- in many of these cases, this is not an

7

element that's difficult to prove.

8

a witness in a particular investigation or is going to

testify in a particular trial who has been murdered,

investigations to be initiated.

14

15

But Congress was also trying to

Those are important

If you allow murders of people who witness

16

crimes in order to prevent them from reporting that

17

information to law enforcement officers, where the

18

reporting of that information would have caused a

19

Federal investigation to be initiated, then you're

20

insufficiently protecting the Federal interest in

21

prosecuting Federal crimes.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Harrington, what would

23

be -- what would happen if instead of Officer Horner,

24

the custodian of the cemetery had come across these

25

people and the exact same thing had happened, would you
41

Alderson Reporting Company

then say that there would be -- that there would be a

2

prosecution -- there could be a prosecution under this

3

statute?

4

MS. HARRINGTON:

Not unless the custodian of

5

the cemetery was on his cell phone saying I'm calling

6

911.

So, if we -- what's important -­

7
8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So is that the difference,

that Officer Horner was on his cell phone?

9

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, in terms of whether

10

the evidence that was presented in this case was

11

sufficient, it was sufficient because the jury knew two

12

things.

13

definitely would have communicated the information

14

that's relevant in the case to local law enforcement

15

officers; and second, they knew that when local law

16

enforcement officers later acquired that information

17

from other sources, they shared it with Federal

18

officers.

19

They knew, first, that Officer Horner

So if you didn't know the first step, if you

20

didn't know that definitely the person who was killed

21

would have communicated to local law enforcement

22

officers, then there wouldn't be a reason -- first of

23

all, you might not have -- have the correct specific

intent to prevent communication with a law enforcement

interesting.

doesn't perfectly map on to the problem in this case, of

course, because there is subsection (g)(2), which

specifically says you take intent out of the equation.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure I

11

We -- we -- there's no proof that this particular

12

officer who was shot was going to pick up the phone to

13

the FBI.

14

called his fellow officers, and somebody, probably his

15

supervisor, or the DA's office was going to make the

16

decision whether to call the FBI.

17

different from the cemetery caretaker, who is going to

18

call it in probably to 9-1-1, and he doesn't

particularly have an idea of who's going to get involved

20

or not because it's really not his issue.

21

a difference between those two situations?

22

the question, going back to what Justice Breyer asked,

23

was, what's the likelihood that this is going to get

reasonably possible?

He may have overheard this.

He would have

MS. HARRINGTON:

attach the word reasonably to possible to sort of to

wall off cases that are theoretically possible, right?

So again, we would like to cover odd occurrences but not

outlandish occurrences, so it's not just anything that's

possible.

8

think it might have happened in this case.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's -- the jury has to have a reason to

So I guess then your

10

burden is only to show that it's a Federal offense,

offense or anything that could be termed a Federal

14

offense.

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

With respect, Your Honor,

16

we don't -- we don't think that's correct.

17

there needs to be a reason for the jury to think that if

this communication had not been prevented, the

information eventually would have gone to Federal

officers.

-- maybe I asked this already, but why isn't that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

difference was between the State and the Federal

2

penalties?

3

MS. HARRINGTON:

I don't know the

difference.

I mean, Gamble when he was -- hew was

indicted eventually for 14 Federal offenses to which he

pled guilty and was sentenced initially to life plus 107

years.

11

prosecuted in State court as well.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So Ms. Harrington, suppose

13

Officer Horner had come to the scene and instead of

14

seeing evidence that there was a robbery about to occur,

had seen evidence only of drug use.

And just to be

clear, we're not saying that that communication that

happened in 2002 is the communication that was prevented

or intended to be prevented.

12

the fact when local cops got the information in 2002,

13

they shared it with Federal officers, that that's a

14

reason for the jury to infer that they would have done

15

the same thing if they had gotten the information -­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What we're saying is that

You're saying the fact that

17

they got this information 4 years later, shared it with

18

law enforcement officers after they knew that a murder

had occurred as a result of an incident would be the

same kind of inquiry that they would make at that time?

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, I think -­
Before the murder?
Well, of course, we don't

24

know what would have happened, because Officer Horner

25

was murdered to prevent any of this from happening, but
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

in fact, the evidence before the jury suggested that it

wasn't the murder that motivated them to share the

information with Federal officers; it was one of the

4

underlying robberies.

5

Inn, which was a Federal offense.

6

limitations had run on that in State court, and so they

charges they could bring against Chris Gamble.

9

they decided to share that information with Federal

officers.

11

So it wasn't the murder that made the

12

difference; it was one of the underlying Federal

13

offenses that was charged against -- as one of the

14

predicate crimes against Petitioner here.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would -- would you not

16

acknowledge that the statute is vague enough that the

17

intent which it requires could be either the intent to

18

prevent testimony from being given to a particular

19

Federal proceeding or to a particular Federal officer or

20

the specific intent to withhold it from a proceeding or

21

an officer who happens to be or which happens to be

22

Federal, but which the defendant is not aware is

23

Federal?

24
25

It could bear that meaning, couldn't it?
MS. HARRINGTON:

It could, but Justice

Scalia, I want to point out that subsections (A) and (B)
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of (a)(1), those are the provisions that talk about

2

official proceedings.

3

the provision that's at issue here, does not talk about

4

official proceedings.

5

information to Federal -- to law enforcement officers or

6

to judges.

7

by reading, sort of a plain reading of those provisions

8

together means that for subsection (C), you don't need

9

to have an official proceeding that was in anyone's mind

10

Subsection (a)(1)(C), which is

It talks about transferring

And so there doesn't -- I think by -- just

or that was underway at the time.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, I acknowledge that, but

12

a particular judge or -- or the conduct of a Federal

13

proceeding, it could -- it could require specific intent

14

of a proceeding or a judge or an officer which happens

15

to be a Federal officer.

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

It could, yes, and again, I

17

think if the defendant has a Federal officer specific

18

intent in mind when he commits the murder, that's

19

enough.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if a defendant has in

21

mind a particular officer, then there's a potential

22

violation of the statute, but if the defendant just

23

kills for the purpose of preventing this from going to

24

any Federal -- any officer who might happen to be a

25

Federal officer, then there's no violation under this -­

Federal officer intent.

question as it was put to me.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. CRAWFORD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CRAWFORD:

Justice Kagan, if I could go

to a question that you posed:

If this Court were to

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

find that the mere presence of a possible Federal

2

offense was appropriate to give Federal jurisdiction

3

under this particular statute, then I would ask the

4

Court to consider the effect that that would have on

5

criminal practice throughout this country.

6

There is significant overlap between Federal

7

and State criminal laws, and if we are simply going to

8

confer Federal jurisdiction on this particular statute

9

because of the mere possibility of a Federal offense,

10

you have created a huge exception and, we would

11

respectfully submit, create problems for that delicate

12

balance between State and Federal.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What's delicate about

14

robbery?

I mean, robbery is completely a Federal crime,

15

and that was what the -- that was what Horner observed,

16

and they were -- they were planning for the robbery the

17

next day.

18

MR. CRAWFORD:

Justice Ginsburg, we would

19

agree that bank robbery is a Federal crime.

The

20

question is:

21

would show there was going to be any Federal involvement

22

in that Federal crime?

23

prosecuted in the State system under their State crimes,

24

but absent some Federal involvement, you have

25

obliterated that line between State and Federal criminal

Is there any evidence in the record that

21

term, but not every oddball example.

22

24

something that rules out the oddball examples.

it's an oddball example, you can't hold him guilty of

2

that, if it turns out that in this case the Federal

3

example is an oddball example.

4

My question really is to you:

If you win on

5

that, then are you going to go back and argue there was

6

not one piece of evidence whatsoever that there was any

7

reasonable likelihood that the Feds would investigate

8

your case?

9

MR. CRAWFORD:

We would argue that there

10

is -- the record is insufficient to establish reasonable

11

likelihood of Federal involvement.

12

any better than that.

13
