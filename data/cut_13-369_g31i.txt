 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

5

Instruments. 

6

 Mr. Vandenberg.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. VANDENBERG 

8
9
10
11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

it please the Court. 
 The Patent Act requires particular and 

12

distinct claims, but the claim in this case is not 

13

particular and distinct.  It is ambiguous because it has 

14

two reasonable readings with very different claim 

15

scopes, even after all of the interpretive tools are 

16

applied. 

17

 Such ambiguous claims defeat the public 

18

notice function which is at the heart of Section 112, 

19

and they increase litigation.  They cause more claim 

20

construction disputes, and they cause more reversals of 

21

district court claim construction rulings. 

22

 Taken all together, ambiguous claims and the 

23

Federal circuit's test allowing ambiguous claims defeats 

24

the very purpose of Section 112 and the patent system, 

25

namely, to encourage and promote innovation by others

3

Alderson Reporting Company

after the first patent issues. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why is this claim 

3

ambiguous?  It's evident that these electrodes have to 

4

be close enough so that the user's hand contacts both 

5

electrodes, but separate enough to heap  keep 

6

electrodes distinct.  Why isn't that sufficiently 

7

definite? 

8
9

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, if  if that 

were the only reasonable construction, then that may 

10

suffice.  However, here, the other reasonable 

11

construction is that the spaced relationship is a 

12

special spacing that causes the electrodes to achieve 

13

the desired result.  And that was the construction that 

14

the majority found at the Federal circuit, namely, that 

15

spaced relationship is not what it sounds like, namely, 

16

any spacing, but rather is a special spacing that is 

17

derived by trialanderror testing to get the spacing 

18

just right so that the electrodes detect 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't think the 

20

majority or the  or the concurrence or the other side 

21

disagreed with that.  The only question was whether it 

22

was part of the specifications or not.  I thought that 

23

was the only difference between them.  They both agreed 

24

ultimately that the electrodes had to cancel out  was 

25

it the EMGs?

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Correct. 
So they both agreed that 

3

that was part of the scope.  The only issue was, was it 

4

part of the specifications or part of the claims,no?  But 

5

both of them make up the scope of the patent. 

6

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, we would submit 

7

that the disagreements between the judges and, in fact, 

8

between Biosig itself went to the scope of the claim, 

9

namely, does the scope of the claim cover all ways of 

10

achieving the desired result no matter how the 

11

electrodes are spaced.  That's one possible reading. 

12

 The other possible reading is that the 

13

claims cover only a special spacing of the electrodes to 

14

achieve the desired result.  And why that matters is if 

15

you think of the inventor in 1994 who invents a new 

16

material for electrodes, and this new material achieves 

17

the desired result of detecting equal muscle signals on 

18

the left and right side, regardless of the spacing of 

19

the electrode.  So it doesn't matter where you put the 

20

electrodes, as long as you can touch them, this new 

21

material achieved the  the desired goal. 

22

 That inventor would not know in 1994 if they 

23

infringed or not, because if the claims had the 

24

interpretation that the majority eventually gave them, 

25

namely, that the spaced relationship has this functional

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

limitation and it must be the result of this 

2

trialanderror balancing, there'd be no infringement. 

3

But if spaced relationship meant any spacing, then there 

4

would be infringement.  So that is the exact type of 

5

zone of uncertainty that United Carbon warned against 

6

and which deters the innovation. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But it can't mean 

8

any spacing, because anyone skilled in the art would 

9

know the hand has to cover it.  So you're basically 

10

talking about a fairly narrow range between one side of 

11

the hand and the other and not too close together  but 

12

they don't  don't work.  And that seems to me that 

13

someone skilled in the art can just try a couple of 

14

things and see where  where the trial and error. 

15

Trial and error makes  could mean a very difficult 

16

thing, like Edison discovering what works in a light 

17

bulb.  But here you've got a very limited range and 

18

someone skilled in the art will just, well, let's try 

19

it, you know, close to the middle, let's try it to so 

20

far apart.  But it's not any spaced relationship. 

21

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

And that's correct, Your 

22

Honor, and I do  when I refer to any spacing, it's 

23

really a shorthand for any spacing that is narrow enough 

24

so that the hand can actually touch both electrodes but 

25

not touching.  So I agree that under each interpretation

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it makes sense that the electrodes have to be touchable 

2

by a single hand, and they can't be touching each other 

3

or there'd simply be a single electrode. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What would be the 

5

purpose of the invention if it were only covering 

6

spacing without the function of canceling the EMG?  I 

7

can't understand, if I read this patent, what it would 

8

do unless you add its function. 

9

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, Your Honor, the 

10

purpose of the patent is it would cover possibly, again, 

11

all techniques for achieving the desired function.  So 

12

again, going back to the invention of the new material, 

13

if the inventor comes up with a specific way of 

14

achieving the result, and here they came up with trial 

15

and error spacing, they didn't describe that in the 

16

patent.  That didn't  that wasn't described by the 

17

inventor until 15 years later.  But nevertheless, let's 

18

say they had this specific way of achieving it.  They 

19

very well could have drafted the claim intentionally the 

20

way they did to have a broader coverage so that they 

21

cover all possible ways of achieving that desired 

22

result.  Patent attorneys are trained to try to draft 

23

the claims, you know, some claims as broadly as 

24

possible.  So that reading by the concurrence was a very 

25

plausible reading of this claim.  Reading the claim, it

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has any spaced relationship as long as, as the Chief 

2

Justice indicated, I can touch them and they're not 

3

touching each other.  But that's it.  There's no other 

4

restriction on what "spaced relationship" means.  That's 

5

a very reasonable interpretation and that was the 

6

interpretation that Biosig asserted at the Markman claim 

7

construction in this case. 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

But you  you acknowledge 

that it  it would be a valid patent if all you said is 

10

you have to space these things and you figure out what 

11

the spacing is going to be.  You  you can  you can 

12

get a patent for  tell somebody trial and error. 

13

Let's take Edison's light bulb.  I mean, could he say, 

14

you know, get some material that  that will  will 

15

illumine when  when electricity is passed through it 

16

and you figure out by trial and error what this material 

17

might be.  Might be tungsten, who knows, you know. 

18

Maybe it's chewing gum.  Would that be a valid patent? 

19
20
21

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

It would not, Your Honor. 

That 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So I don't  I don't 

22

really understand this trial and error spacing stuff. 

23

What  what is the limit on trial and error?  Can you 

24

get patented anything when you say, you know, this is 

25

the basic principle, you figure out what  you know,

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

what makes it work. 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, Your Honor, 

3

there's  there's two levels of indefiniteness here. 

4

First, it's unclear which construction was intended.  So 

5

basically, there are two reasonable 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  I understand that. 

7

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

But the second 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I'm asking why the second 

9
10

construction is  is a plausible patentable invention. 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, it's not 

11

patentable.  In fact, it would be indefinite.  However, 

12

the person of skill in the art reading the claim is not 

13

expected to do a fullblown invalidity analysis. 

14

They're simply trying to figure out, where can I 

15

innovate.  I see this patent.  It issues in '94.  The 

16

the alternative 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

All the person skilled in 

18

the art will know is that he has to figure out what the 

19

spacing is, right? 

20

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

No, Your Honor. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But  but still the  the 

22
23

inventor doesn't tell you what the spacing has to be. 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, that is the second 

24

problem.  We agree.  The second problem with these 

25

claims is they're purely functional.  They simply have a

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clause that says whereby good things happen, namely, 

2

that equal muscle signals are detected.  The claims 

3

don't tell you how.  They leave that up in the air. 

4

Maybe it has something to do with the spacing 

5

electrodes, but maybe not. 

6

 And the further problem is that the 

7

specification here did not describe any technique for 

8

achieving the desired result.  If one reads the 

9

specification, you read it and it says various things 

10

and it says, whereby the muscle signals are detected as 

11

being equal on both hands, on both electrodes.  Well, in 

12

reality, the  the electrical signals on my left and 

13

right palms are unequal.  Somehow, however, the 

14

electrodes detect them as if they're being equal.  The 

15

patent doesn't say how.  It doesn't say why.  It doesn't 

16

say what causes it.  So this is the purely functional 

17

type of claim that United Carbon and General Electric 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you  do you 

19

have any disagreement with a standard that's articulated 

20

by the Solicitor General?  He says that, you know, a 

21

patent satisfies the requirement if, in light of the 

22

specification and the prosecution history, a person 

23

skilled in the art would reasonably understand the scope 

24

of the claim. 

25

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, we may or may

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not, depending on how the Solicitor General would apply 

2

that standard to a claim that has two reasonable 

3

interpretations after the person of skill in the art 

4

reads the claim in light of the specification and 

5

applies all the interpretive tools. 

6

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The Court has to come up 

7

with a formula.  You were saying the Federal Circuit's 

8

formula is no good.  The Solicitor General has, as the 

9

Chief Justice just said, has suggested an appropriate 

10

formula.  And you say, well, it depends on the 

11

application.  As a formula, do you agree? 

12

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, we  we think 

13

it's  it would certainly be an improvement over the 

14

Federal Circuit's amenable to construction and insolubly 

15

ambiguous test.  The Solicitor General refers to 

16

reasonably understand.  The parties have agreed on the 

17

phrasing of "reasonable certainty."  We think 

18

"reasonable certainty" comes out of this Court's cases, 

19

and therefore, we prefer that.  To the extent, 

20

obviously, "reasonably understand" means the same as 

21

"reasonable certainty," then  then we accept that. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's what 

23

I'm having trouble dealing with.  I would suspect your friends 

24

on the other side will say yes, right, that they accept 

25

that, too.  And you say, but it can't be insolubly

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ambiguous or not amenable to construction.  And they 

2

say, well, that's not really what the Federal Circuit 

3

said. 

4

 So until we get to the application, I don't 

5

see much disagreement among any of you about the 

6

standard or what's wrong with the Federal Circuit's 

7

articulation.  And the questions kind of suggest we move 

8

very quickly into the particular invention and the 

9

application.  And I'm just  I'm curious what you want 

10

us to do if it seems like in every case, we have to get 

11

right into the application rather than the legal 

12

standards. 

13

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, I think the  the 

14

key dispute here is what happens if, after all the 

15

interpretive tools are applied, there's a genuine 

16

ambiguity, meaning there really are two reasonable 

17

interpretations of the claim.  Genuine ambiguity, person 

18

of skill in the art applying all the interpretive tools, 

19

trying to understand the claiming.  What happens then? 

20

 Our position is that if such a claim, which 

21

essentially points in two different directions, is 

22

indefinite, the problem with the Federal Circuit's test 

23

is the Federal Circuit would not find that indefinite. 

24

Instead, the Federal Circuit would pick one because it's 

25

amenable to construction.  They would pick one.  They

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would then ask is the construction they picked itself 

2

sufficiently clear for a person of skill in the art. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What if a  what if a 

4

person who's a skilled artisan says that the claim could 

5

mean A and it could mean B, they're both reasonable 

6

constructions, but this person is reasonably certain it 

7

means A, but not B?  What would happen then? 

8
9

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, I think the  the 

proper analysis would be to look at the alternative 

10

construction and ask:  Was that a reasonable 

11

interpretation?  Was the second interpretation a 

12

reasonable interpretation of the claim?  And courts 

13

every day make judgments like that, whether 

14

interpretations, for instance, of statutes.  A second 

15

interpretation of a statute is reasonable. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, the only  the only 

17

analog that comes to my mind immediately is our review 

18

of agency action.  Is  is that the standard that you 

19

want us to use?  If  if, you know, it's within the 

20

scope of the ambiguity, oh, we don't think that's the 

21

right answer.  But it's close enough for government 

22

work.  Is that  is that what you want us to apply to 

23

patents? 

24
25

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

No, Your Honor, because the 

starting point here is the text of the statute.  The

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

text of the statute could hardly be more emphatic. 

2

Section 112 requires that the invention be described in 

3

full, clear, concise, and exact terms and then be 

4

claimed particularly and distinctly.  Given that text of 

5

the statute, given the statutory purpose of protecting 

6

the next innovator from uncertainty, we think that that 

7

statutory language needs to be enforced, you know, 

8

forcefully. 

9
10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
wrong. 

11
12
13
14
15

Can it be reasonable but 

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

No, Your Honor.  If a claim 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I see.  Whatever 



interpretation is wrong is ipso facto unreasonable? 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

If  if I understand 

16

correctly, a claim has only one proper construction.  If 

17

a claim is subject 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  So whatever is wrong 

19

is  is, by your definition  you know, we  we 

20

construe statutes all the time, and we certainly don't 

21

think that the result we come to is the only reasonable 

22

result.  We think it's the best result, but not the only 

23

reasonable one.  But you're saying in this field there's 

24

a right result and everything else is unreasonable. 

25

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

What  what we're  we

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would analogize it most closely to  to the Chevron 

2

ambiguity analysis. 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, that's what I proposed 

first.  But I thought  I thought you didn't like that. 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, if I misunderstood 

6

the question I apologize.  But my understanding is in 

7

order to determine whether or not there is ambiguity in 

8

the statute, that the Court first looks to the statutory 

9

language and then applies interpretive tools.  The same 

10

is true here.  And then the Court  if the Court finds 

11

there are more than one reasonable readings, then the 

12

Court will designate the  the statute as ambiguous and 

13

then move on for the remainder of the Chevron analysis. 

14

 Under this statute, however, if the Court 

15

determines the claim is ambiguous, the proper result is 

16

invalidity. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what is  what is 

18

the ambiguity?  Is it  I thought from your brief that 

19

it was the term "space relationship."  Is that the 

20

what  what is the ambiguity? 

21

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Yes, Your Honor.  It is the 

22

term "space relationship" in the context of the claim. 

23

And again, the ambiguity is that this claim either 

24

covers all possible spacing of the electrodes within the 

25

boundaries that we've discussed or it only covers

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

special spacings of the electrodes that are a result of 

2

trial and error in order to achieve the desired result. 

3

Those are hugely different claim scopes and that  that 

4

uncertainty between those two is what would chill 

5

innovation. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Did you  did you 

7

proffer any evidence below showing that a person with 

8

ordinary skill in the art did not understand what this 

9

claim meant?  Your brief seems to rely only on the 

10

dispute between the majority and the concurrence.  But 

11

was there  did you proffer any evidence below? 

12

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, we did not 

13

proffer our own experts.  The  the evidence below 

14

included that Biosig's own expert asserted that each of 

15

the competing constructions was reasonable, in essence. 

16

More specifically, he said that  this was Dr. 

17

Gannoulas said at Joint Appendix 274  that "The person 

18

of skill in the art could readily discern the trial 

19

court's construction of spaced relationship."  The trial 

20

court's construction was any spacing. 

21

 Then the expert went on and said, "The 

22

person of skill in the art could easily discern the 

23

claim scope because the EMG signals have to be 

24

substantially removed."  That was the competing 

25

functional construction of spaced relationship.  So

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

their own expert supported both of these competing 

2

constructions and the reason they were comfortable doing 

3

that is because 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, I have a really big 

5

problem, which is we as Justices disagree on the meaning 

6

of things all the time, and one side will say, this is 

7

perfectly clear from the text of the statute, from 

8

its  from its history, from its context.  And we do 

9

all the statutory tools, and  there'll be one or more 

10

of us who will come out and say, no, we think it's a 

11

different interpretation.  Would we have any valid 

12

patents in the world if that's the standard that we 

13

that we adopt?  That if any judge on a panel thinks that 

14

there's another interpretation, that that's sufficient 

15

to invalidate a patent as indefinite? 

16

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, we are not 

17

taking the position that because the judges below 

18

disagreed on the construction, that that is dispositive 

19

or proves ambiguity in the claim.  We  we did say the 

20

fact that Biosig itself took both competing 

21

constructions as the need arose 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But the majority  but 

23

the majority here said that it was clear from the 

24

prosecution history, the specifications, and the 

25

description that this was definite.  I don't know on

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what basis I would have to overturn their review of that 

2

issue. 

3

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, that  that Biosig 

4

has taken both claim constructions.  We've not seen them 

5

assert that either claim construction was unreasonable. 

6

The majority did not find the concurrence's construction 

7

unreasonable.  Nor did it find the trial court's 

8

construction unreasonable.  Their experts took both 

9

positions.  So we have a claim that on its face  I 

10

mean, the starting point is looking at the patent, of 

11

course, not what judges or experts or parties said 

12

later.  The patent on its face is grammatically 

13

ambiguous.  There is a whereby clause dangling in the 

14

middle of the claim that says whereby something good 

15

happens. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  We understand all 

17

that.  I  I'm still having trouble understanding what 

18

your standard is.  You  you agree that your standard 

19

is not, there is a right answer and everything that is 

20

not the right answer is unreasonable.  That's not your 

21

position. 

22

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

That's right, Your Honor. 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Right? 

24

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Right. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  Then you invoke

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Chevron.  Do you mean that anything that would pass 

2

Chevron's step one is okay? 

3

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That is, if it would pass 

5
6

Chevron's step one it's ambiguous. 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Well, if  let me be clear 

7

about "pass."  If it's ambiguous under Chevron step one, 

8

then that is a close parallel to being ambiguous 

9

under  under Section 112, paragraph 2.  But again, our 

10

starting point, of course, is not Chevron.  It's the 

11

statutory text, which  and the standard we submit is 

12

to assert  I'm sorry, to enforce the statutory text by 

13

its plain terms. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would this  would this 

15

help?  Do you agree that the standard at the PTO, and 

16

let's say that it's whether or not  the claim is 

17

definite if a person skilled in the art would be 

18

reasonably certain of its scope.  Is the standard used 

19

by the PTO the same standard that the CA Fed ought to 

20

use? 

21

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Yes, it is, Your Honor. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

All right.  How does 

23

that's a sensible answer, I think.  Now, how does the 

24

presumption of validity bear on  on the application of 

25

the  of that same standard in the court of appeals?

19

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

The presumption of validity 

2

certain applies to this defense.  It requires the 

3

challenger to raise the defense, to preserve the 

4

defense, you know, plead it as affirmative defense, to make the 

5

initial argument as to why the claim is 

6

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Doesn't that imply some 

deference on findings of fact? 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Your Honor, it would be 

rare for there to be, in an indefiniteness case, to be 

10

any underlying finding of fact.  The  the issue of 

11

indefiniteness is really subsidiary. 

12
13

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Does it imply  what sort 

of deference does it accord to the PTO? 

14

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If indeed 
That is, the presumption 

16

of validity, does that accord some deference to the PTO? 

17

And how would that apply or not apply here? 

18

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

It would apply  it does 

19

not apply in this case.  There are no fact findings out 

20

of the Patent Office regarding indefiniteness.  But if 

21

there was  the same indefiniteness issue came up and 

22

the Patent Office found, for instance, that a term of 

23

art, so let's say nanotechnology, biotechnology term of art 

24

had a particular meaning, then that factfinding may be 

25

entitled to deference by the trial court.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

 However, indefiniteness itself is a legal 

2

determination.  The Federal Circuit said that.  They 

3

review this.  They know 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

So there's no deference to 

the PTO as to that legal interpretation. 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

No, Your Honor, no more 

7

than there'd be deference to the Patent Office claim 

8

construction or any other legal decision. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The  the quotation that 

10

the Chief Justice read to you from the Solicitor 

11

General's brief referred to the use of prosecution 

12

history.  Do you agree with the Solicitor General about 

13

that use, about the permissibility of that use? 

14

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Yes, Your Honor, so long as 

15

the prosecution history that's being used to clarify 

16

existed at the date the patent issued. If the person of 

17

skill in the art again is supposed to be motivated to 

18

innovate around the patent the day it issues.  Here 

19

there is a reexamination prosecution history. 

20

Sometimes there is later prosecution history in a 

21

related patent.  That type of prosecution history 

22

shouldn't be used to sort of ex post facto cure an 

23

initial indefiniteness. 

24

 But putting aside that rare instance, yes, 

25

the prosecution history and the specification are part

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the interpretive tools that are available and would 

2

be used. 

3

 I think it's important to remember here that 

4

there is no legitimate need or excuse for ambiguity in 

5

patent claims.  Once the applicant has satisfied 

6

paragraph one and its strict requirements for describing 

7

the invention, it is easy to claim the invention 

8

particularly and distinctly.  The only reason that there 

9

are so many ambiguous claims out there today is that 

10

patent attorneys are trained to deliberately include 

11

ambiguous claims.  Ambiguous claims make the patent 

12

monopoly more valuable.  Every patent attorney knows 

13

that. 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The government tells us 

15

there are some 22,000 patent grants since 1976 that use 

16

the term "spaced relationship."  I suppose many of those 

17

would fail your test? 

18

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Not likely, Your Honor.  It 

19

would be highly unlikely in more than 99 percent of 

20

those cases that there'd be any uncertainty of what 

21

"spaced relationship" meant.  The problem here is not 

22

those words.  It's the grammatical ambiguity in the 

23

claim.  It's the fact that the specification did not 

24

describe, even arguably, the invention.  That wasn't 

25

described, the trial and error spacing, until 15 years

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

later, and that the patent specification has no concrete 

2

examples of embodiments inside the claim or outside the 

3

claim. 

4

 So we ask that the Court reaffirm its 

5

precedents in United Carbon, General Electric and Eibel 

6

Process.  Eibel Process upheld a claim that had vague 

7

sounding language.  The language was "high elevation," 

8

"substantial elevation," but it was upheld because that 

9

patent specification concretely described the invention, 

10

its theory of operation, concrete examples that came 

11

inside the claim scope, concrete examples that fell 

12

outside.  And that's why that patent satisfied the 

13

particular and distinct claiming requirement and this 

14

one does not. 

15

 I'll reserve the balance of my time.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK D. HARRIS 

19

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

20

 MR. HARRIS: 

21

please the Court: 

22

Thank you, counsel. 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 The decision of the Federal Circuit should 

23

be affirmed for two reasons:  First, that court 

24

correctly held that the test for definiteness is whether 

25

a claim puts a skilled artisan on reasonable notice of

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the boundaries of the invention, and secondly, whatever 

2



3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If that's  if that's what 

4

it held we wouldn't have taken this case.  I thought we 

5

took it because it had some really extravagant language. 

6

10
11

 MR. HARRIS: 

The court, the court below used 

the word 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I mean, it's one thing to 

run away from that language, as your brief does.  It's 
another thing to deny that it exists. 
 MR. HARRIS: 

Justice Scalia, we are not 

12

denying that those words exist, "insolubly ambiguous," 

13

but what I think this court below, the Federal Circuit, 

14

in this case explained, and it's explained consistently, 

15

is that that  those two words are not the test all by 

16

themselves.  In this very case 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You would agree, I take 

18

it, that if, was it, "insolubly ambiguous" were the 

19

standard that the court used, that we should reverse? 

20

 MR. HARRIS: 

If there were no other context 

21

and only those words alone would be used, it seems that 

22

some district courts might misinterpret those words, as 

23

the Solicitor General has mentioned, but 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So it was fair, as I 

suggested earlier, nobody agrees with that formulation;

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

right? 
 MR. HARRIS: 

Yes, I guess so, Your Honor. 

3

But I want to  I just want to clarify what that point 

4

is.  What the Federal Circuit said below, the full 

5

statement of its test that it was applying in this case, 

6

was:  If reasonable efforts at claim construction result 

7

in a definition that does not provide sufficient 

8

particularity and clarity to inform skilled artisans of 

9

the bounds of the claim, the claim is insolubly 

10

ambiguous and invalid for indefiniteness.  There is no 

11

suggestion that the court 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There is a subtle  no, 

13

there is, if you read that language carefully.  It seems 

14

to be saying that what has to be reasonably definite is 

15

the court's construction, and it takes the emphasis away 

16

from whether a skilled  someone skilled in the art 

17

would be definite.  There is a big difference between 

18

can I read this and give it a construction and whether 

19

or not a construction is definite enough so someone 

20

skilled in the art could understand it. 

21

 MR. HARRIS: 

We would completely agree that 

22

the test needs to include what the skilled artisan would 

23

have understood at the time. 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

That's my problem with 

the Federal Circuit's articulation and as you read its

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decisions.  Its focus is not always on that question. 

2

Its focus seems to be on the reasonableness of its 

3

construction, as opposed to the reasonableness of a 

4

skilled artisan's or whether skilled, someone skilled in 

5

the art could reasonably construe the scope of this 

6

patent. 

7

 MR. HARRIS: 

But I think it's quite clear 

8

from the way the Federal Circuit actually applied the 

9

standard in this case that the Federal Circuit was 

10

looking to what the evidence was as to what skilled 

11

artisans would do with this claim language.  If anything 

12

it's Nautilus that's arguing that it doesn't seem to 

13

matter what a skilled artisan thought at the time. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So what do you see as 

15

the difference?  He says that the concurrence's 

16

definition is different from the majority's.  The 

17

government  explain  I read your brief.  I know what 

18

you think the difference is, but 

19
20
21
22

 MR. HARRIS: 

Well, between the majority and 

the concurrence below, first, we don't think 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

difference in scope, so address that. 

23

 MR. HARRIS: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

He says there is a 

Yes. 
Why don't you see that 

as being a difference of importance?

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HARRIS: 

It would be a difference if 

2

there were a difference in scope, but there isn't one. 

3

I think it's very important to look at what the majority 

4

and the concurrence actually did.  The majority was 

5

addressing definiteness.  The majority did that in two 

6

steps.  The majority said we are going to apply the 

7

principles of claim construction.  The first thing it 

8

did was it looked to the claim language, the written 

9

specification, the diagrams, all the traditional tools 

10

of patent interpretation.  It said there is definiteness 

11

here because there are bounds to the spaced 

12

relationship.  It isn't just anything, it has to be 

13

greater than zero, it has to be less than the width of a 

14

hand.  It's implicit in the  actually explicit in the 

15

statements of the patent. 

16

 Then it said that the functional limitation, 

17

which is the whereby clause in the patent, sheds 

18

additional light.  That's where the concurrence got off 

19

the train and the concurrence said:  I don't think we 

20

need to reach that issue.  Nautilus has turned that 

21

approach on its head.  Nautilus says that the fact that 

22

the concurrence didn't think it was necessary to reach 

23

the functional limitation, in fact said that it's not 

24

before us for procedural reasons, Nautilus reads that as 

25

if the concurrence was somehow disavowing or disclaiming

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the majority's approach.  It never said that.  It was a 

2

procedural argument that it had.  Then, in fact, there 

3

is no disagreement between the majority and the 

4

concurrence. 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Would this patent be valid 

6

if the concurrence's approach prevailed?  It wouldn't 

7

work, would it?  It would not work.  The mere fact that 

8

you spaced it somewhere where the hands can touch it 

9

would not necessarily produce the result, would it? 

10
11

 MR. HARRIS: 

If the patent said nothing 

other than there is a space between 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

 MR. HARRIS: 

That's all the claim said. 
Well, no, no, Justice Scalia. 

14

The whereby clause explicitly said  it described the 

15

structure.  This case is quite different from General 

16

Electric, where there was no structure being given.  It 

17

said that there is going  there are going to be EMG 

18

signals that are going to be detected by the electrodes. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20

 MR. HARRIS: 

Right. 
Then those signals, which will 

21

be detected as equal, are going to be fed into a 

22

differential amplifier and thereby subtracted or 

23

canceled out. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Whereby.  Whereby.  I would 

read that as saying so long as you put the spacing at

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some point where the hands can touch it and they are not 

2

touching, that will produce the result that the signals 

3

will be equalized.  That's how I would read the claim. 

4

 MR. HARRIS: 

Well, in fact, if the 

5

electrodes are configured in such a way that they 

6

detected the signals as equal 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 MR. HARRIS: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, no. 
 it would produce that. 
No.  Yes, I understand 

10

that, but that's not what it says.  It doesn't say space 

11

the electrodes in such a manner that the signals coming 

12

from each side will be equal and you'll have to do this 

13

by trial and error.  That's not what it says.  It just 

14

says, you know, keep the electrodes apart.  They have to 

15

be apart so that the hands don't touch, and on the other 

16

hand they can't be outside the scope of what the hands 

17

grip.  That's all it says.  Whereby, if you do that, the 

18

signals will be equalized.  That's  that's how I would 

19

read it.  It wouldn't work that way, would it? 

20

 MR. HARRIS: 

It wouldn't work if it gave no 

21

specifics.  But this is where the fact that it all 

22

depends on what the skilled artisan would do is 

23

critical.  Because there was uncontested evidence that a 

24

skilled artisan in 1992 was able to read this patent and 

25

understand how to put together this invention in such a

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way that it worked.  In fact, Dr. Galiana's research 

2

assistant did it, in 2 hours was able to build this 

3

invention based on the diagrams. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm a little confused here. 

5

Imagine there are two kinds of electrodes, a blue one 

6

and a green one, and you have to have a blue one and 

7

green one on left hand and a blue one and green one on 

8

right hand.  And now, you cannot let them touch.  The 

9

blue can't touch the green.  I got that.  And suppose on 

10

your left hand you put the blue one here and the green 

11

one there.  And in the right hand, you put the blue in 

12

here and the green in here.  See, they're not touching, 

13

but they're different distances from each other in the 

14

two hands.  Does it work or not? 

15
16
17
18

 MR. HARRIS: 

If the distances on the two 

sides 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 
that one hand. 

19

 MR. HARRIS: 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21
22
23
24
25

Look, look.  This is like 

Yes. 
And this one's like the 

other hand.  Okay?  So does it work or not? 
 MR. HARRIS: 

I don't  I don't know 

whether 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Let the record show that 

the Justice is holding his fingers in the air.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 (Laughter.) 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  Look, on the 

3

green one is two inches  the space between the green 

4

one and the right one is like a half inch for the left 

5

hand, and it's like one inch for the right hand.  Okay? 

6

Does it work? 

7

 MR. HARRIS: 

If I could answer that 

8

question, Justice Breyer, in a  in a more roundabout 

9

way.  What the 

10
11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It was asked in a pretty 

roundabout way. 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 MR. HARRIS: 

What the uncontested evidence 

14

showed was that a skilled artisan at the time knew how 

15

to space electrodes. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Then did he know that they 

17

had to be  like if you put it two inches across here, 

18

so there are two inches between them, and over here it's 

19

like a half inch between them, did he know it did work 

20

or did he know it didn't work? 

21

 MR. HARRIS: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23
24
25

He would know by 
He knew if it worked, but I 

want to know if it does work. 
 MR. HARRIS: 

It probably would not work in 

that situation.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  Now, as soon as you 

2

say that, that's his point.  His point is that when I 

3

read it  I guess that's the point that's being made. 

4

When I read it, it just seems to me that the green one 

5

can't touch the blue one, and the whole thing has to fit 

6

within your hand, so each of them catches a finger.  And 

7

he's saying that isn't good enough.  That doesn't work. 

8

They have to be the same distance.  And what that 

9

distance is, this document doesn't tell us.  And it 

10

doesn't even tell us they have to be the same distance. 

11

So therefore, since it doesn't tell us that, it's 

12

ambiguous.  Is that the correct argument?  All right. 

13

We think it's the correct argument.  So now, what's your 

14

answer? 

15

 MR. HARRIS: 

This Court has never found a 

16

problem with the need for some amount of experimentation 

17

in order to get the parameters exactly right. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It doesn't even say that. 

19

It doesn't even say that.  It doesn't say go experiment 

20

whether somebody with great big fingers on one hand and 

21

tiny little fingers on the other hand 

22

 MR. HARRIS: 

In  in Eibel Process, this 

23

Court faced  as Mr. Vandenberg mentioned  faced a 

24

case in which a method of manufacturing paper, all it 

25

said was that the angle of the supply of the pulp had to

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

be high.  Didn't say anything more than that. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is it part of an 

3

answer to Justice Breyer's question that the diagram 

4

shows them equally spaced or is that not relevant? 

5

 MR. HARRIS: 

I don't think the equal spacing 

6

is the only issue, Mr. Chief Justice.  The issue is how 

7

do you find what that spacing is.  And the answer, the 

8

uncontested answer, is that skilled artisans were able 

9

to do that very quickly.  It's not trial and error as if 

10

it's throwing darts and just seeing what might work. 

11

It's just like tuning a radio.  Just happen to move 

12

things around in order you get that 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why doesn't that 
You know, I can understand 

15

that if the claim said that.  If the claim said, you 

16

know, fiddle with it until it works.  But it doesn't say 

17

that.  It just says, you know, spacing, and I would 

18

think so long as there's space, they don't touch, and 

19

they're no more than the widths of the hands, it'll 

20

work.  It doesn't say that.  I don't think the "whereby" 

21

is  is an invitation to experiment. 

22
23
24
25

 But the other case you were talking about, 
tell us more about it.  It just said a high angle. 
 MR. HARRIS: 

It's at a high angle.  Minerals 

Separation maybe is even a stronger case.  In Minerals

33

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Separation, it was a method for extracting ore from 

2

metal  metallic ore from 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why are you  why are 

4

you running from  the working here is that it cancels 

5

out a signal, correct? 

6

 MR. HARRIS: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
And so what the majority 

8

said is that that function is part of the understanding 

9

of the spacing.  Isn't that what the majority said? 

10

 MR. HARRIS: 

It said that an additional 

11

constraint on the spacing is the fact that it has 

12

that it will work in a certain way. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So I don't know whether 

14

it has to be equal spacing or one could be one inch and 

15

the other half an inch apart.  The bottom line is that 

16

to work, it has to cancel out, that that's part of the 

17

scope. 

18

 MR. HARRIS: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes.  Yes. 
Now, the concurrence 

20

said, no, you don't have  you can't  I'm not looking 

21

at the specification.

without it.

All right.  I don't see 

2

how it could be.  That's what I think Justice Scalia is 

3

saying and Justice Breyer is saying, that if we don't 

4

understand what the purpose is, how can that spacing be 

5

definite enough to make this thing work. 

6

 So tell us why you think that the 

7

concurrence's interpretation is wrong.  What's he 

8

missing? 

9

 MR. HARRIS: 

The word  when  when it 

10

says "whereby," the whereby means the elements that came 

11

before are going to produce that result. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 MR. HARRIS: 

Mmhmm. 
There's never been a problem 

14

with the fact that a  some amount of 

15

experimentation  I hate to even call it that because 

16

it's really just tuning dials on a radio  may be 

17

needed in order to get the exact number, the exact 

18

setting. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Result that the 

specification 
 MR. HARRIS: 

But what the whereby clause 

22

says, it  it conveys a structure.  It says they have 

23

to be detected, the signals, in such a way that they're 

24

equal.  That normally wouldn't be the case.  In all the 

25

devices that existed up to that time, they wouldn't be

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

equal.  Signals would come in from the right and the 

2

left hand that during exercise would be unequal, because 

3

when a person is running or moving, the right hand and 

4

left hand have different amounts of contact with the 

5

electrodes. 

6

 The whole novelty of this was the fact that 

7

you didn't have to cancel EMG signals, what we call 

8

downstream, meaning by just filtering them out.  They 

9

could be detected in such a way that they would be equal 

10
11
12
13

and then be cancelled. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why didn't the patent 

provide more specificity as to the exact spacing? 
 MR. HARRIS: 

Because like Eibel Process and 

14

like Mineral Separation, it wasn't possible.  It 

15

depended on too many variables.  It depended  the 

16

actual spacing in every single instance would depend on 

17

four variables.  This was made clear in the expert 

18

declarations.  The size of the electrode, the shape of 

19

the electrode, the spacing between the electrodes, and 

20

the materials, those four things.  Just like in Eibel 

21

Process, what the Court said was, you may not know in 

22

advance what it is.  But a skilled artisan will know. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What about the apparatus 

24

on which the electrodes are mounted?  Isn't that another 

25

variable way you can't say half an inch, because it

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

depends, as you said, on size, shape, and materials of 

2

the electrodes.  But doesn't it also depend on the 

3

apparatus? 

4

 MR. HARRIS: 

Yes.  Yes, it does.  It does. 

5

The critical point is that there's no question that a 

6

skilled artisan knew how to do this.  They've introduced 

7

no evidence that a skilled artisan didn't know this.  In 

8

fact, their entire argument is based on attorneys coming 

9

up with arguments later. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What  what about 

11

the case that he postulated, an abstract one, where you 

12

have two perfectly reasonable constructions.  What 

13

what happens then? 

14

 MR. HARRIS: 

If there are two constructions, 

15

each of which has survived the Markman claim 

16

construction process, and each one of them does the 

17

things that Markman says the correct construction needs 

18

to do, which is that it fully comports with the 

19

instrument as a whole and it preserves the patent's 

20

internal coherence, then yes, we would agree in that 

21

case it's indefinite.  But what they've put forward 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Doesn't Markman exist for a 

23

different purpose?  I thought that Markman existed in 

24

order to explain things to a lay juror or a lay judge. 

25

Why should the Markman test be used in this context,

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where we're trying to figure out a different question 

2

entirely? 

3

 MR. HARRIS: 

Well, I  I'm not sure I agree 

4

with the premise, Your Honor.  The Markman explained 

5

that the nature of the test may need to be  or the 

6

nature of the process may need to be necessarily 

7

sophisticated.  It's a hard thing to construe  to 

8

construe claims, and we  it depends critically on the 

9

abilities of the skilled artisan to do that. 

10

 Just to return to that  to that  to the 

11

point again, because I think it's such an important 

12

point.  All they're relying on here are attorney 

13

arguments.  In fact, this morning, just now, 

14

Mr. Vandenberg mentioned that the ambiguity isn't even 

15

in the words "space relationship."  This is the first 

16

time I ever heard that.  It's actually somehow in the 

17

whereby clause.  That argument was never made at any 

18

time below or up until now. 

19

 And the reason that's critical  I'm not 

20

arguing waiver  but the reason that's critical is the 

21

rule that Nautilus is suggesting here will encourage 

22

attorneys years after infringement has occurred to just 

23

come up with some way to argue that there is something 

24

that's unclear in the patent. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Could I  could I

Official

1

just go back to my  you know, the two reasonable.  Is 

2

there a range?  The Chevron  the Chevron analogy again 

3

comes to mind.  Let's say one is more reasonable than 

4

the other, but they're both reasonable.  What type of 

5

range do you have before you say that the patent is 

6

invalid? 

7

 MR. HARRIS: 

I think I agree with the 

8

comments that were  the questions that were asked 

9

before, that it's very common in matters of statutory 

10

interpretation to have different answers, some of which 

11

are reasonable but are incorrect.  We hold  we believe 

12

that the test requires that the  if there's  there 

13

has to be more than one correct construction before it's 

14

going to be indefinite.  If it only depends on the fact 

15

that there are reasonable interpretations that are made 

16

in good faith that lawyers are arguing or that jurists 

17

have come to, that's not going to be enough.  Any more 

18

than it is 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

There's never more than one 

20

correct construction.  Even  even when there is there 

21

isn't.  I mean, we always have to come up with an 

22

answer.  And the patent office has to come up with an 

23

answer.  It means this or it doesn't mean this.  Have 

24

you ever heard of a court that says, well, you know, it 

25

could mean either one of these?

39

 MR. HARRIS: 

No.  In fact, I think 

Justice 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

 (Laughter.) 

5

 MR. HARRIS: 

It's a tie. 

I  I think that's the point. 

6

The point is that one of the constructions is going to 

7

be better.  All they have suggested here is that both 

8

constructions, somebody in good faith made.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
time. 

11

 MR. HARRIS: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13
14

So then you win all the 

No. 
There is no such thing as 

ambiguity, because there is always a right answer. 
 MR. HARRIS: 

As this Court has said in the 

15

rule of lenity context, there can be situations where a 

16

statute isn't clear. A judge at the end 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It sounds like you really 

18

are advocating the "insolubly ambiguous" standard, 

19

that's what you're saying.  Unless you have to throw up 

20

your hands at the end and you say, we can't figure out 

21

which one this means, there is no correct 

22

interpretation, unless that's the case, then the patent 

23

is valid. 

24
25

 MR. HARRIS: 

The premise of Markman is that 

in most, if not all, cases or many, many, many cases

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where there is going to be real substantial disagreement 

2

between two parties, good faith disagreement where each 

3

side is supported by its reading of the materials, 

4

nevertheless, the court can come to an answer and should 

5

come to an answer. 

6

 I just want to mention quickly, this Court 

7

has had several cases where words appeared to be 

8

ambiguous on its face and yet the Court didn't have the 

9

trouble of applying them and interpreting them in the 

10
11

patent context. 
 Markman was a case about the word 

12

"inventory."  "Inventory" on its surface could mean 

13

either accounts receivable or the actual stuff.  In the 

14

Yeomans case, the word was "manufacture."  Does 

15

"manufacture" mean the result or does it mean the 

16

process? 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, was the Federal 

18

Circuit wrong when it said the test should be insolubly 

19

ambiguous?  Was that wrong or not? 

20

 MR. HARRIS: 

If "insolubly" means applying 

21

the standard tools of claim construction, then it's 

22

correct to say that that is what's required.  But that 

23

term, I think by some district courts, I'll acknowledge, 

24

may be misinterpreted to mean as long as we can come up 

25

with anything, and it makes it sound as if it's not

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

necessary to actually tie it back to the language of the 

2

patent. 

3

 If the court is doing it the correct way 

4

that Markman prescribes, looking at all the patent 

5

materials and the prosecution history, if it can come to 

6

an answer, then we would agree that answer  that the 

7

patent is definite. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you agree with your 

adversary that the prosecution history is that at the 

10

time the patent was issued and not on reexamination or 

11

anything else subsequent? 

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

 MR. HARRIS: 

I think in this case it comes 

out the same. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no.  I didn't ask 

that question. 
 MR. HARRIS: 

No, I think that the 

prosecution history later also can count. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Explain that.  Because 

19

he says, and it seems logical, that you're going to 

20

stifle inventiveness if people can't, once the patent is 

21

issued, know how to get around it. 

22

 MR. HARRIS: 

Well, let me clarify what I 

23

mean by that.  If evidence is introduced at a later 

24

stage during  in, say, in reexamination, some of that 

25

evidence may be, it may be  a court may be able to

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consider that at a later time as being relevant. 

2

 If I can finish the question. 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

4

 MR. HARRIS: 

5

 If the court  in other words, if evidence, 

You mean the answer? 

Yes, the answer. 

6

as here, was introduced at reexamination about what 

7

skilled artisans knew at the time, the mere fact that it 

8

was introduced at a later stage is not a problem.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON 

13

 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, 

14

Mr. Gannon. 

 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 

15

 MR. GANNON: 

16

please the Court: 

17

Thank you. 

Mr. Chief Justice and may it 

 If I'll start with a question that the 

18

Chief Justice asked.  You've already recited the standard 

19

that we support here, which is that a patent claims is 

20

sufficiently definite under paragraph 2,if a person of 

21

ordinary skill in the art would reasonably understand 

22

the scope of the claim.  And I understand Petitioner's 

23

submission to be a dispute about what happens if there 

24

are two potentially reasonable constructions at the end 

25

of the Markman claim process.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And we think that if there are two 

2

constructions that are of nearly equal persuasiveness, 

3

then that would be ambiguous.  But if one construction 

4

is appreciably better, then that is good enough without 

5

having to take the second step of saying that the second 

6

best construction that's not as good and appreciably not 

7

as good IS  is also unreasonable.  We think that 

8

that's not the way this Court or judges 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What worries me about that, 

10

which is certainly attractive, what you just say, is 

11

that lawyers will come up with all kinds of experts, you 

12

know.  And quite often, if this situation ever arises, 

13

and I don't know if it really ever does, it could 

14

reflect a difference of opinion among scientists.  I 

15

mean, you could have those who followed the phlogiston 

16

 theory of fire.  You could have those who 

17

follow the oxygen theory of fire.  All we have to do is 

18

update that, and you could find different experts who 

19

would have different opinions while all agreeing that it 

20

is absolutely clear. 

21

 I doubt that the Patent Office will very 

22

often find that problem arising.  And if it does, why 

23

not just say, forget about it?  As long as you can say 

24

reasonable experts can clearly  you know, what you 

25

just said  that's the end of it.  And we'll tell you

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what to do later, when we really find the problem or you 

2

tell us what to do.  I mean, I'm having a problem about 

3

it, and I'm explaining what my problem was. 

4

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think that the question 

5

is what does it mean when the Court has demanded 

6

reasonable clarity or reasonable certainty, and that's 

7

the standard that we read in this Court's cases on 

8

definiteness. 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can't we just stop there? 

10

I mean, do we really have to go into this theoretical 

11

dispute between the two scientists, who have opposite 

12

theories of 

13

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I don't think it's a 

14

dispute between two scientists with opposite theories. 

15

The question of what a person of ordinary skill in the 

16

art would think, I think that a person of ordinary skill 

17

in the art is a hypothetical legal construct, like the 

18

reasonable person from tort law. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

When do we ever decide a 

20

case in which we would not say that our result is 

21

appreciably better than the result we reject? 

22

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think that there are 

23

times when the Court would recognize that it's an 

24

authentically closer question. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it's still close, but

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not appreciably better.  If it's not appreciably better, 

2

we would have to say it's a draw. 

3
4
5

 MR. GANNON: 

I don't think that the Court 

has a unified field theory of 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I think the test 

6

you're giving us is not much of a test, it really isn't. 

7

It seems to me it says so long as there is a right 

8

answer, everything else is wrong. 

9

 MR. GANNON: 

No, I think it says that as 

10

long as the right answer is appreciably better than the 

11

second best answer, that you do not have to take the 

12

second step of having to declare 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

14

 MR. GANNON: 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. GANNON: 

How big is appreciable? 
I don't 
You don't know. 
I think it's difficult to put a 

17

mathematical precise  a mathematically precise number 

18

on it. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's the whole problem 

20

with what you're  with what you're saying.  I have no 

21

idea what "appreciable" means.  Let's say we have a 0 to 1 

22

 MR. GANNON: 

Something more like 60/40 than 

23

52/48.  And I think in general the Court recognizes the 

24

difficulty of that type of mathematical precision in 

25

applying tests like what it means to be clear and

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

convincing. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Usually when we ask whether 

3

something is reasonable, we have in mind this reasonable 

4

person and the set of circumstances in which the 

5

reasonable person is going to act.  So in torts, the 

6

reasonable person is going to engage in an activity that 

7

has some benefits but also has some risks; what would 

8

that person do in that situation. 

9

 Now, here you're saying what would the 

10

reasonable skilled artisan do in what situation?  What 

11

is this person doing, setting out to build the device? 

12

What 

13

 MR. GANNON: 

They are trying to understand 

14

the scope of the claim.  And so, and I  I do think 

15

it's important here to recognize that there are two 

16

different questions that are getting conflated in some 

17

of the discussion.  I think that with respect to 

18

definiteness under paragraph 2, as the court of appeals 

19

majority recognized, that this is  in this case the 

20

question is whether the claim clearly states that it 

21

requires the electrodes to be arranged in such a fashion 

22

that they will have the effect of detecting 

23

substantially equal EMG signals at the electrodes.  It's 

24

not with downstream circuitry, which is what Petitioner 

25

suggested in the opening brief.  In Petitioner's reply

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

brief they've suggested they could use some sort of 

2

protective sleeve on the electrodes, but that wouldn't 

3

be consistent with the parts of the limitations that say 

4

that there needs to be physical and electrical contact 

5

with the electrodes. 

6

 And the majority recognize that there are 

7

multiple variables that come into play here, the 

8

spacing, the materials, the separation, as my, my 

9

cocounsel was just explaining, and  but the 

10

disagreement between the majority and the concurring 

11

opinion here is just in whether the functional 

12

limitation inheres in the phrase "spaced relationship" 

13

taken in isolation or whether it can be read from the 

14

rest of the claim as a whole. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But you say 

16

something like "appreciably better," that's a term that 

17

may acquire meaning over time.  Just like 

18

reasonableness, we get a good sense of what it means. 

19

Is it your sense that the Federal Circuit has been 

20

applying its test in this case?  I mean, not in this 

21

case but in a series of cases that is  it is close to 

22

appreciably better or is it something quite different? 

23

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, we do acknowledge that 

24

the phrases that the Federal Circuit has used about 

25

"insolubly ambiguous" and "amenable to construction" are

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

subject to be  to be overread and 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

3

likes those phrases 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5
6

Yeah, nobody 

 subject to being read, 

not overread. 
 MR. GANNON: 

Well, I think that they  that 

7

they could cause mischief if applied in isolation.  And 

8

we haven't taken a position on every case that the court 

9

of appeals has applied these standards in, and I don't 

10

think that the court of appeals was intending a marked 

11

departure from this Court's overarching 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Are there cases where 

13

there are two reasonable constructions, but both would 

14

be patentable? 

15

 MR. GANNON: 

16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

17
18

Well, I think 
Would that satisfy the 

specificity requirement of the statute? 
 MR. GANNON: 

I think that we are arguing now 

19

about when the second best construction ceases to be a 

20

reasonable one, I think.  And I think that if the Court 

21

wants to think of just whether there is a good enough 

22

construction such that there is reasonable clarity as 

23

required under United Carbon and in the Minerals 

24

Separation case where the Court said that the certainty 

25

that's required is not greater than is reasonable.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

What do you think of this 

2

Chevron analogy, Mr. Gannon?  Because sometimes we do 

3

say something close to it's a tie.  We say there are a 

4

couple of reasonable constructions or a number of 

5

reasonable constructions.  We could pick one, we think 

6

it might be better, but it's all close enough that we 

7

don't think we ought to pick one.  So similarly, it's 

8

all close enough that the definiteness requirement has 

9

not been met.  Is that a good analogy? 

10

 MR. GANNON: 

I  I think that that would 

11

probably  we think that the sorts of constructions 

12

that would be reasonable under Chevron that the agency 

13

could take as a second best construction probably aren't 

14

sufficient to be the definite construction here.  And so 

15

I  I don't think it's a close analogy because we don't 

16

think that anyone is seeking that type of deference to 

17

another decisionmaker as 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No.  I'm not sure I quite 

19

got that.  It's just that anything that would flunk 

20

Chevron step one and would go on to Chevron step two, 

21

you would say that that kind of ambiguity, the kind of 

22

ambiguity

 MR. GANNON:

 JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't think so. 
 is also the kind of 

ambiguity that would fail to satisfy the definiteness 
 MR. GANNON: 

No.  And I'm sorry if I wasn't 

5

clear about this before.  I was trying to say that in a 

6

60/40 situation that I said would be adequate here, such 

7

that the second construction did not prevent there from 

8

being sufficient clarity, I think that we would think 

9

that an agency would be entitled to choose the 40 

10

percent option.  But we don't think that that would be 

11

 that that would prevent the 60 percent option from 

12

being good enough in the context required here. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The Federal Circuit 

14

seems to say that if there's two reasonable 

15

constructions and one would make the patent valid, I 

16

think this goes to Justice Kennedy's question, that 

17

they're obligated to pick the one that makes the patent 

18

valid. 

19

 MR. GANNON: 

The case, I think  I believe 

20

the case that's being talked about there is cited in the 

21

Exxon opinion. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 MR. GANNON: 

Uhhuh. 
And that talks about when there 

24

are two equallyplausible constructions.  I think that 

25

that probably is the  the knife edge of insolubly

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ambiguous.  And there, the Federal Circuit suggested 

2

that  that, as Justice Scalia was  was saying 

3

before, that  that because there would be a decision 

4

rule, that you would pick the construction that would 

5

save the patent, that that would be okay. 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

 MR. GANNON: 

Is that right? 
I don't think that that allows 

8

for sufficient clarity.  We believe that if there are 

9

two constructions 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So they're wrong in that 

as well. 
 MR. GANNON: 

In that particular statement 

13

of  of the rule, yes.  We do think, however, that 

14

there is a distinction between the  that the 

15

presumption of patent validity does play a role here. 

16

It doesn't change the standard, but it  it does  it 

17

does play a role in indicating that, as the PTO has 

18

recognized, that courts will do more to save a patent 

19

than the PTO does when it's examining one.  And I 

20

would  I would say that we also disagree with the 

21

notion 

22

25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

How can that be if it's 

the same test? 
 MR. GANNON: 

Well, it's  the overarching 

question is, is the same of whether a person skilled in

52

the art would reasonably understand the scope of the 

2

claim, but

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And that's the same test 

at both levels. 
 MR. GANNON: 

It's  it's not the same test 

6

that the PTO applies in examination proceedings because 

7

it uses a slightly different threshold of ambiguity.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

with your answer? 

10

 MR. GANNON: 

11
12
13
14

Are you finished 

I could give an explanation of 

why. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Can you do it in a 

sentence? 
 MR. GANNON: 

I could say that it involves 

15

the different circumstances there that include the 

16

different record, the different burden of proof, the 

17

lack of adversarial presentation there, and mostly 

18

critically, the fact that it's easier to amend the 

19

claims before the patent has been issued.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 Four minutes, Mr. Vandenberg.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JOHN D. VANDENBERG 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. VANDENBERG: 

Thank you.  I think the 

the essential points here are, first, the emphatic

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

language that Congress chose, and then thinking about 

2

ambiguous claims.  There is no legitimate need for 

3

ambiguous claims.  There is a strong economic incentive 

4

for patent attorneys to draft ambiguous claims, not to 

5

put all their eggs in that basket.  They want some clear 

6

claims in case some copyist comes along, but they want 

7

ambiguous claims so they can  their client can treat 

8

it as a nose of wax later, as happened here.  That is 

9

well established in the patent bar, that there is this 

10

strong economic incentive.  But patent attorneys have 

11

ample tools to avoid ambiguous claims if this Court 

12

tells them that it will no longer be permitted.  That 

13

that is the key here, is that there's a strong economic 

14

incentive.  The patent attorney and the inventor are in 

15

the best position to avoid the ambiguity that Congress 

16

prohibits and therefore, the problem is, the Federal 

17

Circuit has blessed ambiguity with its test.  And in 

18

order to stop all of the problems that the amici have 

19

pointed out that are caused by ambiguous claims, we 

20

submit this Court needs to be clear and go back to 

21

United Carbon and General Electric and to the statutory 

22

text and be clear that ambiguity is simply not 

23

permitted. 

24
25

 In terms of how the Federal Circuit ruled 
here, and we point to the majority's opinion at petition

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appendix 15(a), the court, the majority, definitely 

2

applied the insolubly ambiguous test.  They said, 

3

"Because the term was amenable to construction, 

4

indefiniteness here would require a showing that a 

5

person of ordinary skill would find spaced relationship 

6

to be insolubly ambiguous."  And therefore, if the Court 

7

rejects that test, we submit, at the very least, the 

8

Court cannot affirm the judgment below on that basis. 

9
10

 But more importantly 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the Federal Circuit 

11

said something  I'm looking at the petition appendix 

12

at 20(a)  that sounded very close to what the 

13

government standard is.  It said, "Sufficiently" 

14

"that the claim provides parameters sufficient for a 

15

skilled artisan to understand the bounds of spaced 

16

relationship."  That sounds very close to what the 

17

government says and it isn't  they don't say anything 

18

about insoluble in  in that statement. 

19

 MR. VANDENBERG: 

It is true that here in 

20

some of their cases, the court will  the Federal 

21

Circuit will use language like that saying that one 

22

could have understood.  However, it's clear they were 

23

not applying the type of test that United Carbon and 

24

General Electric required.  They did not even consider 

25

whether the person of skill in the art may have read the

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

claim the different way. 

2

 And in terms of the two different claim 

3

scopes, we would simply invite the Court's attention 

4

back to our reply brief at page 20, which explained the 

5

different claim scopes.  We think the government 

6

misunderstood the point, and therefore, in the reply, we 

7

amplified it some more. 

8

 But as  as I said, the Court at the very 

9

least should not affirm.  But we think it's important 

10

here for the Court to create another concrete guide 

11

post.  In KSR and Bilski, this Court provided a huge 

12

service to the patent bar in applying the correct law to 

13

an actual patent claim, creating concrete guide posts 

14

for Section 101 and 103.  Well, the patent bar and the 

15

trial courts need another concrete guide post if 

16

applying the correct law of Section 112, paragraph 2 to 

17

this particular claim. 

18
19

 If there are no further questions, thank 
you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

21

 The case is submitted.
