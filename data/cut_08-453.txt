ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

Under the OCC regulation at issue here,

12

State antidiscrimination and consumer protection laws

13

can be enforced against national banks by the Federal

14

OCC and by private parties, but not by State attorneys

15

general.

16

detaches the State's power to make laws from its power

17

to enforce them, was not written into the National Bank

18

Act by Congress in 1864, and it's implausible that

19

Congress implicitly delegated to OCC the power to read

20

it in now.

21

This unusual enforcement pre-emption, which

We know the NBA did not in 1864 enact

22

enforcement pre-emption against the States for three

23

reasons:

24

long line of cases from this Court, especially St.

25

Louis, upholding the power of the State to enforce laws

First, the words of the statute; second, a

1

against a national bank or rejecting it on the ground

2

that the law was substantively pre-empted, but not

3

questioning the power of the State to enforce a valid

4

law; and, finally, the wholly anomalous character,

5

foreign really to our structure of government, of

6

separating the power to make law from the power to

7

enforce it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But to some extent, would

you concede that interpretation; that is, not only the

10

attorney general under New York's law, but the

11

superintendent of banks as well, has authority over

12

mortgage lending?

13

part about the bank superintendent's enforcement could

14

not be enforced against national banks?

15

Would -- would you agree that the

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, first of all, the bank

16

superintendent in New York doesn't have authority over

17

national banks.

18

as we pointed out in our reply brief.

19

assert that authority.

20

It has authority only over State banks,
So we don't

I would say that the -- and the injunction

21

doesn't run -- that's at issue in this case, doesn't run

22

against the superintendent.

23

attorney general.

24
25

It runs against the

But I would say -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is -- the

provision that you are talking about, 296(a), concerns
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the authority of the bank superintendent as well as the

2

authority of the attorney general; isn't that so?

3

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I believe that the banking

4

superintendent does not assert authority to enforce in a

5

regulatory fashion against national banks.

6

if -- if -- if the bank superintendent asserted a

7

chartering or licensing supervisory regime, that would

8

be a different issue from the question -

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If they did,

Just with respect to the

10

same issue on mortgage lending where there's a concern

11

about racial discrimination?

12

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, the -- the bank -- the

13

banking superintendent of New York does not enforce

14

against national banks.

15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MS. UNDERWOOD:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20
21
22

And you agree

to that?

17

19

Anything?

Yes, that is right.
Even if the New York

statute MS. UNDERWOOD:

Read differently or

interpreted or applied differently.
What's at issue here is a distinction

23

between a supervisory regime -- "visitation" is a regime

24

characterized by routine examinations, no cause needed,

25

by a chartering or a licensing authority for the purpose
5

of enforcing limitations on -

JUSTICE BREYER:

How is it supposed to work?

3

This is what is bothering me at the heart of this case.

4

I imagine that banks, particularly right in these last

5

few months, are in situations where there are three

6

categories of -- of borrowers.

7

of people whom you are reasonably confident in, and the

8

second is a category of people who are borderline or

9

less so, and there are also minorities.

10

One might be a category

Now, where you make the decision as a bank

11

to deny them the loan, it sometimes is difficult to say

12

whether that decision was made for a discriminatory

13

reason, namely race, or for a legitimate reason, namely

14

because this was a person unlikely to pay the money

15

back.

16

Now, how is a bank to function if 50

17

different attorneys general plus the Federal agencies

18

all look at the books of the bank to look at the

19

individual loan and to make that kind of determination

20

about which quite honestly reasonable people will often

21

differ?

22

And how -- how is that really a problem, or

23

am I just creating that?

And if it's really a problem,

24

how in your opinion does the Federal law deal with that

25

problem, if not in the way that your opponent suggests?
6

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, an -- there is a

2

single standard of discrimination.

3

the -- that the Federal standards applied by the OCC and

4

the State law all look to Title VII law about a prima

5

facie case being -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is the case that

If I may say so, that

7

response overlooks the question.

I don't doubt the

8

single standard.

9

category of uncertain cases, that 51 different

What I do doubt is in the -- in the

10

individuals, 50 State attorneys general plus one Federal

11

individual, will reach the same result.

12

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

These are hard and,

14

therefore, they will reach a lot of different results

15

under the same standard.

16

MS. UNDERWOOD:

There has been no such

17

multiplicity of -- of enforcement.

18

much antidiscrimination work to go around that having

19

multiple enforcers is a device for -

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

In fact, there is so

So you deny the

21

hypothetical.

22

problem is wrong; there simply is no such problem, and

23

since there is no such problem, it doesn't matter if

24

everyone enforces it.

the problem is realistic and therefore there is no

5

problem in your view about having 51 different people

6

enforce the same standard.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

such problem.

10

There is no record of any

And should such a -- yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And should such a problem

arise, what?

11

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Should such a problem arise,

12

that would be an occasion for considering a kind of

13

burden pre-emption that would be similar -- on evidence

14

of such a problem, that might be a basis for OCC to make

15

a record and enact a regulation to deal with that -

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if OCC thought there

17

might be such a problem, couldn't it act in advance to

18

avoid the risk that Justice Breyer's question explains?

19

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, its regulation doesn't

say that.

21

doesn't say that.

So for each institution, I assume it's going to

MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's correct.

And the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

with respect to a particular loan.

Well, that's correct
It's not respect -

10

with respect to Federal policy about national banks

11

around the country.

12

likely that the Federal regulator would want the same

13

rule to apply to banks in Michigan as to banks in

14

Hawaii.

15

It's conceivable and I suppose

MS. UNDERWOOD:

It is.

But if the question

16

was would the -- would the actual act of responding to a

17

complaint or to discovery burden particular people

18

because there would be 50 people asking for the same

19

information, that's not the case, because the loans made

20

in New York would be analyzed by a New York enforcer.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

It's undisputed.

OCC said so in its

Congress has several times said so, which is

10

presumably why the OCC says so -- said so in the Fair

11

Housing Act savings clause, in the -- in the Equal

12

Credit Opportunity Act savings clause, and in

13

Riegle-Neal, which specifically applies only to national

14

bank branches, but expressly preserves the application

15

of State fair lending and consumer protection laws.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You are just at the point

17

of getting to what I -- the blank in my mind.

18

blank in my mind is when you said, but if there were

MS. UNDERWOOD:

For example, make some

2

provision for -- in fact, I believe there are some

3

regulations that call for conferencing and collaboration

4

and consultation among the State enforcers and between

5

the State and Federal regulators to avoid duplicative

6

regulation.

7

to State banks that are supervised both by State

8

regulators and by the FDIC.

in alternate years.

There is already the potential with respect

There are alternate audits

I mean, there -- there is plenty of

10

precedent in bank regulation for mechanisms for

11

consultation and collaboration so that people don't step

12

on each other's toes.

13

And in Federal criminal enforcement, for

14

example, there are -- there are many -- many occasions

15

where there is both Federal and State authority to

16

enforce.

17

extensive, fuller enforcement.

18

both bring the same case.

something, somebody -- a different enforcer will attack

a different problem.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the -- in the -- in the

22

general -- in the field of criminal enforcement

23

generally there isn't any provision comparable to what

24

is now 36(f)(1)(B), at least to my knowledge, and it's

25

set out on pages 46 and 47, the text is in the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

government's brief:

paragraph shall be enforced with respect to such branch

by the OCC."

"The provisions of any State law to

And that mandate, it "shall be enforced with
respect to such branch" sounds pretty exclusive to me.

7

MS. UNDERWOOD:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

Well You can't tell for sure.

But why would -- why would Congress, number one, if

10

it -- if Congress simply assumed that there would be

11

a -- a dual system of enforcement, that OCC could -

12

could say to the bank, you follow State law, and if you

13

don't, we are going to go after you administratively,

14

and leaving it to the State to go after, in any other

15

fashion, what State law provided.

16

Congress's assumption, why would it have -- have passed

17

this seeming mandate, "shall be enforced with respect to

18

such branch" by the -- by the OCC?

19

MS. UNDERWOOD:

If that was

There are two reasons for

20

that provision.

The purpose of that provision was to

21

confirm that OCC didn't lose its pre-existing

22

enforcement power when Riegle-Neal stated -- that's (1)

23

(B) -- in (1)(A) that national branches would be treated

24

more or less like State branches for purposes of

25

consumer protection and fair lending.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that -- that's, in

2

effect, saving clause kind of function could have been

3

performed simply by a statute that says OCC may.

4

this says it shall be enforced by OCC.

5

MS. UNDERWOOD:

And

There is another reason in

6

the legislative history, which makes it clear that it

7

was a directive to OCC to mount an enforcement program

8

which Congress thought it had not been doing.

9

that because in the conference report and other

We know

10

legislative history Congress says it's trying to expand,

11

not contract, the enforcement of fair lending and

12

consumer protection laws, and that the law isn't taking

13

any authority away from the States and that they are

14

distressed at the inadequate failure of OCC to exercise

15

its enforcement authority.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You don't deny, do you,

17

that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce

18

the State laws?

19

MS. UNDERWOOD:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

really contrary to what you are saying.

22

saying the State can do it as well?

23

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Absolutely.
So this provision isn't
You are just

That's correct.

It isn't

24

talking -- it doesn't say anything about exclusive

25

authority, and it isn't talking about judicial
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

enforcement, which OCC doesn't do.

It is talking about

2

it's -- it has a savings clause kind of function and

3

it -- it's hortatory, it's directing OCC to exercise the

4

authority that it has.

5

It seems to be common ground that it didn't

6

give OCC any new power, because it would be odd to give

7

OCC different power over the branches -- this only

8

applies to the branches -- different power to the

9

branches than over the branches than over the banks,

10

different, more extensive power over consumer protection

11

and fair lending than other kinds of bank enforcement.

12

This was a provision dealing with branches and consumer

13

protection and fair lending that said to OCC:

14

have that authority and you should exercise it.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we come to the New

a certain incongruity between saying private attorneys

19

asking for bank books and records.

of visitorial powers is the authority to demand the

22

bank's books and records.

23

I see your argument that there's

But on

And high on the list

So why isn't that -- his preliminary

24

investigation at least, why doesn't that fit within the

25

visitorial power bundle?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, because you can look

2

at books and records under various authorities.

Books

3

and -- you can look at books and records under your

4

visitorial authority, if you are the supervisor and have

5

the relationship to the bank that a licensing or

6

chartering authority has and you are looking at them for

7

no particular cause.

8

records if you have a civil suit against the bank and

9

you are engaging in discovery that is -- or for that

Or you can look at books and

10

matter a criminal prosecution against the bank, and

11

ancillary to that discovery is required; or in Guthrie,

12

the inquiry -- the looking at books and records was

13

pursuant to a statutory authority for shareholders to

14

look at books and records.

15

So the simple fact of a physical act of

16

looking -- or a legal act of looking at books and

17

records doesn't tell you whether visitorial authority is

18

being exercised.

19

understood as a whole regime of oversight.

20

involved a visitorial regime that was ancillary to

21

licensing.

22

referenced in the old treatise tended to involve

23

visitorial regimes that were established ancillary to

24

chartering, back when corporate charters had limited

25

purposes, the way banks do still, but most corporate

Visitorial authority has long been
Watters

The earlier visitorial regimes that were

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

charters, most corporate certificates of incorporation

2

don't anymore.

3

So the fact that books and records are being

4

examined is neither here nor there on the question

5

whether the visitorial power that is referenced in 484

6

is -- is being exercised.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There is an historic

8

reason for thinking that Congress would be more

9

concerned about States exercising visitorial powers than

10

they would be about private attorneys general or private

11

lawyers.

12

National banks were always targeted by the States.

13

weren't typically targeted by private attorneys.

14

that incongruity doesn't strike me as terribly

15

significant.

16

This goes back to McCulloch v. Maryland.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

They
So

Well, the suggestion is made

17

that 484, and there is some historical basis for it, was

18

-- was meant to protect national banks against -

19

against, hostile States, which I guess is what you are

20

suggesting, rather than hostile private people.

21

actually what it was meant to do was assign

22

responsibility for the supervision of these new

23

entities -- there hadn't been banks like this, private

24

banks which were nevertheless federally chartered.

25

Before that there was the National Bank that was at
16
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue in McCulloch v Maryland, and to exclude the States

2

from asserting the authority to do audits, to do regular

3

banking examinations, which actually one senator had

4

proposed the States be permitted to do and that was

5

rejected.

6

I would say the concern about State

7

hostility was apparently much reduced by 1869, not much

8

after this statute was passed, when this Court in

9

National Bank v. Kentucky upheld the power of the States

10

not just to tax shareholders on their shares, but to

11

require the national banks to help, to require the

12

national banks to pay the tax that was due from those

13

shareholders in order to assist in collection.

14

Court -- McCulloch was cited to the Court and the Court

15

said it saw no possibility here, unlike in McCulloch,

16

that the State would somehow use its authority in this

17

way to incapacitate the banks or impair them by

18

eliciting their help to collect a valid tax.

19

And the

There actually had been some thought when

20

the national banks were first created that they would,

21

in the marketplace, drive State banks out of existence,

22

but they didn't.

23

legislatively of maintaining competitive equality

24

between them, not of hostility.

25

And the story has been one

So -

Alderson Reporting Company

Do you want to talk

a little bit about Chevron?

2

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Whatever the

4

arguments may be on the merits, it's not clear to me

5

that visitorial powers has an unambiguous meaning that

6

would pre-empt the authority of the OCC to explain it to

7

us.

8
9

MS. UNDERWOOD:
about that.

Well, I'd say two thing

484 may have some ambiguity about it.

I

10

think it is not ambiguous as to the matters covered by

11

this regulation.

12

have never been understood to include discrete acts of

13

law enforcement by a jurisdiction that neither has nor

14

asserts supervisory relationship, the kind of

15

supervisory relationship that the chartering or

16

licensing sovereign has.

17

Visitorials have -- visitorial powers

So I think -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you say about the

18

quotations in the -- the brief that Mr. Waxman filed, as

19

I recall; it may have been the government's brief -

20

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- which -- which do have

22

references to visitorial powers as including general

23

conformance to the law.

24

provisions, but they -- they were certainly understood

25

in some cases.

Those are not universal

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, the strongest

2

quotations that his brief mentioned several times come

3

from Blackstone.

4

misbehaviors of the supervised visited corporation.

5

Those comments are made in a time and place when there

6

was only one sovereign, not the distinctive federalism

7

we have today, and so there was no need to distinguish

8

between the visitorial, the distinctly visitorial powers

9

of the sovereign, and the coexisting police powers of

10

another sovereign.

11

He talks about inquiring into all

There was no -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but there was -- there

12

was a point in -- in distinguishing the visitorial

13

powers that Blackstone, in the cases Blackstone was

14

referring to, and those for example that would apply

15

solely to -- to religious or originally religious

16

foundations like Oxford and Cambridge colleges and so

17

on.

18

understand the distinction.

19

So there -- there seems to have been a reason to

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, I think that the point

20

about Blackstone's comment to distinguish -- the point

21

about the distinction between the charitable

22

corporations and the public non-charitable corporations

23

is that it may well be that the sovereign was enforcing

24

not just the charter, but the laws of the sovereign with

25

respect to that State.

It simply 19

visitorial powers to do that.

that by virtue of the general law.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

I mean, the sovereign had

Yes, but the sovereign might

do it in many different -- a supervisor might do it in

many different ways, just as OCC here claims to enforce

prerogative of the chartering visitor, but that it could

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART
FOR THE RESPONDENT OFFICE OF
THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
To explain the threat that the OCC believes

14

the State's enforcement regime poses to the national

15

banking system and OCC's administration of that system,

16

I would like to begin by going back to a colloquy

17

between Ms. Underwood and Justice Breyer near the

18

beginning of the argument.

19

And Justice Breyer raised the possibility

20

that a myriad of State attorneys general would file -

21

would pursue similar antidiscrimination claims, and Ms.

22

Underwood's response was there really would be no

23

problem because they are all applying the same

24

substantive standard.

25

of generality that is so; that is, the Federal statute

And I think at a very high level

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and the State statute both say no discrimination on the

2

basis of race in extensions of credit.

3

you get to the way in which the statutes are

4

administered, there is at least the potential for

5

significant differences, because -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I think when

Well, wait a minute.

I -

7

this is state law.

And if the State supreme court has

8

said that the statute means a certain thing and that

9

certain thing is a little bit different from what the

10

Federal antidiscrimination law is, I assume that the

11

Federal Government in applying State law has to -- has

12

to take that difference into account, doesn't it?

13

MR. STEWART:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

We would The Federal Government

doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.
MR. STEWART:

The Federal Government

17

wouldn't have the right to alter State law.

18

19

assessment of whether the State law was pre-empted based

20

upon those distinctions.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Federal

But I thought it is a

22

given in this case -- and tell me if I am wrong on this

23

-- that the State substantive law is not pre-empted.

24

You refer, I think, to enforcement pre-emption; that is,

25

the State law is governing law.

But the only enforcer

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is Federal authority; and if that's so, is there any

2

other -- in all of Federal-State relations, any other

3

law where the State as sovereign can prescribe but

4

cannot enforce?

5

MR. STEWART:

I give two examples from the

6

national banking system, itself.

The first is the

7

Riegle-Neal amendments, which Justice Souter was

8

alluding to.

9

OCC shall enforce non-pre-empted State laws.

And the amendments don't simply say that
It says

10

that those laws shall be enforced by the Comptroller of

11

the Currency.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But do you -- do you agree

13

that -- that it is possible to read the "shall" both as

14

-- as an unequivocal grant of power to OCC, but not

15

necessarily as an exclusive ground?

16

MR. STEWART:

I don't think so with the

17

"shall" in combination with the passive voice.

18

if you had a statute that said a certain category of

19

suits shall be adjudicated by the Court of Federal

20

Claims, I think that would mean not simply that the

21

Court of Federal Claims would be required to adjudicate

22

them if a case was brought before it, but I think that

23

would unmistakably identify the Court of Federal Claims

24

as the exclusive tribunal -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That is,

Yes, but if you have a

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

situation in which the OCC, say, has very limited

2

personnel -- they only have ten people in their

3

enforcement division, for example -- and Congress

4

thought they have to get more, wouldn't it be

5

appropriate in that background to say, you shall start

6

enforcing?

7

excluding States from also enforcing.

8
9

And that wouldn't necessarily mean you are

MR. STEWART:

I agree that if the statute

simply -- if the statute used the active voice and said

10

the OCC shall enforce these laws, there would be a

11

better argument that the OCC's authority was not

12

exclusive.

13

shall be enforced by the Comptroller of the Currency, I

14

think the clear implication is this is the exclusive

15

mechanism by which the laws -

16

But when the statute said -- says these laws

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't see any difference

17

whatever in that regard between using the active and

18

passive.

19

MR. STEWART:

Well, let me give you another

20

example from the national banking system, and that is 12

21

U.S.C. 85.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I want you to come back.

23

-- I won't stop -- I don't want to stop you from doing

24

that, but I want to come back to this.

25

want to go on to your second example, or do you want to

2

MR. STEWART:

Let me just give you a second

3

example very quickly.

12 U.S.C. section 85, which was

4

an issue in Smiley, deals with the maximum rate of

5

interest that national banks may charge, and it says

6

that they may charge as much as the law of the State in

7

which they are located allows and no more.

8

a similar system in that to determine the maximum rate

9

of interest that the bank may charge, you look to State

And that is

10

law.

11

but the enforcement regime with respect to

12

administrative enforcement is exclusively Federal.

13

only the Federal authorities that can go after -

14

You defer to the choice of the State legislature,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's

because it's picking a rate.

that has that rate.

it.

25

That seems passing strange.

And do you have an

27

1

National Bank Act where the State prescribes but the

2

Federal authorities enforce?

3

MR. STEWART:

Well, another example would be

4

the Similar Crimes Act, which provides for the

5

incorporation of State law with respect to -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's not State law

7

applying of its own force, just as your second example

8

was not State law applying of its own force.

10

the Federal Government's adoption of it.

MR. STEWART:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

It was

situation.

14

MR. STEWART:

Those provisions do accomplish

15

incorporation of State law as Federal law.

16

Court has repeatedly said, most recently in Watters,

17

that State law applies to national banks only insofar as

18

Congress shall see fit to permit it.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But this

So Is your concern that

20

-- not with the substantive State law, but that leaving

21

enforcement to the States would cause particular

22

problems?

23

that says you shall do this, and the way the attorney

24

general elects to enforce it is by shutting the bank

25

down, jailing the bank officers, doing all sorts of

I mean there may be a State law provision

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

things that -- that the -- the Federal Government may

2

not consider appropriate.

3

MR. STEWART:

That is certainly true, that

4

the -- the State's exercise of remedial discretion may

5

be different from the Federal Government's.

6

before that stage, if you look at the letters in the

7

Joint Appendix that the New York Attorney General's

8

Office sent to the national banks in question, basically

9

the thrust of the letters was:

But even

We have identified what

10

we believe to be troubling statistical disparities in

11

terms of the terms on which the credit was offered to

12

applicants of different races.

13

not satisfactorily explained, that it -- you may be in

14

violation of State fair lending laws.

15

us a wide variety of information that would allow us to

16

determine whether you have a satisfactory explanation.

17

If those disparities are

Therefore, give

And I think it's clear that had this process

18

been allowed to run its course, what the New York

19

Attorney General's Office was going to do was assess the

20

bank's own criteria for making lending decisions to

21

decide whether those criteria were suitable and decide,

22

therefore, whether they provided a satisfactory

23

explanation for the statistical disparities that had

24

been observed.

25

And once the New York A.G. is in the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

business of passing upon the adequacy of the bank's

2

lending criteria, he is right on the -- the OCC's -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You are arguing for

4

conflict pre-emption.

I mean that's a -- that's a

5

different issue than, say, that the -- the State law

6

shouldn't apply.

7

applies, but only the Federal Government is -- what

8

incentive does the Federal Government have to enforce

9

State law?

But don't tell me the State law

10

MR. STEWART:

Well -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -- it has so much spare

12

time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going

13

to be worrying about State law?

14

MR. STEWART:

Well, the point that has been

15

made at various times in the argument that the State law

16

basically tracks Federal law, I think, is an answer to

17

that question; that is, whatever incentive the Federal

18

Government might have to enforce idiosyncratic features

19

of State law that didn't have a Federal analogue.

20

the State law in question prohibits discriminatory

21

practices that are already prohibited by Federal law.

22

So whether OCC and HUD set out to enforce State law, if

23

they are vigorously enforcing Federal law, they will in

24

the course of doing that vindicate the State's

25

prerogatives.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is there any -- is there

2

any legislative history whatever to the effect that at

3

the time 36(f)(1)(B) was adopted -- to the effect that

4

its effect was to pre-empt State enforcement for -

5

MR. STEWART:

They -- they don't say it in

6

-- with quite that degree of clarity, but there is a

7

colloquy quoted in the -- the brief for the Clearing

8

House between -- I believe it's Senator D'Amato and -

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

MR. STEWART:

Senator D'Amato and -

And it is -- it is to the

11

effect that Senator D'Amato expresses the concern that

12

this may subject the -- the national banks in their

13

branch activities to State supervision.

14

response is that's not the case.

15

branches of State banks, but with respect to branches of

16

national banks the supervision will be by the OCC.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That will happen with

Yes, but the -- the problem

I have with that is, as a -- as a kind of clear

statement of -- of something which is -- is -- would be

supervision.

it doesn't use the magic word "enforcement."

made:

The States will not have the authority to enforce
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this, that there would have been rather a dust-up.

2

there wasn't.

3

argument.

4

as to how to construe 36(f)(1)(B), I'm not sure that I

5

-- I don't think the legislative history supports your

6

exclusivity view.

7

And

It's kind of a "dog that didn't bark"

And, therefore, if -- if there is uncertainty

MR. STEWART:

Well, section 36(f)(1)(A)

8

refers to a very limited category of State laws that

9

include State fair lending laws and said these laws will

10

not be pre-empted unless they would be pre-empted with

11

respect to national banks generally.

12

36(f)(1)(B) says the laws in that preceding paragraph

13

shall be enforced by the comptroller of the Currency.

14

And so even if the colloquy used the term "supervision,"

15

the focus of the statutory language was -- was on a

16

pretty narrow category of laws.

17

And then

I would like also to refer the Court to 12

18

U.S.C. 484(b), which I think is relevant here, and it is

19

on page 1a of the appendix to the government's brief.

20

And it is an express exception to the general rule

21

against the exercise of visitorial powers.

22

And it says, "Notwithstanding subsection (a)

23

of this section, lawfully authorized State auditors and

24

examiners may at reasonable times and upon reasonable

25

notice to a bank review its records solely to ensure
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

compliance with applicable State unclaimed property or

2

escheat laws."

3

Now, the basic thrust of -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Does that mean -- when they

5

say "review records," does that mean that the State

6

auditors in effect can walk into the bank, as

7

distinguished from what we have here, in which the bank

8

is being requested to produce excerpts from records?

9

MR. STEWART:

I think that would be the

10

implication of the provision, but the significant point

11

for our purposes is that it refers solely to ensure

12

compliance with applicable State unclaimed property

13

ordinances and laws.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you this

15

question?

16

can look at, but what if New York was trying to enforce

17

its discrimination laws in an employment context or in

18

context where they said you are charging minority

19

depositors -- giving them lower rates of interest than

20

you give Caucasian depositors?

21

the discrimination and the rates of interests paid on

22

deposits -- assume that was the question.

23

make the same argument, if that was what New York had

24

alleged?

25

Naturally, if it's State laws, clearly they

MR. STEWART:

Would they have -- would

would be going to the banks' federally authorized

JUSTICE STEVENS:

All you would have to just

4

look at the records.

5

whether people of different classes are paying different

6

-- are getting different rates on their deposits.

7

You can tell from the records

MR. STEWART:

I mean, it might be that in

8

that instance the discrimination would be unlikely to

9

persist, but the basic -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It would be unlikely to

11

persist.

Maybe it's an unlikely example.

12

suggesting that that would also interfere with the

13

Comptroller's ability to regulate the banks?

14

MR. STEWART:

But you are

Yes, the way the regulation is

15

written, it speaks to State efforts to enforce laws that

16

are directed at the bank's federally authorized banking

17

activities.

So do you think the same

answer whether -- Justice Stevens mentioned employment

22

it wants to examine certain employment records in that

23

connection.

it can't enforce it?

The State has reason to believe the

Would you say also that, although New York

States?

9

11
12

MR. STEWART:

Yes, a certain -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you began on that,

and I never did hear MR. STEWART:

The part of the point I was

13

trying to make was, even if the substantive State law on

14

its face is not pre-empted because it is identical to

15

the Federal law, once we get to the enforcement stage

16

where the relevant enforcement agency is saying your

17

statistical disparity constitutes a violation because it

18

is not justified by sound banking practices, inevitably

19

that judgment is going to put the State regulator in the

20

business of doing what OCC does.

21

State attorneys general have slightly different ideas of

22

what constitutes an adequate banking justification for

23

lending criteria that produces statistical disparity,

24

then the problem is multiplied.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if 50 different

Then -

That's conflict

Alderson Reporting Company

pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law.

2

shouldn't have a separate State law that -- that

3

provides a separate standard that conflicts with the

4

Federal standard.

5

say the law is in effect, but the State can't enforce

6

it.

So you pre-empt the law.

You

You don't

That's a weird way to solve that problem.

7

MR. STEWART:

Well, the other point I would

8

make about this is that it is accurate to say that under

9

the Federal regime the State is entirely disabled from

10

enforcing its own fair lending law.

11

alluded to in the opening part of the argument and as

12

the Petitioner's reply brief explains at pages 25 and

13

26, the Fair Housing Act does contain a mechanism by

14

which a State agency -- in the case of New York, it's

15

the Division of Human Resources --- can be certified by

16

HUD to enforce the State fair lending laws.

17

As Ms. Underwood

But that certification entails two different

18

steps:

First, HUD has to determine that the substantive

19

State law is -- I believe it's substantially equivalent

20

to the comparable Federal law.

21

monitors the performance of the enforcing agency, the

22

particular agency under State law that carries out that

23

responsibility, and HUD can thereby make sure that

24

enforcement as well as the substance of the law are

25

consistent with Federal law.

I am interested in your response to?

I haven't seen the letter from the Attorney
General.

MR. WAXMAN:

There -- the letters are in the

record in the Joint Appendix.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Now, reading Judge

11

Parker's description of it, it seemed to me that what he

12

had said was that there are statistical disparities

13

between interest rates and race.

14

unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with

15

minorities being towards the bottom, of course such

16

statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate,

17

some not.

18

information is that allegation, it's hard to see how

19

this differs from the case that Justice Ginsburg put.

Well, as long as, most

So if the only basis for getting this

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, that -

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it might be quite a

22

different case, if they had gone into court and found

23

individuals who were really getting different interest

24

rates and who really seemed very, very similar, but for

25

race.

But at that point, they'd have to go get this

same information, because that's where they would find

2

whether that prima facie case was right or wrong.

MR. WAXMAN:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Right.

MR. WAXMAN:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

I'm dividing the matter

vertically, instead of, say, horizontally -

8

10

Do you see what I'm doing?

I'd like to -- and I want to know if

that's possible.
MR. WAXMAN:

I'd like to address both the

12

vertical and horizontal axes of what I perceive to be

13

your question.

14

drew in Guthrie, where it said there is a -- there's a

15

huge distinction in determining what's a visitorial

16

power between a private individual seeking to vindicate

17

a deprivation of his or her traditional property right,

18

which is what was at issue there, and what the Court -

19

what this Court said was the public right of visitation,

20

which it also explained was the State's, quote,

21

"enforcing observance of its laws and regulations."

22

There is a public and private distinction, and

23

visitation deals with the former.

One is the distinction that this Court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. WAXMAN:

Sure, there is.

It deals with the sovereign.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would -- would you

2

acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between

3

enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing

4

State laws apart from visitation?

5

involved was enforcing State laws through visitation.

6

Of course, you can do that through -- through visitation

7

powers, but you can also do apart from that by bringing

8

a lawsuit or whatever.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Breyer, I'll get to the

horizontal axis in a moment.

I'm afraid I'm going to

I'm sorry, did I skip over

an axis here.

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. WAXMAN:

I didn't mean to.

Let me go -- let me go to your

17

axis first, which is to say that anything that is a

18

visitorial power can also be interpreted as a police or

19

enforcement power, and what Congress had in mind -- this

20

is legislation that was born in the crucible of the

21

Civil War, and what Congress sought to pre-empt was

22

State executive action, State examination and

23

enforcement action with respect to these newly created,

24

very important Federal instrumentalities.

25

historically done, this Court explained in Guthrie, and
41
Alderson Reporting Company

That was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Chancellor Kent and Blackstone and many other

2

authorities agree was historically done through access

3

to the courts; and in fact what Dean Pound in his

4

oft-cited article about visitorial powers said, was -

5

he said, and this is discussed at pages 16 through 18 of

6

the amicus brief of the Financial Services Roundtable -

7

what he called, quote, "the leading case for visitorial

8

powers in equity" was a case called the Attorney General

9

v Chicago and Northwest Railroad decided in 1874, in

10

which the Attorney General of Wisconsin was seeking to

11

require this railroad to comply with the State's

12

mandated rate schedule.

13

even though you could also call it a law enforcement

14

power.

15

That was a visitorial power,

Now, Justice Breyer, on the horizontality of

16

your question:

17

Attorney General is trying to enforce its employment

18

discrimination laws or its health laws or its zoning

19

laws.

20

national banks, and he wants them so that he can

21

evaluate for himself whether the banks are making proper

judgments about how to market and how to price their

loans.

13

facie case?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, their -- the OCC in the

15

preamble to its regulations does draw a distinction

16

between State enforcement actions and a pure State

17

declaratory judgment, quote, "as to the meaning of the

18

applicable law."

This is a case that -- in which -

I understand your argument here.

MR. WAXMAN:

certainly in the core, but a -- a State authority,

whether it's the State banking commission or the State

2

human rights commission or the State attorney general,

3

or for that matter another Federal Government authority,

4

that seeks to call a national bank to account for the

5

manner in which it is conducting an expressly

6

designated, allocated banking power is an exercise of

7

visitorial power.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it isn't -- it isn't

if -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He doesn't even want to

11

look at your books; he just wants to prove it by people

12

who have been borrowing money and compare them with -

13

among them they can orally.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

I don't I don't understand why

that would be visitorial power.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

The -- the State's enforcement

18

of any law that is directed at a national bank's

19

authorized banking powers is a visitorial power.

20

the fact that it may also be characterized as a police

21

power or a lawsuit is -- is interesting, but not what's

22

at stake.

23

And

What Congress aimed at -- Congress in 1864

24

knew -- the Supreme Court said, Blackstone and Kent had

25

said -- that visitorial powers on civil corporations are
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exercised A, by the sovereign, not by a private

2

individual, and B, are almost always exercised through

3

access to the courts.

4

courts' authority to seek records or not, that was the

5

historical core of what visitorial powers -

6

Whether they are invoking the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So one could say, yes,

7

the Federal authorities have visitorial powers, and they

8

can go to court.

9

prescribe, not a supervisory regime, but -- fair

But we have here that the State can

10

lending.

11

the bank is violating the State substantive law, which

12

is applicable.

13

And the State wants to go into court and say

MR. WAXMAN:

That's correct.

And a

14

sovereign taking a national bank into court with respect

15

to not any old general law, but with respect to the

16

conduct of its specifically authorized national banking

17

powers, is the exercise of visitorial powers.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

MR. WAXMAN:

20

Well, is it -

That was the reason for the

courts of justice exception.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is it the exercise of

22

visitorial powers, or is it an action which covers the

23

same subject that an exercise of visitorial powers would

24

do?

25

know whether this is sound.

Let me -- let me propose a distinction, and I don't
You know -- I mean, you

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tell me.

2

I would suppose that if someone with

3

visitorial powers dealing with discrimination in lending

4

brought an action against the bank or tried to enforce

5

it against the bank and couldn't do so in any other way

6

then by going to court, it would go to court, and it

7

would say court, tell this institution that I have some

8

responsibility for, to obey the law.

9

But I also assume that if the Attorney

10

General of New York, which is not a visitor, enforces

11

the law, it would go into court and say tell them to

12

obey the law and to pay damages or recompense of some

13

sort to these people whom they have wronged.

14

The subject matter of each suit is the same,

15

but the relief that is being requested and the judicial

16

power that is being exercised is different in these two

17

cases.

18

Is that a fair distinction?
MR. WAXMAN:

I don't think -- I think that

19

if I understood your question, and I may not have -- if

20

a suit by a private individual or a group of private

21

individuals seeking to indicate the deprivation of a

22

private traditional right is not visitorial; but if the

23

State, either directly in the enforcement of its general

24

laws or seeking to protect the people of its State, goes

25

into court or asks for records or anything else, it is
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

exercising a traditional visitorial power.
May -- while I have your attention, may I

3

also go back to your question about 36(f) and

4

Riegle-Neal, because there is yet -- there are other

5

additional indicators that when the Congress said in

6

36(f) that these State laws shall be enforced by the

7

OCC, it was mandatory and exclusive.

8

First of all, the colloquy that was

9

discussed and is reported in our brief, I think at page

10

26, does use the word "enforce" as well as "supervise,"

11

but more to the point -

12
13
14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is the one with

Senator D'Amato?
MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

Riegle-Neal -- here's the

15

most important point.

That provision that we've been

16

were looking at had a cognate, had an analogue that was

17

also enforced.

18

banks can now branch bank.

19

subject to these four categories of State laws.

20

provision we have been looking, which was section 102,

21

said with respect to enforcement of those laws, the OCC

22

shall enforce it.

23

out-of-state bank is a State-chartered bank -- and this

24

is reported, I think it's at section 1820(h) of title

25

12, when it's a State-chartered bank, the State

Riegle-Neal basically said out-of-state

The

But section 105 said where the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authorities of the host State shall enforce the laws.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Uh-huh.

So it enacted a dual regime

4

that demonstrates exactly what Congress had in mind,

5

which is that there would be one regulator making the

6

kind of judgments about, okay, there is a disparity, but

7

let's look at credit history, let's look at the loan to

8

equity value, let's look at income versus debt incurred,

9

and all these factors that the OCC and the Fed have

10

explained have to go into making a judgment about

11

whether or not a particular condition of a particular

12

loan violates Federal law, whether it the Fair Housing

13

Act or the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fed's

14

regulation B.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, you are

16

talking about lending.

core banking activities, but today national banks have a

18

lot of incidental -- they have authority to do things

incidental to banking.

May I answer?

I believe that

Even within the Federal Government, the FBI and

Why doesn't that make perfect sense?

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, even without

7

enforcement of State law, OCC would not have exclusive

8

control of enforcement of discrimination laws against

9

national banks.

So the idea that State enforcement

10

poses some special problem to interfere with that

11

exclusive control is just a mistake.

12

Congress set it up.

That's not the way
