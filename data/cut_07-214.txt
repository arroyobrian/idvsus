CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

United States ex rel. Sanders and Thacker.

6

Mr. Olson.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The False Claims Act addresses and redresses

12

fraud on the government, not on every recipient of

13

government funds.

14

the False Claims Act refer ten times in a single

15

sentence to a submission to the government, getting a

16

claim paid or approved by the government, or defrauding

17

the government.

18

based upon the amount of damages that the government

19

sustains.

20

The liability-imposing provisions of

Liability is to the government and it's

20 years ago, construing an even broader

21

statute, this Court unanimously determined that

22

defrauding the government in any manner for any purpose

23

does not include defrauding recipients of Federal funds.

24

That's the Tanner case.

today in connection with the False Claims Act, and this

2

Court unanimously decided that case that defrauding the

3

government did not include defrauding grantees or

4

recipients of Federal funds.

5

There is no evidence in this case that false

6

or fraudulent claims were submitted to the United

7

States.

12

13

submitted to someone those certificates of conformance.

14

MR. OLSON:

I

The district court very

15

carefully analyzed that evidence, as well as all the

16

other evidence in the case, Justice Ginsburg, and found

17

that an inference could not be drawn with respect to

18

what had happened or when it happened because there is a

19

time lag to drawing an inference from certificates of

20

performance when you don't know when those certificates

21

were made, when they were submitted to the government,

22

what they said.

23

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could the government have

asked -- could the Navy have asked for them?
MR. OLSON:

The Navy, you mean in connection

with the litigation or in connection -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No.

In connection -- the

Navy -- the engines are being supplied for Navy

destroyers and the Navy obviously has an interest in

5

making sure that the -- they measure up to the

6

specifications.

kind of audit where the Navy can say, we want to see the

9

certificates of conformance for those engines or other

So my question is whether in this

documents relating to them.

11

MR. OLSON:

The answer to your question as I

12

understand it, Justice Ginsburg, is yes, the Navy had

13

the right to test the equipment, look at the -- look at

14

the specifications, examine the specifications, ask for

15

corrections if they were unsatisfied, to test the

16

products.

17

things.

18

The Navy had the right to do all of those

And one -- fundamental to this case is we

19

don't know whether they did, whether they were satisfied

20

with the generators as ultimately delivered to them,

21

whether there were corrections, if there were

22

deficiencies or deviations from the specifications when

23

they were first submitted to the shipyards, whether

24

those were corrected, whether those deviations were

25

immaterial.

No. The way the record -- the

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. OLSON:

That's right, that's right.

Subsection (a) provides the

standard for liability.

So you can have a claim, but

5

you're not liable for a false claim unless it's

It's "paid or approved by the government."
MR. OLSON:

Well, I think a reasonable

8

reading of the statute is -- and this is essentially

9

what this Court unanimously decided 20 years ago in the

10

Tanner case, that these cases about defrauding the

11

government must involve something that causes the

12

government to suffer a loss, some something that impacts

13

the government.

14

making the same statement that there has to be a loss.

15

Even -- even the government today is

What I'm saying with -- it's important,

16

Justice Kennedy, that -- that if you are going to want

17

to get something paid or approved by the government, you

18

have to do something that gets it to the government in

19

some fashion.

20

And reading (a)(1) and (a)(2) and (a)(3) and

21

the Tanner decision and the history of this statute from

22

1863 all suggest very strongly, I submit, the plain

23

language of the statute is that it's -- involves fraud

24

against the government.

25

Now, you may submit something to a prime 11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you may be a subcontractor that submits something to the

2

prime contractor, and this very -- this case is a very

3

good example of it, and this case is very much like the

4

Tanner case.

5

If it was false or deficient or out of specifications,

6

the prime contractor had a right to say:

7

tighten those bolts up a little bit more, or we're going

8

to deduct it, a little price from that, and we're going

9

to tell the government that there's a deviation from the

specifications.

What did the prime contractor do with it?

I would concede that.

You could say that the

contractors, harms the government, even though it

11

doesn't come out of the government's pocket, because

12

those funds were given for a particular purpose, and if

13

that purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed.

14

That would work, without saying that the government has

lost any money.

But if this Court's Tanner decision is

correct -- and it was only 20 years ago; it was

unanimous -- it defined the term "defrauding the

24

means defrauding the government, not filing a false

25

claim 16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's why the

2

definition -- it seems to me at the moment -- that's why

3

I'd like your view -- that the language is perfectly

4

ambiguous, the language of "knowingly makes a false

5

statement to get a false claim paid."

6

Now, the "false claim" is the claim that

7

they made to the contractor, because that's the

8

definition.

9

statement to get a false claim paid by the government.

And you are saying:

Well, they made this

10

Now, you could read those words "paid by the government"

11

to say "and there has to be a causal connection," which

12

is what you're saying, that you have to make the false

13

statement, make the claim, and that led the government

14

to pay.

15

But you could also say it's paid by the

16

government when the money to pay it comes out of

17

government funds, because it was paid by the government

even though the government gave the money to build the

account, and then the contractor took the money from the

bank account that the government put in and paid it.

I mean, it "paid or approved."
MR. OLSON:

Yes, I should have said -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- which means there is a

11

third way, and the third way of reading it is if the sub

12

makes the false statement to the general contractor in

13

order ultimately to get a false claim, i.e., the

14

ultimate contractor's claim for conforming work,

15

approved or this particular claim approved by the

16

government when the government makes the ultimate

17

decision to pay the general contractor, that would be

18

covered by (2).

MR. OLSON:

Well, if -- I should have said

20

the word "approved" because I -- I was shortening it up.

21

But it does say "paid or approved."

22

done is that the government has to -- what has to be

submitted is something to cause the government to pay or

to approve a false claim to the government.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that can simply be done

19

by the false claim to the general contractor, who either

2

accepts it as true or, for that matter, knowingly

3

understands that it is false, and ultimately submits the

4

same claim, i.e., as an element of its ultimate bill for

5

the whole project.

6

MR. OLSON:

Well, what I might say in

7

addition to what I have said, Justice Souter, is that

there is no stopping point for that theory.

The

10

money, as long as the project used Federal funds, as

11

long as the project might endanger the Federal fisc, as

12

14

Given the tens of thousands of government

contracts, government funds, government financing of

no limiting point.

You are certainly right when you

20

talk about the thousands of contracts that the

government ultimately makes or finances for the benefit

22

of lower units of government.

from the government's theory that if the United States

makes grants to a sub-unit of government, not for the

purpose of a given contract or a given project, it

doesn't follow from the government's position that when

one of those sub-units of government then makes a

5

by this statute.

This statute would cover the myriad of

MR. OLSON:

I don't -- I don't think, with

12

respect, that that's a fair reading of what the

13

government said either in the Tanner case, think making

14

essentially the same arguments which were rejected

15

unanimously by this Court, or what it says in its brief

16

to the Court today.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, perhaps we should

18

ask the government to explain what its position is.

19

one of the points that has been raised in opposition to

20

your argument is that your interpretation would cut out

21

claims that today are regarded as properly presented

22

under the False Claims Act.

23

But

And the one that was featured was false

24

claims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, because

25

those are presented not to the government but to an
21
Alderson Reporting Company

2

intermediary.
MR. OLSON:

In -- with respect to that, the

3

government filed a brief in a case called Atkins versus

4

McInteer in the Eleventh circuit, and I have the brief

5

here -- it is not part of the material that is before

6

you -- in which the government said that even if the

7

District -- D.C. Circuit decision that's involved in

8

this case, the Totten case, was correctly decided, those

9

Medicare-Medicaid cases would be substantially covered

10

under the statute even under that construction because

11

the provider's claim is passed on by the insurer to the

12

Medicare agency or entity.

13

Now, I don't know, Justice Ginsburg, the

14

facts of that case or the facts of all of those

15

circumstances.

16

statute as it was enacted in 1863, all of this used to

17

be a part of one section that talked in the first case,

18

the first instance, one sentence which discussed in the

19

first instance a presentation of a claim to the

20

government and which was the liability to be imposed

21

upon the claimant.

22

But the fact is that if you take this

The second part of the sentence said -- it

was intended to cover the people aiding the fraud, those

people that provided with records or statements in order

And then the third provision was the

In 1982, Congress specifically said:

We are making no substantive changes in the

If you read that provision in the context of

9

the Marcus versus Hess case, which was in the early

10

'40s, in which the government -- in which the Court

11

specifically said there's liability for an intermediary

12

causing a -- Federal Government to pay the claim.

13

in that case, the invoices were passed on, and the -

14

and the government entity in that case, the Public Works

15

Administration, had the opportunity to review and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the whole

difference -- the whole difference, then, is if the -

17

the immense variety of ways the Federal Government

provides Federal financial assistance, always

19

accompanied by some restrictions or conditions on its

use, the inability of the substantial supervision

it's sort of advancing now, does not provide any test

added after the legislative history that both the

without the claim definition, the statute would not

MR. OLSON:

the claim would be made against the contractor, not

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

14
15

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

16

I'd like to begin with the same point that

17

Mr. Olson began with, namely, does the False Claims

18

Act -- is the False Claims Act directed solely at

19

schemes to defraud the government or does it encompass

20

schemes to defraud people who receive Federal money?

21

And we're in agreement with Petitioners that the False

22

Claims Act is directed at schemes to defraud the Federal

23

Government.

24
25

Our theory in this case is not that the
subcontractors are potentially liable because they may
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have attempted to defraud the prime contractors.

2

theory is that the subcontractors are potentially liable

3

because they are alleged to have used false

4

representations made to the prime contractors but with

5

the ultimate purpose of defrauding the United States.

6

Our

And I think if you imagine what would have

7

happened if the allegations in this case are true and if

8

the fraudulent scheme had been carried to completion,

9

it's very clear that the government, rather than the

10
11

prime contractors, would have been the injured party.

to be used for private work, that the False Claims

MR. STEWART:

I think you could still have a

6

government contract.

7

8

subcontractor really doesn't know what the ultimate

9

project is for, that's not the case here.

10

But whatever the correct answer to

The

subcontractor -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I have another question.

12

Suppose the subcontractor -- the fraud consists of

13

inflating the hours spent in a cost-plus contract.

14

the subcontractor submits and receives payment for

15

$10,000 more than the subcontractor deserved.

16

right?

All

But that all comes out of the hide of the

contractor.

20

harms the contractor.

The contractor gets the same amount of

Why?

Because the statute -- if you

4

relevant provisions of the statute.

5

we're principally -- the two that we're relying on here

6

are subsection 2, which says:

get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the

9

government."

10

And the one that

"Knowingly makes, uses or

it, in effect, gets less than it paid for?

17

MR. STEWART:

Well -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If it were a cost-plus

19

contract, the government would pay an extra 10,000 and

20

it would lose.

21

MR. STEWART:

That's right.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If they -- if they simply

23

supplied defective parts, the government would get less

24

of a machine than it paid for.

That's correct.

And in that

circumstance, I think the scheme could fairly be

characterized as one to defraud the prime contractor,

because the prime contractor would bear the loss

associated with the scheme.

decide whether the claims should be paid, but ultimately

there's reimbursement by the Federal Government.

our answer to the question -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now,

Mr. Olson said on the

5

Medicare that the providers, that the intermediary does

6

present the -

7

MR. STEWART:

And our view is that those

8

would be covered even if there is a presentment

9

requirement, because subsection (a)(1) of the statute

10

refers to a person who knowingly causes a false claim to

11

be presented to a Federal official.

12

So because there's the reimbursement

13

mechanism we think that would be covered.

14

part of our argument here is that the applicability of

15

the FCA should not depend on these sorts of quirks of

16

timing.

17

was discussed in the first part of the argument, you

18

have provision of government money for -- Federal money

deal with the State agency defraud the State agency and

21

they produce a shoddy product.

works is that the State agency pays first and then

Well, how far down

the line?

I mean, let's take that hypothetical.

The school has to be painted as part of that, so the

action against the chemical manufacturer because of that

MR. STEWART:

I think our answer would

probably be yes.

23

limitation into the statute, but part of our point would

24

be that be that that -

25

A court might read a de minimis

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A hundred dollars more a

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

can.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. STEWART:

Well, the answer to that

4

hypothetical -- and the answer to that hypothetical

5

really has nothing to do with whether the statute

6

imposes a presentment requirement, because the

7

hypothetical -

9

It's not a

It's that

10

the claim be paid, the fault claim, be paid by the

11

government.

government pays the State, that pays the school, that

13

pays the contractor, that pays the paint -- blah, blah,

14

blah -- that that is payment by the government of a

15

false claim because the chemical manufacturer six or

16

seven steps down the line commits fraud.

17

And what you're saying is when the

MR. STEWART:

It could be an (a)(2)

18

question, but my point was that the same type of issue

19

could arise even with the presentment requirement,

20

because if the chemical manufacturer presents his own

21

bill to the paint company, who presents his bill to the

22

contractor who does the painting work, who presents his

23

bill, et cetera, et cetera -

24

21

on that theory.

MR. STEWART:

namely the request for funding, but there will be no way

2

to say that that difference -

MR. STEWART:

And of course I exaggerate by

But the point about timing -

10

but the point about timing is if the State's claim is

submitted to the Federal Government at a time when the

fraud has not yet occurred, the State's claim can't be

13

denominated false, assuming that the State intends it -

point is the definition of "claim" indicates that

5

timing, whether the fraud occurs before the claim is

submitted to -

7

9

MR. STEWART:

10

Federal Government reimburses a claim for expenses that

have already been incurred, but under Petitioner's

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES B. HELMER, JR.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10
11

MR. HELMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please this Court:

12

Electricity is the critical component in a

13

modern warship that allows it to fight, to defend

14

itself, and to carry out its mission.

15

the Navy imposed rigid requirements on all who work on

16

its generator sets in manufacturing those generator

17

sets.

18

Because of that,

Those rigid requirements were passed down

19

from the Navy to Bath.

Bath was ordered by the Navy to

20

pass those down in writing to each of its subcontractors

21

who were going to work on these Gen-Sets, and Bath did

22

that.

23

were working on the DDG-51 project, which is the Arleigh

24

Burke-class destroyers.

25

requirements were called out in their paperwork that had

Each of the subcontractors in this case knew they

They knew that military

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to be met; and they did not satisfy those military

2

requirements and yet submitted both claims for payment

3

and, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed out, certificates

4

of compliance.

5

If you look at the Sixth Circuit's joint

6

appendix at page 620, you're going to see, at paragraph

7

6.1 in the contract between Bath Iron Works and Allison,

8

the subcontractor, that Allison was required, when it

9

delivered the Gen-Sets to the shipyard to give a

10

certificate of conformance that all of these rigid

11

requirements had been satisfied, and that certificate of

12

conformance had to be given to the United States Navy.

13

And third, until that certificate of

14

conformance was given to the United States Navy, no

15

money; no money was going to be paid to Allison.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Whose certificate is it?

17

Is it the contractor's certificate that everything that

18

the subs have done or the certificate of conformance

19

that Allison provided, that SOFCO provided?

20

MR. HELMER:

Yes, ma'am.

There are two

21

certificates of conformance, you're absolutely correct.

22

What I'm speaking of is the certificate of conformance

23

from the defendant in this case.

24

give that to the shipyard that says:

25

the requirements, the Navy requirements; and we have to

MR. HELMER:

appendix, the Sixth Circuit joint appendix, at page 620;

16

it's clause 6.1 -- talks about the certificates.

But the invoices from Allison to Bath were all admitted

19

You're not going to see those.

However, for

That's what the statute

That language was taken out in 1982.

10

We all seem to agree that the '82 recodification did not

11

change any of the meaning or purpose of the statute -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your argument -

13

your understanding of the scope of the statute is

14

exactly the same if the words "by the government" were

15

replaced by "with Federal funds"?

16

are -- you think the statute is exactly the same if it

17

said "with Federal funds" instead of "by the

18

government"?

19
20
21

MR. HELMER:
that's correct.

You think those

Yes, Your Honor.

I think

I think that -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So when the

22

government -- when the phrase "by the government" was

23

added -- was it in '86?

24

MR. HELMER:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor.

46
Alderson Reporting Company

There were a lot of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statutes that said "with Federal funds," right?

2

MR. HELMER:

There were.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So why did the

4

Congress add the phrase "by the government" instead of

5

"with Federal funds" if it meant the same thing?

6

MR. HELMER:

The legislative history is dark

7

on that subject.

But I have two answers for you,

8

Mr. Chief Justice.

9

version of the statute, there were six liability

First, if you look at the '82

10

provisions set out.

11

But of the first six that were added in '82, when they

12

broke this long sentence down into parts, every one of

13

those provisions except for (a)(2} dealt with either "by

14

the government" or "defrauding the government."

15

likewise has such similar language.

16

A seventh was added in '86, (a)(7).

(A)(7)

My first point to you is that I believe that

17

when Congress amended this statute in '86 it wanted all

18

provisions to be consistent with each other in that

19

sense that we're talking about fraud on the government,

20

not fraud against private parties, fraud on the

21

government.

22

The second response I would make to you,

23

Mr. Chief Justice, is that we don't read "by the

24

government" as meaning presented to the government or

25

even paid by the government.

We read "by the

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

government" as indicating that this is a limitation on

2

(a)(2), because without that language on (a)(2), if you

3

read the definition of "claim," then any claim or

4

private funds could be -- could have been covered by

5

(a)(2).

6

Congress has limited this to directing to Federal funds.

By adding the words "by the government," the

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

So I guess I

8

get back -- you read "by the government" as if it said

9

"with Federal funds"?

10

MR. HELMER:

I do, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose -- you just said to

12

Justice Scalia -- if you have one minute; I rather

13

missed that -- that your point was if you lose on that

14

point you just made and it isn't "with Federal funds"

15

and it is that the government has to pay the claim, you

16

still win.

17

guess.

That was your point to Justice Scalia, I

18

MR. HELMER:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

argument?

21

what is it?

22
23

Yes.
Well, what was that

Because you said it wasn't in the brief, and
How do you still win?
MR. HELMER:

Well, I believe they -- that

was the first point that I was making to Justice Scalia.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. HELMER:

Yes.

And my point there is that
48

Alderson Reporting Company

(a)(2) covers making a false record or statement to get

2

a false claim paid or approved by the government.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. HELMER:

Yes.

In this case, they were

5

required -- Allison was required by its contract with

6

Bath and the Navy to submit a certificate of conformance

7

to Bath and the Navy to release the Gen-Set for

8

installation into the destroyer.

be installed in the ship and Allison could not have been

pointed out, in the Vermont versus Stevens case.

2

There is no meaningful limitation on what

3

the government and the Respondents want in this case.

4

The government has now come up with this limitation:

5

Well, it must be really a government project.

6

Well, that isn't in the statute.

7

basically the same thing you unanimously rejected in the

8

Tanner case.

That's

The government said in its brief if the

10

government is the ultimate source of the funds.

making.

impossible to trace.

There might be 15 different layers, the way

"claim," which could have been put in section (a), but

that throughout the congressional statutes.

2

We don't know in this case whether the

3

government was defrauded, or was intended to be

defrauded, because there is this big space between what

And in Marcus versus Hess you said that the criminal

false claim statutes have to be construed identically

17

with the civil false claims provisions if they contain

identical language.
