Mr. Ates.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. ATES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. ATES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Fourth Circuit vacated an award of

12

attorney's fees to Petitioner Hardt even though the

13

district court found Respondent violated ERISA in bad

14

faith and required Respondent to redetermine benefits

15

within 30 days or face adverse judgment.

16

then secured the full disability benefits after that

17

court-enforceable order.

18

And Ms. Hardt

Ms. Hardt is entitled to -- is eligible for

19

a fee award under section 502(g)(1) of ERISA by proper

20

application of this Court's established fee standards

21

under any test this Court has previously established.

22

But to be clear --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do you define as --

24

assuming that we go back to our prior language and use --

25

in Ruckelshaus, "some success on the merits," what's the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"some success on the merits" that you claim your client

2

reached?
MR. ATES:

3

In that instance, the "some

4

success on the merits" is the finding of the ERISA

5

violation in this instance.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, I believe that this

7

circuit said, yes, there are cases where we have so held,

8

but that's because there was a cause of action under the

9

complaint that -- that alleged a violation of the Act.

10

But here there wasn't.

11

benefits only, and you didn't get benefits.

12

the circuit's reasoning.

13

and how we go back to defining "some success on the

14

merits" in light of that position by the circuit?
MR. ATES:

15

Here, there was a claim for
That was

So tell me where they erred

They misread the complaint,

Justice Sotomayor.

17

benefits.

18

relief for the ERISA violation.

19

the full and fair review process in 1133 of the statute.

20

Because without a full and fair review by the plan

21

administrator, that fiduciary cannot get to the right

22

result.

23

We are claiming a claim for

As part of that claim, we asked for equitable
The heart of ERISA is

It violated that obligation here.
We asked for the benefits, but the district

24

court, instead of awarding the benefits, said in the

2

the merits under ERISA, because they must abide by their

3

fiduciary obligations, and they breached it here.

4

The relief the district court formulated in

5

essence was an equitable-type relief:

6

asked for that in the complaint.

7

relief.

8
9

That's success on

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do it again.

We

We asked for equitable

So what do you think

our -- the meaning of our footnote, Chief Justice

10

Rehnquist's footnote in Ruckelshaus, who said a

11

procedural victory is not some success on the merits.

12

How do you differentiate what he meant by a --

13

some procedural victory is not enough?
MR. ATES:

14

I think it foreshadowed the

15

Hanrahan-type case, and we are miles apart from

16

Hanrahan.

17

was the circuit court reversing the district court on a

18

pure civil procedure issue.

19

20

is violated, your relief is going to necessarily be

21

process-driven.

Hanrahan, which Respondent is relying upon,

Here, there is a -- a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

So when the process right

It was the same in

23

Hanrahan.

There was a right to a certain process in the

24

lower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved

25

reversal.

It was sent back and said:

Alderson Reporting Company

Give

Official - Subject to Final Review

this person the process that -- that he's entitled to.

MR. ATES:

But, in Hanrahan, there was no

finding of a violation of law, Justice Scalia.

5

obligation by the plan administrator.

6

accorded for that violation was a remand back to the

7

plan administrator to get it right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The fiduciary breached

Are you saying that in

14

Hanrahan there was no prod at all from the court, and

15

here there is?

16

MR. ATES:

I'm sorry --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Hanrahan, there was no

18

prod from the court; the court didn't say anything

19

that -- it was the filing of the complaint that led to

20

the action, wasn't it?

21

MR. ATES:

Well, what happened was the

22

district court, I believe, granted a motion to dismiss or

23

a motion for judgment as of law at trial.

24

court of appeals reversed that.

25

prodding from a court, but moreover a finding of a

Hanrahan.

The court found Reliance violated

That's the key distinction between here and

4

And -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose now, in response

5

to "Do it right," Reliance on a complete record and very

6

careful review finds that total disability was not

7

proved.

Then there would be no fees, right?

8
9

MR. ATES:

No.

Under our position, the --

Ms. Hardt is eligible for fees and the district court

10

can take into account trust law principles which are

11

embodied in what we call this five-factor test to

12

determine whether to award fees.

13

fees based on the violation by Reliance in bad faith.

14

We have a legal wrongdoer here.
The amount of those fees, Justice Ginsburg,

15
16

She's eligible for

may be determined in part by her degree of success.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, this district court

18

kept jurisdiction over the action.

waited to see how the story came out before he wrote the

20

plot.

MR. ATES:

At that point, he doesn't know
At that point, can he --

Absolutely, the court at that

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

point, if he's closing the case out in particular and

2

entering judgment as to the violation --

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that even if, when it

4

goes back to Reliance, Reliance finds that it's patently

5

frivolous, close to a fraud, she -- the employee still

6

gets the fee?

7

MR. ATES:

The only way it's going back,

8

Justice Kennedy, is from a violation of law.

So, in that

9

regard, she has succeeded on the merits by proving a

10

violation regardless of the outcome at the end of the

11

day.
Now, here certainly she got the benefits, so

12
13

we -- we meet even Buckhannon and beyond.

14

case where the district court is sending it back, it

15

must be sending it back for a violation of law, save one

16

instance.

I want to send it back.

But in the

The claimant comes forward and says:

I've got an equitable ground to -- to convince
I want --

In that instance, fees should not be awarded

22

because it was the claimant's fault in not getting this

23

record -- this record evidence in.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well, she prevailed

in some way to give her another chance to make that

argument.

2

MR. ATES:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

Again -I'm just saying I

think you're giving up too much.

5

MR. ATES:

Maybe I am, Mr. Chief Justice.

6

But my point is to try to distinguish Hanrahan, in the

7

sense that we have a judicial finding of a legal

8

violation here.

9

earlier, perhaps inartfully, was that she -- she's

What I was trying to articulate

10

eligible for fees under the five-factor test, but in

11

that instance the district court is not likely to use

12

its discretion to grant fees in that instance.

13

not -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

I was

Well, what if you

15

get in Justice Kennedy's situation, where the court

16

doesn't know what's going to happen on remand?

17

know, the objection is -- the administrator throws it

18

out, saying, you know, you filed the wrong form, so you

19

lose.

20

out on that basis; under trust law, it doesn't matter.

21

And it goes back.

22
23
24
25

You

And the district court says you can't throw it

Now, the district court doesn't know what's
going to happen.

Does she get fees or not?

MR. ATES:

It -- it depends on what the

district court does with it.

But she has to prove a

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

violation of ERISA for it to go back.

2

that, she's eligible for fees.

3

in its discretion can take all these factors into

4

account.

5

And if she proves

And the district court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is the district

6

court -- is the district court supposed to wait until

7

the whole thing is over before deciding the fee

8

application?

9

MR. ATES:

I think the better practice is

10

for the district court to hold the case over and

11

supervise the remand.

12

judgment at that point, then -- then under Rule 54 or

13

the -- they have to come in and apply for fees within

14

14 days of that judgment.

15

this Court an opportunity specifically to give the

16

courts, district courts, guidance whether to keep these

17

cases open or not, much like the Social Security cases

18

that happened in the late '80s and early '90s.

19

But if the district court enters

But this case does not give

But to get back to our main point, which is

20

this is not a prevailing party statute, that was the

21

fundamental error by the Fourth Circuit in imposing a

22

prerequisite to determining whether a claimant is

23

entitled to fees.

24

party statute for three primary reasons:

25

language and structure of the statute.

Section 502(g)(1) is not a prevailing

10
Alderson Reporting Company

first, the
The words

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"prevailing party," a term of art that has been used for

2

hundreds of years, is not within section 502(g)(1), but

3

it is in other sections of ERISA.

4

Its statutory sibling, section 502(g)(2),

5

contains a judgment requirement.

6

ERISA, 1451(e), uses the terms "prevailing party."

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Another provision of

How could somebody have

8

some success on the merits if they don't achieve a

9

judgment of some sort?

10

MR. ATES:

This case -- in the -- in the

11

Bradley case, which was cited in Hanrahan, said you

12

have many final orders in a case, and if the court

13

determines an issue of -- a particular issue in a

14

case -- and here it's finding an ERISA violation --

15

and as relief for that they are issuing an order

16

requiring Reliance to act within 30 days,

17

let's say the case settles at that point.

18

That's enough for fees to issue should the parties not

19

be able to agree on fees as a part of the settlement.

20

It's the judicial act in finding the violation that

21

triggers -- triggers the success on the merits.
And this case was on the merits.

22

As we

23

pointed out in our very yellow brief, the district

24

court --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But under your theory,

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

presumably no relief has to be granted?

2
3

MR. ATES:
granted.

Relief does not have to be

The district court --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But then what -- what's

5

the difference -- is it your theory that if the district

6

court -- for whatever reason, if this wasn't an ERISA

7

case where a remand -- or where the court said they did

8

violate, but I've now looked at the evidence that you're

9

proffering, the new evidence they did not consider,

10

and it's not enough for benefits; you don't get it.

11

your argument that you are entitled to fees because they

12

decided there was -- the court decided there was a

13

violation of ERISA?
MR. ATES:

14

Yes, it is.

Is

My argument is you're

15

eligible for fees, and the amount of fees will be

16

taken into account in determining the degree in the

17

district court, taking these five factors into account,

18

taking into effect your position on the merits, the

19

defendant's position on the merits, and determining what

20

that fee award should be.

21

a barrier to getting into an eligibility question.

But it should not operate as

22

So she's eligible for fees in that instance,

23

but what those fees should be is at the district court's

24

discretion.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Going back to

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Scalia's question, what's the difference between

2

Hanrahan, where there's a violation of the civil

3

procedure code which is an entitlement to process?

4

aren't you successful, if this is a non-ERISA situation,

5

merely for a finding that the district court acted

6

improperly?

7

MR. ATES:

Why

Because you have to look at the

8

party who is violating.

9

violating the law.

It's a party to the suit who is

10

violating the law.

That violation is found in Hanrahan.

11

It's a civil procedure.

12

didn't do something right.

13

Here it's the party who's

The district court didn't --

Here -- and that's not a violation of the --

14

of law.

That's a -- that's a misapplication of a

15

civil -- of a rule of civil procedure.

16

violation of law by a party.

17

difference between us and Hanrahan.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

Here we have a

That's the fundamental

May I ask -- ask this

19

question?

The question here is whether there was

20

eligibility for fees.

21

view say, yes, I think the plaintiff is eligible for

22

fees, but it was actually a very difficult legal issue,

23

and the defendant's position was entirely reasonable, so

24

I think as a matter of discretion I will not award any

25

fees?

Could the district judge in your

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ATES:

2

its discretion and not award fees.

3

that the better result is when a violation of law is

4

proven, the plaintiff or in this instance a claimant or

5

beneficiary should be entitled to some amount of fees

6

because the purpose of the statute, explicitly stated in

7

the statute, is to protect beneficiaries and claimants

8

and have access to the Federal courts.

9

The district court can exercise
I think, however,

If every case is a close case and you're

10

not giving -- giving fees, then -- these are folks with

11

limited means.

12

work when they are disabled, and you are eating up their

13

benefit through attorney's fees.

14

point of the statute when Congress enacted this.

15

to protect beneficiaries, to give appropriate -- give

16

appropriate relief and keep open access to the Federal

17

courts.

These are folks by definition cannot

And that cannot be the
It is

If I can get back to, again, why this is not

a prevailing party statute, the language and structure

clearly show that.

well.

22

talking about the fact that ERISA supplanted the Welfare

23

and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required a

24

judgment before fees could issue, but Congress chose to

25

remove that requirement when it originally enacted

that trust law should inform the interpretation of

under ERISA to inform, guide, and limit district courts'

MR. SHAH:

16

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The district court found that Respondent's

original decision denying benefits disregarded pertinent

20

medical evidence in violation of ERISA and found that

21

the decision was otherwise unsupported by substantial

22

evidence.

after which Respondent finally granted the benefits due.

3

attorney's fees, quote, "in its discretion," end quote.

4

That discretion, as per ERISA more generally, is to be

exercised in accordance with well-established trust law

principles, and those principles quite clearly reject a

Okay.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.
That's clear.

Yes, here

there was an order of remand.

MR. SHAH:

And then a settlement.

And then a settlement.

Well,

21

Your Honor, I think it depends on which framework we're

22

operating under.

23

well-established trust law principles, that clearly

24

qualifies as enough success to justify a fee award.

we can look at several of the trust cases cited in both

There the plaintiff

After he filed the suit -- and this was

for your suit, I'm going to deny your claim to have the

14

Well, that seems like a

15

catalyst theory, and that was, at least in dicta,

rejected in -- in Ruckelshaus.

17

that?

18

MR. SHAH:

So how do you deal with

Well, it wasn't -- in the dictum

19

in Ruckelshaus; it was actually accepted, Your Honor, in

20

that -- in the footnote the Court -- in the dictum within

21

Ruckelshaus, the Court says quite plainly that Congress,

22

in departing from a strict prevailing party language

23

in Ruckelshaus, meant to embrace judicial -- relief that

24

wasn't encapsulated within a judicial order.

6

Okay.

What in the English language can

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Now, of

Your Honor, Petitioner in

7

this case, like all plaintiffs, arrived in court

8

requesting a judgment, a judgment awarding her benefits.

9

Indeed, she believed she was entitled to such a judgment

10

as a matter of law, and she moved for judgment as a

11

matter of law for summary judgment.
What the district court actually did was

12
13

deny that motion for summary judgment.

14

her the judgment she sought, the district court employed

15

a particular procedural maneuver, which was to remand

16

the case -- quote, "remand the case" -- to her

17

litigation adversary to reconsider the question.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

Rather than give

Now --

His point -- your

adversary's point -- is the court couldn't effect that

20

procedural move without taking step one in what was

relief sought, by definition, needed a finding by the

Why is that

that she was entitled to benefits as a matter of law and,

13

instead, remanded the case for further proceedings.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

Counsel, what is the

15

impact on your position of our decision last week in

16

Conkright v. Frommert?

17

to brief it, but I'm also sure had you a chance to read it.

18

I know you haven't had a chance

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, Conkright

19

emphasizes that these judgments are to be made in the

20

first instance and, in fact, in the second instance by

21

claims administrators, that that is --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

23

that it -- one thing it did emphasize, that in the

24

typical case, the likely relief is going to be sending

25

it back rather than making a judicial decision, which --

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which seems to me, then, that -- and then presumably, in

2

most cases, the person would prevail before the plan

3

administrator.

4

So given Conkright, your position is going

5

to severely limit the circumstances under which

6

claimants are entitled to fees.

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, it's -- you are

8

correct that in Conkright, the Court -- Court indicated

9

that in most cases the district court should remand

10

under circumstances like this.

11

Under circumstances like this, then, there would be

12

fewer opportunities for district courts to award --

13

to award fees.

14

502(g)(1), which, as informed by --

You are quite correct.

And that's a correct result under

What would be wrong with this heretical

idea, that as long as the plaintiff wins something out

4

of the court, the district judge -- that group of people

we were talking about -- has discretion to decide

whether ultimately they got something significant of

what they wanted, and as long as that judgment helped

them get them something significantly of what they

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the Court was

3

careful in Ruckelshaus to say that a purely procedural

victory would not suffice.

5

victory may well -- may well result in success for a

6

plaintiff at some later stage; it could result in

out-of-court success.

that we do not look for success out of court; we don't

look for it in interlocutory orders --

Now, purely procedural

This Court has been crystal clear

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rosenkranz, suppose

11

the complaint was:

I asked for a turnover of certain

12

documents; they refused without reason. And the court

13

says:

14

documents.

You're right; you're entitled to those

It's interlocutory; there is no decision;

15
16

but the only thing that the plaintiff asked for the

17

plaintiff got, that is entitlement to the documents.

18

The court said:

19

And then it goes back, and the documents are turned over

20

because the court has ordered that.

21

You are entitled to the documents.

Under your theory, because there was no

22

determination of benefits, even that ruling which was a

23

total victory for the plaintiff doesn't open the door to

24

fees.

25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

On your hypothetical, Your

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Honor, that would not be an interlocutory order.

So if

2

a plaintiff arrives seeking only documents and the

3

district court awards her, her documents, that would be

4

the end of the case, and the district court would

5

properly relinquish jurisdiction, and we could evaluate,

6

compare the result that the district court gave -- gave

7

a plaintiff with what the plaintiff originally asked

8

for.

But this is not such a case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that would fall --

even if in the end of the -- at the end of the day no --

no award is made?

it's a much easier case.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Justice Kennedy, I

don't.

The Court has oftentimes emphasized that

fee-shifting statutes ought to be read in parallel, that

we ought to have fewer rather than more fee-shifting

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor.

I believe

that this Court has rejected the direct results theory

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what is the

11

difference between prevailing party and some success

on the merits for you?

13

they won on one cause of action as opposed to four?

14

The only difference is whether

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, in Ruckelshaus,

15

the Courts emphasized that omitting words like

16

"prevailing party" or "success" from a statute is

17

significant, but it's not revolutionary, that what it

18

accomplishes is a decrease in the quantum of success

19

required -- the degree, I believe was the Court's

20

language -- but not the type of success required.

21

it was still --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

43
Alderson Reporting Company

And under your view

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, the -- the Court

2

in Ruckelshaus was speaking of the interpretation of

3

"prevailing party" that -- that held sway in circuit

4

courts in the 1970s.

5

At that time, "prevailing party" had been read

6

quite narrowly to require substantially prevailing, and

7

the Court understood Congress to reject that standard in

8

adopting a statute that doesn't include language like

9

"prevailing party."

Subsequently, this Court has

10

adopted a much more liberal understanding of the words

11

"prevailing party," so there may not be --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

So you -- you see no

difference today?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

There may still be a

difference, but it will be a smaller difference and a

in type.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And a fee award

May I ask this question?

14

You rely very heavy on Ruckelshaus, which of course was

15

a case in which the fees were sought to be imposed against

16

the government.

17

Is there a basis for distinguishing on a

18

sort of a sovereign immunity approach for saying that

19

maybe there should be a stricter standard when you're

20

taking money away from the sovereign than when you're

21

taking it away from private litigants?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

22

Your Honor, I don't think

23

so.

The Solicitor General is here arguing that this

24

ought to be the rule, and it would presumably be the

25

same rule even in a statute that applied against the

to apply -- to import those principles entirely.

informed by trust principles.
