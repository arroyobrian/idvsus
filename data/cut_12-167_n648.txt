We will hear

Mr. Feigin?

It is Feigin, right? 


6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN 


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

Yes, Your Honor, thank you. 


8

MR. FEIGIN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you. 


Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

The court of appeals' practice of

13

automatically granting appellate relief for every

14

violation of Rule 11(c)(1), irrespective whether it

15

prejudiced the defendant, is flawed.

16

recognized in United States v. Vaughn, Rule 11(h) was

17

adopted for the precise purpose of ending the

18

then-common practice of automatically reversing even for

19

non-prejudicial Rule 11 errors.

20

As this Court

It would be especially inappropriate to

21

apply an automatic reversal rule in a case like this one

22

that comes to the appellate courts in a plain error

23

posture.

24

Erroneous judicial participation --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May -- may I ask you a

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question about that?

2

defendant didn't make an objection in the lower court.

3

But the defendant doesn't know about Rule 11 and doesn't

4

know about 11(c) that says a judge is not supposed to

5

participate in plea bargaining, and his lawyer doesn't

6

tell him the judge is doing something wrong because his

7

lawyer wants him to plea.

8

necessary to make a prompt objection.

9

It's plain error because the

So he lacks the information

So it seems a bit unfair to say that he's

10

subjected to plain error when he hasn't got a clue that

11

the judge -- magistrate wasn't supposed to do what he

12

did.

13

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

14

I'd respectfully disagree with the notion that just

15

because Respondent's counsel was advising him to plead

16

guilty, that Respondent's counsel had so advocated -- so

17

abdicated his representation that he couldn't be

18

expected to object to an error that the judge made.

19

I'd also point out that if the Court were to

20

create an exception to the plain error doctrine, this

21

would be a particularly inappropriate case in which to

22

do it because not only was there not a contemporaneous

23

objection, there wasn't an objection before the district

24

judge in the months and proceedings that followed.

25

They didn't raise any claim of error on
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appeal until the court of appeals raised it.

2

fact, in this case, Respondent did file a motion in the

3

district court to withdraw his plea.

4

mention the magistrate's comments or any pressure he

5

felt from those comments at all. 


6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in

And he didn't

Well, suppose you just 


7

stick with Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, or perhaps 


8

not even a hypothetical, what happened in this case. 


9

Just assume that the defense attorney likes this 


10

judicial intervention and he -- he wants this to take

11

place.

12

plain error because he doesn't tell -- as Justice

13

Ginsburg says, what does the defendant know about Rule

14

11(c)?

15

It -- it seems quite unfair to talk about the

He doesn't know about it.
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, if Respondent

16

wants to make an ineffective assistance of counsel claim

17

on collateral review, he can make that.

18

aware of any court of appeals that has abandoned the

19

plain error doctrine in this kind of case and I don't

20

think there should be any sort of special exception that

21

says when -- that we assume when counsel is advising his

22

client to plead guilty, that we can't expect counsel to

23

make objections to errors that occur based on the

24

judge's comments.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I'm not

It doesn't really

matter -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this is a lawyer that

3

had filed an Anders brief.

4

stage, the lawyer, the -- I don't want to absorb your

5

time beyond this, but I think the plain error is

6

questionable when it seems that the judge, the lawyer,

7

they arranged against the -- the defendant, and the

8

defendant doesn't know that he has this route.

9

MR. FEIGIN:

So he didn't -- even at that

Well, Your Honor, let me just

10

say one other word about that.

11

to be easy for courts of appeals to tell exactly why the

12

lawyer may not have made an objection, and I just don't

13

think it's fair to assume that in every Rule 11(c)(1)

14

case that the lawyer is effectively acting at contrary

15

purposes to his client.

16

I don't think it's going

I mean, lawyers advise clients to plead

17

guilty all the time and that doesn't mean that they've

18

abandoned the representation to the point where you

19

can't assume they're acting on the client's behalf and

20

will raise objections.

21

But our basic point in this --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

Does this

22

issue go -- it doesn't go to whether you should apply

23

the prejudice prong because either under normal harmless

24

error or plain error you have to get to whether it

25

prejudices someone.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. FEIGIN:

That's exactly right, Justice

2

Sotomayor.

3

going to come out of my mouth is that our basic point in

4

this case is that you have to apply prejudice analysis

5

in some form, and whether it's harmless error or plain

6

error, the court of appeals refuses to do it.

7

think --

8
9

That was exactly the next sentence that was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we

One of the most powerful

arguments of your adversary is that in the most common

10

of situations -- and it's how I read the advisory

11

notes -- it's going to be awfully difficult to say that

12

a judge's intervention hasn't influenced a defendant.

13

This is the unusual case where you might actually have a

14

no prejudice argument because of the unique facts.

15

But it -- there is a purpose for keeping

16

judges out of this, and that's because the subtle

17

influence that judges exert is not so subtle.

18

palpable and does influence most decision making, both

19

by lawyers and defendants.

20
21

It's very

So if that's the standard, why isn't it a
rebuttable presumption that prejudice exists?

22

MR. FEIGIN:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -It has to be an awfully

24

high presumption, otherwise, you make mockery of the

25

rule, in my mind.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

2

I want to take issue with the notion that all Rule

3

11(c)(1) errors are alike.

4

of different kinds of Rule 11(c)(1) errors.

5

There's actually a variety

Rule 11(c)(1) has been held to cover, for

6

example, a judge pressuring the government outside the

7

defendant's presence to offer a plea, a judge

8

discouraging a plea, a judge commenting in a

9

well-intentioned manner about the obvious difference in

10

potential sentencing consequences between a potential

11

plea agreement and a trial, or a judge, having rejected

12

one plea agreement that the parties reached, indicating

13

a bit too strongly what kind of plea agreement the judge

14

might accept.

15

I think adopting some sort of "one size fits

16

all" rule would -- would be inappropriate, and a

17

rebuttable presumption I think would also be

18

inappropriate, for a few reasons.

19

First of all, I don't think courts should

20

have to distinguish between different types of errors to

21

see whether a rebuttable presumption should apply.

22

Second of all --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I don't disagree

24

that one doesn't' have to use the word "rebuttable

25

presumption," but there has to be a strong prejudice
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

factor --

2

MR. FEIGIN:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- whether rebuttable or

4

not, assumed in a judge's intervention.

5
6

Well, Your Honor --

MR. FEIGIN: -- I think that's already built
into Rule 52 in a couple of different ways.

7

First of all, Rule 52 places a presumption

8

based on whether or not the defendant objected.

9

defendant objected, the burden's on the government.

10

the defendant didn't object, the burden is on the

11

defendant.

If the

12

If

But also, I don't -- I want to be clear on

13

this, the type of error -- if there is a very serious

14

error, the nature of the error and the error's

15

seriousness would of course be a factor, and a very

16

important factor, in the prejudice analysis.

17

But, as Your Honor has recognized with this

18

case, there may be other circumstances that indicate

19

the error did not, in this case, have a reasonable

20

probability of affecting the decision of the plea.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's the problem.

Is

22

there a way of doing this, which I -- I don't see at the

23

moment?

24

says, you go listen to your lawyer and this is a very

25

harsh penalty and, boy, you are in da da da -- okay?

But the judge intervenes in a serious way and

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Serious problem.
And now to track down whether that affected

3

substantial rights, you have to try to track down the

4

state of mind of the defendant and would he have pled

5

guilty anyway.

6

do, very hard.

7

And that's sometimes quite difficult to

But if you don't insist on doing it, and you

8

have an absolute rule of structural error or something,

9

then you suddenly discover these minor things.

The

10

judge says, go to lunch, or -- or, you know, some really

11

trivial intervention, and you are going to say that --

12

the guilty plea, he can just void his guilty plea.

13

So there should be a way of distinguishing

14

the trivial from the -- from the really important in

15

terms of how serious the intervention was, but I don't

16

see any way to do that.

17

that at all?

18

the other way?

19

Have -- have you thought about

Do we have to go all the one way or all

MR. FEIGIN:

I have thought about that a

20

little bit, Your Honor, and I'd say that trying to break

21

Rule 11(c)(1) into different pieces and adopt different

22

rules based on different kinds of error would be

23

inappropriate, for three main reasons.

24
25

The first one is I think it would be
inconsistent with this Court's approach in Neder v. the
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

United States, which makes clear that in deciding 


2

whether an error is structural you have to look at the 


3

entire class of errors. 


4

And Rule 11(c)(1) defines the class of 


5

errors as cases in which a judge participates in plea

6

negotiations in some way, and it doesn't define

7

subcategories.

8
9

Second, I think breaking this up into pieces
would essentially be an incomplete and unsatisfactory

10

form of prejudice analysis.

11

would still be looking at errors and differentiating

12

between them in order to decide whether relief is

13

warranted, but they would be narrowly focused only on

14

the binary inquiry of how to categorize the error,

15

they'd be disregarding how serious that particular error

16

was versus other errors in that category, and they would

17

be disregarding all the other facts and circumstances

18

the courts always look at and are well familiar with how

19

to look at in a normal prejudice analysis, to determine

20

whether the error affected the outcome.

21

That is, reviewing courts

Third, particularly because the

22

subcategories don't exist in the rule and would be

23

something of judicial invention, I think that approach

24

would be inherently inadministrable and manipulatable

25

and lead to inconsistent results.
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It could be very difficult to tell whether a

2

particular type of error should fall into one category

3

or another, and under the approach you're suggesting,

4

which I think is the approach Respondent is

5

advocating -- I don't think Respondent is actually

6

advocating the per se rule that the Eleventh Circuit

7

adopted here -- I think under that approach, you know,

8

everything turns on a narrow question of categorization.

9

I think the much better approach, and the

10

approach that Rule 52 adopts, is to look at all the

11

facts and circumstances to attempt to determine the

12

effects on the outcome.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Feigin, is there any

14

situation in which a -- a judge participating in a plea

15

bargaining, any situation that would be prejudicial --

16

that you recognize would be prejudicial, and if there is

17

can you describe what that would be?

18

MR. FEIGIN:

19

We -- the government loses many of these

20

cases even in circuits that have prejudice analysis.

21

fact, one example the Court might want to look to, there

22

was a certiorari petition I think filed at the end of

23

last term, a case, 11-8966, Rebollo-Andino, which was a

24

case of Rule 11(c)(1) error.

25

that even on a plain error analysis that that was

Certainly, Your Honor.

The government conceded

12

Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official

1

prejudicial.

2

I can describe --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4
5
6
7

What -- what makes it

prejudicial and this not?
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, let me take -- let me

take a different example.
The Fourth Circuit's decision in United

8

States v. Bradley, the judge essentially told the

9

defendants that he -- it boggled his mind that they were

10

going to trial and kept essentially harassing them about

11

why they were going to trial.

12

said, all right, Your Honor, we are going to -- we're

13

going to plead guilty.

14

obviously is going to be prejudicial.

15

And, eventually, they

I mean, that kind of thing

But the advantage of a prejudice approach is

16

it allows you to separate that kind of case from kinds

17

of cases when there are less serious errors, or even a

18

case where there is a fairly serious error -- and this

19

case may fall within that category -- but there are

20

facts and circumstances that indicate that the error

21

didn't have a reasonable probability of affecting the

22

defendant's decision to plead.

23

And while we're not asking the Court to

24

resolve the prejudice analysis here in the first

25

instance, we -- we're just asking the Court to remand
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the case to the court of appeals to do that, I think

2

it's just worth noting that -- a couple of the factors.

3

One is that -- there was a 3-month break between the

4

magistrate judge's comments and the entry of the plea,

5

and a month into that a speedy trial motion was filed,

6

which indicated at least some intent at that point to go

7

to trial.

8
9
10

The plea and the sentencing occurred in
front of the district judge, not the magistrate judge to
-- who made the comments.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On that point, do we

12

know -- do we know if the district judge who did preside

13

at the plea hearing knew about the episode with the

14

magistrate 3 months earlier?

15

MR. FEIGIN:

I don't -- I'm not aware of

16

anything in the record that reflects whether he did or

17

did not.

18

he said something about them, or that he was aware of

19

them or --

There's never been an allegation that -- that

20
21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The same for the

prosecutor?

22

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, my understanding is

23

the government was not aware of this because it occurred

24

in an ex parte hearing in which the government wasn't in

25

attendance.

The government wasn't aware of it until the
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Eleventh Circuit conducted its own review of the record

2

and asked for further briefing on the issue.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose there's a case where

4

the -- the defendant would not have pled guilty without

5

this court saying something inappropriate about it's a 


6

case where the defendant would be crazy to go to trial 


7

because the trial would lead to a much more severe 


8

sentence.

9

Would there be prejudice there? 

MR. FEIGIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

He has a 


10

right to go to trial if he wants to go to trial, even if

11

it would be crazy.

12

wouldn't have, you know, pleaded guilty without the

13

erroneous comments from the judge, there would be

14

prejudice.

15

So under that circumstance, if he

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's -- what happens

16

under -- under the rule if the magistrate asked that the

17

defendant be excused -- I don't know quite how you do

18

that, the defendant has to be present.

19

can the judge just have the attorneys before him and

20

say, now, I want you to be very, very clear that this is

21

a mandatory minimum, that we should try to avoid if at

22

all possible.

23

Can he do that?

24

MR. FEIGIN:

25

But can the --

Well, Your Honor, I think

that's -15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's awfully hard to have

a hypothetical where you exclude the defendant.
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, this actually

4

happened in a non-hypothetical fashion in a case we cite

5

in our reply brief, called In re United States, in which

6

the judge was apparently unhappy with the government's

7

conduct in that case and had the prosecutor and defense

8

counsel in chambers, or at least in court, without the

9

defendant's presence, and was urging the parties to

10
11

reach a plea agreement.
I think if something like that happened, Your

12

Honor, there'd be some question whether the defendant

13

was made aware of it, and whether it actually influenced

14

the defendant's decision to plead.

15

can be a presumption that just because counsel heard it,

16

that it necessarily --

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't think there

What -- what if the judge

18

sees what the judge thinks is ineffective assistance of

19

counsel, under our decision in Lafler, taking place?

20

there anything that can be done?

21

MR. FEIGIN:

So -- Your Honor, I think one

22

of our main concerns in bringing this case before the

23

Court is the interaction of this Court's decisions in

24

Lafler and Frye with Rule 11(c)(1), and Frye suggests

25

that one way a judge can try to guard against a later
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Is

Official

1

claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is to conduct

2

a colloquy with the defendant -- not a colloquy, but a

3

discussion with the defendant -- during the initial

4

proceedings to try to establish that he understands the

5

consequences of his plea and that he's receiving

6

effective assistance of counsel.

7

I think that could be done very carefully by

8

asking very general questions, but I think it's very

9

easy to see how a judge might slip up and say, oh,

10

that's an interesting offer.

11

your counsel?

12

discuss with your counsel.

13

Did you discuss that with

That seems like something you ought to

And I think what the automatic reversal rule

14

the court of appeals has adopted is it really puts

15

judges, and, frankly, the government, in kind of a box.

16

On the one hand, judges have to guard against these

17

later ineffective assistance of counsel claims by

18

discussing plea discussions, and on the other hand, any

19

slipup in that discussion is going to lead to automatic

20

reversal on appeal.

21

Now, I -- I just want to add one -- one more

22

thing, which is, I think, the best evidence that we have

23

that this -- the magistrate judge's comments here did

24

not create a reasonable probability of effecting the

25

defendant's decision to plead is, again, defendant
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

himself moved pro se to withdraw his plea in the 


2

district court, and his reasons for withdrawing his 


3

plea, which start on page 58 of the Joint Appendix, 


4

never mention the magistrate's comments.

5

his own words, what he says is, "Your Honor, my decision 


6

to enter the plea was a strategic decision. 


Instead, in 


The reason being is that I knew that the 


7
8

prosecutor had a duty with the courts to disclose the 


9

information relevant for this court's determination of 


10

the acceptance or rejection of the plea."

11

And what he means by that is that he took

12

issue with some aspects of the allegations in the

13

indictment, although he's quite clear, both in that

14

proceeding and at his guilty plea proceeding, that he

15

did commit the conspiracy offense, and he just believed

16

that those allegations in the record would be cleaned up

17

or have to be withdrawn by the prosecutor if he pleaded

18

guilty.

19

Now, he was wrong about that.

But what we

20

have in this case is a clear unvarnished explanation by

21

the defendant, in his own words, about why he pleaded

22

that doesn't mention the magistrate's comments.

23
24
25

The Court of Appeals erred in disregarding
that.
And if the Court has no further questions, I'll

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7

MR. YABLON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8
9

Thank you, counsel.

By imploring Anthony Davila to forego his
trial rights, confess his alleged crimes, and accept a

plea deal, the magistrate judge abandoned his role as

11

neutral arbiter and fundamentally distorted the pretrial

12

process.

not one that should be subject to post hoc speculation.

Judges, when an error of this kind occurs --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're creating a sui

23

generis structural error analysis.

24

because even with respect to constitutional violations

25

that we have found structural error in, we've created
19

Alderson Reporting Company

You're basically --

Official

1

the plain error rule that still requires a proof of --


2

of prejudice.

3

that's really sui generis in saying it's always a 


4

structural error. 


5

So you're asking us to create something 


MR. YABLON:

That's -- that's not correct,

6

Your Honor.

7

we do argue that we should not be in a plain error

8

framework at all in this case because of the

9

circumstances in which the judge's improper intervention

10

occurred.

First, let's put to one side the fact that

13

MR. YABLON:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

Assume I accept that

So this Court has -You're -- you're saying

this is a structural error always.
MR. YABLON:

And this Court has, at the very

17

least, strongly suggested that substantial rights, when

18

you're dealing with a structural error, are affected,

19

per se, where they've left the door open to some

20

additional analysis is the fourth prong of the plain

21

error standard where the Court is called upon to

22

consider whether the error affects the fairness,

23

integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings.

24
25

And the government has never, in this case,
invoked that fourth prong.

They've never claimed that

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the error here is one that -- that does not affect the

2

fairness, integrity, or public reputation.

3

So when you're only dealing with the third

4

prong of the plain error standard, does the error affect

5

substantial rights?

6

52(b), the plain error standard, as it is in Rule 52(a),

7

affects substantial rights.

8

52(a) that this is the sort of error for which an

9

individualized prejudice inquiry is not appropriate,

That language is the same in Rule

And if it means in Rule

10

then the same analysis necessarily carries over to Rule

11

52(b).

12

So I would not say that this is at all the

13

kind of sui generis example that -- that you're

14

indicating.

15

And I do want to -- to -- and try to show

16

that this error is quite similar, both to constitutional

17

and nonconstitutional violations in with -- which this

18

Court has said that an error should be said to affect

19

substantial rights without the sort of specific showing

20

of prejudice that the government is demanding.

21

When you have a judge that, as in this case,

22

is stepping out of his proper role, is acting contrary

23

to his duties to guard against ill-considered and

24

involuntary waivers of the defendant's basic trial

25

rights, is actually ratcheting up the already tremendous
21

Alderson Reporting Company

1

pressure on the defendant to plead guilty, that is a

2

systematic distortion of the process.

3

unlike the kind of error that occurs when a defendant is

4

denied an impartial adjudicator, is not unlike the

5

kind of error that occurs when a defendant is denied

6

counsel or is forced to --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is not

What -- what if you

8

have the situation where the judge is conveying purely

9

factual information?

There's a -- a plea bargain on the

10

table for one year and the judge says, you should know

11

that I -- I have these cases a lot.

12

that went to trial where the defendant was found guilty,

13

I sentenced them to a minimum of 12 years.

14

The last ten cases

Pure facts.

The facts might have the effect of pushing

15

the defendant one way or another, but it's also factual

16

information of which he ought to be aware.

17

MR. YABLON:

That's right, Your Honor, and

18

this raises a question about what the scope of the

19

participation prohibition actually is.

20

And we're in a strange posture in this case

21

because the government has conceded that we're dealing

22

with a conceded plain violation of the rule, and yet

23

their analysis, instead of proceeding from that

24

violation, it goes out to the periphery and tries to

25

figure out where are the boundaries of Rule 11.
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Now -- and they cite some appellate cases

2

that arguably have applied too broad a construction of

3

the rule and have reversed where maybe there was just a

4

one-off comment or a purely informational comment, but

5

it's not clear that that is actually what the text of

6

Rule 11 forbids, particularly when you consider the

7

context of the rule and its underlying purposes.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So --

Well, we do need to

have a good sense of how far your -- your per se

10

structural argument is going to reach before we

11

decide -- in deciding whether it's appropriate or not.

12

MR. YABLON:

That's right, Your Honor, and

13

there are -- there are two ways to break it down.

14

is we do argue that the remedy that we seek should apply

15

for all cases of judicial participation.

16

question then is:

17

as expansive a category as the government suggests that

18

they are?

One

And the

Are judicial participation violations

19

Our second argument is that --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, on that, what's the

21

most minor thing that the government could do that would

22

still count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation?

23
24
25

MR. YABLON:

The most minor thing that the

government could do or a judge could do?
JUSTICE KAGAN:

That the judge could do.

23

Alderson Reporting Company

1

I'm sorry. 


2

MR. YABLON:

Well, the most minor -- we 


3

think that Rule 11 is concerned with judicial pressure 


4

to plead guilty.

5

might make a comment that, viewed from the transcript,

6

would suggest that the evidence against the defendant is

7

overwhelming or that the defendant is likely to get a

8

much lower sentence if he pleads guilty than if he goes

9

to trial.

10
11
12

And so the most -- I mean, a judge 


Those we think are -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what about

the hypothetical that I posed?
MR. YABLON:

So that hypothetical, if -- if

13

we were talking about a purely informational statement

14

like that, then, actually, we don't think that that is

15

likely to be a violation of Rule 11(c)(1).

16

reason is, if you look at 11(b), the rule expects that

17

judges are, in fact, going to be offering a lot of

18

advice to defendants before the defendant pleads guilty.

19

And the

And so if a judge is making the kinds of

20

comments that Rule 11(b) is contemplating, informing the

21

defendant about the nature of the charges against him,

22

attempting to make sure that the defendant understands

23

that his trial right is a real one, telling the

24

defendant a little bit about what, in fact, the -- the

25

sentencing exposure might be if he is convicted, those
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purely informational statements we don't think is what

2

is meant to be prohibited by the rule.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if he -- if it's

4

my example and he says, this is what I've done the past

5

ten times, so you ought to think long and hard about

6

whether a bargain for one year is a good deal.

7

MR. YABLON:

So -- and -- and this is

8

getting -- and then the judge may well be crossing the

9

line.

And what the judge --

10
11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's kind of a fine

line to -- to draw, isn't it?

12

MR. YABLON:

There's no question that there

13

will be close cases.

14

the majority of cases that are actually out there, most

15

judges, of course, are very scrupulous about following

16

the rule.

17

usually being circumspect about it, the judge is trying

18

to get a message across to the defendant.

19

I would say that if you look to

And when a judge is not, the judge is not

And so there may be difficult line-drawing

20

cases, and that's true whether you're looking at the

21

remedial approach that we're asking for or the remedial

22

approach that the government's asking for.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Yablon, the -- the

24

case that you're presenting would be quite strong if the

25

same judge -- if the magistrate judge also presided at
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the plea hearing, but here we have two factors that are

2

special in this case.

3

and two is we have the interval of some three months in

4

between.

5

me like it's exemplary.

6

through everything that Rule 11 calls for.

One is it's a different judge,

And then we have a plea hearing that looks to

7

The district judge did go

So it is a different case, isn't it, when we

8

have a plea hearing with a judge who is exerting no

9

pressure at all, has nothing to do with encouraging the

10

defendant to plead, but there was an earlier episode

11

where a magistrate judge did overbear?

12

MR. YABLON:

And at no point during the plea

13

colloquy hearing is the district judge in any way

14

acknowledging or disavowing the magistrate judge's

15

comments, which, we submit, there is at least a very

16

strong probability that those comments affected the

17

defendant's thinking and the reason that the defendant

18

is at the Rule 11 hearing in the first place.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but the -- but the

20

judge did ask, do you recognize that your -- your

21

conduct satisfied the elements of the conspiracy?

22

the defendant answered yes.

23

has anyone pressured you to plead guilty?

24

answers no.

25

And the -- the judge asked,
And he

So -MR. YABLON:

And

And, of course, in that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

situation, the defendant is likely not thinking about 


2

pressure that may come from the judiciary itself.

3

also, not to nitpick, but when he's asking that pressure 


4

question he's asking whether anyone pressured him to 


5

plead guilty today, which may not cause the defendant to

6

think back on why he actually started down the negotiation

7

road.

8

I think an important --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

pleading because defendants often think about it and I

12

can imagine a hypothetical where the lawyer comes in and

I'm not as much convinced by the delay in

to trial and exercise his rights.

5

because he was unhappy that his lawyer just wanted him

to plead guilty.

plea negotiations and a plea deal, which it's clear that

8

he is never happy about from the start.

Here is a defendant who for the

It's the reason that

After that hearing, suddenly there are

9

Even at the plea hearing, he is attempting

10

to tell the judge, look, I don't think that my conduct

11

actually is consistent with the conspiracy charge as

12

alleged.

13

when they are discussing the withdrawal motion that

14

basically he went forward because his lawyer was

15

instructing him that it was the right thing to do.

16

if you look at that sentencing --

17

And he says later on at the sentencing hearing

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

But that is the whole

18

point, which is this may be IAC, but I don't know how --

19

how you prove that what the magistrate judge said to him

20

led to his decision.

21
22
23
24
25

MR. YABLON:

And we don't need to prove

that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's only if we don't

accept that prejudice is a consideration here.
MR. YABLON:

Either way, if you were looking
28


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at whether this conduct should be viewed as inherently

2

prejudicial the reason that you might do that is because

3

you might think that at least in all of these cases

4

there might at least be a reasonable probability that it

5

would affect where the defendant is.

6

a defendant who has been adamant that he's not going to

7

plead, and when you have the judge making these comments

8

in front of the defendant, having him lose confidence in

9

his right to go to trial, then it's likely that that is

And here you have

10

shifting the defendant's mind set in a way that gets him

11

to the negotiating table.

12

defense lawyer's position in this case.

13

And it also reaffirms the

And so you have a defense lawyer who may

14

then go back to the prosecutor and say, we're just going

15

to get this deal done, and it may not be the deal that

16

the defendant would otherwise have reached.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

You want us to basically

18

not apply the 11(h) with the harmless error business, and

19

you basically want to prevent bizarre results by making

20

a tough definition of the word "participate."

21

how I understand you.

22

sounds to me as you say it in reading the briefs that

23

this is really a job for the rules committee.

24
25

That's

And maybe you are right, but it

This is a rule.

We don't normally have

structural errors in respect to rules.
29

Alderson Reporting Company

We have rules

Official

1

committees there to listen to this kind of complaint, to


2

weigh it in the system as a whole and to come up with 


3

better rules. 


4

MR. YABLON:

Let me address that in two ways 


5

because we have two separate arguments and I want to try 


6

to keep them distinct.

7

text and history of Rule 11, there is strong evidence 


8

that Congress actually made an affirmative judgment not 


9

to sweep in Rule 11 violations within the scope of Rule 


10
11

One is that if you look at the 


11(h).
Our second argument is that even if Rule 11(h)

12

applies to all Rule 11 errors, that all Rule 11(h) does

13

is apply the same substantial rights language that you

14

see in Rule 52(a) and (b).

15

recognized that, while that substantial rights language

16

is often synonymous with a case of specific prejudice

17

inquiry, that's not always true.

18

of examples.

19

constitutional cases in which the Court has said that an

20

error is structural without trying to determine -- make

21

a case-specific determination of prejudice.

22

And this Court has

And there are a number

The Court is familiar with the

But there are a number of nonconstitutional

23

cases as well in which the Court has said that an

24

individualized prejudice inquiry is simply

25

inappropriate, that the error affects substantial rights
30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

by its nature.

2

close to the one we have here is -- is Gomez v. United

3

States, where you have the Court addressing a statutory

4

provision that prevents magistrate judges from

5

conducting the jury voir dire.

6

violated and the Court is asked to conduct a prejudice

7

analysis, did it matter that the magistrate judge

8

conducted voir dire?

9

So one example that I think is fairly

And that provision is

And the Court said, we are not going to go there.

10

This is -- this is in effect a structural defect in the

11

proceedings.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Yablon, have we

13

ever said that about the violation of a rule of criminal

14

procedure, that it's structural error no matter what the

15

circumstances?

16
17

MR. YABLON:

Court has said that rules of criminal -- I'm so sorry --

First, Justice Sotomayor, this

She used to sit over there.

This Court has said that Federal rules and

Alderson Reporting Company

should be the same.

5

case where the Court did apply, in effect, a

6

structural analysis to -- to a rule violation and a

7

second case in which the Court at least left open the

8

possibility.

9

And in fact there is at least one

So the case in which the Court did so is the

10

McCarthy case, which is discussed extensively in the

11

briefs.

12

Rule 11 and said that prejudice adheres in a violation

13

of that rule and that it was not going to conduct an

14

individualized prejudice analysis.

15

to grant relief where there had not been full compliance

16

with that provision.

And the Court referred to the 1966 version of

It was simply going

17

Of course, the rule has been amended since

18

then, but that provides evidence that the Court is not

19

unwilling to adopt this kind of rule in the context of

20

the Federal Rules.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I would think, Mr. Yablon,

22

that one of the effects of doing what you are asking us

23

to do is that the rule will just get narrower and

24

narrower.

25

always the effect of finding a violation -- and I think

In other words, if automatic reversal is

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you acknowledge this in a way -- that people will just

2

find fewer and fewer violations.

3

we should do something like that rather than interpret

4

the rule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then

5

say, you know, somebody can look and say it really just

6

didn't matter that it was violated in this case.

7

MR. YABLON:

And I'm wondering why

So we think that our approach

8

is consistent with how the rule is, in fact, meant to be

9

interpreted.

The rule really is about this problem of

10

placing judicial pressure on defendants to plead guilty,

11

and those are the cases that ought to be reversed.

12

But the Court has a line-drawing decision to

13

make either way.

14

focus on is the line that separates participation from

15

nonparticipation or, again, a narrower class of

16

participation.

17

Either the line that the Court should

And I want to get to this point that --

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you are arguing for a

18

narrower interpretation of Rule 11(c)(1) than a number

19

of courts of appeals have adopted, isn't that correct?

20

MR. YABLON:

There -- I believe there are

21

some decisions out there that have adopted probably a

22

broader construction than we think is necessary and

23

appropriate.

24

to monitor?

25

narrowing -- the improper narrowing of the rule over time,

But what is easier for reviewing courts
Is it easier for them to monitor the

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or is it easier for them to monitor improper applications

2

of the harmless error rule, especially applications of it

3

that are happening in this kind of setting, where it's

4

going to be almost inherently a very speculative analysis,

5

an attempt to read the defendant's mind and ascertain 


6

whether the defendant was influenced by what the judge 


7

was saying. 


8
9

And it would be much easier for appellate 

courts to focus on the line-drawing exercise that 


10

determines whether or not a violation had occurred or,

11

if you think that the rule is broader, whether the kind

12

of violation that occurred in this case occurred, than

13

it would be to try to make these case-by-case scouring

14

the record, individualized prejudice determinations.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you say something

16

about Mr. Feigin's comments regarding what a judge can

17

and cannot do if the judge thinks that he or she sees a

18

violation of Lafler and Frye taking place?

19

MR. YABLON:

So there ought to be things

20

that a judge is able to do in that situation.

21

for example, that the judge becomes aware that the

22

defense attorney has given the -- his client false

23

information about the elements of the charge.

24

not violate Rule 11(c)(1) for the judge to say, I

25

understand that you were told that the elements of the
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Suppose,

It would

Official

1

charge are A, B, and C, but in fact they are X, Y, and

2

Z.

3

So there are -- there are certainly steps

4

that a judge can take to help root out the violation.

5

And I would say that the fact is that generally when it

6

comes to ineffective assistance of counsel claims, there

7

is only so much that the trial court can do.

8

the fact that the trial court may not be able to solve

9

or prevent every ineffective assistance claim in this

So

10

context is not necessarily an argument against the rule

11

because the judge often is not aware of the privileged

12

communications.

13

Now --

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the judge knows as a

14

result of pretrial motions that the evidence in the case

15

is very, very strong.

16

Let's say there's a -- there's been a motion

17

to suppress extremely incriminating evidence and the

18

motion has been denied, so the judge knows this is going

19

to come in.

20

there's virtually very little chance that the defendant

21

is going to be acquitted, and yet the defendant -- and

22

the judge knows that a plea bargain -- a plea offer was

23

made and the defendant initially was going to take it,

24

and then before it was accepted, it's rejected.

25

And the judge thinks if this comes in,

Is there anything a judge can do in that
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

situation?

2

case to be -- to be reversed?

3

Just sit back and, you know, wait for the

MR. YABLON:

Well, the judge's role in that

4

situation is -- is not to step in as defense counsel or,

5

in effect, as second prosecutor.

6

that there may be ways in that case for the judge to try

7

to alleviate the error without -- without crossing the

8

line.

9

in that -- in that situation, you -- you go down the

The judge -- I think

But when -- but when you start to make exceptions

10

road of -- of the judge being the one who is evaluating

11

the evidence and who is, in effect, potentially

12

presuming the defendant's guilt.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the judge --

It just puts -- puts the

14

judge in a very difficult position.

15

judge say, you -- do you realize that I denied your

16

motion to suppress that wiretap?

17

that on that wiretap, you conceded that the loss in this

18

case is $20 million, and do you know that under the

19

sentencing guidelines, the sentence where the loss is

20

$20 million is whatever it is, ten years in jail.

21

It could -- can the

And do you recognize

If the judge says all of that, has the judge

22

violated Rule 11(c)(1)?

23

MR. YABLON:

And if this is happening in the

24

context of active discussions of whether the defendant

25

should or should not take a plea, then that -- that may
36

well cross the line.

instance, again, you have a situation that may not be

13

different from situations that arise in completely

14

different contexts, where the attorney is doing

15

something that's ineffective, for example, and the judge

16

just doesn't know about it.

17

that can be cured in this -- in this setting of the --

18

of plea discussions, it's just a little bit tangential,

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would say in both

of those examples, the line -- the gray area, if you

1

were, is really quite narrow than here, where almost

2

every time you've been asked a question about a

3

difficult hypothetical, you say, well, maybe, maybe not.

4

And I think that's quite different than saying is the

5

court closed or not or was the person -- you know, did

6

he represent himself in fact or not.

7

strike me as much easier cases.

8

MR. YABLON:

9

all of the difficult hypotheticals.

10
11
12

And those just

And, of course, I'm being asked

If you look at the cases that actually
rise -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but if you were

13

-- if you were arguing whether or not it's -- it's

14

categorical error when the magistrate conducts voir

15

dire, it'd be pretty hard for somebody to come up with a

16

tough hypothetical.

17

MR. YABLON:

In that instance, yes.

But

18

there certainly are instances in which the structural --

19

in which the Court has found structural error, even when

20

there will be difficult line-drawing problems.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

Mr. Yablon, one problem

22

with calling this structural error is that it's not so

23

clear that this is a -- a bad thing.

24

States, even today, allow a judge to participate in plea

25

bargaining, and the advisors -- the rules advisory
39

Alderson Reporting Company

That is, some

Official

1

committee -- said, when it -- when it framed this rule,

2

that some commentators had said it was quite -- quite a

3

frequent thing that happened, that judges participated.

4

So it isn't like not having a public trial or not giving

5

a person counsel of choice.

6
7
8
9

It's, this was -- this was something that
still some jurisdictions think it's okay.
MR. YABLON:

Your Honor, no jurisdiction

endorses judicial exhortations to plead guilty.

And --

10

and so this Court can resolve the case just on that

11

narrower basis, that there is a category of cases that

12

clearly do involve direct judicial pressure.

13

State allow -- allows it, and those are clear violations

14

of the rules.

15

lines about how broad participation may reach, the Court

16

can do that.

17

And no

So without needing to draw these other

But even in those States, it's important to

18

note that -- that the Federal system has made a

19

different structural choice.

20

violate the Constitution for States to have carefully

21

tailored procedures that allow some type of judicial

22

involvement, that's not the structure that the Federal

23

system has chosen.

24

structural choice that was made in Rule 11, that judges

25

shall not, must not participate in plea discussions,

So whether or not it may

And when you're dealing with the

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that that is as elemental to the Federal system of plea

2

bargaining that we have as many of the familiar elements

3

of -- of the trial are.

4

have made -- made different structural choices does not

5

mean that it's not a structural error here.

6

And so the fact that States

Now, I do want to get back to this

7

line-drawing issue because I think that this is not

8

something that should trouble the Court too much, for a

9

couple of reasons.

10

First, in most cases, the line will not be

11

that hard to draw when you consider the purpose of Rule

12

11(c)(1), which is reducing judicial pressure, and

13

instances in which judges are stepping out of their role

14

as impartial adjudicators, and when reviewing courts

15

take that as the touchstone, there may be difficult

16

cases, but they're going to be able to resolve most of

17

them.

18

Now, if the Court feels like it may be

19

difficult to do line drawing, and it is uncomfortable

20

extending the rule -- the remedy that we're seeking that

21

far, it is entirely appropriate for the Court to -- to

22

take out a subcategory of Rule 11(c)(1) violations.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that seems a bit odd,

24

don't you think, Mr. Yablon?

25

well, there are core violations as opposed to noncore

You know, you're saying,

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

violations.

2

Court would think about when it was doing prejudice

3

analysis.

4

I mean, presumably, that's part of what the

MR. YABLON:

It would factor into the

5

prejudice analysis that the Court undertakes, but it

6

also is a reason just to -- to draw the line.

7

this Court in -- in various instances has

8

indicated that -- I mean, there are some -- some broad

9

rules out there, the right to the assistance of counsel.

I mean,

10

It comes in different shapes.

11

analysis that applies for a total denial of the right to

12

counsel is different from the one that applies when

13

you're dealing with mere deficiency in counsel's

14

performance.

15

And the prejudice

And there is -- and again, this is -- this

16

is a comparative line-drawing problem.

17

the line looking at what a violation is or looking at

18

what a judicial exhortation is from the statement that

19

is made, or you engage in this freewheeling speculation

20

that the government wants engaged in, where you were

21

trying to read the defendant's mind.

22

not how harmless error analysis normally proceeds, where

23

you have a closed universe of a record, you have

24

specific criteria that are being applied, and you can

25

posit what a reasonable juror is.
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Either you draw

And that is simply

Official

1

There is no reasonable defendant that can be

2

posited in the same way because defendants are

3

idiosyncratic and are entitled to be idiosyncratic.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Yablon, do you know of

5

any case where there is one of these core violations,

6

these exhortation cases, where the Court did not find

7

prejudice?

8
9

MR. YABLON:

The answer is no, and that

would be -- and we would urge the Court that if it does

10

not accept our primary submission, that it make clear

11

that judicial exhortations like this are highly unlikely

12

to be harmless.

13

That is what the Fourth Circuit has done,

14

the Fifth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Tenth

15

Circuit, the D.C. Circuit.

16

a per se analysis, they're just not calling it that.

17

They are reversing in all of these cases.

18

They are in effect applying

And so if this Court is uncomfortable

19

calling it a per se rule, at least it should give very

20

strong indications that comments like this cannot be

21

written off, that they are highly likely, given the

22

position of the judge relative to the defendant, to

23

affect the defendant's thinking, to affect the way that

24

the defense counsel approaches the case, and possibly

25

the prosecution as well in those cases in which the
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecution is aware of the error.

2

And we would go further and say that if the

3

Court were to go down this road, it would be useful for

4

the Court to provide the additional guidance of holding

5

that this particular error was not harmless.

6

send a signal to the lower courts that this conduct is

7

clearly off limits, and it would give them an indication

8

that the court means what it's saying, that these kind

9

of comments, where a judge is exhorting a defendant to

10
11

That would

come to the cross, that he needs to plead guilty -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do we -- if

12

we're giving this guidance, what do we say about the

13

fact that he had a different judge subsequent to this,

14

that he filed a speedy trial motion after this coercion,

15

which suggests that he wasn't coerced all that much.

16
17
18

Are we supposed to take all that into
consideration, too?
MR. YABLON:

You should say that those

19

inferences are not adequate to overcome the inference

20

that you draw from this type of participation,

21

particularly here.

22

I mean, consider the change in judge.

The

23

reason this hearing occurred before the magistrate judge

24

is because the defendant sent a letter to the district

25

court asking -- explaining his problems with his
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

counsel.

2

So in the defendant's mind, the magistrate judge and the

3

district court are effectively one and the same, and you

4

would not want a system where district courts are

5

encouraged to send these issues to magistrate judges, so

6

magistrate judges can engage in these kind of comments,

7

but then the district court judge can basically just

8

cleanse it.

9

process plays out.

10

He got a response from the magistrate judge.

It is going to affect the way that the

Now, the speedy trial issue, if I may

11

just -- we can equally draw the inference that that was

12

only done because counsel wanted to put some pressure on

13

the government to actually reach a deal.

14

kind of speculation that makes this error ill-suited to

15

the kind of remedial analysis the government favors.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. FEIGIN:

21

I just want to make one quick point in

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

response to the notion that we're asking for some form

23

of new prejudice analysis here.

24

This is the exact same prejudice analysis

25

from Dominguez Benitez, that looks whether there is a
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable probability that the error affected the plea.

2
3

Unless the Court has any further questions,
I will rest --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feigin, can I ask you

5

the same question that I asked Mr. Yablon, do you know

6

of any cases where in these -- where there are really

7

core violations, where a judge exhorts the defendant to

8

plea it -- does the Court ever find that

9

non-prejudicial?

10

MR. FEIGIN:

I am aware of one or two State

11

cases in which the court has looked at the passage of

12

time as a reason why that kind of error wouldn't have

13

been prejudicial.

14

But otherwise, I agree with Respondent that

15

in the Federal courts of appeals, that does tend to get

16

reversed.

17

the Court adopts the normal prejudice approach, and

18

reaffirms that approach in this case, that there's

19

not really that --

20

And I think that supports the idea that if

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you disagree with how

21

the Fourth and Seventh Circuits and other circuits apply

22

a prejudice analysis, but one that says that it's highly

23

unlikely that you're not going to find prejudice?

24

you disagree with their analysis and approach?

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Do

Well, Your Honor, there -46


Alderson Reporting Company

1

my -- I'm not going to go so far as to endorse the

2

results they've reached in every single case --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. FEIGIN:

No.

-- but I think insofar as they

5

approach the matter that -- you know, if there's a 


6

fairly serious error and the defendant pleads guilty 


7

right after that, that that's very likely absence of 


8

extenuating circumstances to be prejudicial; we don't 


9

have a problem with that. 


10

Unless there are further questions --
