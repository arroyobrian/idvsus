CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in 05-1575, Schriro versus Landrigan.

5

Mr. Cattani.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT E. CATTANI

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. CATTANI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Ninth Circuit's rejection of a reasoned

11

State court factual determination and decision is

12

improper under any deferential standard of review, and

13

it is particularly improper under the highly deferential

14

standard of review required under the AEDPA.

15

morning I'd like to try to develop three -- three

16

points.

17

This

First, the State court's factual finding

18

that Landrigan instructed his attorney not to present

19

any mitigating evidence was not an unreasonable finding

20

and, in fact, is the most logical interpretation of the

21

record.

22

does not show whether his decision not to present

23

mitigation evidence was knowing or voluntary, that is

24

not a claim that was ever developed in State court.

25

never alleged in his State post-conviction proceedings

Although Landrigan now argues that the record

3

Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that that, his decision to do that was not knowing or

2

voluntary.

3
4

Secondly, an evidentiary hearing is
unwarranted in this case -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

one?

7

involuntary?

Does the Constitution require there be no

8
9

May I ask about the first

MR. CATTANI:

It would require that it would

be knowing and voluntary, yes.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if the record showed

11

that he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to

12

voluntarily waive those Constitutional rights, wouldn't

13

the district court be able to reexamine that?

14

MR. CATTANI:

Well, there's no colloquy

15

requirement for a defendant to waive presentation of

16

mitigation.

17

the defendant or defense counsel had simply said my -

18

if the attorney had said my client has instructed me not

19

to present any mitigating evidence, and that would be

20

adequate.

21

his waiver was not knowing or voluntary, the burden

22

would shift to him to do that in a post-conviction

23

proceeding, and he did not do that in this case.

24
25

And I think it would have been enough if

If a defendant chooses to make a claim that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How would he make such a

claim in this case where in open court he was asked by
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether

2

it was the case that he did not want any mitigating

3

evidence introduced?

4

correct?

5

And he said, right, yes, that's

MR. CATTANI:

I agree, Your Honor.

It would

6

be very difficult for him to make that argument and I

7

suspect that's why the argument was not raised in the

8

State post-conviction proceeding.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I don't know if you

10

got to the third point you were going to make.

11

outlining three different points.

12

that from the very start, what happens is that you and

13

your brother for the respondent are talking past each

14

other.

15

State court's finding.

16

all we want is a hearing in the district court, and

17

those are two different issues.

18

You were

But it seems to me

You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the
The respondent says what we -

We want a hearing in the district court,

19

i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial

20

or incorrect.

21

issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each

22

other on this point.

Those, it seems to me, are two different

23

Did you see the same thing?

24

MR. CATTANI:

25

Yes, I did, Your Honor, and I

think the reason for that is, in our view an evidentiary
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hearing is not necessary because the factual finding by

2

the State court obviates the need for one.

3

evidentiary hearing would be developing evidence that

4

would never have been presented.

5

finding, the State court is in effect saying no matter

6

what counsel might or might not have developed, it would

7

not have been presented at sentencing because this

8

defendant specifically instructed his attorney not to

9

present any mitigating evidence.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

An

Given this factual

In your view, what is the

11

standard for when the district court may hold an

12

evidentiary hearing?

13

discretion in it.

14

I know there's an element of

MR. CATTANI:

A district -- the district

15

court can order an evidentiary hearing if the defendant

16

has been denied an opportunity to develop relevant facts

17

necessary to resolve a colorable claim in State court.

18

And I think here the defendant fails on two different

19

points.

20

First -

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22
23

That's the only time the

district court can hold a hearing?
MR. CATTANI:

Well, it has to be through no

24

fault of his own and if the facts were not developed in

25

State court.

Certainly it's the petitioner's
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

obligation, a defendant's obligation to present these

2

claims in State court and the only -- the reason -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, but it seems that if

4

he doesn't do that, then that's a bar.

5

done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?

6

MR. CATTANI:

But if he has

Well, but that's the point

7

here.

8

develop facts or he was not precluded from developing

9

facts that would be relevant to a resolution of his

10

He has not done that.

He did not attempt to

ineffective assistance claim.

11

If I could, Your Honor, there are two

12

different parts of that question.

13

not relevant.

14

an evidentiary hearing is this additional, this

15

mitigation that should have been developed.

16

fact, his avowal that he did not want any mitigation to

17

be presented is accurate, then these other facts are not

18

relevant.

19

First, the facts are

The facts that he's seeking to develop in

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If, in

No, but isn't that the

20

problem in your argument?

Because your argument

21

assumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a

22

moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he

23

informed the court that he did not want mitigation

24

evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of -

25

binds him as a matter of law for all time.
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And what he is saying here is look, if I had

2

known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence,

3

as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end

4

of the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver,

5

if you want to call it that.

I would not have made that

6

representation to the court.

And what I want is an

7

evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact,

8

when I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I

9

didn't mean this.

10

And he wants a hearing for that.

The only

11

way it seems to me that you can properly win on the

12

issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I

13

think you said a moment ago.

14

finding that he made a statement, whatever its

15

predicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating

16

evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a

17

matter of law.

18
19
20

That once there is a

My question is, do you have any authority
for that?
MR. CATTANI:

Simply the AEDPA 2254(e).

I

21

don't have a specific case that also would go directly

22

to that point.

23

Your Honor, I would also -

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Justice Souter's

question highlights an ambiguity in this Ninth Circuit
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opinion, for me anyway.

2

that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is

3

the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation

4

evidence that he now wants to present?

5

MR. CATTANI:

Do you understand the hearing

It seems to me the hearing is

6

directed at presenting all of the mitigation evidence

7

that he now wants to present.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:
both?

Doesn't it have to go to

Because I mean, he's saying look, first I want to

10

show that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence

11

that was not proffered, that I didn't have in mind, that

12

I wouldn't have objected to.

13

And he then wants to proceed with respect to

14

his inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the

15

existence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't

16

look to.

17

There's a dual purpose, I thought.

18

MR. CATTANI:

19
20

I would agree with that, but

Your Honor JUSTICE SCALIA:

I wouldn't agree with it.

21

I thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear

22

that it did not agree with the district court's

23

determination that he had waived mitigating evidence.

24

thought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that

25

finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating
9

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence.

2

MR. CATTANI:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that so?

I mean,

4

that's what that -- one of the reasons the case was

5

here, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a

6

district court factual finding that he had waived any

7

mitigating evidence.

Isn't that what happened?

8

MR. CATTANI:

That's correct, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it wasn't remanding for

10

a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence.

11

It made the determination that he had not waived it, and

12

then remanded for investigation into what that

13

mitigating evidence would be.

14

MR. CATTANI:

I don't know that it's

15

completely clear as to what the Ninth Circuit is saying

16

can be developed and how that evidence can be used.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it's clear at least

18

that they disagreed with the finding of the district

19

court that there had been a waiver, no?

20
21
22

MR. CATTANI:

That's right, Your Honor, and

I think JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it's clear that they

23

disagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive.

24

Is anything clear beyond that?

25

hesitant to say I'm raising the same question that the

I mean, I guess I'm

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Chief Justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court

2

did.

3

I mean, there's no question that they found

4

that the -- the State trial court's finding with respect

5

to waiver or whatever we want to call it was not

6

necessarily dispositive.

7

they found anything beyond that, but correct me if I'm

8

wrong.

9

MR. CATTANI:

I don't think it's clear that

The Ninth Circuit ordered an

10

evidentiary hearing to allow him to develop whatever

11

mitigation he's proffered in Federal court.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

But that could

13

have, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual

14

purpose.

15

the nondispositive character of the State court's

16

finding; and two, to show relief for inadequate

17

assistance of counsel.

18

One to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or

And the question here is that, the immediate

19

question is what exactly did the State court find with

20

respect to -- oh, sorry -- what exactly did the Ninth

21

Circuit find with respect to the State court finding?

22

And there's no question that the Ninth

23

Circuit assumed that the State court finding was not

24

necessarily dispositive, but I don't know that it's

25

clear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could help me if I'm wrong.

2

MR. CATTANI:

Well, the Ninth Circuit

3

clearly held that the State court's determination of the

4

facts was unreasonable.

5

decision because if the determination of facts was

6

reasonable, it obviates the need for any further

7

evidentiary hearing.

8
9

And that's the problem with its

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on the waiver point,

let's assume that this case had not come in -- come

10

here, and you had gone back to the district court

11

pursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit.

12

Surely you would have taken the position, or

13

you could have taken the position if the evidence

14

developed that way, that he really knew or should have

15

known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived.

16

You certainly could continue to take that position in

17

the district court.

18

MR. CATTANI:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the district court

20

would say I now have a more full, factual record, and I

21

make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there

22

wasn't.

23

MR. CATTANI:

Yes, but the point we've tried

24

to make is that he was allowed an opportunity to develop

25

his claim about whether his -- whether he made that
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statement and whether he intended to instruct his

2

attorney not to present any mitigating evidence.

3

submitted an affidavit where he said, if my counsel had

4

told me there was this evidence of a genetic

5

predisposition to violence, I would have allowed that to

6

be presented.

7

He

The court -- there was no need for an

8

evidentiary hearing because the court simply accepted -

9

accepted as true that Landrigan would have provided that

10
11

testimony.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how could the district

12

court on remand find that there was a valid waiver when

13

the Ninth Circuit says on A-17, the appendix to the

14

petition, for all the foregoing reasons, Landrigan has

15

not waived the right to assert a claim for ineffective

16

assistance of counsel?

17

MR. CATTANI:

I think you're correct.

The

18

Ninth Circuit has specifically found that the

19

determination of facts was unreasonable and found that

20

Landrigan has established a colorable claim of

21

ineffective assistance.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And it has not waived.

Not

23

that the district court was -- didn't have enough

24

evidence before it.

25

has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective

It says the foregoing, Landrigan

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3

assistance.
So how can you possibly say that that
question is still open?

4

MR. CATTANI:

Well, I -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The district court has to

6

accept that he hasn't waived.

7

for is for all of the facts that show -- that show he

8

had ineffective assistance of counsel.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what it's sent back

Let me ask this question.

10

It seems to me that there are two separate parts to the

11

waiver issue.

12

put on any mitigating evidence?

13

One, did he intend to say I don't want to

But then the second part of the question is,

14

was that statement made knowingly and voluntarily, just

15

as a guilty plea or something like that has to be.

16

So is it enough for you to say it's clear

17

what he intended, or is it also part of your burden to

18

say that that intent was expressed in a way that was

19

knowing and voluntary, compliant with the rule that

20

applies to waivers of constitutional rights?

21

MR. CATTANI:

I think it's clearly enough

22

simply to say that, as I indicated, even if it had just

23

been an avowal by the attorney that this defendant has

24

instructed me not to present mitigating evidence, that

25

that would be enough.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is that a sufficient

2

waiver without inquiring as to whether it was a knowing

3

and intelligent waiver, that he knew what he could put

4

in, and so forth and so on?

5

MR. CATTANI:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

I

6

think to the extent that the defendant wants to raise

7

that, he can raise that in a State post-conviction

8

proceeding.

9

post-conviction proceeding.

10

He should make that type of argument in the

And that's not what he did here.

An

11

analogous situation is that -- came up in a case that

12

the defense, that Landrigan has cited, Iowa versus

13

Tovar.

14

raise a claim -- that case involved whether it was a

15

counsel -- it was a decision to waive counsel at a plea

16

proceeding.

17

that is in a post-conviction proceeding, and that the

18

burden shifts to the defendant to raise that issue.

And this Court expressly noted that the time to

19

And this Court noted that the time to raise

And here if you look at the, the petition

20

for post-conviction relief, if you look at the affidavit

21

that Mr. Landrigan submitted, there, there is nothing in

22

there that suggests that "I did not understand what I

23

was doing when I instructed my counsel not to present

mitigation.

25

mitigation."

So I would -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't there something that,

3

isn't he saying implicitly Justice Souter implicitly "I

4

didn't have this kind of evidence in mind; if I had been

5

aware of this kind of evidence, I wouldn't have given

6

that instruction?"

7

So he is, it seems to me, implicitly saying

8

well, my waiver was not knowing, in the sense that I

9

understood there was this kind of evidence and intended

10

to preclude its introduction?

11
12

MR. CATTANI:

Isn't that clear?

It's clear he is saying that I

would have permitted one type of mitigating evidence.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that's the same thing,

14

isn't that the same, a way of saying that to that extent

15

my waiver was not knowing?

16

MR. CATTANI:

He, he's raised to it that

17

extent as to that particular piece of mitigation.

18

the trial court is expressly saying I disbelieve you

19

when you say you would have allowed presentation of that

20

mitigation.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

And he's saying if you will

give me a hearing, district court, I will try to

demonstrate to you why, why the State court's finding on

24

that point was unreasonable.

25

finding based on its observation of me at trial and, and

The State court made that

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at the sentencing phase; but it didn't give me a, a

2

further chance to develop my evidence on, on

3

post-conviction.

4

And I want a hearing to develop that

5

evidence in front of you, Federal district court, in

6

order to prove that the State court's finding in light

7

of that evidence was unreasonable.

8
9

Isn't, isn't it correct that that's what
he's asking for now?

10

MR. CATTANI:

He is, Your Honor, but I would

11

suggest that there is no further evidence that was

12

presented that he was attempting to present in State

13

court regarding whether his waiver was knowing or

14

voluntary.

15
16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How would -- how do we know

that?

17

MR. CATTANI:

MR. CATTANI:

3

4

claim.

5

I don't think, I don't think

I think he was not raising that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but, I thought a second

6

ago you -- you admitted that to a degree he was, because

7

he is saying implicitly if I had known about this kind

8

of mitigating evidence, I wouldn't have waived.

9

Therefore, my waiver was, as to this, not a knowing

10
11

waiver.
MR. CATTANI:

He raised that as to that one

12

aspect of mitigation.

13

simple for him, a simple matter for him to argue I

14

didn't understand the whole concept of mitigation.

15

didn't understand what I was doing.

16

But it would have been very

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I

Look, it would have been a

17

better affidavit, it would have been better pleading.

18

We can stipulate to that.

19

there is any serious question that he is arguing right

20

now that as to this kind of evidence, had I known about

21

it I wouldn't have waived and therefore, I shouldn't be

22

precluded from, from getting it in now.

23
24
25

But is there, I don't see

And, and if there's no question about that,
then -- then I think we're just fighting about words.
MR. CATTANI:

Well, I think the issue was

2

Landrigan was not credible even in making that assertion

that I would have allowed presentation of genetic

9

unreasonable resolution of a factual issue.

10

I want a

hearing.

11

That's all he's asking for, isn't it?

12

MR. CATTANI:

I would just suggest that

13

there is no further evidence other than putting

14

Landrigan on the stand to say -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

18

Well, that's pretty good

any need for an, for the trial court to put Landrigan on

Circuit's finding, that the State court unreasonably

Now, why shouldn't he have a hearing on

MR. CATTANI:

Well, the problem with, that

11

Your Honor, is that he didn't ask for, for a hearing to

12

present testimony from, for example, his biological

13

mother and his ex-wife, who would have presented the

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. CATTANI:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

In State court he didn't.

In State court in the Well, I mean, is the

18

requirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a

19

State court on a general matter, "I would like to show

20

through a hearing," then he gives a whole lot of

21

affidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce,

22

that then the State says "no," you go into Federal court

23

and say "I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have

a few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra

25

things," no, you can't do that?

in State court that you plead with specificity what type

of claims you're raising in a post-conviction -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Didn't he say my claim is

ineffective assistance?

6

MR. CATTANI:

Ineffective assistance -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

Because he didn't

investigate to discover the horrendous circumstances in

which I was raised, and had he done it, he would have

10

found roughly this kind of thing, and I would like to

11

show that he should have done that because it would have

12

changed the result?

13

MR. CATTANI:

Well, his argument at

14

State court was not that he didn't investigate that; his

15

argument in the post-conviction proceeding was he could

16

have presented that through some other witnesses.

certainly an ambiguous argument to present in mitigation

at a sentencing hearing.

MR. CATTANI:

Certainly.

And that is, that

is the main point I'm trying to make is that that was

7

the only thing he was asserting in his post-conviction

8

proceeding, was that "I would have liked have raised

this argument that I'm generically predisposed to

violence."

12

restricted, he had limited his counsel's, restricted his

13

counsel from presenting the very type of evidence that

14

we're talking about now, this other type of evidence.

The rest of the argument I think would have

I thought all that evidence

the reasonableness of the State court's factual finding.
23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, but the

2

reasonableness of factual findings depends on what the

3

evidence is that can go in on the issue of

4

reasonableness.

5

between a proffer of evidence which the district court

6

says "well, I'll assume that," on the one hand, and on

7

the other hand, the actual presentation of witnesses

8

perhaps including Landrigan himself, which the court

9

actually hears.

And there's a universe of difference

You know, you, sometimes you get a lot more

impressed by real evidence than by assumptions you make

12

for the sake of argument.

of difference.

14

MR. CATTANI:

I don't necessarily disagree

claim was that was raised in the State post-conviction

The only thing, but the -

the -- I guess on that point, my only, my only reason

20

for raising this with you is on that point, it's not

21

enough to say well, the district court assumed this.

22

for that matter, the State trial court assumed this.

That is not the same thing as putting in the

MR. CATTANI:

dead right, not factually, but just as a matter of law,

2

that you cannot waive this right unless the record shows

3

that he's fully advised of the scope of the right that

4

he's waiving.

5

MR. CATTANI:

Well, first, there's no

6

authority that I'm aware of that would require any type

7

of a specific colloquy.

8
9

I think this record -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's new to me also.

I

never heard of it.

10

MR. CATTANI:

And I think that would be -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But why should it be, why

12

should there be a less complete colloquy for this kind

13

of waiver than a guilty plea itself?

14

there's no authority on the point.

15

absolutely obvious?

16

MR. CATTANI:

Now I admit
But isn't it

Well, I think the reason

17

there's no need for one is because a defendant can come

18

in and if he really believes that his waiver was not

19

knowing and voluntary, he has an opportunity to pursue

20

that type of claim in a post-conviction proceeding.

21

he can come in and proffer whatever evidence he wants to

22

proffer if, in fact, that's his claim, that he didn't

23

understand -

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Some kind of waivers, like

waiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a
26
Alderson Reporting Company

colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what

2

consequences of foregoing counsel are.

4

what a significant decision that is.

5

take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the

6

question, you know, "do you agree that your counsel

7

should not introduce any mitigating evidence?"

8

it's clear on, on its face.

9
10

MR. CATTANI:

So the judge

But it doesn't

I mean,

I would agree, Your Honor.

And I think -

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But doesn't that assume

12

that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is?

13

mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, "I

14

thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what

15

the, these two relatives were going to testify to.

16

There was really much more, if my counsel had

17

investigated."

18

And that's not a knowing waiver.

MR. CATTANI:

I think that type of argument

19

was belied by what, what happened at the time of

20

sentencing.

21

I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, unless the argument

22

is, and maybe this is what the other side its going to

MR. CATTANI:

Well, I agree, Your Honor.

And it's because the nature of mitigation is so open

ended, it would be difficult to explain precisely and

16

have a waiver of every conceivable item of mitigation.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And so are you, are you in

effect then saying that the waiver does not need to be a

knowing waiver in the sense that it needs to be based

upon an appreciation of all the possible mitigation

21

evidence that in this case might come in?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

5

I'd like to begin by clearing up what

6

exactly we did and didn't argue with respect to waiver

7

and what exactly is and isn't before this Court on that

8

set of issues in our judgment.

10

Circuit did and what effect that would have on this

11

Court's disposition of the case.

I then would like to

And if there's any

I'd like to turn to the question of

Now, with respect to this question of

17

whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid

18

counsel for the State is just wrong about this.

19

important to understand how this comes up.

20

a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient

21

performance and prejudice.

22

defense to that claim:

23

It's

We asserted

The State asserted as a

No, no, he's waived.

And the trial judge, the State habeas judge

24

in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that

25

and said, well, yes, he's waived.

We then filed a

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

petition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't

2

rely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing

3

and intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst.

4

That's at page 92 of the joint appendix.

5

That motion for rehearing was denied without

6

any further comment.

We then took a petition to review

7

to the Arizona Supreme Court.

8

appendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in

9

which we specifically argued that you can't look to this

That's also in the joint

10

so-called waiver as a defense to our claim of

11

ineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and

12

intent.

13

Now, in the State's response to our

14

petition, which unfortunately is not in the joint

15

appendix but is in the record, the State says:

16

waiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally

17

defaulted because this procedure was decided on direct

18

review.

19

that you raised this Johnson against Zerbst issue too

20

late, it can't be considered.

21

We then went to -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

that.

Well, there's no -- but the

17

point is that's not -- when we took this to the Arizona

18

19

in opposition to our raising Johnson against Zerbst.

20

Then when we got to the Federal district court we raised

21

this again, this exact argument in Federal district

22

court, and the State in Federal district court didn't

23

object that we had failed to raise this appropriately in

24

the State proceedings.

25

We took it to the Ninth Circuit.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

They

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

didn't raise the objection that we failed to raise it

2

appropriately in the State proceedings.

3

that question has even been raised here is in the reply

4

brief on the merits in this Court.

5

The first time

And I think that's tied to the next point I

6

want to make, which is significant, which is as the case

7

comes to this Court the Ninth Circuit has ruled that we

8

have met the requirements of 2254(e)(2) and are

9

therefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing.

10

Now, what the State is essentially saying

11

is, well, no, you really aren't entitled to an

12

evidentiary hearing on this set of issues because you

13

didn't raise them adequately in the State court.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And is it just an

15

evidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination

16

to commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the

17

waiver question?

18

MR. VERRILLI:

On both, Your Honor.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why did -- the

20

court on page A-17 ruled that there was no waiver.

21

why would they then send it back for an evidentiary

22

hearing on waiver?

23

MR. VERRILLI:

So

Let me move to that if I

24

could, because I do think that's significant.

25

the Court has elucidated the two potential readings of
34
Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Ninth Circuit's decision.

It seemed to us as we

2

prepared this case on the merits that the reality is

3

that the two, the issue of performance and the issue of

4

waiver, are tied together, because if it comes out after

5

a hearing that counsel did perform an effective job, a

6

diligent job of performing the investigation, and did

7

instruct the client as to what the mitigation evidence

8

was, then you view the waiver in a different light than

9

of course you would if the counsel hadn't.

So we

10

acknowledge here that the proper disposition of this

11

case ought to be a remand for an evidentiary hearing.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that wasn't your

13

assertion even in this motion for a hearing.

14

that he didn't know what he was giving up.

15

rather the sentencing transcript, you say, "does not

16

establish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and

17

intelligently waived his right to present mitigating

18

evidence.

19

right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in

20

frustration with his attorney during that particular

21

proceeding."

heat of anger.

3

Now, you're raising a totally different issue.

4

saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all

5

the elements of mitigation that the waiver might

6

embrace.

7

And he didn't think it was in the

He did think that it was a valid waiver.
You're

That wasn't the argument you were making here.
MR. VERRILLI:

Your Honor, I want to respond

8

directly to Your Honor's question, if you'll just permit

9

me one more thought about the Ninth Circuit and I'll

10

turn right back to that.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. VERRILLI:

Okay.
So in other words, we are

13

making a more modest request for relief here which, is

14

affirmance of the judgment sending back for an

15

evidentiary hearing, but with a recognition that the

16

evidentiary hearing ought to deal with the issue of

17

waiver, which should be understood to be left open.

18

think we're conceding something here, that waiver ought

19

to be left open and not definitively resolved.

20

premature to definitively resolve that against the State

21

without an inquiry.

22

I

It's

Now, turning to Your Honor's point, the -

23

with respect to whether there was a waiver here or not

24

and what the State judge did or didn't do, something

25

very significant here that I think the State's argument

6

and beginning at page D-4 -- D-3 is where the colloquy

occurs where this alleged waiver happened.

next thing that occurs, the very next thing that occurs,

is the trial judge says:

Then the mitigation witnesses say:

that occurs is the trial judge says:

15

when all that's said and done, the trial judge says to

16

the lawyer -- - and this is at D-15 -- you got anything

pass sentence.

21

pages are D-20 and 21, and on those pages you will see

22

that what the judge does is not treat Mr. Landrigan's

MR. VERRILLI:

Let me address your second

question first and then your first question.

14

I think that that in two senses does not

15

accurately represent what this mitigation case presented

16

to the State court and presented to the Federal court is

17

all about.

With respect even to his affidavit, which I

It says the "biological component of

claim and -

That suggests to me it's a genetic

MR. VERRILLI:

But one other thing it does

5

that's very significant, Mr. Chief Justice, is it also

6

says that these witnesses can attest to the use of

7

alcohol and drugs by the biological mother when

8

Landrigan was in utero.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but he knew

10

about that.

11

the trial because his biological mother was there.

12

He knew about that mitigating evidence at

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, but what he's saying

13

that he would have agreed to, it seems to me the only

14

fair reading in this affidavit, which again I don't

15

think fairly defines the full scope of what he's allowed

16

to proceed with under Arizona procedure, but with

17

respect to this affidavit he's saying, well, if you had

18

had an expert who could have come in and given testimony

19

about fetal alcohol syndrome and the organic brain

20

damage and other impairments that it causes, I would

21

have cooperated with that.

22

significant because if you look at page D-21 of the

23

appendix to the petition -

24
25

And that's really

How could that be

helpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother

expert opinion and then provide it to the court.

That's a routine matter, for experts to

10

mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court?

2

That's what he had in mind?

3

MR. VERRILLI:

If I -- whatever else

4

happened, the trial judge here considered this evidence

5

of mitigation and did a weighing.

6

want to make sure I make here is that therefore any

7

evidence that this lawyer had prepared, an expert on

8

fetal alcohol syndrome most prominently and any other

9

evidence, the trial lawyer could have proffered at the

10

time and had considered at the time and had weighed at

11

the time by this trial judge.

12

prejudice, it seems to me, that even if one grants, even

13

if one assumes -- and we dispute it and I'd like too

14

talk about that -- but even if one assumes that there is

15

a finding and we can't do anything about it that

Landrigan would not have cooperated in the presentation

of any -

And the key point I

And that's a claim of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, do you

19

think it's possible to have a valid waiver of the

20

presentation of mitigating evidence or is it always

21

possible that some additional evidence would come up and

22

you say, what if I had known that, I wouldn't have

23

waived it?

24
25

MR. VERRILLI:

I don't think there's a yes

or no answer to that question.

It's something -

41
Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can't give a yes

2

answer to whether it's ever possible.

3

MR. VERRILLI:

4

Yes.

Yes, it's possible.

It's certainly possible.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

MR. VERRILLI:

Okay.

But I think I don't -- I want

7

to make sure I don't leave any implication that the rule

8

we're asking for here is going to open the door to lots

9

of claims, because I don't think it does for two sets of

10

reasons.

One is a procedural set of reasons and that's

11

the -- that, we refer the Court to the Blackledge

12

against Allison decision -- that if -- that it's not

13

going to be enough in every case for you to plead an

14

adequate claim and then jump right to an evidentiary

15

hearing.

16

court has available to it a number of tools that it can

17

use to test the claim before granting an evidentiary

18

hearing.

As the court said in Allison, the district

So there's a limitation there.

mitigating evidence; I'm a really bad guy.

how he's trying to portray himself.

24

and you allow for the possibility that there could be a

25

knowing waiver of mitigation.

The defendant
I don't want any
And that's

What -- you said,

What would have had to

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

transpire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?

2

MR. VERRILLI:

I think that's important, and

3

hopefully it will help explain why we think that this is

4

a narrow -- that the rule we're asking for here is a

5

narrow one, and it's not going to open the door to lots

6

of claims.

7

other fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial,

8

the defendant's got to understand what mitigation means.

He's got to understand its significance in the

have a situation in which you have documented that the

20

client understands what mitigation is -- and frankly I

21

don't think, with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice,

22

this is the kind of documentation that ought to suffice.

23

But even if you had that, even if you documented that

24

the defendant understood it, even if you documented that

25

the defendant clearly waived it and documented that was

And so if you

done with counsel's assistance, then it seems to me it

2

is going to be very hard for a habeas petitioner to

3

plead something that's going to get past -

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why isn't the type

5

of documentation that would be sufficient?

6

understands what the consequence of not putting

7

mitigating evidence on is going to be.

8
9

MR. VERRILLI:

He

Well, because I think there

isn't clarity at all that he understands what mitigating

10

evidence is, what the full scope of it is and how it

11

could -

He's present in the court while

13

they're making a proffer of this sort of mitigating

14

evidence.

15

he doesn't want the evidence, I want to know what it is.

16

And he called the two witnesses.

17

defendant does is undermine his lawyer's effort to

18

present the mitigation.

19

The judge is quite careful, saying okay, if

And so I don't think you can cut off his

Well, are you claiming that
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

-- are you claiming that his attorney did not adequately

2

represent him at the sentencing hearing with respect to

3

the question of waiver?

4

the attorney should have insisted that the judge go

5

through some kind of more comprehensive colloquy with

6

him about waiver and inform him of certain things about

7

what he was giving up?

8
9

In other words, when -- that

Are you making that claim?

MR. VERRILLI:

I think, Justice Alito, we're

making a couple of different claims, not that claim, but

10

a couple of different claims.

11

particularly to a mental health expert, that even if

12

Landrigan behaved exactly the way -- at 13 -- he in fact

13

behaved in the counterfactual world in which he had

14

received adequate representation, that the mental health

15

expert testimony could have been proffered to the Court,

16

had it been prepared and developed, would have been

17

considered, and could have made a critically important

18

difference and for precisely the reason that

19

Justice Ginsburg's question suggested, which is that

20

he's obviously behaving badly in this situation.

21

One is, and it pertains

What the trial court ruled out of that is,

22

well, he's an amoral person.

What the mental health

23

testimony would give you is an alternative frame of

24

reference for making a reasoned moral judgment about

25

this guy, and could be critically important in
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

explaining that behavior.

So even within the confines

2

of accepting that the world would have unfolded exactly

3

the way it did, it was ineffective to have dropped the

4

ball on preparing that kind of evidence.

5

Then it's also ineffective in -

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

I'm not

7

following you.

8

testimony could have gone to whether the judge should

9

have accepted the waiver?

10

MR. VERRILLI:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12
13

You mean the mental health expert's

No.
I thought that's what you

were saying, I'm sorry.
MR. VERRILLI:

No, to the basic weighing the

14

mitigation which the judge undertook based on all

15

proffered evidence.

16

argument that the waiver that, even if you are going to

17

consider that a waiver, you can't consider it a knowing

18

and voluntary waiver, knowing intelligent waiver

19

supported adequately by the efforts of counsel.

20

Then beyond that, we're making an

JUSTICE ALITO:

Isn't that a separate

21

question, whether it's a knowing and intelligent waiver?

22

Isn't the question here whether he was prejudiced, which

23

is a question of fact, which is a question of whether

24

had he been informed of the possibility of mitigation

25

evidence relating to a history of family violence, he
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would have persisted in blocking the admission of any

2

mitigation evidence?

3

it was knowing and intelligent.

4

separate legal question.

5

Isn't that the issue?

MR. VERRILLI:

No.

Not whether

That would be a

I don't think that's the

6

issue.

With all due respect, Justice Alito, I think the

7

test under Strickland is whether there was sufficient

8

performance, which we think we have a very powerful

9

record of here, and then a reasonable probability that

10

the outcome would have been different.

And I think the

11

inquiry here that the State habeas judge is undertaking

12

is the reasonable probability inquiry.

13

to be a mixed question that requires -

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

That seems to me

Yes, it's a mixed question.

15

But if the post-conviction relief court found as a

16

matter of fact that even had he known about the

17

possibility of this type of mitigation evidence, he

18

would have persisted in refusing to cooperate -- if

19

there was such a finding, and know you dispute it -- and

20

if you were granted a hearing, is it not true you would

21

have to disprove that by clear and convincing evidence?

22

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, taking our first

23

argument to the side, our first argument which I've been

24

discussing about what happened at the hearing, I think

25

with respect to that argument the answer's no, that
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument stands without any need to disprove the factual

2

finding, if you assume it is a factual finding, and we

3

don't concede that.

4

But if it is a factual finding, then yes, we

5

would have to disprove it by clear and convincing

6

evidence, but we think we can do that, and all we're

7

asking for is a hearing to enable us the opportunity.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the standard?

I

ask that because I'm not certain from what I heard

10

previously -- I think the State was saying that the only

11

issue that was raised before the State proceeding,

12

collateral, the State collateral post-sentencing

13

proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that

14

he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something

15

like that.

16

When I've looked at this, it's on page 88,

17

the motion filed says we have two claims.

18

the claim that was just mentioned, it says that -- about

19

it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and

20

alcohol.

21
22
23

One claim is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where are you quoting from?

JUSTICE BREYER:

Joint appendix A.

I'm sorry.
And then

24

there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to

25

failing to investigate these alternative sources, we
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

also want to say that counsel failed to explore

2

additional grounds, and that was the sister.

3

sister was going to testify that the mother -- the

4

foster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she

5

has a whole list of things in her affidavit.

6
7

So is that still before us?

I mean, isn't

that something you want to argue?

MR. VERRILLI:

11

And the

Absolutely.

MR. VERRILLI:

All right.
Thank you, Your Honor, for

bringing us back to that question.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then the claim would be

13

this:

You want a hearing in which you're going to

14

present the sister, the Landrigans, what they did , what

15

the school says, what happened to him at school, all

16

things that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the

17

State court, and that the biological gene.

18

to say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your

19

mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this

20

been looked into and presented to the defendant, the

21

defendant would not have said don't present any of that,

22

it would have been presented, and it would have made a

23

difference.

Thank you.

The -- with

respect to the standard, there are two things that we

have to show and if we do, we're entitled to a hearing.

15

One is that we're not disentitled under the analysis

16

under Section 2254(e)(2) as explicated in the Court's

17

Michael Williams decision, to show that the court below

18

That's established and

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That you've satisfied (e)(2)?

That (e)(2) does not apply to

us proceeding to an evidentiary hearing.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why, because you

satisfy it or because it doesn't apply?

3

MR. VERRILLI:

Because the -- there is no

4

lack of diligence here that would trigger us meeting the

5

heightened requirements of (e)(2), and therefore it

6

doesn't apply to bar us.

7
8

Now, with -- the other thing we have to
show -

9
10

That's the theory.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, you'll

just have to bear with me.

11

MR. VERRILLI:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're saying you

13

satisfy (e)(2)(A)(ii), because there's no lack of

14

diligence.

15

which is to show that no reasonable factfinder would

have found him guilty, in other words words subject to

Don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(B),

MR. VERRILLI:

No, Your Honor.

That's

19

-- as we understand the Michael Williams decision

20

interpreting that provision, Your Honor, those

21

requirements only kick in in a situation where you

22

haven't shown diligence and therefore you're at fault,

23

and you can overcome your fault by meeting those

24

heightened standards.

where you have been diligent and therefore you're not -

With respect to the -- what else -- with

respect to what else we'd have to show, we'd have to

4

show that -- and this is the Townsend standard, which

5

nothing has changed -- that we've alleged facts which,

6

if proven, entitle us to relief.

7

things we have to show and we've done both of those

8

things.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Those are the two

And the district court has

10

substantial discretion in determining whether or not to

11

grant that hearing on that basis.

12

MR. VERRILLI:

And the Ninth Circuit -- and

13

it seems to us actually, Your Honor, under Townsend in

14

that situation the hearing's mandatory.

15

court would have discretion under habeas, under habeas

16

practice, to hold a hearing as a discretionary matter

17

even in a situation where we haven't shown a mandatory

18

entitlement to it.

So there is discretion there.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

circumstances under which we could prevail.

2

We're -- our position is an intermediate

3

one, which is that the right answer here is that the

4

judgment to send it back for an evidentiary hearing was

5

correct and should be affirmed.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What do you do

7

with -- following up on Justice Kennedy's question, the

8

dissent took the position in the Ninth Circuit that the

9

mitigating value of any proven, quoting A-24, "genetic

10

predisposition to violence would not have outweighed its

11

aggravating tendency to suggest that Landrigan was

12

undeterable and even from prison would present a future

13

danger"?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

I think the answer is that

15

that is an inappropriately truncated assessment of the

16

mitigation case and a wrongly focused assessment of the

17

mitigation case, which ought to Focus on the troubled

18

history and the fetal alcohol syndrome, which provide a

medical mental health explanation for his conduct which

MR. VERRILLI:

That's not correct, Your

Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The biological

2

mother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.

3

MR. VERRILLI:

The fact that she used

4

abusive -- that she abused alcohol, but not the medical

5

expert testimony explaining what effects that would

6

have.

7

that was the big problem.

That's precisely the thing that wasn't there and

8
9
10

So I do think that that -- that's why we
need an evidentiary hearing, to develop that.

This

weighing, by the way -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think the

12

State trial court had no familiarity with fetal alcohol

13

syndrome?

14

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, if you look at page

15

D-21, Mr. Chief Justice, what you'll see is actually

16

proof in the transcript that she had no familiarity,

17

because she said on page D-21 all it does is predispose

18

you to being an addict yourself.

19

syndrome is a much, much broader set of impairments that

20

can bear directly on one's, one's moral culpability.

21

If I could just say -

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But fetal alcohol

I have just one other

23

question on a different matter.

In Judge Bias's

24

dissent, Judge Bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from

25

the Petitioner, the Petitioner does not want to proceed

1

with this appeal and wants the execution scheduled.

2

you comment on that?

3

MR. VERRILLI:

Sure.

Can

What there was that

4

the Ninth Circuit, upon receiving this letter, contacted

5

counsel for Mr. Landrigan, asked him -- asked them to go

6

visit him in prison and find out what's going on.

7

did so.

8

Mr. Landrigan did in fact want to proceed with the

9

appeals.

They

They reported back to the Ninth Circuit that

He has continued to want to proceed with the

10

appeals, signing the IFP papers, et cetera, and it turns

11

out there were neurological problems that were

12

afflicting him, very serious, at the time.

13

what happened.

So that's

14

If I could say in conclusion, just remind

15

the Court what it said in the first Norrell decision,

16

that even in the world of habeas there's a difference

17

between deference and abdication.

18

like this one, in which the State court has not afforded

19

an evidentiary hearing and has not allowed the

20

development of the evidence that bears directly on

21

Mr. Landrigan's claims, it would be a form of abdication

22

to hold that he can be conclusively barred from

23

proceeding further, even to an evidentiary hearing, on

24

the basis of the present record.

25

And in a situation

Thank you.
