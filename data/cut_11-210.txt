ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and


may it please the Court:
Military honors play a vital role in

12

inculcating and sustaining the core values of our

13

nation's armed forces.

14

criteria in awarding honors, and Congress has a long

15

tradition of legislating to protect the integrity of the

16

honors system.

17

The military applies exacting

The Stolen Valor Act continues that

18

tradition by prohibiting knowingly false statements that

19

one has been awarded a military honor.

20

carefully limited and narrowly drawn category of

21

calculated factual falsehoods.

22

substantial, and, indeed, compelling governmental

23

interest, and it chills no protected speech.

It regulates a

It advances a legitimate

24

This Court has recognized -

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, may I pose a

hypothetical?

2

up a sign that says I won a Purple Heart -- for killing

3

babies.

4

During the Vietnam War, a protester holds

Knowing statement.

He didn't win the Purple

5

Heart.

As a reader, I can't be sure whether he did and

6

is a combat veteran who opposes the war or whether he's

7

a citizen protesting the war.

8
9

Is that person -- if he's not a veteran
having received a medal, is he liable under this Act?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

I think, Your Honor, it

11

would depend on whether that was -- that expression was

12

reasonably understood by the audience as a statement of

13

fact or as an exercise in political theater.

14

the latter, it's not within the scope of the statute -

15
16
17

19

If it's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Somewhat dangerous,

GENERAL VERRILLI:

-- and it wouldn't be

isn't it -

subject to liability.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- to subject speech to

20

the absolute rule of no protection?

21

you're advocating, I understand.

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Which is what

Well, Your Honor -
That there are no

24

circumstances in which this speech has value.

25

believe that's your bottom line.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I

Official

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, what -- what I

2

would say with respect to that, Your Honor, is that this

3

Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts,

4

that the calculated factual falsehood has no First

5

Amendment value for its own sake.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's not -
Well, I'm -- I'm not sure

8

that that's quite correct.

It has said it often but

9

always in context where it is well understood that

10

speech can injure.

11

brief, you make this point, and it's what Justice

12

Sotomayor is indicating.

13

falsity.

14

Defamation, Gertz -- page 12 of your

You think there's no value to

But I -- I simply can't find that in our

15

cases, and I -- I think it's a sweeping proposition to

16

say that there's no value to falsity.

17

in which we contrast what is false and what is true.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Falsity is a way

I want to be -
And -
I want to respond with

21

precision, Justice Kennedy, that the -- I think what

22

this Court -- and Gertz is a good example -- has done is

23

to draw a line, and that line -- and I think it is Gertz

24

itself that contains this Court's statement that false

25

statements of fact have no First Amendment value.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official

1

doesn't automatically mean that a false statement of

2

fact lacks First Amendment protection.

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that's in the context

of a defamation case.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
And you want to take the

7

Gertz case, where it's well understood that defamation

8

is actionable, and say that as a general matter, that

9

the government can inveigh against what's false.

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The -- no, I'm trying to

11

say something much narrower than that, Justice Kennedy,

12

that, with respect to factually false statements, the

13

government has the authority, if it can meet the

14

"breathing space" principles that this Court's cases

15

have articulated, along with the recognition that

16

factually false statements have no intrinsic First

17

Amendment value.

18

they are substantial constraints that are satisfied in

19

this case because the Stolen Valor Act regulates a very

20

narrowly drawn and specific category of calculated

21

factual falsehood, a verifiably false claim that an

22

individual has won a military honor, and that's

23

information that is within you, and only punishes speech

24

about yourself.

25

the knowledge of the individual speaker.

Those are substantial constraints, but

So, it is speech that's uniquely within

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose -- suppose,

2

General Verrilli, that the decorations were left out and

3

Congress had said we don't like people saying that they

4

were in the Marine Corps for 25 years when they never

5

served for a single day in any armed force.

6

have a statute just like this one, but it is directed to

7

the false claim that one has served in the armed forces.

8
9

So, they

I don't see in your argument that there's
something special about the decorations.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10

Well, I do think the

11

decorations matter, Justice Ginsburg.

12

that that kind of a statute would be a harder case and,

13

under the Court's "breathing space" principles, closer

14

to the line because the category is much broader, much

15

harder to define, and it would depend on the interest.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We -- we think

Why is it much harder to

17

define?

I don't -- why does the broadness have anything

18

to do with the breathing space?

19

argument here is that there is harm; it's not just

20

falsehood, but it's falsehood conjoined with harm, just

21

as libel is.

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

23

our argument, Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, I suppose your

That's -- that's exactly

Okay.

So -- and in the

example that Justice Ginsburg just gave -- in your case

there's harm to those courageous men and women who

2

receive the decorations.

honorably served in the armed forces.

In the -- in the example that

need to articulate a substantial interest.

But that's -- that's for

That's -- when -- that's fraud.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I do -- if I could get

20

back to Your Honor's point about the nature of the harm,

21

it is true that in Gertz you had the particularized

22

harm, but this Court -- the common characteristic that

23

allowed this Court to move from defamation to

24

false-light privacy, to intentional infliction of

25

emotional distress in the Falwell case, then to baseless
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

lawsuits, the sham exception in Noerr-Pennington, the

2

sham exception under the National Labor Relations Act,

3

the common characteristic was not an analogy to the

4

particularized harm that existed in defamation contexts.

5

The common characteristic that this Court's opinions

6

identify is the calculated factual falsehood.

7
8
9

It is true that the harm here is different.
It's a -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They were -- they were in

10

a context, though, of recognized torts, intentional

11

infliction for emotional distress.

12

me that you can argue that this is something like a -- a

13

trademark, a medal in which this -- the government and

14

the armed forces have a particular interest, and we

15

could carve out a narrow exception for that.

16

we'd have to do that.

Here it does seem to

I think

17

But just to say that the cases you mentioned

18

say that there's no value to false speech, I just simply

19

cannot agree that they stand for that broad proposition.

20

They do in the particular context of a recognized tort

21

like intentional infliction of emotional distress.

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That -- that is true.

23

And this -- this is a case in which the -- one of the

24

harms that justifies this statute is the

25

misappropriation of the government-conferred honor and
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

esteem, and that is a real harm and a significant harm.

2

And there is also the particularized harm of the erosion

3

of the -- of the value of the military honors confirmed

4

-- conferred by our government; and those are

5

particularized harms that are real.

6

speech that this statute regulates are a genuine threat

7

to those harms in a way that, looking backwards, looking

8

and anchoring this argument in the tradition of this

9

Court's precedents, this is a type of calculated factual

10

falsehood that

11

has -

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And the kind of

Harms -- General, I

13

spent a lot of time going through the multiple cases

14

that you cited in your brief defining the various

15

statutes that basically impose penalties for

16

impersonation of some sort or another.

17

every one of them, except perhaps one, there was either

18

an economic interest that was harmed by the

19

impersonation, either by the face of the -- by the very

20

face of the statute or by the nature of the claim, a

21

dilution of a trademark by taking on someone else's

22

valuable property rights.

23

And virtually in

And so, I went back reading our cases, and

24

Justice Story many, many years ago said, look,

25

falsehoods have no value as such, but the "breathing
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

space" concept is defined by those falsehoods which

2

cause injury to rights that people possess, to pecuniary

3

-- to pecuniary interests that they have, or to the

4

reputation of others.

5

we've approved a harm concept as being permissible for

6

7

And almost every statute where

So, please tell me what's wrong with

8

Justice Story's view, number one; and, number two, how

9

does the definition of harm fit in that?

10

What's the

harm here that fits within that descriptor?

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I think three

12

points.

13

response to Your Honor's question.

14

reality here is that, as I read this Court's cases, this

15

Court has never held or even suggested in any context

16

when the government wants to regulate a properly defined

17

category of calculated factual falsehood, that it has to

18

meet strict scrutiny.

19

-- and a real change in the law that would subject -

20
21
22
23
24
25

First, if I could just make a general point in
I think that one

That would be a real break and a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I didn't mention -

neither did Justice Story.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

And -- but -- and

again -- but -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

He said if you want to

regulate a falsehood, it has to cause a harm in this
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way.

2

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And that's why I want to

3

get to -- that's why -- but I think it's relevant, Your

4

Honor, to the point about Justice Story in the following

5

way:

6

U.S.C. 1001, 18 U.S.C. 962, the impersonating a Federal

7

officer statute; 1001 being the false statement statute;

8

perjury statutes.

9

integrity of the government processes.

The -- the -- there are a series of statutes, 18

Those are designed to protect the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

There isn't -

Not really.

They're

11

intended to protect the right of the government to

12

secure truthful information.

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Rights -
The government has a

15

right to subpoena you at trial, subject you to oath, and

16

force you to tell the truth.

17

GENERAL VERRILLI:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20

right.

Statute -
So, if you -- that's a

That fits within Story's definition.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

But not a -- as -- as I

21

read what Justice Story is talking about, he was talking

22

about the rights of private citizens, and what I'm

23

saying is there is an additional category of

24

long-recognized, well-accepted government regulation of

25

-- of factual -- calculated factual falsehood that
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

serves systemic interests.

2

to the Stolen Valor Act, the -- Congress -- Congress is

3

building the Stolen Valor Act on a statute that Congress

4

enacted in 1923 which prohibited the -- the wearing of

5

medals without justification to wear the medals.

6

And, of course, with respect

And, of course, one of the reasons Congress

7

acted in 1923 to do that was out of concern that the

8

misappropriation of the government conferral of esteem

9

was going to cause substantial harm.

10

That's been on the

books for the better part -

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is your -

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General -

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15
16

-- of a century -

Is your argument limited to

statements that a person makes about himself or herself?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

It is.

That's the

17

category that the statute regulates.

18

seems to me in a situation in which the statute is

19

limited to factually verifiable information, the person

20

is speaking about himself or herself, and the category

21

of what's prescribed is clear -

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

That is -- and it

What's the principal reason

23

for drawing the line there?

Suppose the statute also

24

made it a crime to represent falsely that someone else

25

was the recipient of a military medal, so that if
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

someone said falsely and knowingly that a spouse or a

2

parent or a child was a medal recipient, that would also

3

be covered.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

I think -

That would be protected by

the First Amendment?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think that would be a

8

-- that would be a case in which under the "breathing

9

space" principles that this Court applies when we're

10

talking about calculated factual falsehood, you'd have

11

to answer a question, which is, how much risk is there

12

of chilling constitutionally protected speech, because

13

when you're talking about somebody else -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't see any difference

15

as far as that risk goes.

16

colloquy with Justice Kennedy, you -- you were not

17

retreating from what our cases have repeatedly said,

18

that there is no First Amendment value in falsehood.

19
20
21

I hope that in your earlier

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And that only -- and

that -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, this doesn't mean that

22

every falsehood can be punished, because in -- in

23

punishing some falsehoods you -- you risk deterring -

24

deterring truth.

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And that's -- that was

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what I was trying to say in response to Justice Alito's

2

question.

3

You have -
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I believe that there's no

4

First Amendment value in -- in falsehood.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

You have to answer the

6

question in that case of whether there was a material

7

risk of deterring expression that's truthful because

8

what -- who knows whether your grandfather was telling

9

the truth when he -- when he said he won the medal.

10

so, you -- it may be a more difficult case.

11

the Court's "breathing space" principles, that's the

12

question that one would have to answer.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

But under

General, is that -
Well, the assumption -

15

the assumption is that it's false.

That was -- and that

16

it's not so hard to find out if somebody claims to have

17

the Medal of Honor and he doesn't.

18

you answered yes, that it's only self, and now you said,

19

no, it's -- it can be -- or at least I think you said -

20

making a false statement of fact.

21

and I gave you the question of just in service, leaving

22

out the -- the decorations -- other statements of fact,

23

false statements like "I deny that the Holocaust ever

24

occurred."

25

fact, isn't it?

So that -- first,

And the concern is -

That's a statement -- a false statement of

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It could be.

I think a

2

statute seeking to regulate that, Justice Ginsburg,

3

would have viewpoint discrimination problems of the kind

4

that the Court identified in R.A.V., and I think also

5

under the Court's "breathing space" analysis you

6

would -- you'd have to look long and hard and have

7

significant concerns about that kind of a -- a statement

8

because it's so bound up with matters of ideological

9

controversy that -- that you'd want to exercise care,

10

but that's really quite different from what we have

11

here.

12

This is a pinpoint accuracy, a specific

13

verifiable factual claim about yourself, that you've won

14

a medal.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I -- I want to

16

follow up on Justice Scalia's question because I'm not

17

sure I understood.

18

there is no First Amendment value in a false

19

representation of fact, by which I understand you to

20

mean not parody or something like that, but a statement

21

that's intended to be understood as true.

22

First Amendment value in that statement.

23

protected because of the "breathing space" argument, but

24

in whatever context, in whatever guise, there's no

protection in that false representation as such.

The Government's position is that

It may be

1

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, that is the

2

position we've taken in this case, Your Honor, and the

3

reason we've taken it is because we read the Court's

4

precedents, Gertz and many others, Falwell v.

5

as saying precisely that.

6

further and says false statements of fact are

7

affirmatively harmful to First Amendment interests

on the precise language of cases stretching back a half

13

ideas or the search for truth, and then it

Garrison said calculated falsehood is a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

General, what -- what about

16

these State statutes -- there are more of them than I

17

thought that there would be -- that say no demonstrable

18

falsehoods by a political candidate in a political race,

19

and prohibit demonstrable falsehoods by political

20

candidates?

21

Would they come out the other end as constitutional?

22

How would your analysis apply to those?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think that those kinds

23

of statutes are going to have a lot harder time getting

24

through the Court's "breathing space" analysis because

25

the context in which they arise is one that would create
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a more significant risk of chill.


2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose it says


3

demonstrable falsehoods about yourself -- 

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think -- I think -

-- just about your

6

qualifications, about what you've done in your life,

7

your -- you know, whether you have a Medal of Honor,

8

whether you've been in military service, whether you've

9

been to college.

10

So, any demonstrable statement that a

candidate, political candidate, makes about himself.

11

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

I think under the

12

Court's "breathing space" analysis, because of the

13

political candidate context, those statutes are going to

14

pose a particular risk of chill that this statute does

the chilling effect seems to me, at least, to be

materially different than in a situation like this one,

military honor or not?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, but I have a

23

problem, which is it's not as narrow as it could get.

24

Wouldn't take much to do exactly what Congress said it

25

was doing, which was to protect against fraudulent
22

Alderson Reporting Company

1

claims of receiving a medal, and the example it used was

2

someone who used a fraudulent claim of receiving a medal

3

to get money.

4

What I'm trying to get to is what harm are

5

we protecting here?

I thought that the core of the

6

First Amendment was to protect even against offensive

7

speech.

8

emotional reaction to offensive speech is not enough.

9

If that is the core of our First Amendment, what I hear,

We have a legion of cases that said your

10

and that's what I think the court below said, is you

11

can't really believe that a war veteran thinks less of

12

the medal that he or she received because someone's

13

claiming fraudulently that they got one.

14

think less of the medal.

15

that we're offended by the thought that someone's

16

claiming an honor they didn't receive.

17

They don't

We're reacting to the fact

So, outside of the emotional reaction,

18

where's the harm?

19

take offense when people make these kinds of claims, but

I take offense when someone I'm dating makes a claim

that's not true.

to avoid the discovery of someone who should be hidden,

MR. LIBBY:

Well, that's right, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, but in all of those examples, those are

12

examples where we have harm attached to the falsehood.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, sometimes the harm is

just the impairment of governmental purposes, such as

section 1001, which criminalizes the making of a false

what is being urged here is that the making of this type

21

honor valorous members of the armed forces.

Because the making of the false

MR. LIBBY:

Well, we believe there's -

MR. LIBBY:

What

12

we're suggesting is false statements -- false statements

laws do have a history in this country.

14

harm or potential risk of imminent harm to government

18

Since the beginning of our nation, Congress has passed

19

these various false statement laws.

20

And perjury certainly falls into that
1001 very well may fit into that category.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And do we give some

21

deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to

22

governmental purposes, or do we make it up ourselves?

23

When Congress passed this legislation, I assume it did

24

so because it thought that the value of the awards that

17

a medal that has not been earned?

18

MR. LIBBY:

Let me ask you this:

What

Wearing medals is a slightly

different category because there you're dealing with

conduct rather than content.

21

Well, I'm not so sure.

expressive speech, it seems to me.

prevail here that the wearing prohibition must also be

in serious doubt.

Alderson Reporting Company

I think if you

Official

1

MR. LIBBY:

It may be or it may be in doubt

2

under certain situations where one is wearing a medal.

3

But certainly Congress has an interest in protecting

4

non-expressive purposes of wearing the medals.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I think it is, if the

whole purpose of the person who puts the medal on his

3

Where

4

you go out in the street with the -- with the medal on

5

you for everybody to see.

6

MR. LIBBY:

If -- if there's -- if Congress

7

does not have a non-speech purpose for prohibiting the

8

wearing of the medals, then if it's strictly an

9

expressive purpose, then, yes, there would be a

10

significant First Amendment problem.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

that's the case?

13

I can think of.

14

Well, don't you think

There's no non-expressive purpose that

MR. LIBBY:

Well -- and that very well may

15

be.

16

with is strictly a content-based regulation on speech.

17

What I can say is in this case what we're dealing

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you -- you acknowledge

18

that the First Amendment allows the prohibition or the

19

regulation of false speech if it causes at least certain

20

kinds of harms.

21

argument is determining which harms you think count and

22

which harms don't count.

23

And the problem I have with your

Would you go as far as was suggested earlier

24

to say that only pecuniary harm counts?

25

you say that, then the -- the classic case of
34

Official

intentional infliction of emotional distress is

2

unconstitutional, going up to someone and saying falsely

3

your -- your child has just been run over by a bus.

4

how do we determine which harms are sufficient?

5

MR. LIBBY:

So,

I believe -- what we believe the

6

right way of looking at this is you -- you determine

7

whether or not there is imminent harm or a significant

8

risk of imminent harm to an individual or to a

9

government function that would result from the speech.

10
11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

When you say "imminent," you

mean -- what do you mean by that?
MR. LIBBY:

I guess I'm suggesting the

13

Brandenburg standard, which is -- if -

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if that's the

15

standard, then most of the prosecutions for making false

16

statements to a Federal law enforcement officer are not

17

going to survive, are they?

18

MR. LIBBY:

Well, but the issue is what

19

about the law.

And the issue with 1001 and those false

20

statement statutes is it's the substantial risk of

21

imminent harm to the government that could result from

22

the falsehood.

23

So -- well, certainly, it may not result in

24

a particular case, but the substantial risk of imminent

25

harm is there.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mr. Libby, let's suppose

that I agree with Gertz that there is no constitutional

value in a false statement of fact, and the reason why

17

we protect some false statements of fact is to protect

truthful speech.

I don't understand

analyze it to determine if it chills protected speech.

11

MR. LIBBY:

I suppose I read the

12

Government's argument differently.

13

Government's argument, it's that it's entitled to, at

14

most, limited protection.

15

start from the presumption that it's not fully protected

16

speech; whereas, of course, what we should be starting

17

with is the presumption that it is fully protected

18

speech unless this Court has previously said it's in one

19

of these historical categories of unprotected speech.

So, the Government seems to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

As I read the

May I -- if I understood

21

your argument, you're saying historically we have not

22

protected false statements that cause harm.

that's your argument.

MR. LIBBY:

That's correct.

38

Alderson Reporting Company

I think

Yes, Your

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

so, it's -- we do protect false statements

3

presumptively, but the historical exception, like

4

defamation, are those that cause harm.

5

All right.

Assuming -

So, I go back to Justice Alito's question

6

because you really haven't answered his question.

7

You've dealt with the government process cases, although

8

I -- we could argue about whether that's protecting a

9

process or protecting a government right to truthful

10

information.

11

That's a different issue.
But the question is how do you deal with the

12

intentional infliction of emotional distress?

13

damage -- we require injury, and it's defined under law

14

what kind of injury.

15

the nongovernmental situation, number one, and then tell

16

me why that -- this situation doesn't fit that

17

definition.

18

Because

So, tell me how you define harm in

MR. LIBBY:

Well, in the situation with

19

intentional infliction of emotional distress, you are

20

dealing with an instantaneous harm, a mental distress

21

that results from the false statement.

22

there's imminent harm as a result of -- that results in

23

intentional infliction of emotional distress for

24

false-light -

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, why isn't the

outrage that medal winners, legitimately entitled medal

2

winners, experience in seeing fake people or hearing

3

fake people claim a medal -- why isn't that comparable?

4

MR. LIBBY:

Well, I don't believe that fits

5

into the same category of -- of mental distress that we

6

look at in intentional infliction of emotional distress.

7

Certainly, people are entitled to be upset

8

by these false claims.

9

these false claims.

I mean, I'm personally upset by

But the fact that there is a

10

certain level of upset doesn't mean that you were -

11

you're harmed in the sense of the intentional infliction

12

of emotional stress tort.

13

with here is simply a non-instantaneous harm.

14

And so, what we're dealing

Now, what the Government has suggested is

15

that there's no harm that really results from a single

16

claim, that Mr. Alvarez's falsehood did not cause harm

17

to any individual.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

It seems to me what you're

19

-- what you're arguing is that we should determine that

20

there are certain harms that are sufficient to allow the

21

prohibition of a false statement and there are certain

22

harms that are not sufficient, irrespective of what

23

judgment Congress made about the significance of those

24

harms.

25

Is that -- is that accurate?
MR. LIBBY:

That's certainly part of it.
40


Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

mean, we believe that there needs to be imminent harm,

2

that it needs to be targeted harm to an individual or

3

to -- to government function, that it can't be the type

4

of diffuse harm that the Government -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. LIBBY:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- says took place here.
Why not?

Because, after

8

all, we're willing to protect the Olympics Committee

9

when a false person saying he's the Olympics Committee

10

might deprive the Olympics Committee of a penny, while

11

here they're saying that to win this great medal, say,

12

the congressional Medal of Honor, the highest award in

13

the military the nation can give, you're deserving of

14

the most possible, grandest possible respect, and we

15

don't -- we don't even want you to have to think about

16

somebody having taken that name falsely; and so, we will

17

just criminalize it to discourage such activity that

18

undermines the very thought and purpose of giving the

19

medal.

All right?
So, I'm just saying in my mind there's real

harm.

22

instances where we do want to protect false information.

23

theory is that it does hurt the medal, the purpose, the

a lot of people out there who don't know what it is.

that your willingness to say that this statute is valid

it's an awfully big concession.

16

MR. LIBBY:

Well, it would -- if it -

again, if Congress were to amend the law to require that

Well, how does it work in

11

the law now, where we have similar statutes, and there's

12

an additional requirement when you're imitating, say, a

13

Federal officer or somebody else you shouldn't, you have

14

to perform an overt act that asserts authority that the

15

impersonator claims to have.

16

What does that add?

Do you have to -- does it add enough to just

17

make it not pure speech, to limit -- to wall off the

18

things about -- the things that we're worried about in

19

the First Amendment? Or there's another one, you have to

20

falsely assume or exercise powers, duties, and

21

privileges.

Those are ways statutes have of limiting

22

this thing.

How does that work?

23

MR. LIBBY:

Well, when you get into the

24

issue of impersonation, then you're -- the Court perhaps

25

should be assessing it under the amount of -- of

Alderson Reporting Company

start from the presumption that we have the right to say

limit it where -- again -- and, I guess, it goes again
