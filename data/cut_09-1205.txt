We'll hear argument

Mr. Monahan.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. MONAHAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. MONAHAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Petitioners Keith Smith and Shirley

12

Sperlazza were not named plaintiffs in the prior Federal

13

proceeding litigated by George McCollins.

14

received notice of that prior proceeding; they never

15

received an opportunity to appear and be heard; they

16

never received an opportunity to opt out; and they never

17

received an opportunity to appeal the decision denying

18

class certification.

19

They never

No precedent of this Court would justify

20

treating -- treating people as parties under preclusion

21

principles under these circumstances.

22

Taylor v. Sturgell, this Court addressed the rule

23

against nonparty preclusion and discussed the recognized

24

exceptions.

25

conducted class action as being one of the exceptions.

Recently, in

The Court in that case discussed a properly

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The Court, in discussing these preclusion

2

rules, noted that they are limited by due process

3

concerns, and the Court noted that the properly

4

conducted class action is an exception due to the due

5

process protections incorporated into Rule 23.

6

Obviously, this Court has discussed the due

7

process protections with class actions in prior cases,

8

particularly those dealing with 23(b)(3) classes in

9

cases such as Eisen and Shutts.

The Court has noted

10

that whenever a class is certified notice must be

11

provided; the right to -- notice must be provided; they

12

must have the right to appear and be heard in person or

13

by counsel; they must have the right to opt out as well

14

as protection of adequate representations.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose a class action

16

based on diversity is filed in one of the Federal

17

districts in West Virginia, and the district court

18

denies class certification.

19

MR. MONAHAN:

Yes, it could be the same

10

11

in South -- South Central Bell v. Alabama, and also as

12

discussed in the Richards case.

13

This Court noted that in Taylor v. Sturgell,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would the -- would the

14

decision that's saying -- saying Rule 23 standards have

15

not been met, the individual issues predominate over the

16

common issue -- doesn't that deserve some measure of

17

respect when the same thing is tried again?

18

MR. MONAHAN:

Yes, Your Honor, but that

19

would be under stare decisis principles, we believe, and

20

that's the situation, since it is a different party,

21

since it's not the same party itself.

22

the district courts in West Virginia would look to other

23

district courts' opinions and would likely render them

24

persuasive -- or consider them persuasive under those

25

circumstances.
Alderson Reporting Company

And, certainly,

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE ALITO:

But they have no obligation

to follow another district court opinion, do they?

3

MR. MONAHAN:

Technically, no, Your Honor.

4

If the Fourth Circuit, for instance, had spoken on the

5

matter, though, and it was something that was decided by

6

the Fourth Circuit, or of course by this Court, then

7

clearly they would.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And this one was

determined by the multidistrict panel, right?

10
11

And the -­

MR. MONAHAN:
Minnesota.

Yes.

Yes, a district judge in

Yes, Your Honor.

12

Interestingly, in Taylor, this Court noted

13

that adopting a broad theory of virtual representation

14

based upon an identity of interests, adequate

15

representation, and a close relationship would -- would,

16

in essence, be equivalent to adopting a de facto class

17

action or recognizing a common law class action without

18

any of the procedural due process protections provided

19

by Rule 23.

20

Obviously, in dealing with these cases, the

21

main reason a certification is -- the main reason the

22

due process protection is provided upon certification is

23

to go ahead and justify binding the class members to any

24

judgment issued by the court at that point.

25

have that, unless you have the certification and the due

2

have those, the absent class members remain strangers to

the proceeding.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the absent class

5

members retain their individual right.

7

only they can't be a class representative.

MR. MONAHAN:
Honor.

I mean, they are
It's

That's -- that's true, Your

We submit, however, that any procedural rights

10

which have been recognized and adopted -- those

11

procedural rights, just as the substantive claim itself,

12

have to be adjudicated consistent with due process.

13

West Virginia itself has adopted Rule 23 of the West

14

Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, and that State has

15

the right to apply and interpret that rule as it sees

16

fit to manage its own docket and administrate its own

17

docket as it sees fit.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

Am I right to read the

19

supplemental brief as saying that now the West Virginia

20

Supreme Court agrees with the multidistrict panel on

21

what the content of West Virginia law is?

22

MR. MONAHAN:

That's not correct, Your

23

Honor.

All of the issues raised in our petition for

24

cert remain just as they were.

I will not dispute that.

But we also have a

And the critical fact of this case in that

6

regard is the question of whether or not a class may be

8

9

court.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Monahan, do you

11

mean by that that you would have a blanket rule that a

12

decision on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 can never

13

be preclusive as to a State Rule of Civil Procedure 23?

14

MR. MONAHAN:

Your Honor, I believe it would

15

depend upon whether or not that State has said that not

16

only are we going to look at these Federal decisions as

17

being persuasive, but we're going to consider ourself

18

bound by the decisions of the Fourth District or the

19

United States District Court for the Southern District

20

of West Virginia.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, suppose the State

22

says:

We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have

23

our own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll

24

go along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't.

25

Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case

2

would have gone along, would have interpreted its own

3

rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal

4

court interpreted the Federal rule?

5

MR. MONAHAN:

Well, for instance, what Your

6

Honor suggested is essentially what the West Virginia

7

Supreme Court of Appeals does.

8

they will consider them to be persuasive.

9

consider them -- but in their In re Rezulin case, the

I mean, they will -­
They will

10

court noted -- the court actually criticized the circuit

11

judge for relying exclusively on Federal decisions

12

denying class certification in medical device or

13

prescription drug cases.

14

know, although we will look at those rules and they may

15

be persuasive, they are not binding or controlling on

16

us, and that's because we do not want our legal analysis

17

to be nothing more than a mere Pavlovian response to

18

Federal decisional rules.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the court noted that, you

20

difference between the Federal law and the West Virginia

application to this particular complaint, but as to the

23

24

between the Federal standard and the West Virginia

25

standard?

Not the

What do you see as the difference

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

MR. MONAHAN:

The main difference, Justice

2

Alito, is that our court has -- and they cite this in

3

In re Rezulin, for instance.

4

Actions as one of the authorities to support this

5

principle, but they note that in -- in our court that

6

normally challenges based upon reliance, causation, and

7

damages will not bar certification on a predominance

8

basis, because those go to the right of the individual

9

to recover, but not to the overall liability issues of

They cite Newberg on Class

10

the defendant, which it believes can be addressed as

11

common issues in many cases and save the court an

12

extreme amount of time addressing those common issues.

13

Now, the court indicates that if individual

14

trials need to be conducted later on, on any of those

15

issues, if there are truly individual issues that need

16

to be resolved concerning those claims, individual

17

trials can be accomplished.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

On the ground that the

19

court here, the Federal court, decided that there

20

weren't predominant issues based mostly on the fact

21

that, like the Virginia court has now, it's decided that

22

there is no economic loss, what were the differences?

23
24
25

What were the differences here?

How would

the difference in standard play out here?
MR. MONAHAN:

Well, for instance -- and this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

is an interesting aspect of this case -- that the

2

court's not only trying to bind us on the procedural

3

ruling but is also trying to bind us in a substantive

4

ruling as to what the elements of the claims in West

5

Virginia are and as to what's needed to prove those

6

claims.

7

For instance, the Eighth Circuit has -- has

8

held that, in looking at the district court's opinion,

9

that it has held that an actual physical injury is

10

required, that economic loss alone is not enough.

11

Clearly, that's not consistent with West Virginia law.

12

An economic loss alone can be sufficient.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In West -­

The -- I'm sorry.

I

14

don't mean to cut you off.

15

that due process requires the same treatment,

16

essentially, of notice and an opportunity to be heard

17

that we are giving to a substantive decision that blocks

18

a future member from pursuing his or her claim, correct?

19

MR. MONAHAN:

But you're really arguing

Yes, very similar, Your Honor.

20

I mean, in this circumstance -- I mean, these rights are

21

provided.

22

created, are being provided, and they can't be taken

23

away without due process.

24

the right to -- to proceed in our court under our rule,

25

and not -- you don't have a guarantee --

These procedural rights, once they are

West Virginia has recognized

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're almost treating

2

it as a property right, and -- and you're basically

3

saying we're equating it with, essentially, a property

4

right.

5

MR. MONAHAN:

Well, I think -- I think what

6

I'm trying to say, Your Honor, is that these type of

7

procedural rights -- whenever you have a substantive

8

claim which is a property right, and you seek to

9

litigate them, you shall have available to you all the

10

Rules of Civil Procedure which have been adopted and

11

recognized, and those procedural elements of the claim

12

should be treated or adjudicated just the same as a

13

substantive claim, consistent with due process.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we disagree with you,

15

because there is a difference of some sort between

16

procedure and substantive rights, then what would

17

command the due process violation in a situation in

18

which the Federal litigation has applied essentially the

19

same standard that the State has and there has been

20

adequate representation on the procedural question,

21

where no substantive right of a plaintiff has been

22

extinguished?

23

That's a lot of conditions, but those are

24

the three conditions of this case.

25

process requires that outcome, your outcome?
Alderson Reporting Company

So, what in due

MR. MONAHAN:

Well, I believe that the

basic -- because we are not the same party, we believe

the basic elements of just the notice and the right to

be heard, which our party has never had.

9

May I -­

If I return to my question of what

MR. MONAHAN:

Well, this particular

procedural right is very closely connected -- I mean,

10

one of the main purposes of a class action is to level

11

the economic playing field and to enable people with

12

small individual claims to aggregate them in order to

13

seek justice.

14

Without those -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Actually not true.

how much money the lawyers are going to receive,

MR. MONAHAN:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

The issue is

Well -­
-- because plaintiff

20

gets their attorney's fees, gets a statutory violation

21

amount, which is going to be the same whether it's in a

22

class action or an individual action, so it's really not

23

the plaintiff who stands to win.

24
25

MR. MONAHAN:

No, Your Honor, what -­

what -- the assumptions you just made I don't believe
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

are correct in this -- in this particular case, because,

2

one, obviously if we lose the CCPA claim in light of the

3

White case, there would be no statutory attorney fees.

4

And even if we had the CCPA claim, it's -- the court has

5

discretion.

6

that it do so, no requirement whatsoever.

7

It may award them.

There's no requirement

And how can anybody bring -- any lawyer

8

trying to bring one of these small damage claims -- if

9

the damages are only $100, $200 per plaintiff, for

10

instance, how could any lawyer justify facing a

11

defendant such as Bayer in a complex product liability

12

action?

13

discovery -- all those matters would greatly exceed the

14

value of the claim itself.

15

only way in which to aggregate the claims and level the

16

economic playing field for everybody.

17

Just the cost alone of having experts, of doing

So the class action is the

The other thing, I would note for the common

18

law fraud claim, West Virginia does have a bad-faith

19

exception for attorney fees, but that depends on the

20

degree of fraud that the court finds, and that -- that,

21

in and of itself, is discretionary.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

does your procedural right extend?

24

second action, the court says, look, we've been through

25

all this before; we have had a million pages of
Alderson Reporting Company

What if -- how far
Let's say in the

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

discovery from the prior action, no protective order at

2

all.

3

you're entitled to, you know, 10 interrogatories,

4

because we've been through this before, I'm going to say

5

you can look at all the discovery that's there, but you

6

only get 5 interrogatories.

So while, if you were the first person here,

7

Now, do you say no, no, no, I'm entitled to

8

the same procedural rights I'd have if I were here

9

first?

10

Is that right?
MR. MONAHAN:

Your Honor, I think the court

11

does have some flexibility, depending upon the

12

procedural rule at issue.

13

court is applying almost essentially the stare decisis

14

type of principles there.

So now it's not only

17

that you're entitled to your day in court substantively;

18

you're -- you're entitled to your day in court

19

procedurally as to some procedural aspects but not

20

others?

21

MR. MONAHAN:

Well, I certainly think the

22

Court needs to examine the procedural aspect and its

23

importance, and the part that it plays.

24

instance, one of the problems we have in this situation

25

is that normally res judicata and collateral estoppel do
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, for

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

not normally apply to mere procedural rulings.

2

not normally used for that purpose.

3

They're

Most cases where they are used for that

4

purpose are cases where a dismissal has occurred based

5

upon a procedural ruling or a procedural failing.

6

whenever they apply collateral estoppel and res

7

judicata, it's almost -- every case I've seen deals with

8

the exact same party in another proceeding.

9

they preclude them.

And

And there

But here is a totally different

10

party.

And the issue under West Virginia law has never

11

been litigated by any court.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

A totally different

13

party -- if a person, say an intervenor, joins a

14

litigation late, and there have been a lot of procedural

15

rulings, I guess that that intervenor takes the case as

16

he finds it.

17

Judge, I want you to reconsider your procedural ruling

18

in light of the fact I'm here.

19

Now, he could go to the judge and say:

How does the situation I've just sketched

20

differ from this one?

I mean, you have a client who's

21

coming to the litigation late.

22

litigation, I know, but he could send a representative

23

to the judge and say:

24

But I'm thinking of the -- of the Chief

it.

joins litigation late?

And is your client analogous to that person who

5

MR. MONAHAN:

No, Your Honor, because -- I

6

mean, for instance, this Court has noted -- and they

7

noted it, I believe in the -- you noted it in the

8

Richards case.

9

Martin v. Wilks has noted that a stranger to litigation

The Chase National Bank v. Norwalk and

10

has no duty to seek to intervene in the case; however,

11

they can; they can seek to intervene if they have

12

notice, if they so choose.

13

If you take that affirmative step to

14

intervene, knowing what has happened in that case, you

15

obviously have notice of the case because you're

16

choosing to intervene.

17

having that notice, then you take it as you find it.

18

And if you seek to intervene

Now, you can certainly ask the court to

19

reconsider because you want to raise new arguments, but

20

there would be no obligation to do so.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

forum.

You pick up a different plaintiff, and you go to

24

that you could go on and on and on until -- until maybe

you find a judge who will certify this class.

How -- and I guess your answer is

MR. MONAHAN:

Your Honor, I don't -- I don't

believe so.

3

there are limitations to that.

4

if you filed at another Federal court, for instance,

5

Rule 23 would be the same legal standard.

6

23 is the same legal standard in all Federal courts.

7

I don't believe that's the case because

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One would be, I think,

But we have a new

8

plaintiff, so that plaintiff wouldn't have had notice

9

and an opportunity to be -- to be heard.

10

MR. MONAHAN:

For preclusion purposes,

11

that's correct.

12

would look at those cases for stare decisis purposes in

13

looking as to whether or not the class should be

14

certified under the same legal standard.

15

But I think the Federal court certainly

Now, here we do have a different forum.

We

16

have the State of West Virginia, as a separate

sovereign, has its own rights to do this.

once -- if a class would be denied in West Virginia at

19

one time, I believe that the chances of having another

one succeed are very low, because courts will look to

those stare decisis principles.

And

if -- and if the plaintiff was asking for a nationwide

2

class action.

3

MR. MONAHAN:

Yes, Your Honor, and the issue

4

with that, though, is this Court has -- in Taylor v.

5

Sturgell, for instance, which Your Honor authored, the

6

Government argued in that case that, you know, we should

7

adopt this virtual representation theory because of

8

repetitive litigation.

9

person out there can file asking the government for

We had this FOIA request.

Any

10

these documents, and the government may have to go on

11

thousands of times, millions of times, conceivably, to

12

do this.

13

And this Court note -- noted that the threat

14

of repetitive litigation is not sufficient to justify

15

adopting a new exception to the rule against nonparty

16

preclusion.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

What kind of notice do you

18

think due process would require?

If the court in which

19

the case was first filed thought, I'm not going waste --

20

I don't want to waste my time on this class

21

certification issue if it's just going to be re­

22

litigated over and over and over again, so I want to

23

provide sufficient notice so that the members of a class

24

will be bound by my -- by my class certification issue,

25

what -- what would have to be done?
Alderson Reporting Company

Would they all have

Official - Subject to Final Review

20
1

to be given individual notice and asked to opt out?

2

MR. MONAHAN:

Your Honor, I -- I believe so.

3

I believe -- I mean, consistent with Shutts, this

4

Court's ruling in Shutts and Eisen, I think they would,

5

because once they had the notice and that they would

6

decide not to opt out, then they would be bound by any

7

ruling that the -- that the court issues there.

8

if -- if they don't have that opportunity, especially

9

whenever -- and this case also involves the

10

Anti-Injunction Act, of course, the principles of

11

federalism and comity, and any question under the

12

Anti-Injunction Act, any doubt, should go against

13

issuing injunctions.

14

But

And the -- the exceptions to that Act are

15

narrowly construed in light of principles of federalism,

16

and because we do have a separate State here and we're

17

trying to apply or seek State relief and seek the State

18

rules and follow the State rules, I do believe you would

19

need the same notice that we have in Shutts, the notice,

consistent with due process, certainly they could have

different manner, and that was to go ahead and change

But they

know, certain exceptions for certain discretionary ones,

Now, certainly, we would admit that since

14

CAFA has been enacted, the chance -- certainly, there's

15

not nearly as many of these cases which will occur where

16

this would -- where this will be an issue, because many

17

large classes now will get removed.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -­

When -- when Congress

19

enacted CAFA, did Congress think about this precise

20

issue, the issue that Justice Ginsburg is raising about

21

a lawyer going from State to State with a different

22

named plaintiff?

23

Congress was reacting to?

Was that -- was that part of what

In all other Federal cases, I

believe that that might survive a due process challenge,

because you're limiting it to the same legal standard in

because it would be applying, though, to absent class

JUSTICE BREYER:

Did it ever happen -- did

2

you ever come across an instance before where in a

Federal court a judge in the district court says, no,

4

you can't have a certification, no; and then a different

plaintiff went to a different Federal court in a

different part of the country and asked for a similar

certification?

in precedent, that it's in two Federal courts rather

that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP S. BECK

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19

MR. BECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

The core issue here is whether absent class

21

members can be bound by a denial of class certification

22

where there was adequate representation on that issue

23

but not notice and opportunity to be heard.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When you say "on that

issue," Mr. Beck, on what issue?

Because I think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

26
1

there is an argument in this case that the West Virginia

2

approach to class certification is different from the

3

Eighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have

4

been the way that the Eighth Circuit would have

5

approached the class certification question.

6

MR. BECK:

The issue that was decided and

7

preclusive was the issue of predominance, Your Honor,

8

and what happened there is that Judge Davis, the judge

9

who was supervising the multidistrict litigation, he

10

made a determination under West Virginia law as to

11

what's required to make out an economic loss claim, and

12

he concluded that what is required is individual proof

13

of injury as well as individual proof of causation.

14

then he went on to describe what kind of evidence would

15

be necessary to do that.

16

And

So he made a legal determination, and then

17

he went -- and then after looking at what kind of

18

evidence would be required -- excuse me -- made a -- I

19

think a mixed law and fact determination that, given

20

that, individual issues would predominate over common

21

issues.

22

was later vindicated by the West Virginia Supreme Court

23

in White, where they held that -- that there is a

24

requirement of individual proof of injury, which had

25

been contested by Petitioners, and it's clear that it's

His -- his interpretation of West Virginia law

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1
2

going to require the same exact kind of inquiry.
So what we have is that there's no

3

suggestion in Rezulin or anywhere else that the

4

predominance requirement under the West Virginia version

5

of Rule 23, which is essentially identical to the

6

Federal version, has any other content that's different

7

from the Federal version.

8
9

In Rezulin, there's a suggestion that when
-- that the West Virginia courts would treat differences

10

in -- in damages or reliance as less significant than

11

some Federal courts, but nothing at all that suggests in

12

any way that if the underlying cause of action requires

13

individual proof of injury and causation, that somehow

14

that common questions are going to predominate over

15

individual questions.

16

There's no suggestion of that.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When the Federal judge said, having to make
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

28
1

a determination of West Virginia law, no, it's not the

2

law; you have to show causation, some harm to you.

3

then when they -- when these plaintiffs went to the West

4

Virginia court, that was still an open question of West

5

Virginia law, and the West Virginia courts might have

6

decided it differently than the Federal court, right?

7

MR. BECK:

Yes.

But

Well, yes -- when the

8

Federal district judge made the determination, it was in

9

Mr. McCollins's case, and he's called upon to resolve

10

questions of State law just like courts are every day in

11

diversity actions.

12

State law, what's required by the West Virginia Consumer

13

Credit and Protection Act.

14

And he resolved the question of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But sometimes Federal

15

judges -- they try their best, but they're not the last

16

word on what the State law is.

17

MR. BECK:

And some -- and, Your Honor, if

18

-- if for example, Judge Davis had found as he did in

19

McCollins, and then he had issued the same injunction,

20

and then the White case had come down the other way,

21

that -- that says that there is no requirement of

22

injury, then conceivably the Petitioners could have gone

23

back to Judge Davis and asked for relief from his

injunction.

changes, or the law is declared differently by the West

They were the

Nothing would have precluded them from

coming back in front of Judge Davis and said:

11

Respectfully, sir, you -- you were wrong in your

prediction, and we'd like to be relieved from the

13

injunction.

14

And then we'd have a very interesting

15

question about whether being correct or incorrect is -­

16

is something that can eliminate the law of preclusion,

17

because normally if -- if a party is precluded, they're

18

not allowed to say I shouldn't be precluded because I

19

think the judge made a mistake on the law.

20

have that here because, in fact, Judge Davis was

21

vindicated on the content of West Virginia law.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But we don't

Mr. Beck, I'm -- I'm not

23

sure that White answers the question that I asked,

24

because White decided a matter of substantive liability,

25

and the question I asked was whether the approach to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30
1

class certification was different in the Eighth Circuit

2

and in West Virginia.

3

MR. BECK:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
If you look at Rezulin, if

5

you compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems

6

to be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about

7

the extent to which a finding is required that common

8

issues predominate.

9

MR. BECK:

I think that, actually, Judge

10

Davis took into account the difference in tone, and he

11

looked very carefully at Rezulin, and he said that what

12

Rezulin was focusing on was individual questions of

13

damages, which defendants often argue is enough so that

14

individual questions predominate, individual questions

15

of reliance, which we also often argue mean that

16

individual questions predominate.

17

But he said this is different, because this

18

is -- in order to prove liability, they've got to

19

establish individual injury, which means, on a

20

person-by-person basis, either that they were harmed by

21

the drug or that the drug didn't work to lower their

22

cholesterol as -- as it was supposed to, and they have

23

to show that whatever the violation of the Consumer

24

Fraud Act was is causally linked there.

25

And he said that's a different animal from
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

questions of reliance and damages.

2

heard or read no conceivable explanation about how,

3

under any standard of predominance, you could have

4

common questions predominating when every single member

5

of the class is going to have to examine the medical

6

records to see whether their cholesterol came down,

7

whether they suffered any side effects, and -- and if

8

their cholesterol didn't come down and they did suffer

9

side effects, how that could be linked to a violation of

10

And -- and I've

the Consumer Fraud Act.

11

So what Judge -- Judge Davis didn't depart

12

from Rezulin at all.

13

core questions of liability, and as I interpret the West

14

Virginia statute, in order to establish liability,

15

they're going to have to show that on an

16

individual-by-individual basis.

17

Judge Davis said:

This goes to

And the relevance of White is that he's

18

correct.

19

because of that, there's no cause of action under the

20

West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act.

21

Of course, White even goes further and says,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you answer that

22

they have claims that do not involve the consumer,

23

whatever it is; that they have fraud claims and some

24

other kind of claims?

25

MR. BECK:

Their warranty claim is no

Fraud, obviously, requires individual proof

6

of injury and causation.

9

can't make out a cause of action under the Consumer

The fraud is -- I mean, the

If you

Fraud Act, it certainly can't be made out under fraud.

11

And in terms of preclusion law, what the

12

Eighth Circuit observed was that when there's the -- the

13

same core set of facts that make out a cause of action,

14

adding another label to it doesn't change the preclusion

15

analysis.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Beck, if you're right

17

about issue preclusion, then if Bayer had gone into the

18

West Virginia court and said, West Virginia court, Judge

19

Davis has decided this case in Minnesota Federal

20

District Court -- issue preclusion -- that's one thing,

21

but what was used here was quite a heavy gun, and that

22

is the -- an empty suit injunction, which seems to say:

23

We're not going to trust the West Virginia court to

24

apply issue preclusion.

25

from proceeding altogether.

We're going to stop that court

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

And the anti-suit injunction is -- it's a

2

very strong weapon, and even though it's the -- the

3

clients who are being precluded, it's really saying to

4

another court:

5

this question; we're going to stop you.

6
7
8
9

We're not even going to let you get to

So maybe you could be right about preclusion
but wrong about use of the anti-suit injunction.
MR. BECK:

Well, Your Honor, the -- any time

that someone invokes the re-litigation exception to the

10

Anti-Injunction Act, by definition, an alternative would

11

be to go into the second court and -- and just simply

12

plead preclusion.

13

if that were sufficient, then there would be no

14

re-litigation exception to the Anti-Injunction Act.

15

That would always be available.

And

Here's a reason why it's very important in a

16

case like this:

17

not only file a class action in one county in West

18

Virginia, and then if we couldn't get an injunction but

19

we pled preclusion, and if -- and if we prevailed, they

20

could file one in another county.

21

county judges don't look to judges from other counties

22

as stare decisis.

23

Under their theory, they -- they could

And in West Virginia,

And so they could go, under their approach,

24

to another county, and that judge might agree with us.

25

And then they go to another county, and eventually
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

they're pretty confident that they'd find one judge in

2

one county in West Virginia who would reject our

3

preclusion analysis and allow the case to go forward.

4

And in West Virginia, we have no right to have an appeal

5

heard.

6

there's no appeal of right to the West Virginia Supreme

7

Court.

8
9

There is no intermediate appellate court, and

What would have happened if the

10

class had gone -- those who wanted to be in the class

11

had gone first to the West Virginia court, and the West

Virginia court had denied class certification?

13

that preclude a later Federal court from granting class

14

certification?

15

MR. BECK:

Would

If the -- if the West Virginia

16

court had denied class certification on an issue that is

17

present in Rule 23, then it would be preclusive under

18

Rule 23.

statute, where Federal courts have to give full faith

20

and credit to State judgments to the same extent that -­

21

that a State would.

It would be under the full faith and credit

22

If, however, Your Honor, the court said in

23

West Virginia, well, they meet all of the requirements

24

of our Rule 23, but under West Virginia law, we have

25

discretion to deny a class even if they meet all the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

requirements of Rule 23, then that would be an

2

interesting question, because under Federal procedure,

3

under this Court's opinions, if someone meets all the

4

requirements of Rule 23, then class certification is

5

appropriate.

I'm not sure that it would be

apply?

could see under the -- looking at the statutory language

of the re-litigation exception that talks about

could argue, in an appropriate case, that whatever the

law is as to preclusion generally, when it comes to the

the thing that was responsible for getting the case out

If -- if a State court had said

there wouldn't be preclusion.

I think -- I think, Justice

Sotomayor, that you have to distinguish between Rule 23

12

and the underlying State law that's the subject of the

13

lawsuit.

14

at whether a class action can be certified for a

15

violation of State law, it has to make a determination

16

of whether -- of what State law is in terms of how you

17

prove a violation, what the elements are.

18

what -- that's just -- you have to do that every single

19

day.

And any time a -- a Federal court is looking

And that's

20

And you make that kind of determination, and

21

then you move to the next step of whether that should be

22

preclusive, which is when Rule 23 comes into play.

I think that's the point where you say, are the State

have to do the analysis that's called for in Taylor v.

Moreover, in cases talking about adequate
