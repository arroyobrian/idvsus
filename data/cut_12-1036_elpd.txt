 Mr. Massey.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY 

8

11

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 The text and structure of the Class Action 

12

Fairness Act of 2005, which is known as CAFA, show that 

13

it does not extend to State parens patriae actions.  If 

14

there are any doubt on the matter, CAFA would have to be 

15

narrowly construed as a matter of the principles of 

16

federalism that are at issue here, as evidenced by the 

17

46 States supporting Mississippi before the Court. 

18

 The disposition of the case today, we 

19

believe, is straightforward.  There is only one 

20

plaintiff in this case, the State of Mississippi.  It is 

21

not a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, 

22

and therefore, the requirements of even minimal 

23

diversity, let alone the 100person numerosity 

24

requirement of CAFA, cannot be met. 

25

 Our friends on the other side want to use

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the statute of CAFA to change that result.  The mass 

2

action definition is the key part of the statute issued 

3

today.  It is in the Joint Appendix at pages 79 to 80. 

4

 Essentially, the attempt to force State 

5

actions into the mass action definition is a 

6

squarepegroundhole kind of problem.  The mass action 

7

definition addresses the situation of mass consolidation 

8

or mass joinder, when there are 100 individual 

9

plaintiffs or more in a case.  And CAFA provides that 

10
11

there's Federal jurisdiction over such a case. 
 But that does not apply to this situation. 

12

CAFA refers to real plaintiffs asserting concrete claims 

13

and further provides that those claims must be proposed 

14

to be tried jointly.  None of that happens in a parens 

15

patriae case, where the State is the only Plaintiff. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Massey, with respect 

17

to that, there is a claim for restitution.  I take it, 

18

if the suit is successful, the money that's collected 

19

will be distributed to all the people who are affected 

20

by this conduct. 

21

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's 

22

very unlikely in this case.  The Plaintiffs  the 

23

Plaintiff in this case is the State of Mississippi.  The 

24

consumers of Mississippi have already sued in an 

25

indirect purchaser action that has been settled.  So

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

they have received compensation. 
 The State does have a restitution claim 

3

here.  Your Honor is correct.  And at page 65(a) of 

4

the  of the response to opposition of the Orange 

5

Briefs, 65(a) describes the restitution claim. 

6

 The restitution claim seeks recovery to the 

7

State of the money, not to consumers in Mississippi. 

8

And what's likely to happen here  and, frankly, what 

9

happens very frequently when the Federal Trade 

10

Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission or 

11

any other State or agency seeks restitution, the money 

12

is recovered by the State. 

13

 And in a case like this, where it is very 

14

difficult to trace the individuals, the consumers who've 

15

been hurt  after all, we're talking an LCD 

16

pricefixing conspiracy.  So every television, computer 

17

monitor, phone, toy, digital camera, car navigation 

18

system, there are no records, obviously, of who 

19

purchased them, and it would cost so much money to 

20

identify them 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

22

$10,000 for each one? 

23

 MR. MASSEY: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

And you're asking for 

Pardon me, Your Honor? 
You're asking for $10,000 

for each one?

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, the  the complaint does 

2

pray that.  As the case goes forward, the Attorney 

3

General  and subject to all the procedures that occur 

4

in Mississippi, will have to make a judgment about how 

5

that money is to be distributed. 

6

 In the past, what I can tell you 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let's assume a case 

8

where  forget about that the consumer action was 

9

settled.  And let's forget about a case in which the 

10

damages are difficult to prove. 

11

 MR. MASSEY: 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
Let's think of a case in 

13

which the damages can be determined, and the State comes 

14

in on behalf of a class of consumers and says, we're 

15

seeking their restitution.  Does your argument change if 

16

the facts are different? 

17

 MR. MASSEY: 

Our argument does not change. 

18

I would say, in our case, the State  just to be clear 

19

about restitution  the State is proceeding under 

20

statutes that gives the  the State the only cause of 

21

action.  Only the State can sue under these provisions. 

22

If the State  the  the consumers have separate 

23

damages statutes.  The consumers would sue under 

24

separate statutes in a different court. 

25

 So the  the  in a different court,

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

meaning in Mississippi, that would have to be in a 

2

circuit court, court of law, as opposed to a court of 

3

equity.  But if a State were to seek restitution and to 

4

distribute it to consumers, just to be clear, our 

5

argument would not change because restitution is still a 

6

public remedy. 

7
8
9

 And for years  for decades, Federal 
agencies and States have 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So is this a real 

10

partyininterest argument, or is it a statutory 

11

argument that 

12

 MR. MASSEY: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It is 
 the statute requires 

14

named plaintiffs as opposed to  named or unnamed 

15

plaintiffs, but plaintiffs. 

16

 MR. MASSEY: 

Yes, named plaintiffs.  The 

17

the simplest resolution of the case is simply a 

18

statutory argument, that, on its face, the mass action 

19

definition refers to plaintiffs.  The only plaintiff is 

20

the State.  Even if the State has statutory authority to 

21

seek restitution, it is still the only plaintiff. 

22

 So you would not even need to get into the 

23

real partyininterest test because the statute doesn't 

24

refer to unnamed parties or to people who might be real 

25

parties in interest.  It refers simply to the

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

plaintiffs. 

2

 So it's simple 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

4

reference to persons? 

5

 MR. MASSEY: 

What do you do with 

Yes, Your Honor.  There is a 

6

reference to persons in the mass action definition.  It 

7

occurs  we believe, very strongly, that it 

8

equates  that  that section continues and equates 

9

persons with plaintiffs, and that the statute, in fact, 

10

wouldn't  would be absurd if it didn't because it 

11

refers to the monetary claims of 100 or more persons, as 

12

Your Honor has noted. 

13

 But then it says, "that are proposed to be 

14

tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims 

15

involve common questions of law or fact."  Those two 

16

sets have to mean the same thing; otherwise, it doesn't 

17

make any sense. 

18

 And furthermore, there are severe practical 

19

problems that support our sort of 

20

squarepegandroundhole problem. 

21

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

22

 MR. MASSEY: 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I  I realize that. 
Yes. 
But I'm not sure why that 

24

why it wouldn't make sense to read two different terms 

25

in the same sentence to mean two different things.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. MASSEY: 

2

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well 
The persons could be here, 

3

the citizens of Mississippi, who were damaged by the 

4

activity in question.  The plaintiff  plaintiffs, 

5

here, there's one named plaintiff.  The plaintiffs can 

6

refer to  to the person or entity or multiple people 

7

or entities who were named as plaintiffs. 

8
9
10

 So why  I don't see what the inconsistency 
is. 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, because  we think that 

11

our reading is better because, if you're applying the 

12

common question test, not to the persons who were in the 

13

case, those abstract unnamed, unknown consumers, you're 

14

not inquiring as to what their claims might be, you're 

15

applying the common question test only to the plaintiff, 

16

how could that  how could that produce an 

17

administrable result?  You could have consumers  you 

18

never  you would never know whether they presented 

19

common questions. 

20

 And that  that can't be what Congress was 

21

thinking of because, then, you would have a license for 

22

an unadministrable  this is clearly a reference to the 

23

kind of Rule 23 inquiry where, as this Court has 

24

emphasized in class action case after class action case, 

25

there has to be a rigorous analysis to ensure that there

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are actual common questions based on the  the actual 

2

claims asserted. 

3

 And  and we think that there's  that any 

4

other reading produces confusion, not just in this 

5

section, but also in the remand section  the $75,000 

6

remand section of the statute.  CAFA provides that, if a 

7

claim does not make  does not reach the amount in 

8

controversy requirement, it has to be remanded to State 

9

court. 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What if you have an 

11

executor, and he's administering an estate in which 100 

12

people have equal shares to the estate, and the estate 

13

has a claim.  And he brings it on behalf of the estate. 

14

Now, is that covered as a mass action or  or not? 

15

 MR. MASSEY: 

That, of course, is a different 

16

case when it is not involving the government.  But we 

17

think Navarro would, essentially, address that 

18

situation. 

19

 That's this Court's decision in 1980 that 

20

held that the trustees of a business trust were the sole 

21

real parties in interest and that the beneficiaries were 

22

not, even though they stood to get money as a result of 

23

the action, so I think that would address Your Honor's 

24

question. 

25

 The text of the statute still would refer to

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"plaintiff."  So you would inquire, in that instance, 

2

whether under State law  this is what happened in 

3

Navarro  the Court inquired, does the executor have 

4

the legal authority to represent the beneficiaries as 

5

the sole plaintiff? 

6

 And if he or she does, then you would have 

7

the single plaintiff situation, and you would not be 

8

under CAFA. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Massey, you envision 

10

one proceeding, it could be a class action on behalf of 

11

the individuals, that doesn't require everybody  that 

12

satisfy the amount in controversy, and then this action 

13

by the Attorney General, which does, among other things, 

14

seek restitution. 

15

 Isn't there an overlap between those two 

16

claims?  And how do we sort out  you said  at one 

17

point, I think you described the restitution as 

18

"disgorgement of illgotten gains." 

19

 MR. MASSEY: 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
But, now, we have the 

21

consumers who were affected, they've already been paid. 

22

So how does it work for the Attorney General's suit? 

23

What is the impact of the class action that has already 

24

gone forward and been completed on the Attorney 

25

General's claim?

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MASSEY: 

2

 The  when the MDL judge entered the 

Yes, Your Honor. 

3

settlement in the class, she indicated her view that it 

4

would not preclude a parens case.  Of course, it's open 

5

on remand for the defendants to argue that the consumer 

6

settlement bars the Attorney General's action.  That 

7

will have to be adjudicated on the merits in 

8

Mississippi. 

9

 States are free to adopt different rules 

10

about this.  There is no case that we have found in 

11

Mississippi squarely addressing this.  There have been a 

12

dozen or so parens cases over the last 10 years. 

13

 There is a case, though, from the State of 

14

Washington, which is illustrative.  It's actually on 

15

page 35 of the Red Brief  from our friend's brief, and 

16

it's a case from the Washington Supreme Court in 1976, 

17

called Ralph Winters Chrysler Plymouth. 

18

 In that case, the Washington Supreme Court 

19

encountered the situation where the State had sought 

20

restitution on behalf of consumers and sought to 

21

distribute the money to consumers, and consumers also 

22

brought separate damages actions. 

23

 And the Washington court said, there was no 

24

double recovery, no preclusion problem, because the 

25

restitution remedies were public in nature, and the

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

private damages actions proceeded under different 

2

statutory authority for different claims. 

3

 And whether Mississippi would adopt that 

4

approach, I don't know.  But that illustrates, I think, 

5

ultimately, that these are questions of State law, and 

6

there is a longstanding tradition of restitution being a 

7

public remedy. 

8
9

 After all, the government  we've cited 
some cases in the brief involving everything from rent 

10

control to energy price regulation.  The government 

11

brings  the Federal government, as well as State 

12

governments, has brought restitution actions where it 

13

has not returned money to consumers, has sometimes 

14

done  also sometimes has returned money, has  but in 

15

all those cases, consumers never participate.  They are 

16

never permitted to intervene. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it would 

18

make  it would make no sense for a defendant in a 

19

class action brought by consumers to ever settle the 

20

case.  It's going to have to pay twice.  It's going to 

21

have to pay consumers, and then it's going to have to 

22

pay you because you can, say, well, we want restitution, 

23

and we are not going to distribute it to the class 

24

members, but we're entitled to it. 

25

 And I assume the amount of the restitution

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is based on some estimate of the class  the consumers' 

2

claims. 

3

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, the evidence  the 

4

evidence of loss is relevant.  But the law is actually 

5

wellsettled in the lower courts  there's not a 

6

decision of this Court, but  that a consumer releasing 

7

his claim or her claim does not bar the State from 

8

proceeding with a public parens patriae action. 

9

 The defendants, when they settled, there is 

10

a little bit of disagreement in the brief, but the MDL 

11

judge took the defendants as conceding that their 

12

settlement with consumers would not bar a parens 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is there  is 

14

there  what is your understanding under Mississippi 

15

law, which you know a great deal more than I do, about 

16

any limits on a parens patriae action? 

17

 Let's say there was one purchaser in 

18

Mississippi of LCDs, whatever, or two or three.  Could 

19

you bring a parens patriae action on their behalf? 

20

 MR. MASSEY: 

21

case, Your Honor. 

22
23
24
25

That would be a very different 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I know, 

but I'm trying 
 MR. MASSEY: 

I think probably  I think 

very unlikely.  I don't  it depends on the  for

14

3

example, let me  let me just be clear 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Unlikely as a 

practical matter or as a legal matter? 

4

 MR. MASSEY: 

5

 There are  there are  there's no bright

6

line.  And after all, Snapp, which is the lodestar 

7

parens case from this Court in 1982, involved only 787 

8

workers.  They were agricultural workers from Puerto 

9

Rico.  And the Court  one of the objections was this 

10

was not a sufficient quasisovereign interest to support 

11

a parens patriae case. 

12

 And what this Court said was that you can't 

13

just look at numbers because those people represent a 

14

public interest.  They were  they alleged wage 

15

discrimination, and there was a deterrent effect.  So 

16

that it wasn't really just 787.  It was the entire 

17

population of Puerto Rico. 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Are there parens patriae 

19

actions where the State attorney general brings the 

20

action in what is really a suit on behalf of private 

21

parties?  And, if so, do you call it private parens 

22

patriae? 

23

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, we  don't think that 

24

would be  that is not a proper parens patriae case, 

25

and the attorney general 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

In other words, parens 

patriae has to have  you have to ask for restitution? 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, no, no.  The parens 

4

patriae case, for example, here involves injunctive 

5

relief, civil penalties, harm to the State as a 

6

purchaser, itself, of LCD panels.  And so restitution 

7

the remedy doesn't matter.  But the  the attorney 

8

general has statutory authority in this case to bring a 

9

case in the name of the State. 

10

 He is actually prohibited, under the State 

11

Consumer Protection Act  all parties are prohibited 

12

from bringing a damages case on behalf of a private 

13

consumer, except in that consumer's name, so 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Did the State 

15

interest that's being  the State interest that is 

16

being asserted is damage to the consumers? 

17

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, no.  I mean, the State 

18

interest is broader than that.  It is the  it is the 

19

harm to Mississippi as a  as a population, as an 

20

entity from this pricefixing conspiracy, just as the 

21

Federal government 

22
23
24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Because it harmed 

members of the population of Mississippi, right? 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, yes, but I think  I 

think, in Snapp, the Court discussed how the  when a

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

harm is broad enough, when it affects a substantial 

2

segment of the population and affects them in their 

3

economic capacity, there are indirect as well as  as 

4

well as direct effects that the State could be concerned 

5

with. 

6

 Now, let me just 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

8

 MR. MASSEY: 

9
10
11
12
13

What  what are those? 
Well, in other words, there 

are  if people are harmed by a pricefixing 
conspiracy, they have less money, they're not  they 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Damage to  having 

less money is a damage to the consumer. 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, but that has a ripple 

14

effect in the economy.  Pricefixing conspiracies have a 

15

public dimension. 

16

 And of course  of course, if this  any 

17

challenge to whether this is a proper parens patriae 

18

case or any case would be heard on the merits.  We  we 

19

know the defendants will argue back in the Mississippi 

20

courts that they have a series of defenses as to why 

21

this case should not be brought. 

22

 One of them will be the attorney general 

23

should not have brought it because it's outside his 

24

authority.  And that issue will be decided in 

25

Mississippi.  There is  there is a case  a vitamin

17

price fixing conspiracy case called the BASF case 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What prevents 

3

what prevents attorneys general from around the country 

4

sitting back and waiting until every  as private class 

5

actions proceed, and as soon as one settles or one 

6

the plaintiffs' class prevails, taking the same 

7

complaint, maybe even hiring the same lawyers, to go and 

8

say, well, now we are going to bring our parens patriae 

9

action, we know how the trial is going to work out, or 

10

we know what the settlement is going to look like, and 

11

we are going to get the same amount of money for the 

12

State? 

13

 MR. MASSEY:

matters, and I think the

22

serious matter when a plaintiff class recovers for, as

in this case, an antitrust violation or whatever and 

24

what's the answer?  I'm sorry.  I'm repeating my 

25

question.

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, I think the answer is 

2

 that the State has separate interests.  The interest in 

3

 the  that the State has qua State, yes, it should 

4

 bring cases where the public has been harmed.  Of 

5

 course 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So the answer is 

7

 that there is nothing to prevent 50 attorneys general 

8

 51, from saying, every time there is a successful class 

9

 action as to which somebody in my State purchased one of 

10

 the items, we are going to file a parens patriae action, 

11

 the complaint is going to look an awful lot like the 

12

 class action complaint, and we want our money? 

13

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, I think that  I think 

14

 that isn't going to happen because the State  well, 

15

 the complaints are not the same.  The State has its 

16

 own  sues in its own name, in its own rights, and, of 

17

 course, the problem Your Honor is hypothesizing 

18
19
20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, that means that it 

 could happen? 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, it could happen, right. 

21

 The State  if the State has its own rights and its own 

22

 interests, it should sue.  The attorney general is accountable to the 

23

general public 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry, counsel, 

25

 but you told me the State's own interest was in 

26

 protecting its consumers, so it would be able to file

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 this suit every time its consumers have been harmed, as 

2

 demonstrated either through settlement or suit.  That's 

3

 the State interest, protecting its consumers. 

4

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well  if  if a State 

5

 some States may adopt a different rule from Washington. 

6

 As the Washington court said, the State  the consumer 

7

 claims would preclude a State attorney general action. 

8

 If a State does not  if the State legislature 

9

 authorizes its attorney general to bring a suit when 

10

 this attorney general can identify harms to the State 

11

 that are separate from harms to consumers. 

12

 Your Honor is saying that  that the two 

13

 are identical.  They are not.  And Snapp makes clear 

14

 that they are not.  The State has a broader interest 

15

 than simply the compensation interest that an individual 

16

 has. 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, as a matter of 

18

 efficiency  take the Chief Justice's hypo, the 

19

 hypothetical and back it up.  The moment the class is 

20

 certified, why can't the attorney general join it and 

21

 say, now, our interest is a little different, but it's 

22

 so much the same that we want to join it, and we want to 

23

 join it as parens patriae.  Would that prevent its 

24

 removal? 

25

 MR. MASSEY: 

If  if the State attorney

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 general was combined with thousands of individual 

2

 claimants that, otherwise, would trigger CAFA, then 

3

 then CAFA  then you would be forced into this whole 

4

 case situation. 

5

 The whole case test, which you'd need not 

6

 reach here because the statute and the real 

7

 partyininterest tests are clear, but under the whole 

8

 case test, you weigh whether the State has an  the 

9

 essential nature proceed  the essential nature of the 

10

 proceeding is that the State is the real party in 

11

 interest. 

12

 In the hypothetical you posit, I think it 

13

 would be removable.  Obviously, it turns on the 

14

 particular facts, but, yes, if the State attorney 

15

 general is in court with 1,000 individual claimants, 

16

 that is probably a CAFA case. 

17

 That hasn't ever  has never happened, 

18

 and in all of the districts outside the Fifth Circuit 

19

 because the Fifth Circuit is the only court that has 

20

 adopted the rule that we  that you're reviewing today, 

21

 every other circuit court has held that CAFA does not 

22

 extend to State parens patriae actions. 

23

 In all of those cases, the attorneys general 

24

 are not running around following class actions to try to 

25

 piggyback on top of them.  They are not joining other

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 class actions.  Those  those 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But you can't 

3

 provide any reason why they wouldn't do so and, 

4

 presumably, would start doing so with greater frequency 

5

 if you prevail in this case. 

6

 MR. MASSEY: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well 
It doesn't have to 

8

 be the same case.  It can be the next case on the 

9

 court's docket.  The first case is In Re:  LCD 

10

 Litigation, and the second case is State of Mississippi 

11

 v. LCD Manufacturers. 

12

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, we don't think so.  And 

13

 it certainly the State  a State would be free to adopt 

14

 a  a different rule as to preclusion.  In other words, 

15

 a State legislature could say that a  if  if 

16

 consumers have recovered, the attorney general can't or 

17

 that the attorney general doesn't have statutory 

18

 authority in such cases. 

19

 But when the State legislature has told the 

20

 attorney general to enforce the public interest and 

21

 given him statutory authority to do so, he would be 

22

 derelict if he didn't honor the legislature's directive. 

23

 And that's what's happening here, that in a 

24

 series of cases involving vitamin pricefixing, 

25

 adulterated products, Google street view, where Google

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 found  you know, downloaded data from people's 

2

 wireless networks, the attorney generals have responded 

3

 in those cases.  Those are what these numbers are about. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And in every one of 

5

 those cases, there had been private class litigation 

6

 prior to the filing of parens patriae? 

7

 MR. MASSEY: 

No, I don't think there has 

8

 I don't think there had been in virtually any of them. 

9

 The attorney general is  is stepping into the breach 

10

 when the private lawyers have not brought class actions 

11

 because of the difficulties of bringing  in bringing 

12

 class actions. 

13
14
15
16
17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Except we know that's not 

 true in this case because we already have a settled 
 MR. MASSEY: 

There is a  there was a class 

 action settlement here.  That is true. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is your  is your view 

18

 of what's called the mass action  a mass action is you 

19

 have to have a sizeable number of plaintiffs, each one 

20

 with 75  at least $75,000 at stake.  Is that 

21

 MR. MASSEY: 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

23
24
25

Yes.  Yes, Your Honor. 
And so they would all be 

 named plaintiffs. 
 MR. MASSEY: 

That's correct.  That's 

 clearly  the sort of mass consolidation is what the

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 mass action definition is addressing. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Are there many actions of 

3

 that nature where there are hundreds of people, each 

4

 with a claim of 75,000 or more? 

5

 MR. MASSEY: 

There are.  I don't  I don't 

6

 know particular numbers.  There are such cases that 

7

 that are filed in Federal courts and when the  when 

8

 the plaintiffs are individually identifiable. 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why would you bring such 

10

 a claim in Federal courts in this mass action format? 

11

 I can see in Mississippi, it doesn't have class actions, 

12

 but if you're in Federal court, why would you ever have 

13

 a mass action, instead of a class action? 

14

 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, if you  if you could 

15

 identify the plaintiffs, you don't need to go through 

16

 Rule 23.  So if you know the 150 people who are  who 

17

 are at issue, you can avoid all the certification 

18

 rulings and simply proceed on a consolidated basis.  It 

19

 just cuts off sort of  part of the inquiry.  And 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Massey, if you are right 

21

 about what mass action means in this statute, what is 

22

 this exception about the general public doing? 

23

 MR. MASSEY: 

The general public.  The 

24

 it's doing two things.  First, the  as the amicus 

25

 brief of public citizen describes the legislative

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 genesis of it, it was really to address the California 

2

 unfair competition law situation, where there are 

3

 private attorneys general who are able to bring suits in 

4

 the name of the general interest  the general public. 

5

 And they  that was sort of the original genesis of it. 

6

 It is a separate reason to reverse. 

We 

7

 believe we meet it as well because it addresses a 

8

 situation where a State is  where any litigant, State 

9

 or private, is representing the general public as 

10
11

 opposed to individual claimants. 
 And here, because restitution is a public 

12

 remedy and because the individual claimants cannot be 

13

 identified, the State is proceeding on the basis of the 

14

 general public of Mississippi.  If anyone  the 

15

 district court found  it's in the Petition Appendix at 

16

 49a and 50. 

17

 The district court discusses the 

18

 traceability problems  I'm sorry, I said the Petition 

19

 Appendix  not the Joint Appendix. 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you tell me, when you 

 come back, where the money goes if you win? 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Yes.  The money probably goes 

23

 to the State treasury because, in this case, it would be 

24

 too difficult to trace who gets  who has been harmed. 

25

 The  that's why the district court found that the 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 given the ubiquity of the product and the fact that 

2

 there is no central record of whoever purchased a cell 

3

 phone in Mississippi, that the cost of  of finding all 

4

 these people is  is just not worth it. 

5

 There could be  it could wind up in the 

6

 education program.  The attorney general had mentioned 

7

 to me schools and things like that, but it's not going 

8

 to go  it's very unlikely to go to the individual 

9

 consumers. 

10

 Thank you, Your Honor. If I could reserve my time. 

11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

12
13
14
15
16
17

Thank you, 

 Mr. Massey. 
 Mr. Curran? 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. CURRAN 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court: 

18

 The attorney general's interpretation of the 

19

 mass action definition requires this Court to conclude 

20

 that a mass action can only be one of the actions with 

21

 100 or more named plaintiffs and can never be a 

22

 representative action.  That interpretation cannot be 

23

 squared with the statutory language, the purpose of the 

24

 Act, and the structure of the Act. 

25

 Justice Kagan, you referred to the general

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 public provision.  That provision expressly refers to 

2

 the possibility of a representative action.  In the 

3

 parenthetical language in that provision and  you 

4

 know, I look at it on the  in the Act form on 66a, but 

5

 it's, of course, in the codification as well, on page 

6

 79a of the Joint Appendix  the parenthetical there 

7

 says that  that this exclusion does not apply in cases 

8

 where the action is not on behalf of individual 

9

 claimants or members of a purported class. 

10

 So in other words, this exclusion under the 

11

 mass action definition is contemplating a situation 

12

 where there are individual claimants or members of a 

13

 purported class.  That  that has to be beyond the 

14

 named plaintiff. 

15

 In another example, farther down in the 

16

 exceptions to the mass action definition, there's a 

17

 reference to Section 1407, which is the MDL transfer 

18

 provision.  There, again, there's reference to the 

19

 possibility of a mass action being converted into a Rule 

20

 23 class action. 

21

 Those provisions don't make sense, unless 

22

 it's possible for a mass action to be a representative 

23

 action. 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So how do you remand a 

 case when it involves unnamed plaintiffs?  Not a

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 proposed class because you  if you have a proposed 

2

 class, that could be persons, and you could identify 

3

 those.  But under your theory, what does a court do to 

4

 figure out which of all of those unnamed people have 

5

 claims above or below $75,000? 

6

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well  well, a couple of 

7

 things.  Number one, it  it may well be that the mass 

8

 action definition, a use of persons, that, of course, 

9

 our position is that is unnamed.  Those are real parties 

10

 in interest of the claims.  The reference to plaintiffs 

11

 may well be, as the attorney general posits, the named 

12

 plaintiffs. 

13

 So the $75,000 requirement  and Justice 

14

 Ginsburg referred to this  this as well, that  that 

15

 can make perfect sense.  It's  it's a way to make sure 

16

 that the named plaintiffs, who, after all, are being 

17

 given the keys to Federal discovery and maybe the 

18

 ability to negotiate settlements, that they've got some 

19

 skin in the game, that the plaintiffs, the named 

20

 plaintiffs controlling the litigation, have 75,000 or 

21

 more at stake. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

You know, this language 

23

 is very reminiscent in what's in Federal Rule of Civil 

24

 Procedure 20, the joinder rule. 

25

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And if I look at the 

2

 joinder rule, it uses "persons" and "plaintiffs" 

3

 essentially in the same way.  It's talking about persons 

4

 being proposed plaintiffs, as opposed to unnamed 

5

 people 

6

 MR. CURRAN: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8
9

Well 
 or the proposed 

 class, in essence. 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Your Honor, I see similarities 

10

 between this provision and the PSLRA, the Private 

11

 Securities Litigation Reform Act, that reformed class 

12

 actions in the securities context.  And there, there 

13

 was  there were provisions requiring that the named 

14

 plaintiff be a prominent victim of the alleged fraud. 

15

 And  and here, I think it's got a similar 

16

 idea, that we want to make sure that the named 

17

 plaintiffs have that kind of stake.  And this is an 

18

 important point because I think there's been some 

19

 suggestion that this is unwieldy or does it make sense, 

20

 if all the claimants under 75,000 get remanded. 

21

 But recall this Court's jurisprudence on 

22

 supplemental jurisdiction.  Allapattah allows for 

23

 supplemental jurisdiction in a situation like this, 

24

 where certain plaintiffs do not satisfy the 

25

 jurisdictional minimum.  As long as there are some that

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 do, the district court has discretion to allow those 

2

 that don't to stay in the same action. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It seems that that would 

4

 be hard to invoke that case when a statute commands 

5

 differently. 

6

 MR. CURRAN: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, I mean, I don't see 
In that case, it's in 

8

 the  in the absence of statutory language that 

9

 requires remand. 

10

 MR. CURRAN: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well 
I  I'm hardpressed to 

12

 think that we can be exercising supplemental 

13

 jurisdiction in a case where Congress has expressly 

14

 spoken and said you can't or shouldn't. 

15

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, I don't understand that 

16

 because Section 1367 says supplemental jurisdiction 

17

 shall exist, unless it's expressly provided otherwise in 

18

 a Federal statute. 

19

 And this Court, interpreting similar 

20

 language in the Breuer case, which is cited in the 

21

 papers, said "expressly" means it's got to be direct, 

22

 it's got to be explicit, it has to be inescapable. 

23

 So I would submit that this language about 

24

 the 75,000, that does not preclude supplemental 

25

 jurisdiction.  In fact, I think that  that argument is

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 foreclosed by Breuer. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

In this particular case, 

3

 the individual claims were settled in the  in the 

4

 class action, so if there  if there are no individual 

5

 claimants to be  to be represented, why doesn't this 

6

 end up being a claim where only the State of Mississippi 

7

 has a stake because the individuals that the State might 

8

 have been representing have already been satisfied, so 

9

 if this is 

10

 MR. CURRAN: 

There are  there are a couple 

11

 of aspects to this.  First of all, our position, of 

12

 course, is that the Mississippi statute requires that 

13

 the money goes to the Mississippi citizens and that the 

14

 attorney general here is basically suing as a 

15

 representative or a conduit for those citizens. 

16

 The fact that those citizens, many of those 

17

 citizens, not all of them, the fact that many of them 

18

 have settled and have resolved the claims in the 

19

 multidistrict litigation, that means that there is going 

20

 to be a fight in one court or another  we think it 

21

 should be in a Federal court; the attorney general 

22

 thinks the State court  over what the preclusive 

23

 effects are of that prior settlement. 

24
25

 We view this case as nothing more than an 
 attempt to double dip.  It's the same 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why is that?  I thought 

2

 that in a  maybe it's changed since I knew the law in 

3

 this area.  But I thought, because of Illinois Brick, 

4

 the ultimate consumers couldn't recover, but rather 

5

 you have to be a direct purchaser rather than an 

6

 indirect purchaser of the pricefixed good. 

7

 MR. CURRAN: 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

 is a State law case. 

10
11
12
13
14

 MR. CURRAN: 

That is under Federal law. 
Yes.  All right.  So this 

The IPT case, that was a State 

 law case in Federal court.  Okay. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know your case is, but 

 the one that settled previously? 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Yes.  That's what I'm referring 

15

 to.  That was in Federal court, but it was asserting 

16

 State claims.  That's included 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.  So you have a 

18

 double dip claim.  I guess my question, procedurally, is 

19

 that, here, the State of Mississippi is the named 

20

 plaintiff. 

21

 MR. CURRAN: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The named plaintiff. 
And moreover, the State of 

23

 Mississippi is suing in order to obtain money, is what 

24

 we just heard, for its treasury.  And, third, the State 

25

 of Mississippi is suing because of their belief that the

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 defendants injured the economy of Mississippi, and they 

2

 injured it by hurting the pocketbooks of many 

3

 individuals in Mississippi, the names of whom they don't 

4

 even know.  All right? 

5

 Now, they say, look at  read the statute. 

6

 Read the cases which say if you are a nominal plaintiff, 

7

 that's good enough, as long as you are not suing as some 

8

 kind of  I forget the words  quasisovereign, 

9

 whatever it was, one way or the other.  You know the 

10

 cases better than I.  But why isn't what they just said 

11

 sufficient? 

12

 MR. CURRAN: 

Because we are not disputing 

13

 that the attorney general has standing to bring a claim 

14

 as a nominee for the real parties in interest. 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I understand that, but why 

 does that fall within this statute? 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Because the statutory language 

18

 says if it's a civil action  in which monetary relief 

19

 claims  we clearly got that  of 100 or more persons, 

20

 we think those claims under the Mississippi statute 

21

 inescapably belong to those persons 

22
23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If you go on and read that a 

 little bit further, Mr. Curran 

24

 MR. CURRAN: 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I'm getting there. 
 it says, "claims of 100

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 or more persons that are proposed to be tried jointly on 

2

 the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common 

3

 questions of law or fact." 

4

 MR. CURRAN: 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes. 
And here, of course  you 

6

 know, there's no joinder, let alone, any proposed  you 

7

 know, there's no  there nothing that the Mississippi 

8

 attorney general has to go through, to show that the 

9

 plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or 

10

 fact, right?  They don't  there's no showing of that 

11

 kind that has to be made in a parens patriae case. 

12

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, they filed a single 

13

 complaint, right, under Rule 42 and  of the Federal 

14

 Rules of Civil Procedure, the State analog to that, and 

15

 preexisting jurisprudence.  When you file a single 

16

 complaint, you're asking for a single trial.  And if you 

17

 want to bifurcate a trial of some kind, you have to make 

18

 a motion. 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

20

 MR. CURRAN: 

21
22

But, again, this clearly 
So I submit there is a 

 proposed  a proposal to try these claims jointly. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But they don't have to 

23

 show  and this is clearly referring to a kind of Rule 

24

 23 inquiry, which they don't have to go through to do a 

25

 parens patriae.

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CURRAN: 

That would be the same thing, 

2

 Your Honor, in the case that they say is the 

3

 quintessential mass  mass action case.  They say a 

4

 mass action case is one where a bunch of plaintiffs have 

5

 joined together in a single suit 

6
7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, but they do have to 

 show that 

8

 MR. CURRAN: 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN:  in a massive 

10

 MR. CURRAN: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

12

 MR. CURRAN: 

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Why? 

No, they 
 consolidation case 
 file a complaint. 
 the judge is going to 

14

 say, you have 100 claims; we want to see that those 100 

15

 claims have common questions of law or fact.  But in a 

16

 parens patriae case, the State never has to make that 

17

 showing.  It can just stand up and say, here we are.  We 

18

 are the State.  We're representing the interests of the 

19

 State qua State.  Here's our claim. 

20

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, Your Honor, I think  I 

21

 submit that, when a State attorney general files a 

22

 complaint on behalf of 100 or more persons claiming to 

23

 have standing and to be seeking to recover for the 

24

 damages to those 100 or more persons, he's proposing to 

25

 try those claims together.

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 And as to  as to whose claims they are, I 

2

 mean, the Mississippi statute is pretty clear that the 

3

 claim for restitution is  is necessary to restore to 

4

 the persons in interest, the victims. 

5

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, but the attorney 

6

 general says that that's not what's going to happen 

7

 here.  How do you square that with his statement that 

8

 that money will not get to these people? 

9

 MR. CURRAN: 

He cited the statute that has 

10

 that plain language.  That plain language was 

11

 interpreted by the Fifth Circuit.  There are  it's a 

12

 model act that's been interpreted by the State Supreme 

13

 Courts of other States, Iowa and Arizona.  They looked 

14

 at that language.  Oh, yeah, the money goes to the 

15

 people. 

16
17
18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

He says you can't  he 

 says you can't even identify those people. 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, that is  that doesn't 

19

 hold up.  Obviously, those people were identified in the 

20

 class action.  They're getting the money that's being 

21

 distributed.  People can turn in receipts.  There are 

22

 records.  Every antitrust case has this issue 

23

 identifying the victims and compensating them.  It's no 

24

 different here. 

25

 And another thing, there was a suggestion

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that, oh, everybody in the world has LCD panels, that 

2

 the period of time at issue in this case is 1996 to 

3

 2006.  LCD panels, which we now take for granted and are 

4

 ubiquitous, back then, were just an emerging technology. 

5

 And for that, I cite to the attorney 

6

 general's brief at page  their complaint, page 32a of 

7

 our cert ap, paragraph 104, which acknowledges that LCDs 

8

 were not even the leading technology for televisions 

9

 back during this period of time. 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about  see, I can 

11

 understand a complaint where they have taken 100 

12

 individuals, or 102, and they list them as plaintiffs, 

13

 and they don't call it a class action.  And that would 

14

 fall right within the meaning of mass action, if the 

15

 numbers are right. 

16

 MR. CURRAN: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
But if we take 

18

 your approach and depart from that mechanical, but 

19

 simple  simply administered interpretation, what is 

20

 worrying me, and perhaps you can help me with that, is 

21

 that there are perhaps all kinds of State actions where 

22

 one of the motivating reasons is  behind the lawsuit 

23

 is some person hurt our citizens. 

24

 And so, now, we will get into the instantly 

25

 interesting, but very difficult question of, well, when

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 you say hurt your citizens, do you mean hurt them by 

2

 giving them rise to an independent cause of action for 

3

 each of them, who we don't know who they are, and we 

4

 don't know if the statute of limitations has run to 

5

 some, and we don't know if others have other 

6

 disabilities; but, nonetheless, we're not certain this 

7

 suit is entirely for that, it may be mixed up with other 

8

 things. 

9
10

 Do you see the problem once I start down 
 your road? 

11

 MR. CURRAN: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13
14

I do.  I do. 
I've departed from the 

 clear and simple. 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Okay.  But to be clear, our 

15

 in our position, the only basis we have for removal here 

16

 is the inclusion of the restitution claim, which, under 

17

 Mississippi law, says that the claim belongs to the 

18

 citizens, and it's their money.  If  if that claim 

19

 wasn't in this action 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That seems to be  that 

21

 seems to be disputed because I understood Mr. Massey to 

22

 say that the restitution claim would go to the State. 

23

 And you say that that  the restitution couldn't go to 

24

 the State. 

25

 MR. CURRAN: 

That's right.  There is a

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 dispute on that issue. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You can hold him to that, 

3

 and I guess he can say, no, I don't want to be held to 

4

 that or  but that seemed to be not for this Court. 

5

 Once he says it, I guess 

6

 MR. CURRAN: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

8
9

We don't care where it goes. 
But can we not take him at 

 his word?  He said it wasn't. 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, the Mississippi statute 

10

 is clear.  The attorney general cited that.  The case 

11

 law is clear on that.  So  and the Fifth Circuit found 

12

 that Mississippi law required the money to go to the 

13

 individuals.  I think this Court should defer to those 

14

 prior rulings of  of those courts. 

15

 And  so basically, back to the statutory 

16

 language  and by the way, parens patriae is such a 

17

 loose label that's thrown around.  The  the attorney 

18

 generals seem to raise that up as a Latin shield of some 

19

 kind, suggesting that, as long as they invoke that term, 

20

 that issues of federalism prevents removal or something. 

21

 That doesn't hold up. 

22

 The statutory language, which is in English, 

23

 says that specific  specific cases are removable.  And 

24

 so we  so I don't think we should  I don't think 

25

 it's productive to talk about whether something is

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 parens patriae or not. 
 But, Justice Breyer, there are a lot of 

3

 cases that can be brought by State attorney generals 

4

 that would not be mass actions, like this case without 

5

 the restitution claim.  Okay? 

6

 Also, if there's a big pollution problem 

7

 or  or some public nuisance or some other thing like 

8

 that, where  where there's no identifiable victims, 

9

 but the public as a whole is injured, that  that 

10
11

 probably is a quasisovereign claim. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What  what do you do 

12

 about this  this language in the definition?  I 

13

 haven't heard you explain it. 

14

 It  it says  it means any  mass action 

15

 means "any civil action in which monetary relief claims 

16

 of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly 

17

 on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common 

18

 questions of law or fact." 

19

 Now, they're not proposed to be tried 

20

 jointly here on that ground.  They're being tried 

21

 jointly on the ground that the suit is being brought by 

22

 the attorney general under this State statute. 

23
24
25

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, I  I view that language 

 as contemplating a Rule 23 type analysis. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, I understand that.

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. CURRAN: 

Okay.  And in this case, we've 

2

 got a State attorney general who's suing, not only for 

3

 the consumers, but also for himself, right?  He's got 

4

 propriety claims in there.  He's also suing on  for 

5

 all the counties and municipalities in Mississippi. 

6

 I think a basis for his combination of those 

7

 claims in a single lawsuit is the inescapable 

8

 commonality of fact and maybe law in those claims.  So 

9

 I  I do think that it  it satisfies that language. 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, Mr. Curran, really, do 

11

 you  are you saying that, as a matter of State law, 

12

 that, in this suit, the attorney general has to make a 

13

 proposal that  that the plaintiff  that  that he 

14

 can bring the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs' 

15

 claims involve common questions of law or fact and that 

16

 that proposal has to be adjudicated by the Court? 

17

 MR. CURRAN: 

I think, Justice Kagan, that 

18

 the attorney general has already done that.  I think 

19

 that his complaint, beginning on the first page, says, 

20

 I'm bringing this claim on behalf of purchases by the 

21

 State and by its citizens of these LCD panels, and it's 

22

 a single complaint.  So I think  I think 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But he does not have to show 

24

 any common questions of law or fact in the typical way 

25

 that we demand.  I mean, that's actually a really

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 demanding showing that we have forced lawyers to make in 

2

 the class action context.  All that the attorney general 

3

 has to do is to stand up and say, I have a State 

4

 interest in protecting my citizens and in deterring 

5

 improper behavior, and here is my substantive right. 

6

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, I guess  I suppose we 

7

 could move for bifurcation to separate the  the 

8

 proprietary claims from the claims on behalf of 

9

 citizens, and then he would say, no, it makes sense to 

10

 keep them all together.  But  but the  the 

11

 sequencing of those arguments, I don't think should be 

12

 dispositive here. 

13
14
15

 By filing a complaint, again, I invoke 
 Rule  Rule 42 of the Code of Federal Civil Procedure. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I don't understand 

16

 the bifurcation point.  It seems to me that what the 

17

 attorney general is saying is he has a set of claims. 

18

 They're his claims on behalf of the  the populace, 

19

 but  but to further State's own interests. 

20

 And there  there's none of this Rule 23 

21

 kind of business about common questions of law or fact. 

22

 So it's not a question of  you know, one set of claims 

23

 or another set of claims, now or later.  He has a claim. 

24

 That's all he has. 

25

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, certainly, he  he at

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 least is attempting to combine the claims of all the 

2

 various individuals in the State on the grounds of 

3

 commonality, right?  I mean, even if you separate his 

4

 claims out, I mean, it's  the reason is 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Suppose it's a given that 

6

 we all concede that the complaint is both for 

7

 privatenamed persons and for restitution.  Both.  What 

8

 result? 

9

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, certainly, it's  it's a 

10

 mass action in that circumstance because restitution, 

11

 under Mississippi law, is for those specified 

12

 individuals. 

13
14
15
16

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, the rest of my 

 hypothetical, part of the restitution goes to the State. 
 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, then, again, the 

 statutory language says if it's a civil action 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

18

 MR. CURRAN: 

Where's the language? 
Well, it's at the beginning of 

19

 the mass action definition.  You can look at it on 

20

 either 65(a) and 66(a) or 79(a). 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

22

 MR. CURRAN: 

I have 79. 
Okay.  79(a), "Mass action 

23

 means any civil action in which monetary relief claims of 

24

 100 or more persons."  So as long as you've got a 

25

 qualifying claim, then the civil action's removable.

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And it doesn't matter if there are additional claims or 

2

 extraneous claims. 

3

 So the  the claim here for restitution on 

4

 behalf of Mississippi citizens is, in and of itself, 

5

 enough to make this a mass action. 

6

 And, again  and, Justice Kagan, maybe this 

7

 is getting back to  to your point.  I refer to the 

8

 references to representative actions in the  in the 

9

 General Public Provision and in the 1407 provision that 

10

 inescapably mean that  that this provision can apply 

11

 to representative actions. 

12

 Maybe that doesn't satisfy your commonality 

13

 point, but  but it gets part of the way there. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And this is the main 

15

 provision where they're trying to define what mass 

16

 action means.  And I take your point that there are 

17

 there's some slippage between this provision and the 

18

 various provisions that it refers back to because those 

19

 provisions  we're talking about class actions, and 

20

 this one is talking about mass actions. 

21

 But this is the essential definition. 

And 

22

 this one seems to be pointing to a very different kind 

23

 of suit, one in which there are 100 individual claims 

24

 that  that 100 people seek to have joined in which a 

25

 court is going to make a determination about whether

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 those 100 individual claims have questions of common law 

2

 or fact. 

3

 MR. CURRAN: 

If that's all this statute was 

4

 meant to reach, that would have been such an easy 

5

 statute to write.  Instead of this more convoluted 

6

 language, it could have just said if it's a civil action 

7

 in which 100 or more named plaintiffs are asserting 

8

 monetary relief claims for joint 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that would have 

 required this Court 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

That's essentially what it 

12

 says.  I mean, the only  the only thing it doesn't say 

13

 in what you just said is that it says persons, instead 

14

 of named plaintiffs.  But then, if you read the 

15

 sentence, it's pretty clear that persons and plaintiffs 

16

 are the same. 

17

 MR. CURRAN: 

Well, how  well, first of 

18

 all, how do you explain  I don't mean to pose a 

19

 question to you  it's inexplicable that the word 

20

 "persons" 

21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

22

 (Laughter.) 

23

 MR. CURRAN: 

I might not answer it. 

It's  it's inexplicable that 

24

 Congress would use the word "persons" and then, 12 words 

25

 later, use "plaintiffs," if it signifies the exact same

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 thing and then continue to use the term "plaintiffs" 

2

 throughout. 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But  isn't your 

4

 proposal mean that before someone can remove, they have 

5

 to decide whether the class is certifiable? 

6

 MR. CURRAN: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No. 
Because you're not going 

8

 to decide whether these plaintiffs are actually going to 

9

 be plaintiffs and part of this class until you decide 

10

 the class question.  If you use the word "persons" and 

11

 you use the language of the statute, it's the class 

12

 that's being proposed.  It's the named plaintiffs and 

13

 the class that's being proposed of persons that are 

14

 being proposed to be tried together. 

15

 MR. CURRAN: 

There's another provision in 

16

 here that is incorporated into the mass action  you 

17

 know, you will recall that if something qualifies as a 

18

 mass action then the provisions dealing with class 

19

 actions apply as well.  And subpart 8, which is found 

20

 at the bottom of 77a, specifically says, "This 

21

 subsection shall apply to any class action before or 

22

 after the entry of a class certification order by the 

23

 court with respect to that action." 

24
25

 So it's  what this statute is addressing 
 is possible class actions.  And, in fact, I think  I

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 think it makes sense to  to view this  this 

2

 statutory question in light of the overriding statutory 

3

 purpose here. 

4

 And, Justice Breyer, you address this in 

5

 your opinion in Standard Fire.  The driving force behind 

6

 this statute was to put interstate claims of national 

7

 importance into Federal court, to provide the option of 

8

 a Federal forum.  And in that case, in Standard Fire, 

9

 this Court unanimously examined the statutory question 

10

 there through that lens. 

11

 Here  so Congress dealt with class actions 

12

 proper, if you will, under Rule 23, in the class action 

13

 section.  And then it's got the mass action section, 

14

 which is inescapably designed to catch other devices 

15

 that have the same problems. 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17

 do it right, you know? 

18

 (Laughter.) 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Sometimes, Congress doesn't 

Sometimes, they try to 

20

 catch everything, but the language they use doesn't do 

21

 it. 

22
23

 MR. CURRAN: 

But, here, I think it does do 

 it. 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

 MR. CURRAN: 

But more than that 
And if there are competing

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 interpretations, then that purpose should drive the 

2

 decision. 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But more than that, 

4

 Mr. Curran, is that there was actually a considered 

5

 effort by the attorneys generals here to take themselves 

6

 out of this statute 

7

 MR. CURRAN: 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And they failed. 
 and that that  well, 

9

 you say they failed, and  I mean, that's the statutory 

10

 question.  But it's not just Congress didn't do it right 

11

 this time.  It was that there was a very serious effort 

12

 to get attorneys general out of this statute.  And 

13

 that's  and  you know, it seems to me that they did 

14

 pretty well. 

15

 MR. CURRAN: 

No, no, no, no.  No.  They made 

16

 their proposal to  to modify the statute after the Act 

17

 was in this form.  They saw the Act in this form  and 

18

 including Attorney General Hood sent a letter to 

19

 Congress saying this is going to infringe upon our 

20

 rights to parens patriae cases.  That amendment 

21

 sponsored by Senator Pryor failed. 

22

 So I  I think the only conclusion that can 

23

 be drawn from that is that Attorney General Hood and 

24

 many of his counterparts in other States saw this 

25

 problem, saw this  this threat.

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Now, a response that some on the Senate 

2

 floor gave to that proposal was it's not really 

3

 necessary.  But the reason it was not really necessary 

4

 is because the bona fide interests of the State were 

5

 already protected, through the local controversy rule 

6

 and through the general public exception. 

7

 Congress did not intend for State attorneys 

8

 general to be able to use their offices to hire outside 

9

 counsel  outofState outside counsel, to copycat a 

10

 class action complaint from an MDL, bring it again 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Maybe 

maybe they 

12

 didn't, but if you look at the committee report, what is 

13

 the definition of mass action?  And it is, under this 

14

 new subsection D11, "expands the jurisdiction over suits 

15

 that are brought on behalf of numerous"  numerous 

16

 "named plaintiffs."  "Numerous named plaintiffs." 

17

 MR. CURRAN: 

Yes, I am familiar with that 

18

 sentence in that Senate report.  I am also aware that 

19

 that Senate report was issued and dated a week or ten 

20

 days after Senate  after President Bush signed this 

21

 Act, so I question its value and its credibility. 

22
23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You mean it's contrived 

 legislative history? I can't imagine. 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 MR. CURRAN: 

But  but even if it somehow

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 could be considered, I don't think that  that sentence 

2

 is definitional.  That, certainly, is one alternative 

3

 to  to conventional class actions that Congress was 

4

 concerned about. 

5

 Our point is it wasn't the only one. 

6

 Congress was trying to close loopholes and trying to 

7

 prevent abuses, and a miserly interpretation of the 

8

 class  of the mass action definition would undermine 

9

 that  that purpose. 

10

 Now, in my remaining time perhaps, not 

11

 Justice Kagan, at the end of the day there was no 

12

 carveout in the statute for attorney general actions, 

13

 even though that was sought.  But the Act does reflect 

14

 some sensitivity for federalism concerns. 

15

 It's got an exception for situations where 

16

 States are the primary defendants  or State officials 

17

 are the primary defendants.  There is also a 

18

 notification to State attorneys general when there's a 

19

 settlement of a class action. 

20

 Those kinds of provisions show that Congress 

21

 was trying to be sensitive, and it was horse trading, it 

22

 was cutting deals, it was log rolling, coming up with an 

23

 Act here that was at once sensitive to federalism 

24

 concerns, but also trying to solve the very real abuses 

25

 that it had identified.

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And on the federalism point, the attorney 

2

 general's brief has a lot of citations to Eleventh 

3

 Amendment issues, and some of this Court's precedents 

4

 dealing with State sovereign immunity.  I submit that 

5

 those precedents and that Amendment deal only with 

6

 situations where the State is a defendant. 

7

 And here, where we are talking about the 

8

 State as a plaintiff  and the only intrusion we are 

9

 talking about is removal from State court to Federal 

10

 court, that is not on the same playing field as the 

11

 authorities relied on by the attorney general. 

12

 A couple of other things. 

There was a 

13

 suggestion in the reply brief that the complaint here 

14

 was not, in fact, a copycat case  a copycat complaint, 

15

 but instead, was a summary of the Federal indictments, 

16

 and that that explains the eerie similarity between the 

17

 class action complaint and the attorney general's 

18

 complaint.  That  that's just factually not right. 

19

 The  some companies who were defendants, 

20

 like my client, Toshiba, was never charged or convicted 

21

 of anything in this case, yet we're a defendant in this 

22

 case, and that's because we were a defendant in the 

23

 class action case that was copied. 

24
25

 And, in fact, the indictments against some 
 companies bear very little resemblance to the complaint

51

Alderson Reporting Company

 that the attorney general has filed here, in terms of 

2

 the duration of the conspiracy and the subject matter of

 the products that are alleged  were allegedly

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. MASSEY 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

12

 MR. MASSEY: 

13

 Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the 

14
15

Thank you. 

 Court: 
 The issues that I'd like to raise on 

16

 rebuttal are limited.  The  the most important thing 

17

 is that jurisdictional schemes should be simple, 

18

 administrable, predictable. 

19

 The simplest route  the simplest 

20

 interpretation is the one we have shown, that these 

21

 the statute is directed at actual plaintiffs with 

22

 concrete claims that are proposed to be tried jointly. 

23

 The only thing our friends on the other side 

24

 have pointed out is the use of the  is the word 

25

 "persons."  Justice Sotomayor is 100 percent correct

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that the word "persons" is basically  is an echo of 

2

 Rule 20, of the joinder rule, which also refers to 

3

 persons and plaintiffs. 

4

 So the fact that Congress used the word 

5

 "person" once in a mass action definition simply 

6

 confirms our point that the statute is really directed 

7

 at the mass joinder, mass consolidation situation, and 

8

 does not have anything to do with actions by sovereign 

9

 States. 

10

 Their primary argument seems to be that the 

11

 attorney general doesn't really own the claims in this 

12

 case, that these are claims that are owned by the 

13

 citizens of Mississippi.  That is a classic State law 

14

 issue, which should be raised on remand in the State 

15

 court.  A very similar 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

17
18

Did not the Fifth Circuit 

 decide that State law question? 
 MR. MASSEY: 

No, Your Honor, we don't 

19

 believe so.  That the Fifth Circuit ruled on its  the 

20

 interpretation of CAFA and said that, for purposes of 

21

 the statute, the claims were removable.  But it didn't 

22

 decide the attorney general's authority to sue in the 

23

 name of the State under the statutes which give him that 

24

 authority. 

25

 The  we don't think the Fifth Circuit

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 decided that question, and I read the Red Brief at page 

2

 33 as saying the attorney general's authority is not at 

3

 issue here, that we assume the attorney general has the 

4

 authority to bring the claims in the complaint as he 

5

 pled them, which is the restitution claimed in the name 

6

 of the State. 

7

 And the  there was a decision in 

8

 Mississippi in 2006, the only really relevant authority. 

9

 It's called the BASF case.  And there, a lower court in 

10

 Mississippi, the Chancery Court, upheld the attorney 

11

 general's authority to bring a very similar parens 

12

 patriae case. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What he says is  in the 

14

 complaint, it says  "prays that the defendant be 

15

 ordered to restitute any and all monies for the 

16

 purchases of its citizens." 

17

 All right. 

Now, you look at the statute he 

18

 quoted, the Mississippi statute, and it says there is 

19

 the authority to have restitution to restore to any 

20

 person in interest any monies which may have been 

21

 acquired by means of a practice prohibited. 

22

 So he says that sounds as if what you're 

23

 talking about is you want restitution, though, given to 

24

 the State, the restitution is for individual purchases 

25

 of individual citizens because there could be no other.

54

1

 And, therefore, you have a list of people in mind, or 

2

 you must find one, where there were particular 

3

 individual purchases, by individual citizens, and get 

4

 that restitution into the treasury. 

5

 All right. 

Now, that  I think something 

6

 like that was his argument, and I wanted to know what 

7

 you were going to say.  Are you going to give up these 

8

 last five words, "and the purchases of its citizens"? 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And that's what I 

 understood the Fifth Circuit to have held. 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, what the  what the 

12

 what the prayer for relief says is the  "restitute to 

13

 the State" 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15

 MR. MASSEY: 

16
17
18
19
20
21
22

 "for its purchases and the 

 purchases of its citizens." 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, and the purchases of 

 its citizens. 
 MR. MASSEY: 

So the State will get the 

 money 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know they'll get the 

 money 

23

 MR. MASSEY: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Right. 

Right. 
 but he's saying, to get 

 the money, you have to say which money.

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. MASSEY: 

2

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, it 
And to get the money, which 

3

 money means you better have a list of the individual 

4

 people who bought something, or otherwise, there is no 

5

 such money. 

6

 And that's enough to make those, in respect 

7

 to this paragraph, individual people whose claims the 

8

 State of Mississippi is pursuing.  Something like that 

9

 is his argument.  And I just wanted to know your 

10
11

 response. 
 MR. MASSEY: 

Well, the  the evidence will 

12

 be proven through statistical aggregate evidence, rather 

13

 than a list of names.  The list of names is impractical. 

14

 The  the State will show, basically, on the basis of 

15

 gross sales 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that has to go with 

17

 the facts of this case.  Don't go with the facts.  Go 

18

 with the  with the  the point, which is that you 

19

 in  in a normal case, aren't you, in fact, suing for 

20

 the citizens?  The named citizens.  Or the citizens 

21

 MR. MASSEY: 

In many cases, we are.  It is 

22

 still a public remedy of restitution.  In many cases, 

23

 the individuals may be identified. 

24

 Thank you.
