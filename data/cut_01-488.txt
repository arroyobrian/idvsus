CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument


next in No. 01-488, Timothy Stuart Ring v. Arizona.

Mr. Hurwitz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW D. HURWITZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HURWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:

In Apprendi v. New Jersey, this Court held that


11

the Sixth Amendment guarantee of jury trial extends to the


12

finding of any fact that exposes the defendant to a


13

greater sentence than he could have received on the basis


14

of the jury verdict alone.

15

controls this case. 


16

We submit that that principle


In Arizona, a defendant convicted of first


17

degree murder may be sentenced on the basis of the jury


18

verdict alone only to a sentence of life imprisonment. 


19

The judge in Arizona has no power, no legal discretion


20

under the law to sentence a convicted first degree murder


21

defendant to death.


22

QUESTION:

Well, if you're correct, Mr. Hurwitz,


23

I take it we would have to overrule not merely Walton, but


24

Clemons against Mississippi, Cabana against Bullock, and


25

Spaziano against Florida. 

3

1

MR. HURWITZ:

Your Honor, let me take those


2

cases separately because I do not think that at least two


3

of them are implicated by the position that we urge today.


4

Certainly Walton would be have to be -- would be


5

overruled because it's directly on point. 


6

And certainly, to the extent that Spaziano says


7

that a judge may, in the first instance, make the finding


8

of fact to -- to -- of -- of an aggravating circumstance


9

in order to allow a death sentence, it would be also -- it


10

would be also implicated and overruled by the position we


11

urge today. 


12

With respect to Clemons, Clemons was a case in


13

which a jury made findings of fact on multiple counts that


14

allowed a defendant to be sentenced to death, and the


15

issue on appeal was rather whether, one of more of those


16

factors having fallen out, the remaining factors could be


17

weighed against mitigating factors for purposes of


18

determining in the sentencing phase, the discretionary


19

phase of the -- of the capital punishment issue, whether


20

or not there could be imposed a capital punishment at that


21

point.

22

our position today. 


So, I do not believe that Clemons is implicated by


23

Rather, our point is very --


24

QUESTION:

25

MR. HURWITZ:

How about Cabana? 

Cabana, Your Honor, I suggest is a

4

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

more difficult question.

Its reasoning would be


2

implicated by our position today, but I -- as we suggested


3

in our brief, I think there is a distinction.

4

-- or Cabana -- the issue was whether or not a particular


5

sentence, where all the facts necessary under State law


6

had been found by the jury, was unconstitutional as


7

applied to a particular defendant.

8

applied analysis is the kind of thing that judges


9

typically do.

In Cabana


That sort of as-


They look at the law and lay it next to the


10

facts of the case and determine whether or not that law,


11

as applied, is unconstitutional with respect to a


12

particular defendant or a particular sentence. 


13

The issue posed by -- by this case and by


14

Apprendi is, I think, a quite different one.

15

State law expressly requires a number of factors as a


16

prerequisite to the imposition of a particular penalty,


17

the maximum penalty allowed by law, whether or not the


18

State can systematically deny to defendants in those cases


19

the right to a jury trial. 


20
21

QUESTION:

It is when


What other States have schemes that


under your position would also fail the Apprendi test? 


22

MR. HURWITZ:

Your Honor, we -- I think we


23

attempted to summarize the -- the status on page 38 of our


24

brief.

25

systems would be implicated by this.

We think there are eight or nine States whose

But what is not


5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clear in all of those States -- and to take Florida as an


2

example, Your Honor -- is whether or not in a system


3

which, as this Court suggested in Jones, where the jury


4

makes, by implication or by necessity, a finding of a


5

particular aggravating factor in order to recommend a


6

death sentence, whether or not that system would -- would


7

be affected by the principle that we urge.

8

those States where there is no jury involved in finding


9

the necessary aggravating circumstance would be the ones


Certainly


10

that would be implicated, and I would suggest that that


11

category is probably somewhat less than the category in


12

footnote 35 of our brief. 


13

It is clear, however, that whatever the effect


14

on other States, Arizona's system precisely complies and


15

precisely matches up to the rule that this Court announced


16

in Apprendi.

17

judge to impose this sentence of death without first


18

finding a fact that Arizona's State law specifies is


19

necessary for the imposition of that maximum punishment. 


20

And under that circumstance, we suggest there is no basis


21

for distinction of Apprendi. 


22

It is simply not possible in Arizona for a


Now, the State has suggested in this case that


23

one basis for a distinction is that the Arizona statute


24

says, within one single statute, the range of punishment,


25

the possible punishment for first degree murder is either

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

life -- life without possibility of parole, or death.

2

I would suggest that distinction makes no difference. 


3

But


Certainly in the Jones case, the precursor to


4

Apprendi, a case that this Court considered a year before


5

Apprendi, a single statute set forth the range of


6

punishment.

7

considered only several weeks ago, where the government


8

conceded that section 841, the drug statute, was covered


9

by Apprendi, several different punishments are set forth


10

In the Harris case, the case this Court


in a single statute. 


11

It is difficult to believe that Apprendi would


12

have been -- come out differently, that there would have


13

been a different result in that case, if the statute


14

instead read there's a possible punishment of 20 years for


15

discharging a firearm with racial motivation, but the last


16

5 years may not be imposed.

17

in the absence of racial motivation.


18

QUESTION:

You may not exceed 15 years


If we were to accept your position,


19

Mr. Hurwitz, what would it do to the Federal Sentencing


20

Guidelines? 


21

MR. HURWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me focus on


22

only one aspect of the sentencing guidelines because it


23

seems to me that there's no implication whatsoever for


24

downward departures and that the -- this Court has already


25

made clear, as the guidelines themselves say, that you

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

can't exceed the maximum sentence provided by the


2

underlying substantive statute. 


3

7

So, if I can focus on the question of what would

happen --

QUESTION:

Upward -- upward adjustments within


the maximum. 

MR. HURWITZ:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

With


8

respect to those, I think there is a distinction, and let


9

me suggest it to the Court.


10

In Arizona, the -- the judge simply has no legal


11

power, no discretion, no ability whatsoever to impose a


12

sentence greater than life in the absence of finding a


13

particular aggravating circumstance specified by the State


14

in its statutes. 


15

With respect to the sentencing guidelines, a


16

judge has discretion, and we know that because you review


17

sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion.

18

judge has the legal discretion to impose a sentence in


19

excess of the so-called presumptive range upon the finding


20

or upon noting in the record any number of particular


21

facts, not specified by statute. 


22

QUESTION:

So, the


Yes, but he didn't -- it's a strange


23

kind of discretion that can be reversed on appeal.

He


24

doesn't have discretion.

25

guidelines is to eliminate the discretion, to say you must


The whole purpose of the


8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

give this sentence if these factors exist.

MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Scalia, my point is, I


3

think, that in our case the judge has no power at all.

He


4

can never find -- he can never exceed that particular


5

limit, the limit being life, in the absence of -- in the


6

absence of finding a fact specified by the State, a fact


7

chosen by the State as necessary to impose the sentence.


8

The sentencing guidelines strike me as somewhat


9

distinguishable because the range of factors that a judge


10

may choose to depart upwards is -- is by the guidelines


11

relatively unlimited. 


12
13

QUESTION:

Well, in -- in this case, the


aggravating fact was killing for pecuniary gain. 


14

MR. HURWITZ:

15

QUESTION:

Correct, Justice --


And that was clearly implicit, if not


16

explicit, in the jury's finding.


17

MR. HURWITZ:

18

I -- I would suggest neither in


this case, Your Honor. 

They didn't find a robbery? 


19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HURWITZ:

The jury found a robbery, but


21

under Arizona law, as the cases make quite clear, in order


22

in a felony murder case for there to be a finding of


23

pecuniary gain, or in any murder case to be a finding of


24

pecuniary gain, there must be a showing that the murder


25

itself was motivated by a desire for pecuniary gain.
9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And


1

the Arizona Supreme Court has said on three or four


2

occasions it is not enough that a murder was committed in


3

connection with a robbery or, indeed, even in connection


4

with a felony murder.

5

particular homicide. 


6

The issue is motivation for the


In this case, the Arizona Supreme Court said


7

expressly we can't tell from the trial record why the


8

driver was killed.

9

trial record as to why the driver was killed.

There is virtually no evidence in this

It was on


10

the record made in the post-trial proceedings, the record


11

made on the basis of the accomplice testimony, that the


12

Arizona Supreme Court concluded that.


13

So, in this case when the Arizona Supreme Court


14

says two things -- one is the issue for pecuniary gain is


15

whether or not there has been proof of the motivation for


16

the murder, and second, in this case we can't tell why the


17

person was murdered -- I would suggest there is neither a


18

necessary, implicit, or even logical finding by the jury


19

in this case of -- of pecuniary gain.

20

Court I think addressed that issue quite straightforwardly


21

and directly.


22

The Arizona Supreme


Now, the State suggests that one distinction


23

between this case and Apprendi is the idea that these


24

aggravating circumstances are so-called sentencing


25

factors, not elements of the crime.

But I think that --


10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that argument was answered in Apprendi. 


2

What this Court said in Apprendi was that the


3

real test is not one of labels.

4

function.

5

State law to allow the judge to sentence somebody to the


6

maximum sentence provided by law?

7

whether you call these aggravating circumstances


8

sentencing enhancements or whether you call them elements,


9

you arrive, I would suggest, at the same result.

10
11

The real test is one of


Is this a fact that is necessary under the


And plainly it is, and


This


case on its face is covered by Apprendi. 

One way to -- one way to -- to get into that


12

issue is to -- is to imagine the following circumstance. 


13

Let's assume that Arizona law, instead of providing


14

precisely what it does now, said instead that the penalty


15

for first degree murder is life without -- is life with


16

possibility of parole.

17

to life without possibility of parole upon finding of one


18

of 10 specific aggravating circumstances, so that we had


19

exactly the same statute that we have now, but at the


20

first level you get life with possibility of parole after


21

25 years, and at this next level, you got life without


22

possibility of parole.

23

doubt, under those circumstances that on its face the rule


24

this Court set forth in Apprendi would apply. 


25

QUESTION:

But that penalty may be increased


I don't think there could be any


I think that's true, and I think that

11

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in the -- in the normal circumstance when a State does


2

something like that, even if it is not calling it an


3

element of the crime, it is an element of the crime.


4
5

What we have here, however, this -- this statute

was enacted in -- in what?

6

MR. HURWITZ:

7

QUESTION:

'73?


Initially in '73, Justice Scalia.


Which was the year after Furman.

8

what Arizona was saying was, you know, we -- we never


9

thought we had to have any finding of aggravated --


And


10

aggravating factors in order to impose the death penalty,


11

but the Supreme Court, in a decision that -- that had no


12

-- no rooting in the common law, said that we cannot


13

impose capital punishment without aggravating


14

circumstances.

15

circumstances necessary and we'll have that finding made


16

by a judge. 


17

Okay.

We'll make a finding of aggravating


Now, I -- I don't regard that as Arizona


18

adopting the aggravating circumstance as an element of the


19

crime, nor does the statute read that way.

20

you're talking about something that is unprecedented in --


21

in the common law.

22

has been mandated by the Supreme Court and the issue is


23

whether the finding mandated by the Supreme Court has to


24

be made by the jury or -- or the judge.

25

several cases that it's enough if it's made by the judge. 


So, you're --


You're talking about a finding that


And we've said in


12
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Now, why isn't --


2

MR. HURWITZ:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

Justice --


-- why isn't that enough to resolve


the case? 

MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Scalia, if the -- if the


6

point here is that the State was forced to do this and,


7

therefore, this cannot be an element under the Apprendi


8

test, I would suggest that presents several analytical


9

problems. 


10

The first is that this Court has said on any


11

number of occasions to the States, here is something that


12

must be in your law.

13

decided Furman or the year before, it decided Miller, and


14

in Miller it said if you want to have a constitutional


15

obscenity law, State, you must have a specific definition


16

in that State -- in the law of the kind of conduct that


17

you wish to -- to punish, the kind of -- the depiction of


18

the kind of conduct that you wish to punish.

19

telling you, States, by the way, what specific factor you


20

have to have.

21

The very same term that this Court


You decide.

We're not


Here are some suggestions.


Arizona, the year after Miller was decided,


22

amended its statutes to add to its obscenity laws a


23

specific requirement with respect to proof of specific


24

types of sexual conduct.

25

The Constitution made them do that.

This Court made them do that. 

But I do not believe


13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it would be suggested that those specific elements of the


2

crime, those specific factors that are necessary to impose


3

the maximum punishment allowed by law, are somehow


4

exempted from the Sixth Amendment for that reason. 


5

QUESTION:

No, but in -- in the -- in the


6

obscenity field, we didn't invite the kind of procedure


7

that -- that was adopted here by -- by establishing a


8

separate -- a separate category, the -- you know, the --


9

the guilt phase and the penalty phase.

We -- we invited


10

the -- the severing of the trial into those -- into those


11

two portions.

12

the constitutional requirement that we've imposed upon the


13

States requires a finding by the judge or a finding by the


14

jury.

15

it's an element of the crime and therefore has to be found


16

by the jury.

17

does the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court,


18

demand.


It's -- it's simply not was simple as to say, well,


19
20

And it seems to me it's up to us whether


It's -- it's rather what does the -- what


MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Scalia, let me -- let me


come at that at -- at two levels. 


21

The first one is I think the basic


22

constitutional principle that underlies the Sixth


23

Amendment.

24

in both Jones and Apprendi, is the notion that before


25

you're handed over to the State and before the State is


And that principle, as this Court articulated


14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

allowed to exact the maximum punishment permitted by law,


2

a jury of your peers is allowed to you to find those facts


3

to put the State in that position.

4

principle is directly implicated by the death penalty


5

situation on its face.

6

Amendment principle strikes me as no different. 


7

Certainly that


So, this underlying Sixth


With respect to bifurcation, there is, of


8

course, no constitutional requirement that the aggravating


9

circumstances be found in a penalty phase of the trial. 


10

This Court has made clear on any number of occasions that


11

the aggravating circumstances, these so-called narrowing


12

circumstances, the facts necessary under State law to


13

allow the imposition of a death penalty can be found in


14

the so-called guilt phase of the trial. 


15

QUESTION:

But if -- if Apprendi was based on a


16

long common law history, as -- as it certainly seems to


17

have been, wouldn't that distinguish it from the


18

aggravating/mitigating, which certainly is not based on


19

common law history at all?


20

MR. HURWITZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, it strikes me


21

that the common law history here makes the central


22

principle.

23

history is, after all, the one that Apprendi and Jones


24

articulate about the protection of the Sixth Amendment. 


25

The procedure faced in Apprendi was not known at the


The central principle in the common law

aggravating factor that might enhance a sentence was


3

unknown to the common law.

should apply to this circumstance.

7

The procedure of having a specific


QUESTION:

Yet, this Court in Apprendi


I think that's --


Mr. Hurwitz, may I ask why you have


8

-- you have certainly made a case about the aggravating


9

circumstances, but you haven't put, as part of that case,


10

the so-called Enmund/Tison findings.

11

that if in Arizona someone can be put to death only if he


12

was the triggerman, or was a -- what is the other phrase,


13

a major participant, you haven't made anything of those


14

factors, and I think if -- if the aggravating factor has


15

to be found by the jury, then surely those would have to


16

be as well. 


17

MR. HURWITZ:

And it seems to me


Justice Ginsburg, that may well be


18

the case.

As I think I suggested in response to the Chief


19

Justice's initial question, it -- it has struck us that


20

there is a difference between the sort of as-applied


21

analysis that an Enmund/Tison finding requires, a


22

proportionality analysis, and the issue of whether the


23

State systematically denies with respect to a particular


24

factor that it's picked out, and nothing in this Court's


25

jurisprudence required the State to adopt any particular

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

aggravating circumstance. 


2

With respect to those particular factors, it


3

strikes us that's at the core of Apprendi.

I don't resist


4

the suggestion that perhaps the principle in Apprendi


5

extends farther, and it extends to -- to the Enmund/Tison


6

findings.

7

of Apprendi, the very central holding of the case


8

necessarily extends to facts which the State itself has


9

said in its statutes are necessary in order to find -- in


What I do suggest is that -- is that the core


10

order to allow the maximum punishment to be imposed by


11

law.


12
13

QUESTION:

But -- but the other factor you


haven't discussed is the mitigating circumstances. 


14

MR. HURWITZ:

15

QUESTION:

Correct, Justice Kennedy.


The common law, in defining elements,


16

doesn't usually have some factors on the other side that


17

-- that are mitigating.

18

suggest some examples where they do.

19

very much, it seems to me, to show that this is part of


20

our Eighth Amendment protections that have been mandated. 


21

In Apprendi, the judge could always, once he or she found


22

the racial animus, enhance the sentence; in fact, had to. 


23

Here there's still a balancing that has to take place and


24

-- and that -- that certainly is -- is not something


25

classically reserved for the function and province of the


Perhaps -- perhaps you can

jury. 


2

MR. HURWITZ:

And that's -- that's correct,


3

Justice Kennedy, and we don't suggest that mitigating


4

circumstances or circumstances that suggest leniency must


5

be found by the jury.

6

once the judge was empowered to enter the maximum sentence


7

allowed by law, that judge could consider whatever factors


8

or the State could consider, in -- in whatever form it did


9

so, those factors that might provide for a sentence of


10

It has always been the case that


less than the maximum sentence allowed by law.


11

QUESTION:

What about that kind of argument that


12

initially Justices Stewart and Powell and Stevens have


13

made, that there's a necessary connection between the


14

determination that death in a case is not cruel and


15

unusual and the jury is doing the weighing in order to


16

show that it reflects a community sentiment in that


17

community that the death penalty is not cruel and unusual?


18

MR. HURWITZ:

And, Justice Breyer, had this


19

Court accepted that as -- as a correct statement of the


20

Eighth Amendment, we obviously wouldn't be here today. 


21

We're operating -- we're operating with the constraints of


22

this Court's decisions which have said that kind of jury


23

weighing, that kind of jury sentencing is not required


24

by --

We are not suggesting that jury


11

sentencing is required.

We are suggesting that jury fact


12

finding is required. 


13

And if I might, let me suggest the difficulties


14

of adopting a rule that somehow has one -- one approach if


15

something was done pre 1972 and another one after.

16

Arizona had adopted this very same statute identically


17

worded in 1965, when the ALI first suggested it as a


18

possibility to the States, it seems to me clear, on the


19

basis of Apprendi, that the aggravating circumstances


20

would be elements, or at least sentencing enhancements, as


21

the Court said, and required to be found by the jury.


22

QUESTION:

If


But if it adopted the statute in


23

1965, it could have simply had the exact language that it


24

had and said the decision as to whether death or life is


25

simply up to the discretion of the judge, and it would

MR. HURWITZ:

been decided at that time, Mr. Chief Justice. 


4
5

Because Apprendi and Jones had not


QUESTION:

And because Furman had not been


decided.


6

MR. HURWITZ:

To be sure.

But my point is that


7

if this Court -- this Court will enact an unworkable


8

system if what it does is start looking at State statutes


9

and trying to determine whether or not particular factors


10

in those statutes arose in response to Furman, before


11

Furman, after Furman.


12

One example is suggested in our brief.

The


13

State of New York in the mid-1960s determined to narrow


14

its capital punishment laws and apply them only when the


15

victim was a peace officer.

16

1988.

17

from this Court, or was Arizona's decision because, as New


18

York, it made a policy decision? 


Arizona made that decision in


Was Arizona's decision in response to a mandate


19

QUESTION:

Arizona has decided to apply its


20

capital punishment only to when the victim was a peace


21

officer? 


22

MR. HURWITZ:

No.

That's one of the -- one of


23

the narrowing circumstances in Arizona law.

And my -- my


24

point, Mr. Chief Justice, is let's assume two States, one


25

of which made that decision in 1965, and another one made

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that decision in 1988, and it was the only aggravating


2

circumstance that that State had adopted.

3

Court then say, with respect to State number one, the


4

aggravating --


5

QUESTION:

Would this


But here it's a whole procedure


6

designed to have express mitigation and -- and aggravation


7

to be considered by the same trier of fact and balanced. 


8

And you -- you seem to give again very -- very little


9

force to the mitigation aspect. 


10

MR. HURWITZ:

Justice Kennedy, I don't mean to. 


11

I think it is entirely appropriate and entirely possible


12

for a State to design that weighing and that mitigation


13

issue to a -- to a jury.

14

not only in this context, but in other contexts, that --


15

that a defendant is not entitled to a jury trial to


16

establish mitigation from the maximum sentence that the


17

law might allow. 


18

But this Court has made clear,


Once again, I would return, I think, to the


19

underlying Sixth Amendment principle, as this Court stated


20

it in Jones and Apprendi.

21

before a defendant was put, in effect, into the tender


22

mercies of the State to be -- to be subjected to whatever


23

sentence the law might allow, first that defendant got the


24

right to have a jury of his peers find the facts that were


25

necessary to do so.

The notion was in 1791 that


He did not have the right at that

21

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

time to have a jury of his peers find whatever facts might


2

persuade the sentencer to give him less than the maximum


3

allowed by law. 


4

So, I would suggest that when you return to the


5

underlying Sixth Amendment principle here, it does provide


6

a distinction between facts that would call for leniency


7

and facts that -- that are necessary under the State's law


8

to impose a particular sentence.


9

QUESTION:

Except that Arizona has designed its


10

system, and you could design other systems, but it's


11

designed its system in order to sort out the most culpable


12

offenders and it uses this balancing mechanism.


13
14
15

MR. HURWITZ:

Well, I would separate, Justice


Kennedy, the two parts of the death penalty process.

There is a sorting at the front end.

There is a


16

narrowing that is required in order to determine which


17

defendants among all those convicted of homicide are, in


18

effect, the most culpable and can be sentenced to death. 


19

There is a second proceeding.

The second


20

proceeding is the sentencing proceeding.

And what this


21

Court has made clear is that with respect to that first


22

proceeding, there must be specified facts.

23

Furman analysis.

24

that we contend is required under the Constitution to be


25

found by the jury. 


That's the


And that's the aggravating circumstance


22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

With respect to the second decision, this Court


2

has made plain on any number of occasions that that can be


3

made a discretionary decision for the judge. 


4

Proportionality measurements are no longer required at


5

that level.

6

just have to let the defendant have the opportunity at


7

that circumstance to argue for individualized treatment or


8

to argue about leniency, to bring the facts pertinent to


9

his case to the attention of the court.

What this Court has said, however, is you


So, I would


10

suggest it is at this first stage, this narrowing stage,


11

that the Apprendi principle applies.


12

QUESTION:

What you're saying is you're not


13

entitled to a finding of -- of mitigation.

14

entitled to a finding of -- of aggravation. 


15

MR. HURWITZ:

You are


Precisely so, Justice Scalia.

And


16

I -- and I think not only are you not entitled to it, but


17

-- but there is nothing in this Court's jurisprudence that


18

requires that the State specify a particular fact in


19

mitigation. 


20

Here we have facts chosen perhaps under the


21

compulsion of the Constitution, but nonetheless chosen by


22

the State as necessary prerequisites to the punishment.


23
24
25

Unless the Court has other questions, I will

reserve the balance of my time. 

QUESTION:

Very well, Mr. Hurwitz.

General Napolitano, we'll hear from you. 


2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JANET NAPOLITANO


3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


4
5

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


6

Opposing counsel began with Apprendi, but let me


7

take up on the suggestion by Justice Scalia that this case


8

really begins with Furman because after Furman, the States


9

were left with the mandate that death penalty decisions


10

could not be left unguided under the Eighth Amendment, but


11

requires a standard of judgment. 


12

Some States imposed mandatory death sentences, a


13

practice this Court later found unconstitutional.

14

contrast, Arizona amended its death penalty statute to


15

comply with Furman by adding a series of factors which the


16

judge would take into account in choosing between the


17

alternative punishments of life or death. 


18

In Walton, this Court fully considered and


19

upheld the constitutionality of Arizona's law.

20

question now is whether at this late date Apprendi


21

requires you to overrule Walton.

22

Apprendi is a Sixth Amendment issue.

23

this case Ring concern the Eighth Amendment. 


24
25

In


The


And the answer is no. 

Furman, Walton, and


In addition, principles of stare decisis are

heavily implicated here because, as Chief Justice

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Rehnquist mentioned, there have been any number of


2

precedents in this Court that would be implicitly, if not


3

explicitly, overruled should this Court overrule Walton.


4

Let me, if I might, turn to two important


5

distinctions between Ring and -- and Apprendi.

6

substantive and one I would call formal. 


7

The substantive distinction is this.

One is


The


8

sentencing statute in Arizona derived from Furman.

9

passed in 1973.

It was


The pecuniary gain aggravating factor was


10

one of the original aggravating factors in that statute. 


11

There was never a -- a suggestion that Arizona was playing


12

a game, moving something that previously had been an


13

element into the sentencing factor side of the statute. 


14

There's never been any suggestion that this was anything


15

other than a way to decide which of all first degree


16

murders deserve the death penalty.


17

QUESTION:

Are we going to have to try to figure


18

that out case by case with -- with respect to every


19

State's statute, as Mr. Hurwitz suggested we -- we would


20

have to do?


21

MS. NAPOLITANO:

22

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I think --


I mean, what about the New York


23

statute that -- you know, that makes an aggravating


24

circumstance the death of a -- of a peace officer? 


25

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Your Honor, I think what you

25

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have to do is just look at what was the underlying first


2

degree murder statute, what is the underlying statute


3

which gives rise to the possibility of a death penalty. 


4

In Arizona, the underlying first degree murder


5

statute has been the same since 1901, and in fact, around


6

the country, most first degree murder statutes can trace


7

their routes to England in terms of how they are defined,


8

the mens rea, the actus reus, and the causation


9

requirements. 


10

QUESTION:

11

MS. NAPOLITANO:

12
13

But you're --

It's not a difficult process to


go through. 

QUESTION:

But you're saying -- the implication


14

of what you're saying is that any, in effect, departure or


15

innovation in the modern law which doesn't have a clear


16

antecedent, at least as of the time of the -- of the


17

framing, is exempt -- is a fact exempt from the jury trial


18

requirement.

19

that rule in order to see it your way.


20

I mean, that's -- that -- we'd have to adopt


MS. NAPOLITANO:

No.

No, Your Honor, you would


21

not have to adopt such a blanket rule.

What I am


22

suggesting is this.

23

statutory scheme that quite clearly, plainly, and


24

unequivocally derives from this Court's Eighth Amendment


25

jurisprudence, some of the Sixth Amendment questions that


In a situation where you have a

1

were raised in Apprendi are not implicated.

2

make --


3

QUESTION:

And you can


So, if the State comes up with a new


4

condition, the jury trial guarantee applies.

5

Court comes up with it, for whatever reason, it does not


6

apply. 


7

MS. NAPOLITANO:

If this


Not necessarily, Your Honor. 


8

And it gets you into the discussion of what is the intent


9

of the legislature, what does it mean to be an element of


10

the crime in the first place.

11

QUESTION:

But under --


Why -- why does it matter whether


12

it's an element or not?

13

it an element, call it a factor, we don't care what you


14

call it?

15

be found by the jury. 


16

I mean, doesn't Apprendi say call


If it's a fact necessary, et cetera, it's got to


MS. NAPOLITANO:

Well, I think in -- in looking


17

at McMillan and Jones and Apprendi and that whole line,


18

there has been a question created by this Court as what is


19

an element because if it's an element, what this Court has


20

said is it has to be charged, it has to be proved beyond a


21

reasonable doubt, and it has to go to the jury.

22

sentencing factor, if it's -- if that's what's going on,


23

those requirements do not apply. 


24
25

If it's a

in effect, I sort of put you off track here.

I --


You -- you


27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

were saying that there isn't a simple distinction on your


2

theory between facts added by a legislature and facts


3

required by this Court.

4

isn't such a distinction as -- as you're arguing it now.


5

So, tell me -- tell me why there


MS. NAPOLITANO:

What we're arguing, Your Honor,


6

is that when a fact is found purely for the purpose of


7

sentencing -- and -- and recognize the fact here murder


8

for pecuniary gain was never a part of the definition of


9

first degree murder.

First degree murder is the


10

intentional killing of another or a felony murder with


11

certain underlying felony predicates.

17

There was a death notice in


Right. 


14

16

The jury found that


The jury was death qualified. 


So, there's no question of surprise here. 

QUESTION:

Well, are you -- are you saying then


18

that if a legislature adds a fact -- call it an element if


19

you want -- purely for purposes of determining the


20

sentence, that that too would be exempt from the -- the


21

guarantee of the jury trial? 


22
23
24
25

MS. NAPOLITANO:

I think it could be exempt


depending on the circumstances, yes, Your Honor. 

QUESTION:

But would it be -- I mean, is that


the theory that you're arguing? 

28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. NAPOLITANO:

QUESTION:

3
4

Yes that there are --


I just want to know what you're --


you're arguing. 

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Yes, Your Honor.

I'm sorry. 


5

That there are some facts that the legislature is entitled


6

to find which don't go to the definition of the crime but


7

go to the punishment.

8

there's a Sixth Amendment right to jury sentencing.


9

QUESTION:

And this Court has never held that


What -- what do you do with the


10

broader principle which we express from time to time that


11

the -- the ultimate point of the jury right in -- in a


12

criminal case is to -- is to place the jury between the


13

defendant and the State?

14

statement, then you're saying, well, only part way between


15

the defendant and the State.


16

MS. NAPOLITANO:

If -- if that's a fair


In the death penalty context,

Your Honor, this Court has already limited the kind of


18

offenses for which the death penalty can even be a


19

possibility.

20

legislative discretion that you would in another


21

circumstance.

22

kinds of non-death cases, you may have to do a different


23

kind of analysis.


24
25

So, you don't have the kind of broad ranging


That's why I say you -- you -- in those


But in the unique context of the death penalty

world where you have to have either a first degree murder

29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

or a felony murder -- and if it's a felony murder and you


2

have a non-shooter, you have to make the Enmund/Tison


3

finding, and that has to be made and can be made by the


4

judge -- there -- the legislature is not -- they're not


5

charging the death penalty for jaywalking.


6

And then the question is, all right, is the


7

legislature entitled under the Eighth Amendment or does


8

the legislature under the Eighth Amendment have to channel


9

discretion?

10

And they do.


And then the question is, does Apprendi somehow


11

require that that Eighth Amendment jurisprudence be


12

converted into a jury right on this -- on the aggravating


13

factors?

14

no, starting with Proffitt v. Florida all the way through


15

Walton.

16

And as this Court has said time and time again,


Poland v. Arizona is a great example where --

QUESTION:

But -- but your -- your principle, in


17

fact, is broader than that because, as I understand it,


18

your principle is that what we have traditionally referred


19

to as sentencing factors -- maybe change that to a neutral


20

term, facts that bear solely on sentencing -- they can be


21

excluded from the -- the jury finding guarantee.


22

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Yes.

In the unique context of


23

the death penalty and then it remains for this Court to


24

decide whether you want to broaden it.

25

proposed by the petitioner here would be equally broad


But the rule


30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

taken out of the death penalty context because you could


2

have no fact that enhanced a sentence that didn't first


3

have to be found by a jury. 


4

And in response to a question that was posed


5

earlier, that would throw into question the Federal


6

Sentencing Guidelines and their structure and -- any many


7

State sentencing structures where, once you are convicted


8

of a particular offense, the State law requires the judge


9

to give you a presumptive sentence unless he finds


10

additional facts, in which case he can depart upwards. 


11

It's not just the Federal Sentencing Guidelines that use


12

that structure.

13

you are to hold that an aggravating factor even in a death


14

penalty case has to go to the jury, it is hard to imagine


15

why that wouldn't extend throughout the sentencing systems


16

of the States. 


17

Many States use that structure.

QUESTION:

So, if


General Napolitano, how many death


18

sentence case are there presently in Arizona that would be


19

affected by a reversal here? 


20

MS. NAPOLITANO:

We've had 89 death sentences


21

imposed since Walton, and approximately 30 are in some


22

type of direct review.

23

that's just in -- in Arizona. 


24
25

QUESTION:

So, it's a substantial number, and


Maybe Apprendi throws into play some


of those earlier cases, even if you don't agree with

1

Apprendi or feel it's quite limited.


2

What about the other cases I mentioned where


3

Powell and -- and Stewart -- Stevens all thought that a


4

jury should make this determination as part of the Eighth


5

Amendment jurisprudence because it's very important that


6

the death penalty be applied only where opinion in that


7

community believes that it is consistent with the cruel


8

and unusual punishment prohibition? 


9

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Two responses to that, Your


10

Honor.

One is this Court itself in a later case mentioned


11

that they thought judicial sentencing may, in fact, be a


12

better way to guarantee against the arbitrary imposition


13

of the death penalty. 


14
15

QUESTION:

The statistics seem to suggest that


it is absolutely no reason to think that.


16

MS. NAPOLITANO:

The statistics seem to suggest


17

that there is absolutely no reason to think that jury


18

sentencing is any different, that they're a wash.

19

there hasn't been a lot of literature on this subject.

The difference is that the

responsibility of saying I as a human being have decided

Your Honor, even under

11

colonial times.

17

MS. NAPOLITANO:

QUESTION:

Excuse me?


It could make all those findings that


19

you just recited, and yet the law of Arizona would not


20

permit the imposition of the death penalty.


21

MS. NAPOLITANO:

22

under that part of our statute, would say that the maximum


23

death penalty is death.

MS. NAPOLITANO:

He must find an aggravating

mitigators and make the determination as to whether death


6

is the appropriate punishment. 


7

But again, this is part of the process this


8

Court has dictated to the States to determine which of the


9

worst murders deserve the worst penalty.


10

QUESTION:

General Napolitano, the -- the


11

expanded argument that Justice Breyer is -- is suggesting,


12

which -- which isn't urged by Mr. Hurwitz, is really an


13

part of my argument, because it's not just the cases you

could have the situation such as a State like Florida

was found, and you're still --

Well, he doesn't know which is found,

but he knows that one is found.

that's not enough, then you are making the Stewart Eighth

MS. NAPOLITANO:

It seems to me if you say

1

what it is, and the judge still has to go through all of

the evidence and do the weighing as to what weight that

aggravating circumstance should find versus the

is the function of the jury there anyway?

protection the Sixth Amendment is providing to a defendant

there?

What is the


And I would suggest that a defendant such as

Ring and such as a defendant in Florida has already

received all the protections that the Sixth Amendment


11

entitles him or her to.

12

a narrowing process where the judge's discretion is


13

actually being narrowed in sentencing, not broadened.

Apprendi, you could actually say the discretion was being

broadened, the same as in Jones, but it is being narrowed.

And all that is going on here is

Yes, but it's narrowed to the extent

that he now knows he must make an additional -- one single

Now, in -- in the Ring case, there -- there is

the issue of the fact that he was convicted of armed

robbery and conspiracy to commit armed robbery.


4

QUESTION:

May I ask if you disagree with your


5

opponent's analysis of the pecuniary circumstance issue? 


6

He says that there's a difference between armed robbery on


7

the one hand which is for a pecuniary purpose and the


8

pecuniary motivation in a death case, and that has to be


9

the motivation for the killing itself, is that the robbery

11

with that?

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Do you disagree


Yes, Your Honor.

And I would

It's an Arizona Supreme Court case.

But I would also add that in this case, based on


22

the trial transcript and the sentencing hearing


23

transcript, which are part of the joint appendix before

11

QUESTION:

Would you tell me how one would

explain to a citizen that you can't get 5 years added on


13

to your sentence unless the jury makes the critical


14

finding, but you can be put to death with the judge making


15

the critical finding?

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Because, Your Honor, the -- the

difference is what is the source of the punishment.

Apprendi does is expand the range of the jury trial.

what the Court has not done is expand the Eighth Amendment

protections that it -- that it incorporated onto the

QUESTION:

And -- and the implications are


It seems to me that you're making a

novel application of the principle we've repeated several

times, that death is different. 


7

MS. NAPOLITANO:

And -- and again, if this Court were to overrule


19

Walton and reopen all of the cases in Arizona, at least


20

that are on direct review and in the other States, it's


21

hard to imagine how you then would not also have to


22

overrule Clemons, Hildwin, Poland, all the cases we've


23

cited to the Court before, because they all recognize and


24

state that these cases are different and that there is a


25

separate rule for the judge in these kinds of cases.

QUESTION:

The -- the difference obviously is


2

that, of course, it's different.

3

So, the obvious argument is that if you're going to insist


4

that a jury find a fact that could enhance a sentence from


5

10 years to 15, surely a jury, when you're under the


6

Eighth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment, should find the

fact that could enhance the sentence from life in prison

to death.

It's worse, not better.


I mean, I think that's what it's --

QUESTION:

11

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Well, I think that's --


-- is the underlying point here.

I think that's petitioner's

basic argument, and -- and our response is it's more

complicated than that.

question because in the death penalty world, the case law


15

is different, the tradition is different.

16

creation of Supreme Court precedent, really not of the


17

common law as it came down through colonial times.

18

what is going on here are additional protections for a


19

defendant, not fewer protections for a defendant. 


20

That doesn't really answer the


This is all a


And


And remember, in this case, you know, if you


21

just took the -- the literal language of Apprendi and --


22

and didn't go beneath it, and you took the literal


23

language of the Arizona first degree murder statute, the


24

maximum penalty under the statute is death, and the judge


25

is simply making a choice between life or death.
44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And the


1

jury's verdict authorizes the judge to go forward and


2

enter into that sentencing proceeding.

3

procedure that this Court has embraced, upheld, and


4

specifically said does not violate the Sixth Amendment.


5

QUESTION:

And that is a


Would you comment on your opponent's


6

suggestion that that would apply to other statutes like


7

the drug statute?

8

statute is life in prison and so forth, but nevertheless,


9

Apprendi applies.

The maximum penalty under the same


Or Apprendi itself -- supposing the two


10

-- instead of two statutes, there had been one.

11

that have made a difference? 


12

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Would


You know, in the statutory


13

analysis that Apprendi suggests, part of that analysis is


14

you have to look at each statute and how it was


15

constructed and so forth.

16

automatically it would apply because, again, as I've made


17

the argument today, the Eighth Amendment death penalty


18

cases just are different. 


19

I don't know whether


But, again, if you overrule Walton, it -- it is


20

hard to imagine how any judge would have the authority


21

under the Sixth Amendment to find any kind of fact that


22

would be used to enhance a sentence.

23

Apprendi is supposed to mean, that's a very, very broad


24

ruling. 


25

QUESTION:

And if that's what


To -- to enhance a sentence beyond

45

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that which was otherwise authorized by law by the jury's


2

verdict. 


3

MS. NAPOLITANO:

Well, or enhance a sentence


4

beyond the presumptive sentence, because what's the


5

difference between a sentence authorized and a presumptive


6

sentence set forth in either guidelines or in legislation? 


7

We're cutting very fine hairs here. 


8
9

And I think the ultimate question is, what is

the role of a jury?
Yes.

Was that jury's role embraced by


10

Arizona?

11

change at any time from what it was pre-Furman to post-


12

Furman?

13

death case?

Yes.

14

case?

Everyone knew it was a death case.

15

no surprise.

16

way, we're going to ask for an additional 10- to 20-year


17

enhancement like they did in Apprendi or an additional 10-


18

year enhancement as in Jones.

19

This was a death case from the beginning and it should be


20

a death case now. 


No.

Yes.

Did the role of the jury in this case

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Hurwitz, would you address the


2

question that General Napolitano made about this is an


3

Eighth Amendment requirement, not a Sixth Amendment


4

requirement, and that's a huge difference? 


5

MR. HURWITZ:

I -- I will, Justice Ginsburg.

It


6

seems to me that the State's position is that when a fact


7

is required by State law at the policy whim of legislators


8

in order to impose the maximum punishment allowed by law,


9

that fact gets Sixth Amendment protection.

But when a


10

fact is required by the Constitution or by decisions of


11

this Court, that it somehow obtains less Sixth Amendment


12

protection.

24

protection of the right to jury trial, applies with no


25

less force under a circumstance where the enhanced

2

circumstance where the enhanced sentence may be from 10


3

years to 12 years.


4

It may well be true that this Court's Eighth


5

Amendment jurisprudence is unique, but in the context of


6

the Sixth Amendment, in the context of the facts necessary


7

and specified by State law, in order to allow the maximum


8

punishment allowed by law, there should not be an Eighth


9

Amendment exception. 


10

The State has chosen to make specific facts


11

necessary for the imposition of the ultimate sentence, and


12

when the State chooses to do so, whether it chooses to do


13

so because it merely thinks it's a good idea or it chooses


14

to do so because the Constitution of the United States


15

requires it to do so, the same Sixth Amendment principle


16

ought to obtain.

2

second level of whether this is a particular penalty


3

that's appropriate for this defendant.

4

narrowing, the State's choosing of factors and putting


5

them in its law and saying to the defendant, this is a


6

fact that must be found before you can receive this


7

maximum sentence, is a Sixth Amendment point.


8
9

One final point.

But the State's


With respect to notice, this


is plainly not a notice case.

I don't believe Apprendi


10

would have come out a single bit differently if, before


11

his trial, Mr. Apprendi was told you're going to be tried


12

on the firearms charge and at the end of the charge, the


13

judge is going to determine whether there's racial


14

motivation and he's going to give you an additional


15

sentence.

16

not about notice. 


17

Apprendi was not about notice.

This case is


This case is, however about that central Sixth


18

Amendment point, and I would suggest to the Court that try


19

as you might, unless you simply say in the end we're going


20

to have a different rule for capital punishment, you can't


21

distinguish the issues in this case and the underlying


22

Sixth Amendment principle from the principles in Apprendi.


23

And for that reason, we suggest that this case is


24

controlled by Apprendi and that the sentence of death


25

imposed on this petitioner was inappropriate under the
