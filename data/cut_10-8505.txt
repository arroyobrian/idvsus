CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in Case 10-8505, Williams v. Illinois.

Mr. Carroll.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN W. CARROLL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. CARROLL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, Sandra Lambatos testified that

11

Mr. Williams' DNA matched a DNA profile that, according

12

to assertions made by analysts from the Cellmark labs,

13

was the genetic description of the purported offender.

14

Because no one from Cellmark appeared at Mr.

15

Williams' trial, Lambatos' testimony conveying the

16

testimonial statements from Cellmark violated Mr.

17

Williams' rights under the Confrontation Clause.

18

these reasons, the Illinois Supreme Court's decision

19

should be reversed.

20

For

Now, Ms. Williams' -- or Ms. Lambatos'

21

testimony on direct examination clearly conveyed

22

Cellmark's statements.

23

swab and blood sample from the victim were sent from --

24

to Cellmark for DNA analysis.

25

there a computer match generated from the male DNA

She testified that the vaginal

profile found in the semen from the vaginal swabs of the

2

victim and the male DNA profile that had been identified

3

as having originated from Mr. Williams?

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, it hasn't been

5

the focus of the briefing, but you've just made it the

6

focus here.

7

statements about what constituted the Cellmark lab

8

results are a statement that violates the Confrontation

9

Clause.

I know that you've been claiming that her

But are you taking the position that her

10

statements and the admission of the documents, mailing

11

the lab sample to the laboratory, and them getting it

12

back, that all of those business records were improperly

13

admitted?

14

MR. CARROLL:

As --

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because she testified

16

that in her records she sees that her lab -- and she

17

says -- I think those records were produced; I could be

18

wrong -- that --

19
20
21

MR. CARROLL:

Yes, the shipping records were

produced.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They were produced and

22

admitted into evidence.

23

the victim, L.J., was mailed to the laboratory and that

24

it came back.

25

That the lab sample taken from

Are you taking the position that those

shipping documents were not business records?

2

taking the position that those were improperly admitted?

3

MR. CARROLL:

Are you

No, Your Honor, at this stage,

4

we are not challenging the admission of the shipping

5

records.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that would just show

7

that the material went to and came back from the lab.

8

It wouldn't show what the lab results were.

9

results that she testified to, right?

10

MR. CARROLL:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

It was the

That's correct, Your Honor.
And what other evidence was

there of the results besides her testimony?

13

MR. CARROLL:

There was no other evidence.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No other.
In the case of the blood

16

that was tested in the police lab, there the person who

17

was testing did testify at the trial, right?

18

just Lambatos -- Lambatos, but the one who had tested

19

the blood?

20

MR. CARROLL:

It wasn't

The -- the person who

21

tested or who analyzed Mr. Williams' blood did testify

22

live at the trial.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Yes.
Abbinanti testified that

she did the blood test and it went into the State

database with reference to the other crime, not this

2

crime; am I correct?

3

MR. CARROLL:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

he was arrested for an unrelated matter.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- when

But she's an expert.

She

6

testified how she did the test and what the -- and that

7

she put the DNA result into -- into the data bank.

8

MR. CARROLL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Hasn't it long been accepted

10

that experts may testify to the facts that form the

11

basis for their opinions on the ground that when the

12

experts go over those facts, they are not -- those --

13

that information is not being introduced to prove the

14

truth of the matter asserted, that -- the truth of those

15

underlying facts; only that those are the facts that the

16

expert has relied on in reaching an opinion?

17

has not been considered to be hearsay.

18

And that

Now, do you argue that those -- that that's

19

incorrect?

Those -- those statements cannot be

20

testified to as an -- by an expert without their

21

constituting either hearsay or testimony within the

22

meaning of the Confrontation Clause?

23

MR. CARROLL:

In this case, where the --

24

where the basis evidence the expert testifies to, where

25

it's -- the expert's opinion depends on that -- those
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statements being considered true, in those instances

2

then, yes, we are arguing that the Confrontation Clause

3

does not allow --

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let's say that -- let

5

me put it this way:

6

the -- the expert testifies, I received the -- I looked

7

at the report from -- from the lab; I looked at the

8

report from -- I looked at the report from Cellmark, the

9

outside lab; I looked at the report that we did; and

10

Let's say the expert -- people from

there -- there is a match.

11

And so, the expert is -- is mentioning facts

12

that form the basis of the opinion but not testifying to

13

the truth of those.

14

Confrontation Clause at that point?

15

Is that a violation of the

MR. CARROLL:

If the -- the expert is not,

16

you know, asserting that the statements are true, then

17

no.

18

Your Honor.

19

However, that's not what happened in this case,
Ms. Lambatos -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it would be utterly

20

irrelevant, would it not, if the statements were not

21

true?

22

about a hypothetical, you know:

23

this, Mr. Expert, what would the result be?

24

those assumptions, it would be this.

25

I mean, it's one thing for an expert to testify
Assuming this, this,
Well, on

But this was not -- nobody asked -- asked
7
Alderson Reporting Company

1

her to assume those things at all.

2

that -- that she had a match between what she had done

3

and what had been done on the -- on the DNA of this

4

individual by somebody else.

5

MR. CARROLL:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

She testified

That's correct.
That seems to me quite

7

different from the -- from the ordinary hypothetical put

8

to an expert.

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:
thought -- yes.

You can -- sorry, go ahead.

11

MR. CARROLL:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

with that.

Yes, I would have

No, I was just going to -You were going to agree

And --

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know.

I mean, I'm sure

16

you've looked at this probably.

But the most -- one of

17

the more interesting things I've found in these briefs

18

were the references to Wigmore.

19

read what Wigmore said about scientific evidence, expert

20

evidence, and business records.

21

concedes and agrees with Justice Scalia, and those

22

opinions are filled with hearsay.

23

24

in college, which reflects dozens of out-of-court

25

statements given to dozens of people who wrote them up

So, I went back and

And he certainly

They are filled with hearsay.

5

6

recognized since the 17th century or earlier to cover

7

that kind of material?

8
9

But Wigmore writes a

So, my question for you is why shouldn't we
recognize a similar, related kind of exception here?

10

We're trying to discover the meaning of "testimonial."

11

The difference here is a police lab or a lab that

12

reports to a police lab.

13

know that there is a fairly good chance that what they

14

say will be used in a criminal trial.

15

it for sure, but they're controlled by the canons, by

16

accreditation, by tests of reliability, by the fact that

17

they're not normally interested in the results of a

18

trial, as here they couldn't care less; they don't even

19

care if it is used in a trial.

20

The individuals there probably

They don't know

And all the Wigmore factors for both

21

exceptions could support a similar exception here, which

22

would have the following virtue:

23

virtue of not requiring 10 people to come in and

24

testify, whom the defense is, of course, free to call;

25

and it would also have the virtue of removing the

It would have the

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

temptation for prosecutors to stop relying on the more

2

reliable evidence, DNA, and instead encourage them to

3

rely on the less reliable evidence; namely, the

4

eyewitness testimony in a case.

5
6

Now, that -- that really is all my questions
in one.

(Laughter.)

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Because I understand every

argument you're making as fitting it in with hearsay.

10

agree with that.

11

testimonial point.

12

and Wigmore provides all the reasons, and since we're

13

interpreting that word "testimonial," don't we have the

14

power, and why shouldn't we create one out of the word

15

"testimonial"?

16

I

And I also agree to a degree with the
And I see the need for an exception,

MR. CARROLL:

Well, Your Honor, because the

17

Confrontation Clause guarantees the defendant the right

18

to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him,

19

and that's the reason why this Court should not make an

20

exception --

21
22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I'll go further in

your direction -JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not objecting to

24

hearsay, are you, counsel?

You're objecting to a

25

violation of the Confrontation Clause -10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. CARROLL:

That's right.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- which is quite different

3

from what -- what Mr. Wigmore was writing about, which

4

was hearsay.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but Wigmore actually

6

believed that the Confrontation Clause simply

7

encapsulated the hearsay rule.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We've said the contrary,

though, haven't we?

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm asking you the

12

question, and I -- I'll go further in your direction.

13

I'll go further, because I would say what about saying

14

this:

15

it isn't a full exception; that if the defendant can

16

show some reason to believe that either the laboratory

17

is not properly accredited, it isn't doing things

18

properly; or that the individual technician has

19

something personal or knows about -- about the defendant

20

that makes it suspect, immediately the presumption that

21

the exception applies disappears, and the prosecutor has

22

to call the -- the witness.

that not only do we recognize the exception, but

23

You can say, well, we shouldn't make that

24

up, but I believe if you go back to the 18th century,

25

you'll discover that your interpretation of the

1

Confrontation Clause was not there.

2

what's basing my question, and I'd like your reaction.

3

It's a long question, considers an exception, and I'd

4

like you to give me your reaction to that.

5

MR. CARROLL:

So -- so, that's

Well, Your Honor, I think that

6

this Court's decisions in Crawford and Melendez-Diaz and

7

Bullcoming largely foreclose on making such an

8

exception.

9
10

The -JUSTICE SCALIA:

from those opinions.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I did, but I --

-- Justice Breyer's

dissent.

16

extending those cases from one individual from a

laboratory being familiar with the results to requiring,

18

in ordinary cases, the calling of what could be up to 10

19

technicians -- I see that as making a sea change in

20

normal criminal law practices, and my motive is as I

21

said:

22

of relying on less reliable eyewitness testimony rather

23

than more reliable technical laboratory DNA-type

24

evidence.

25

I really want to get your response.

I fear it will push the system in the direction

Now, you have my -- I've made the point, and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Carroll, are we

2

talking about 10 witnesses?

3

about just one witness, from Cellmark.

4

MR. CARROLL:

I thought we were talking

Yes, on this record, Your

5

Honor, the -- the statements that were produced were the

6

statements of the authors of the report.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. CARROLL:

So --

That's 1 person, not 10.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

I believe there are two

Well, 10 isn't -- 10 is not

11

a far-fetched hypothetical.

We have an amicus brief

12

from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and the

13

New York City Chief Medical Examiner's Office, and they

14

say that their very fine crime lab involves at least 12

15

technicians in the analysis of DNA.

16

They break it down that way because it

17

increases accuracy; it decreases the chance of any

18

favoritism for the prosecution.

19

it is impossible for us to bring all 12 of those

20

technicians into court to testify in every case in which

21

there is DNA evidence, and if we have to do that, we

22

will just not be able to use DNA evidence in court.

23

practical consequence that we have to accept under

2

MR. CARROLL:

No, Your Honor, because even

3

in the worst-case scenario described in the New York

5

which of those 12 he wants to bring in, whether he wants

question is, whose statement is being presented?

5

given the five steps in the brief, the electrophoresis

6

step, the person who does the DNA typing and determines

7

what alleles are present in the sample, that person

8

probably has to testify because that's really what the

9

results are, what alleles are present.

Now,

The amplification step, the person who, you

know, copies the DNA and tags it -- I don't think that's

question:

Suppose you had two witnesses, one from --

10

11

they both testify.

12

13

match.

14
15

And

And now an expert comes in, and the

Now, there would be no problem at all with
that; is that right?

16

MR. CARROLL:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.
Okay.

So, now we only have

18

one of the lab technicians, and we take away the other

19

lab technician.

20

we have this expert, and she's saying she could do a

21

match, but the question is a match of what?

22

question, right?

And what you are saying is, well, now

23

MR. CARROLL:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

That's the

That's correct, Your Honor.
So, why is that a

Confrontation Clause issue?

Why isn't it just that the

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecutor has failed to prove an element of his case?

2

MR. CARROLL:

It's a Confrontation Clause

3

issue because the prosecution presented the statements

4

of the person who did the analysis on the victim's

5

vaginal swab.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, is that right?

I

7

mean, I thought that the judge here said:

No, I'm not

8

taking this for the truth of the matter asserted; I'm

9

only taking your statements about the lab tests as an

10

indication, as -- as the basis for your opinion.

11

I'm listening to your opinion.

12

So,

The problem is in this whole case, there has

13

been no factual testimony about what the results were

14

from the swab on the victim.

15

MR. CARROLL:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. CARROLL:

Isn't that right?

Well -Or am I missing something?

stated he was not considering the evidence for its

22

facts, he states that he was convinced of the -- that

23

there was a match because the evidence from the experts

25

found on the victim.

3

4

If he wasn't considering

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what did the Illinois

5

appellate court say about that, about whether the

6

information was -- whether the evidence was admitted for

7

the truth of the matter asserted?

8
9

MR. CARROLL:

The appellate court held, as a

matter of Illinois law, these statements -- statements

10

that serve as the basis of an expert's opinion are

11

generally deemed not to be admitted for their truth.

12

However, in this case, there's no meaningful

13

distinction between considering Cellmark's statements

14

to -- you know, in assisting the evaluation of Lambatos'

15

testimony and considering it for its truth.

16

statements weren't true, then Lambatos' testimony would

17

not link Williams' DNA to the crime.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the

Isn't -- but isn't Justice

19

Kagan's question there the correct question?

Isn't that

20

a question of Illinois evidence law, not a Federal

21

constitutional question?

22

MR. CARROLL:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, Your Honor.
Was there sufficient -- was

a sufficient foundation laid for the introduction of the

here isn't whether the State's evidence was sufficient.

6

It's whether the evidence the State did present violated

7

Mr. Williams' rights under the Confrontation Clause.

8

Now, this -- I can give an example or an

the DNA there, and this is what we got back.

MR. CARROLL:

Well, Your Honor,

21

hypothetically, the State could -- I believe the State

22

could present its evidence through circumstantial

MR. CARROLL:

MR. CARROLL:

And as long as there is

I do not believe so, Your

5

Honor.

Had -- had Cellmark's statements been presented

6

in the report itself, the report being admitted itself,

7

I think there would be no question that that was a --

8

that would be a violation of the clause under

Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming.

The fact that the same

statements were coming in for the same evidentiary

change that situation.

It's the same statements coming

Bullcoming, where they had somebody from the lab testify

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

2

Sandra Lambatos's testimony really has to be

3

analyzed as having two components to it.

4

component is the match, the match between the data

to that component of her testimony, she's a live

issue.

11

But as several members of the Court have

12

pointed out, that testimony is entirely irrelevant and

13

nonprobative unless it can be linked to the semen that

14

was taken from the victim and that was subsequently

15

analyzed to generate a DNA profile.

16

Illinois State law provides that her testimony cannot

17

prove for the truth of the matter asserted what Cellmark

18

did.

19

gives the basis for her testimony, things that Cellmark

20

said and have them be taken for the truth --

As to that issue,

She cannot repeat on the witness stand, when she

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, Mr. Dreeben, she

22

did repeat what Cellmark said.

23

State's attorney whether, if she had read the data

report from the laboratory analysis, would that have

25

been a violation of the Confrontation Clause?

I asked your -- the

Alderson Reporting Company

Not

1

clear.

She says, only if you admitted it.

2

But in fact that's what she did.

If you

3

read her testimony -- I give you an example at page

4

79 -- she tells on cross-examination exactly what the

5

steps were in the Cellmark report, what numbers they

6

gave, and she tells and explains -- she -- the State's

7

attorney took pride in this -- she said, I disagree with

8

that number that they came up with; I think the number

9

should be....

10

So, she's really reading the report.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, first of all, Justice

12

Sotomayor, that did come in on cross-examination, and I

13

don't think that Petitioner is contending that evidence

14

that he himself elicits on cross-examination --

15

I think, because she clearly did link the DNA that she

compared to the blood DNA to the semen that was sent to

2

Cellmark, and I think that several members of the Court

3

have raised the question, is she implicitly thereby

4

repeating what Cellmark said and then making Cellmark

5

the out-of-court witness?

6

My answer to that is twofold.

First of all,

as a matter of Illinois State law, she could not do

MR. DREEBEN:

And this brings me to my

13

second reason for saying that this is not a

14

Confrontation Clause problem.

15

It's in essence what the Chief Justice

16

described and what Justice Alito referred to as the

17

circumstantial way in which the factfinder can infer

18

that Cellmark tested the DNA in the semen that was sent

19

to it.

20

semen goes out to the lab; there's a shipping manifest

21

that shows that it comes back.

2

case if it doesn't produce a witness from the lab who

3

can attest to the fact that the lab did what it was

4

supposed to do and conducted a properly authorized DNA

5

examination.

6

circumstantial showing of we sent the material out --

7

The State may have a very weak

It has to get by with the very skimpy

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, it -- it doesn't

8

though.

It could have -- could it have a witness saying

9

Cellmark is the nation's foremost DNA testing

10

laboratory; they hire only people who have Ph.D.'s in

11

DNA testing?

I mean, is that all right?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Yes.

Yes.
The State can make

its case a lot stronger --

15

MR. DREEBEN:

And it did that here by saying

16

that Cellmark is an accredited laboratory and Sandra

17

Lambatos participated in designing proficiency

18

examination.

19

that she had no idea what Cellmark actually did in this

20

case.

21

that she drew are what enable her to say my opinion is

22

there is a match between the DNA in the semen and the

23

DNA in the blood.

24
25

But she had to admit on cross-examination

She could draw inferences.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the inferences

As you understand our

precedents, would this have been a stronger or a weaker
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case if a representative, an employee, of Cellmark had

2

come and said, although I didn't do this sample, I want

3

to tell you how our procedures work and why we're a

4

respectable lab, et cetera, et cetera?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

It would have been relatively

6

stronger had a witness been able to actually come from

7

Cellmark and validate that Cellmark is an accredited

8

laboratory and conducts procedures in a certain way.

9

But the crucial point here --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, if no

11

expert from either lab came in, if an expert had the

12

Cellmark information and the Illinois State Police

13

information, not offered for the truth of the matter,

14

and came in and said, I matched this and I matched that,

15

and it's the defendant -- could that have been done?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Only if as a matter of State

17

law there was a sufficient foundation for the factfinder

18

to conclude that the DNA actually came from the blood

19

and the DNA came from the semen.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Dreeben, that seems to

21

me -- I mean, we have a Confrontation Clause which

22

requires that the witnesses against the defendant appear

23

and testify personally.

24

here is the testing of the semen found on the swab.

25

That is -- that's the crux of this evidence.

And -- and the crucial evidence

46
Alderson Reporting Company

And you're

Official

1

telling me that this Confrontation Clause allows you to

2

simply say, well, we're not going to bring in the person

3

who did the test; we're simply going to say this is a

4

reliable lab.

5
6

I don't know how that complies with the
Confrontation Clause.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

The Confrontation Clause,

8

Justice Scalia, does not obligate the State to present a

9

strong case.

It does not prevent the State from

10

presenting a relatively weaker case, so long as it does

11

not rely on testimonial statements to prove the truth of

12

the matter asserted.

13

This Court held, in Bruton v. United States,

14

that there is a very narrow exception to the almost

15

invariable presumption that juries will follow the

16

instructions that they're given.

17

to take evidence for the truth of the matter asserted,

18

they are presumed to follow that instruction.

19

Illinois State law supplies that filter.

20

If they are told not

Here

Everything that the judge heard, he filtered

21

through Illinois State law that says the basis for the

22

expert's opinion doesn't prove its truth.

23

gave up the right to say you can believe that this DNA

24

report is reliable and trustworthy because Cellmark says

25

so.

So, the State

The State doesn't get that benefit, and as a result
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of not getting that benefit, it is not obligated to

2

treat Cellmark as if it's a witness.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Cellmark --

I suppose the problem is,

4

Mr. Dreeben, that if the -- if the State put up Ms.

5

Lambatos and Ms. Lambatos had to say I did a match -- I

6

was given two reports; there was a match, but I have no

7

idea where this other report came from; you know, it

8

might have been from the victim, but it might not have

9

been; I don't have a clue -- the State would never have

10

put that prosecution on, because the State would have

11

understood that there was no case there.

12

The State is relying on the fact that people

13

will take what Ms. Lambatos says about what she knows

14

about where the report came from as a fact, as the truth

15

of the matter, that in fact this report did come from

16

the victim.

17

saying you can't consider this except for the truth of

18

the matter asserted.

And so, the jury can be given instructions

19

But it's a bit of a cheat, no?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

I think, Justice Kagan,

21

when you consider the things that this Court has held

22

juries can properly apply limiting instructions to, they

23

can hear the fact that evidence was seized from the

24

defendant, marijuana was found at his house.

25

defendant gets up on the stand and says, no, it wasn't.

The State can introduce that marijuana to impeach his

That -MR. DREEBEN:

There's no instruction here,

10

Justice Scalia, because this is a bench trial.

And in a

bench trial, the judge is presumed to follow the law,

12

and as my colleague read to the Court --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, we simply have a

14

presumption even though -- even though the court's
