ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Our case is about whether the claim of

12

liability is, in a fundamental sense, class-wide or

13

individual.

14

sold in reliance on a misleading statement.

15

question at the class cert stage is whether each

16

individual will have to prove his own reliance directly

17

on the statement, or whether every -- he can prove

18

indirectly reliance on the statement by showing that

19

everybody relied on a distorted market price.

20

The heart of a 10b-5 claim is I bought or
The

A market price will reflect a statement if

21

and only if the statement is material and is made

22

publicly on an efficient market.

23

materiality, the market price cannot be presumed to

24

reflect the statement in question.

25

plaintiffs --

So, absent

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why -- why is

2

that -- why is that the case?

3

there's no materiality, that means that the effect on

4

the market price just happens to be zero.

MR. WAXMAN:

I would suppose, if

That's exactly correct.

And

the point here is -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why isn't that

common to all parties?
MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, every one of

10

the four predicates to the fraud-on-the-market theory,

11

which is a shortcut that -- that excuses plaintiffs from

12

proving that I heard the statement and relied on it --

13

every one of those predicates is common.

14

Whether the market is efficient is common.

15

Whether the statement is public is common.

16

stocks were bought and sold during the period of market

17

distortion is common.

And materiality is common.

18

The question is not whether --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Whether the

So is the falsity of the

statement common as well?
MR. WAXMAN:

The falsity of the statement is

22

common, but it is not a predicate to whether or not you

23

can prove reliance on a statement indirectly by relying

24

on the integrity of the market price because, in an

25

efficient market, material public statements, whether
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they are true or false, will presumably move the market

2

price.

3

false --

And if you're trying to prove reliance on a

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can -- can an individual

5

who has -- it has been deemed in -- in a cert 


6

certification, that an issue is immaterial, could an 


7

individual claimant ever prove it's material? 


8

MR. WAXMAN:

Sure.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not arguing --

On the 


10

truth-on-the-market -- the truth-in-the-market defense,

11

which is the type of defense that you're raising here.

12
13

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

Either way.

Let me

explain why.

14

There's no doubt that this Court's standard

15

for materiality, announced in TSC v. Northway and since

16

reiterated, is an objective standard.

17

on who the relier was.

18

It doesn't depend

But the inability to prove to a certifying

19

judge that class-wide reliance can be -- that class-wide

20

reliance exists because the statement was material

21

doesn't preclude a plaintiff like Connecticut

22

Retirement, which has said it's going to proceed whether

23

there's a class or not, or any other member of the

24

class, from coming to court and saying, either, I

25

directly relied on this statement, and here's my proof
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it's material to the trier-of-fact, because the 


2

decision that the judge makes at certification is not 


3

binding on the trier-of-fact; or even to say, I relied 


4

on the integrity of the market price, and I have proof 


5

that the market price was affected because here are 


6

three investors, they're all reasonable people, and they 


7

say that it was relevant -- important to them in the 


8

total mix of information involved. 

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

I'm sorry --


Mr. Waxman, that's just to

11

say that you -- a plaintiff can always relitigate the question

12

of materiality.

13

isn't it correct that, if the Court holds that a

14

statement is immaterial, it's immaterial for all members

15

of the class, and the suit has to be dismissed?

16

that right?

17

But at the class certification stage,

MR. WAXMAN:

The suit cannot -- that is, the

18

suit cannot proceed as a class action.

19

Retirement or any --

20

Isn't

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Connecticut

It can't proceed as an

21

anything action, can it?

22

you had thought that the -- the statement was

23

immaterial, is not to say, I won't approve a class.

24

would be to say, the suit has no merit.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean, the -- the remedy, if

I -- I think that's wrong.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

It

I

Official

1

think that's conceptually wrong, Justice Kagan, in the

2

sense that all that the class certification decision

3

says is that the putative class representative can sue

4

on his own behalf, but he can't drag everybody else into

5

the --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you mean to say

7

that a judge, who has just ruled that a statement is

8

immaterial, is going to keep the case in his court,

9

litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's

10
11

just ruled that the statement is immaterial?
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I want to -- I'd like to

12

come back to the question of why whether, even if

13

your -- the premise of your question is correct, it

14

doesn't matter for this case.

15

run at -- at your premise.

16

But let me take one more

The next thing that would happen if I'm

17

right, presumably, and the case isn't over, the class

18

just isn't certified, is the defendant -- you know,

19

emboldened by the judge's rule, will file a motion for

20

summary judgment on the grounds that materiality -- the

21

element of the substantive offense, not materiality, the

22

predicate to class certification -- has just been

23

determined in favor of me.

24

question for the Court.

25

That is a very different

Materiality, as this Court has said, is
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fact-sensitive, and it involves a balancing of

2

credibility of witnesses or of expert opinions, and the

3

judge at the -- at the class cert stage, has to find

4

facts and has to make a ruling.

5

When it comes up on summary judgment, what

6

the -- if there is a dispute of material facts, what the

7

judge should do under the law is to say, look, I just

8

held that I didn't think it was material, but I resolved

9

disputed material facts, and that's for the jury, and

10

this case will go to the jury.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you're saying that a

12

judge on a class certification stage can say, this is

13

immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this

14

can't proceed as a class action.

15

judgment motion comes in, arguing the exact same thing,

16

the judge will say, oh, it's not immaterial after all,

17

or it's disputed enough, that the case can -- can

18

continue?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

But when a summary

Well, in some cases if -- if

20

the alleged fact is -- you know, that Amgen's president

21

law.

3

These are flagship

On the other hand, the evidence we wanted to

4

introduce and the judge wouldn't hear because, in the

5

Ninth Circuit, the test is not proving facts, but simply

6

alleging them --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess the question,

8

Mr. Waxman, is if it is not immaterial as a matter of

9

law, at the summary judgment stage, how could a judge

10

possibly say it is material at the class certification

11

stage?

12

MR. WAXMAN:

The judge at the class

13

certification stage is required to weigh competing

14

evidence and -- and render his or her best judgment.

15

the summary judgment stage, a judge is precluded from

16

doing that.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. WAXMAN:

stage becomes kind of a super merits inquiry?

At

MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

issue?

And the judge simply

That is the key through the certification gate

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought we were talking

8

about, Mr. Waxman, the materiality of the alleged

9

misstatement, and I am really nonplussed by your answer

10

that, if the judge says it's immaterial, that doesn't

11

end it for everybody.

12

it for the class; you said that.

13

for the representative of the class to say, okay, now

14

I'm going to come back, and this statement, -this

15

finding of the immateriality doesn't bind me.

16

Certainly, it should -- it ends
Should it also end it

Of course, it's going to bind the class

17

representative.

18

And if it is material, then it is material to everybody

19

in the class.

20

So if it's immaterial, the case ends.

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, let's

21

take an easier case.

Let's say I'm somebody who bought

22

Amgen during the relevant period, and they -- the judge

23

says -- you know, I've heard your -- I've considered

24

your event studies, and I think that this is --

information isn't material.

There is nothing whatsoever that precludes

2

me from bringing a suit and saying, here's my

evidence of materiality.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How could that be -Are you saying that

10

MR. WAXMAN:

The -- the standard of --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that if there was

13

fraud on the market, that is a materiality question

14

addressed at the certification stage, but if the class

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do the first part.

11

Alderson Reporting Company

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Materiality -- the quirk

3

of this case is that materiality is both -- as all my

4

friends on the other side agree, an essential predicate

5

of the fraud-on-the-market theory, that is the essential

6

predicate of the ability to prove indirect reliance on

7

the statement through an assertion that the market

8

price -- that the statement distorted the market price.

9

Everyone agrees that, if the statement isn't

10

material, it didn't distort the market price, and

11

therefore, reliance is an individualized issue for those

12

who actually heard and detrimentally relied on the

13

statement.

14

One of the elements that has to be proven in

15

a 10b-5 case is reliance, which is what we were talking

16

about on the class cert stage, and there, materiality is

17

a predicate for reliance.

18

proven, materiality is also an element of a 10b-5(b)

19

cause of action, and the standard for materiality is the

20

same.

21

But even if reliance is

The real question in this case is what is

22

the purpose of Rule 23?

If you think that the purpose

23

of Rule 23 is to postpone to the merits everything that

24

can be postponed without a risk of foreclosing valid

25

individual claims, we lose.

But that's not the purpose.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The purpose is for a court to determine whether all of

2

the preconditions for forcing everyone into a class

3

action are present before you certify.

4
5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or you can take exactly

what you said and phrase it the opposite way.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

But I wouldn't.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

You can say – No I know is

8

it the purpose of the certification stage to try out every

9

element of liability at that stage, rather than waiting

10

for the trial?

11

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Now, once you say that, what you have said

No, it's not.

Good.

14

is, you know, it could still be material for some

15

individual, even though there is no market reliance.

16

And similarly, a silence going (indicating), some odd

17

set of words or whatever it is, although it's not false

18

for almost anybody, for some particular person, it could

19

seem -- convey something false in some particular set of

20

circumstances.

21

So let's try out falsity at the

22

certification stage, too.

In fact, let's try out

23

everything because we could always think of a few

24

examples where, despite the fact that -- you know, that

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's only a common issue 99 percent of the time, we can

2

dream up a situation where it's not a common issue.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Breyer, the point of

4

class certification is not to pre-try the merits of the

5

case.

6

What -JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but you are saying with

7

a cert -- class certification here, if there is no

8

materiality, there is no class; and you are repeatedly

9

faced with the question, you are absolutely right; in

10

fact, there is no case.

11

and indeed, I have a few instances here in which there

12

could be a case, and I’d say, I bet if we are -- you

13

know, professorial enough, we could dream up a

14

hypothetical for anything, where there still is a case.
MR. WAXMAN:

15

And so then what you say is,

The point of the class

16

certification, as this Court explained in Amchem and

17

other cases, and as the Rules Advisory Committee notes,

18

is the question of whether there is class coherence in

19

the first place.

20

whether it's fair for the class representative to impose

21

on the defendant the juggernaut of class action and on

22

the absent class members their fortunes in his or her

23

hands.

24
25

It's not the merits issue.

It's

And what -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman, that is exactly

right, and that's what we said in Wal-Mart recently, that

rule on the issue, do you rule on each of the claims in

13

one stroke?

14

15

Official

1

question common to the class; that is, the question of

2

materiality.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

The answer, Justice Ginsburg,

4

is that the question at the class certification stage --

5

the predominance question is the reliance element, not

6

the materiality element.

7

Everyone agrees that materiality, like

8

falsity, like scienter, like loss causation, are all

9

common questions.

As this Court explained in Basic and

10

reiterated last term in Halliburton, in 10b-5 actions,

11

the question at class certification is whether reliance

12

needs to be proven directly; that is, individually by

13

people who heard and acted in response; or whether the

14

shortcut that this Court authorized in Basic of allowing

15

indirect proof by proving that the statement caused a

16

distortion of the market, is the way to go.

17

There are two tracks, and it happens in this

18

case that materiality is both an element, which is

19

common, and a predicate to class-wide reliance.

20

Everyone agrees that there -- you can't rely as a class

21

on the -- the challenged misstatement, unless the

22

statement moved or had the capability of moving the

23

market price.

24

glue that holds --

What is that statement,

MR. WAXMAN:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because the difference is if

8

there is an unefficient market, the case goes forward,

9

and people have to prove individual reliance, and that

10

means that the class splits apart, and you don't get a

11

coherent class.

12

an argument either on publicity or on the efficient

13

market is that the class becomes incoherent, that

14

everybody then has to prove individual reliance.

So the function of -- of your winning

19

When you prove immateriality, the whole

MR. WAXMAN:

That's not correct, and in any

20

event, that analysis -- that approach is, as I was

21

trying to say, is like letting the fruits justify the

22

search.

23

The question is -- at the time that class

24

certification is sought, the question is do common

25

issues predominate?

And the question, in a securities
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case, is, is reliance in fact -- to quote this Court's

2

opinion, "in fact, a common issue?"

3

You also have to prove -- to show that, in fact,

4

it's a common issue, you have to show that the market

5

reacted to the statement, whether it was true or false,

6

whether it was made with scienter or not, whether there

7

was loss causation or not, the market had to react, and

8

to do that, you need all three legs of a stool.

9

The statement has to be material because

10

immaterial statements don't move markets.

common issue, regardless of what you have to show down

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, you seem to

15

be setting up two determinations of materiality.

You

16

say, in order to certify the class, you have to show

17

that the misrepresentation was material.

18

to win on the merits, you certainly have to show that

19

the misrepresentation was material.

And in order

How do those two findings of materiality

20
21

differ?

22

at the certification stage differ from the finding that

23

must be made at the trial?

24
25

How does the finding that you say must be made

MR. WAXMAN:

They differ temporally, they

differ functionally, and they differ in terms of who
21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decides it and with what level of finality.

2

temporally because the first question is, is this

3

case going to -- which of two tracks is this case going

4

to proceed?

5

They differ

Is it going to proceed as a -- as a direct

6

reliance case -- I heard the statement, and I relied on

7

it -- or is it going to proceed on a theory on behalf of

8

everybody that whether -- the people who relied on it,

9

the people who heard it or who didn't hear it, on a

10

theory that the -- we rely on the integrity of the

11

market, and the integrity of the market was impaired if

12

the statement was false.

13

In any event, there was a price effect.

14

there isn't a price effect if the statement wasn't

15

material and made publicly into an efficient market.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

But I’m still -- what --

17

what does "material" mean at the trial level, what does

18

"material" mean at the certification?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

Material means, at both, as

20

this Court said, that there is a substantial likelihood

21

that the information would have been viewed by a

22

reasonable investor as having significantly altered the

23

total mix of information available.

That is the test.

So it's the same

trial?

That's correct.

Just like the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The class certification process determines

16

whether the case can generate common answers for all

17

class members.

18

So for three reasons --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why don't you answer the

19

question that was asked earlier, if Basic set forth a

20

presumption, and are you disputing that, at the class

21

certification stage, a defendant can prove that the

22

market is inefficient?

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Yes.
So why shouldn't we hold

Basic to its position that all of its presumptions can
23

Alderson Reporting Company

1

be rebutted as well, not just efficiency?

2

out efficiency as the one issue that can be rebutted?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Why do we set

There is a lot to said about

4

Basic, and let me just start the ball rolling by making

5

these observations.

6

distinguish between the requisites of Rule 23 and the

7

substantive component of the fraud-on-the-market theory.

8

And that's important because, in that case, the court

9

remanded for a redetermination of materiality, but it

10
11

First, Basic did not try to

upheld the class certification order.
So in the context of Basic, the court seemed

12

to be thinking there was a difference between what

13

needed to be proved for class certification and what

14

would need to be proved on the merits of the case.

15

Now, the second thing to be said is that

16

Basic needs to be read against the backdrop of Rule 23

17

and especially this Court's recent decision in

18

Wal-Mart v. Dukes.

19

a common answer for all class members, it is the

20

quintessential common issue that does not splinter the

21

class or cause it to be noncohesive for purposes of

22

understanding predominance.

23

Because materiality always generates

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Doesn't -- doesn't that

24

assume that the efficient market theory is always

25

relevant to materiality?

And there might be instances
24


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in which there is subjective reliance, which we inquire

2

into, that is objectively reasonable, but that does not

3

involve a fraud on the market?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Only in a hypothetical case,

5

Justice Kennedy.

6

important point that I can try to make today.

7

fraud-on-the-market case, the idea of reliance -- the

8

only theory of reliance that is being advanced is

9

indirect reliance on the integrity of the market.

10

And this is the absolute most
In a

There

is no other theory of reliance.

11

Why do we know that in this case?

For two

12

reasons:

First, the Connecticut Retirement System could

13

not be the class representative, if it did not meet the

14

typicality requirement of Rule 23(a), which the district

15

court found -- this is on page 25A of the petition

16

appendix -- and has not been challenged subsequently.

17

But why doesn't Connecticut have a direct

18

reliance theory?

We know they don't because they have a

19

fiduciary duty to their investors to apply whatever

20

theory they have of securities fraud.

21

this case -- and this is, by far, clear in the

22

run-of-the-mine fraud-on-the-market case, that the class

23

representative will only establish reliance indirectly,

24

by showing that the integrity of the market was

25

impaired.
25

Alderson Reporting Company

So we know in

And so their construct is an entirely

2

hypothetical and theoretical one.

3

arise in the real world of fraud-on-the-market cases.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It simply does not

Mr. Frederick, you -- you

5

say that -- you know, it's a flukey hypothetical

6

where -- where the -- the issue here would -- would come

7

up again in a different context in an individual suit.

8

Let -- let me give you a -- a case that's -- that's not

9

flukey and hypothetical.

That is, it is usually the

10

case that -- that people who are allegedly defrauded in

11

stocks rely upon the fact that they bought it at an --

12

at an inflated price or sold it at a depressed price.

13

Both of those questions depend upon the efficiency of

14

the market.

15

If the market is not efficient, a question

16

that has to be decided for the class certification case,

17

the individual investor is not going to be able to say,

18

you know, that's -- that's why I got cheated, because

19

the market reflected this false statement, and I paid

20

more money for the stock than I should have.

21

that is not a flukey hypothetical.

22

happen in most individual cases.

23

of the efficiency of the market has to be decided at the

24

class certification stage.

25

MR. FREDERICK:

That --

That is what will
And yet, that question

Alderson Reporting Company

1

have to know are all the investors standing in the same

2

position.

3

absorbing information into the price, all investors will

4

have the same question with respect to materiality.

5

If the market is efficient and it is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could say the same

6

about materiality.

7

reflected in -- in the market.

8
9

If it's immaterial, it isn't

MR. FREDERICK:

They all lose on the merits,

if there is no materiality.

The question about

10

efficiency, Justice Scalia, and the reason why it is

11

advanced at class certification is because it serves a

12

gatekeeping role in determining whether all the

13

investors can show indirect reliance on the market.

14

the -- if the stock is thinly traded, there are no

15

public analysts, there are no stock reports given about

16

it, and no one knows exactly why is the price being

17

determined, that creates exactly the kind of individual

18

issues that would predominate in a securities fraud

19

case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

If

So -- so the difference you

21

assert is that, with respect to the issue here, it will

22

be an issue in all individual cases; whereas with regard

23

to the efficiency of the market, it will only be an

24

issue in -- what, 95 percent of -- of the individual

25

cases?
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. FREDERICK:

No, the question is:

Does

2

efficiency serve as a means of determining are all the

3

investors similarly situated?

4

class?

5

they -- they conceded this question in their answer and

6

they did not challenge the expert that was put in the

7

district court on the question of efficiency, so that

8

question's

Are they a cohesive

If the market is not efficient -- and mind you,

9

really not in this case.
But in the case that you're hypothesizing,

10

Justice Scalia, efficiency serves the gatekeeping

11

function of determining are all the investors similarly

12

situated, so that indirect reliance can be a -- a method

13

of showing that predicate for a common answer to be

14

determined at trial.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

MR. FREDERICK:

17
18

Could we --

Publicity serves the same

function.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could we get a

19

hypothetical that I actually think could occur, which is

20

not a truth-on-the-market defense, but a known truth to

21

the individual person seeking certification.

22

it's immaterial to that person because they were told

23

this information by someone and still trading.

24

that defense be available at certification?

25

MR. FREDERICK:

So that is

Would

I think it -- where it gets
28


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appropriately done is the adequacy and typicality prongs

2

of Rule 23(a) because that person has a different

3

factual basis for attempting to assert a securities

4

fraud, and that person is not typical of the class and

5

so therefore would not meet the typicality requirement

6

of 23(a).

7

Now, it is possible, certainly, that in

8

other cases, there might be investors out there who do

9

have a direct reliance theory, but they are protected by

10

Rule 23 in a couple of ways.

11

their own case, and they can say, I directly relied on

12

Amgen's misstatements and the false things that they

13

said about their flagship products, and I, therefore,

14

have my own 10b-5 case.

and they think they have a direct reliance theory, they

16

can opt out of the class.

One is they can bring

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is true, but I'm --

I'm -- I'm trying to work out what, as I understand it

19

now, Mr. Waxman's point is -- is basically this:

20

That -- that why do we use an efficient market theory?

21

We use it because if the market is efficient and the

statement is public, then someone who bought over the

market is buying in a -- in a world that reflects the

false statement.

case.

5

it wasn't material, then our theory of market

6

reliance -- market -- efficient markets goes out the

window because you can have all the efficiency in the

something to a reasonable stockbroker is irrelevant, his

But also, it is a feature of materiality that, if

And therefore, although there

that -- so what's your direct answer to that?

17

And -- and I don't hope it is, if I've

My direct answer to that is

18

that materiality still serves as a common answer.

But, Justice Scalia, I think

that the issue that you want to decide or you think that

you want to decide is what constitutes the efficiency of

the market, and that is a hotly litigated issue in many

11

securities cases.

this one.

the stock that is at issue before you.

saying, in this kind of case, the -- the materiality or

not is not likely to be specially sufficient --

if it is a common issue, and there is no reason to

You -- you are saying

that, if everyone loses, if it's not material, that's a

9

common issue, and therefore, the trial court at the

10

certification stage does not have to determine it.

MR. FREDERICK:

No, what I'm saying is that

it is -- because it is a common question, it is not one

to be decided at class certification.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just like

I'm not sure how that's

16

different from what I said.

17

words, you are saying that market efficiency is just

18

presumed, and everybody wins or everybody loses, and so

19

you can have a class action, even though the trial judge

20

is convinced that there is no adequate common market

21

theory to support the common -- the common injury.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

But in other -- in other

That's not our position.

23

question.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick, you say --

3

you say, you point out, quite rightly, that the

4

efficiency of the market was conceded -- was conceded

5

below.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was not challenged.

8

Except that now, in -- in Amgen's brief, there is a

9

suggestion that the efficiency of the market is a more

10

sophisticated question.

11

I think is what they said -- it isn't that it's either

12

efficient or it's not efficient; it depends on other

13

factors.

14

And it's not my note -- binary,

MR. FREDERICK:

It's a new concoction they

had not argued before this stage of the briefing in

17

18

that may have some subsidiary materiality effect are

19

going to be able to show that there was some consequence

to the market.

is still a common question, even if there are these

22

subsidiary inefficiencies --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

this, your answer -- which I am trying to follow it;

efficiency of the market, that's not a traditional

element of a tort --

special to get into this theory.

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

matter, that is not traditionally a common element of

9

the tort.

10

That is something special to get into this

theory.

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Correct.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

With materiality, it is a

13

common element of the tort always; it is traditionally

14

there; it will be litigated, so there is no special

15

reason to or desirability in or need for litigating at

16

the outset.

17

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

And

18

Congress recognized that there were issues concerning

19

these various elements.

20

it enacted the PSLRA, it addressed scienter by imposing

21

a heightened pleading requirement and loss causation,

it chose not to.

MS. SHERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

2

predominate over individual issues.

3

The only question is whether common issues

As several of the justices have recognized,

4

materiality is an objective inquiry, it leads to a

5

common answer, and that common answer unites the class,

6

rather than divides it.

7

class members can proceed together on the

8

fraud-on-the-market theory.

If materiality is shown, the

pointed out earlier, so is efficiency or nonefficiency.

MS. SHERRY:

And the difference --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that -- that

13

differentiation, articulating it that way, doesn't move

14

the ball.
MS. SHERRY:

15

I would disagree with that

16

because the difference is with efficiency and with

17

publicity.

the class may divide.

19

the market is inefficient, individual class members can

make out claims of direct reliance.

3

100 percent, that's -- that's the basic difference?

4

So -- you know, 95 percent instead of

MS. SHERRY:

The -- the purpose of the class

5

certification stage with respect to predominance is to

6

weigh the common issues against individual issues.

7

with respect to market efficiency -- excuse me -- market

8

efficiency and publicity, those are two matters that --

9

that either bind the class together or divide them.

And

To

10

the extent the market is inefficient or to the extent

11

the statements are not public, they are not all getting

12

the information from the same source.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

They are preconditions --

14

they are preconditions, not related to the merits, that

15

do, in fact, justify the use of a special reliance

theory.

17

materiality.

Now, I've said that; of course, so is

18

MS. SHERRY:

But --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

But materiality, unlike the

20

other two, is part of the element of the basic case,

21

where it is a common issue in this case -- and in

22

most -- to everybody.

MS. SHERRY:

And that is exactly right.

the difference is -JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that exactly right?

Because I am getting the -- facing the problem a few

2

minutes from now, somebody is going to say, well, why is

3

that exactly right?

4

I mean, it is a precondition.

MS. SHERRY:

I am going to say it's exactly

5

right because the confusion here is that materiality in

6

a fraud-on-the-market case serves two purposes.

7

predicate to the fraud-on-the-market theory, but it is

8

also an independent, separate element.

9

Petitioners would have this Court do is isolate the two

inquiries when they're really the same question.

11

It is asking the same question that leads to

12

the same answer, and it's one that unites the class.

13

There's -- Petitioners phrase the question as whether

14

reliance --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you have the same

16

question, then maybe we shouldn't have this

17

fraud-on-the-market theory because the whole purpose of

19

was -- was damaged and relied -- because you can rely on

20

an efficient market.

21

22

misrepresentation.

23

But you can only rely on an

So maybe we should overrule Basic because it

24

was certainly based upon a theory that -- that simply

25

collapses once you remove the materiality element.
41

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. SHERRY:

The fraud-on-the-market theory,

2

however, is a substantive theory.

It's not a procedural

3

doctrine.

4

is it allows classes to be certified, but it's a means

5

of proving reliance in an impersonal market in which

6

investors trade today.

To be sure, one of the practical consequences

7

What the Court did in Basic was adapt the

8

direct reliance concept which envisioned face-to-face

9

transactions to the impersonal market.

And so with

10

respect to actually proving a fraud on the market,

11

you're absolutely right, but what we're talking about

12

here is not whether a fraud on the market can be proven;

13

we're talking about whether common issues predominate

14

over individual issues.
And Petitioners still fail to point to any

15
16

individual issue that would come into play in a case

17

where materiality is not able to be shown.

18

because materiality would kill the case for all.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

None would

Materiality is a common

20

issue.

21

the fraud-on-the-market theory.

22

And you are using the one, which is a common issue, to

23

leapfrog into the second, to make the -- the efficiency

24

of the market reasoning something that it isn't.

25

Reliance is only a common issue if you accept

MS. SHERRY:

That's the problem.

With all due respect, the two
42


Alderson Reporting Company

1

really do collapse into one.

2

the market is efficient and once you've proven that the

3

statements are public, you're asking the same question.

4

You can call it reliance, or you can call it

5

materiality.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Once you've proven that

Well, that then -- that

7

imparts the question of 24 years of economic

8

scholarship -- I think that's how long it's been since

9

Basic was decided -- has shown that the -- the efficient

10

market theory is -- is really -- really an

11

overgeneralization.

12

that and so you have an advanced theory.

13

us to ignore that.

14

It could be much more subtle than

MS. SHERRY:

But you want

No, I -- a couple responses to

15

that.

16

which is that market efficiency isn't disputed here.

17

was conceded in the answer at paragraph 199.

18

only is it not -- is it not contested here, Petitioners

19

actually embrace an efficient market, in

20

order to pursue their truth-on-the-market defense.

21

The first one is the one that my colleague made,
It

And not

And so my first response would be that's not

22

something to be addressed in this case.

And my second

23

response is Basic didn't adopt any particular economic

24

model of market efficiency.

25

of Basic, if you look at footnote 28 of Basic, the Court

If you look at footnote 24

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

makes very clear that it's not adopting an economic 


2

theory, as far as how quickly or completely the 


3

information is incorporated into the market price. 

Instead, it was looking at congressional 


4
5

intent, it was looking at difficulties in direct proof,

6

and it was looking at common sense to reach a result and

7

again to adapt a reliance theory that was premised on

8

face-to-face transactions to the impersonal market that

9

exists today.
And so, again, I wouldn't consider market

10
11

efficiency in this case.

It's not presented.

To the

12

extent there's questions about how the determinations

13

should be made in terms of levels of generality, that's

14

something that the lower courts can decide.
Today, all we're talking about is the

15
16

materiality component and, again, focusing on whether or

17

not common issues predominate over individual issues.

18

It's a comparative inquiry.

19

common issues on the one hand and individual issues on

20

the other.

21

individual issues that will actually come into play as

22

the case is litigated.

23

It requires comparing

And Petitioners have not identified any

The -- going to the -- some of the policy

24

concerns that were raised, I'd make a couple points.

25

One is the one that my colleague made.
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Congress

Official

1

addressed those policy concerns in the PSLRA, in SLUSA,

2

and it chose to address them through different means.

3

The second point I would make is the same

4

argument could be made with respect to the other

5

elements of the securities fraud cause of action.

6

the argument is you should have to prove it at class

7

certification because, otherwise, the case is going to

8

settle, you could say the same thing with respect to

9

scienter, with respect to falsity, with respect to loss

If

10

causation, which this Court in Erica John, of course,

11

said did not have to be proven at the class

12

certification stage.

13

So in short, it proves too much.

The third response is that there are

14

countervailing policy concerns, and there are

15

countervailing concerns that are actually tethered to

16

Rule 23 in terms of efficiency.

17

Excuse me.

Petitioners --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you -- do you

19

agree that you have to show materiality to rely on the

20

fraud-on-the-market theory to establish reliance?

21
22
23

MS. SHERRY:
merits, yes.

As a substantive matter on the

It is a predicate.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I don't

24

understand why that is.

If you're trying to show

25

reliance, and you show that it's an efficient market,
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and that the information was -- was public, doesn't that

2

show reliance without regard to whether the statement's

3

material or not?

4

MS. SHERRY:

I think, in terms of

5

transaction causation, what you're -- and reliance is

6

referred to as transaction causation -- what you're

7

trying to show is whether or not the information

8

affected or distorted the market price.

9

show price distortion, it does require that the

10

information be material.

11

of the fraud-on-the-market theory --

12

And in order to

And so we accept that in terms

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or, to put it differently,

13

an efficient market is a market that takes account of

14

material factors, right?

15

MS. SHERRY:

I -- I would say it's --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not an efficient

17

market if it's -- you know -- it's -- who knows, random?

18

It takes account of material factors.

19

MS. SHERRY:

I would make a minor quibble on

that.

21

public information, but it only -- it only moves based

22

on material information, so that's exactly right.

23

so our issue is not with the predicates for the

24

fraud-on-the-market theory.

25

I would say that the market takes account of all

And

Our issue is with Petitioners equating the

8

And if I can quickly go back to my point

9

about countervailing policy concerns, as Petitioners

10

acknowledge, a determination at the class certification

11

stage is not binding on anybody -- in that case on the

12

ultimate fact-finder, or in any other case.

13

And so the problem with Petitioners'

14

position is that it would require relitigation of the

15

materiality question at the merits stage to the extent

16

the class is certified or, if it's not, in every other

17

case that is brought on the same issue.

That doesn't

The -- in terms of absent class members, he

MR. WAXMAN:

amendment that Ms. Sherry was referring to states,

quote, "A fraud case may be unsuited for treatment as a

48

Alderson Reporting Company

1

That is this case.

The anomaly of our -- my

2

friend's position is they concede that materiality is a

3

predicate for class reliance.

4

the statement is material, however efficient the market,

5

however loudly the statement was published, there is no

They agree that, unless

Reliance can only be approved -- and,
Justice Breyer, this goes to your traditional paradigm

10

case -- in the paradigm case, reliance was proven by the

11

fact that you heard the statement and you did something

12

in reliance on it, to your detriment.

13

The innovation of Basic, and the notion that

14

Basic didn't say anything about class certification

15

under Rule 23 is astonishing, given the fact that the

16

whole reason that the question of the

17

fraud-on-the-market theory was presented, was the

18

inquiry about whether there could be -- whether the

19

traditional bilateral method of proving detrimental

20

reliance on a statement could be aggregated into a

21

ginormous class by allowing everyone to say, well, we

22

relied on the integrity of the market price and a

23

material misstatement -- a material statement affected

24

that price.

Joe -- Farmer Jones comes in, you have to show it's

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No class, okay?

And then you

Those --

So the materiality was not

8

part of reliance.

Materiality was an element that was

9

always proved, and then you went on to show reliance.
MR. WAXMAN:

10

Exactly right.

And what the

11

Court in Basic could have said, Justice Breyer, was,

12

forget the fraud-on-the-market theory; we are going to

13

absolve -- we are going to say that, for 10b-5 actions,

14

you don't have to prove reliance directly on the

15

statement.

16

We are going to allow you to -- we -- we

17

posit that investors rely in common on the integrity of

18

the market price; and if you can demonstrate to us that

19

a challenged statement moved the market -- if there was

20

market effect, we will allow you to proceed as a class;

21

because then the common answer to the common question,

22

how are you going to prove reliance, is we are going to

23

prove it all the same way because investors rely on the

24

integrity of the market price.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the reason that we want

13

to prove it upfront in the 23, rather than wait till the

14

merits, where it will be argued anyway in exactly the

15

same way -- the reason that we want to do it first is,

16

since it's going to be there anyway and going to be

17

litigated anyway, unlike publicity, unlike efficiency,
