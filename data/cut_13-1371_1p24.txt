 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

of Housing and Community Affairs v. The Inclusive 

6

Communities Project.

 Mr. Keller.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER 

9
10
11
12

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. KELLER: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 The Fair Housing Act does not recognize 

13

disparateimpact claims, first, because its plain text 

14

doesn't use effects or resultsbased language, and when 

15

a statute prohibits actions taken because of race and it 

16

lacks effectsbased language, the statute is limited to 

17

intentional discrimination.  And, second, the canon of 

18

constitutional avoidance compels this interpretation. 

19

Most importantly, the Act doesn't use the phrase 

20

"adversely affect."  Smith v. City of Jackson, 

21

recognized that this effectsbased phrase 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

At the time of Smith and 

23

Griggs, neither the Title VII nor the ADEA used the 

24

words "disparate impact," and yet we recognize they 

25

apply disparate impact.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KELLER: 

At the time, disparate  the 

2

words "disparate impact" were not used; however, the 

3

words "adversely affect" were used.  And Watson 

4

subsequently interpreted Griggs as finding the textual 

5

hook for disparateimpact liability was based on the 

6

phrase "adversely affect." 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you have a problem, 

8

because it says "to refuse to sell or rent," et cetera, 

9

"or otherwise make unavailable," and the agency charged 

10

with interpreting that language has determined that it 

11

means disparate impact. 

12

 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Sotomayor, the  the 

13

phrase "make unavailable" is an act prohibited by the 

14

Fair Housing Act.  It is an act 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's a consequence.  It 

16

happens to be because that's what you do with housing, 

17

but it's a consequence. 

18

 MR. KELLER: 

The act of making unavailable a 

19

dwelling to a person is the act prohibited by the Fair 

20

Housing Act.  This isn't like Section 4(a)(2) of the 

21

ADEA, where Smith said disparate impact lied.  This is 

22

like Section 4(a)(1) of the ADEA, because of the 

23

804(a) prohibits the refusal to sell or rent, the 

24

refusal to negotiate, otherwise making unavailable, or 

25

denying.  All of those are active verbs, and they're all

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

acts prohibited.  The work that is being done by 

2

"otherwise make unavailable" is to cover additional 

3

acts, such as zoning decisions or land use restrictions 

4

that are not outright refusals or outright denials.  And 

5

that's why the language of the Fair Housing Act focuses 

6

on actions, not on 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, you could say 

8

the same thing about "adversely affect."  I mean, that 

9

also is an active verb, right?  And it also  you had 

10

to adversely affect by discriminating. 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

On the basis of 
So, you know, I  the 

13

points you make are  are true enough, but they were 

14

also true with  with respect to Title VII, weren't 

15

they? 

16

 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Scalia, I don't believe 

17

so.  Because Section 4(a)(2) and Section 703(a)(2) ban 

18

the act of limiting, segregating, and classifying.  And 

19

then they check for a certain result, something which 

20

would deprive, tend to deprive, or adversely affect. 

21

And it was that results or effectschecking language 

22

that gave rise to disparateimpact liability. 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But after that language 

24

is the phrase "on the basis of," race, sex, whatever. 

25

So it's adversely affect on the basis of the  whatever

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the category. 
 MR. KELLER: 

Well, and that was the 

3

interpretation that the Smith plurality and concurrence 

4

came to on Section 4(a)(2).  But in Section 4(a)(1), the 

5

phrase "because of race" appears, and you have active 

6

verbs there.  You have "refuse" and "otherwise 

7

discriminate," and the Court was unanimous in finding 

8

that Section 4(a)(1) only required intentional 

9

discrimination, it did not 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Do  do we take into 

11

account at all that in both Title VII and the Fair 

12

Housing Act, there was a grand goal that Congress had in 

13

mind?  It meant to undo generations of rank 

14

discrimination.  And what was the phrase that this Court 

15

used in Trafficante to describe the Fair Housing Act? 

16

That its objective was to replace ghettos by integrating 

17

 "integrated living patterns," just as Title VII was 

18

meant to undo a legacy of rank employment 

19

discrimination.  So doesn't that purpose give a  a 

20

clue to what Congress was after? 

21

 MR. KELLER: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the 

22

Court needs to focus on the plain text.  And unlike 

23

Title VII, which was passed in 1964, and unlike the 

24

ADEA, which was passed in 1967, both of which included 

25

the phrase "adversely affect," in 1968 when Congress

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

passed the Fair Housing Act it didn't use that language. 

2

Instead, it prohibited making unavailable a dwelling to 

3

any person because of race.  In  in common language if 

4

you were to say, "Adam made unavailable a dwelling to 

5

Bob because of race," you ask, well, why did Adam act? 

6

He acted because of race, and race was a reason for the 

7

action. 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if I could understand 

your point, General Keller, you agree with Justice 

10

Scalia that "make unavailable," it's  like "adversely 

11

affects," they're  they're both verbs.  "Make 

12

unavailable" is just one way to adversely affect.  And 

13

what you're pinning your argument on is these extra 

14

added words in the Title VII statute, right?  So that 

15

it's  in the  in the Title VII statute, it's 

16

can't even find them.  You know what I mean. 

17

 MR. KELLER: 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I do, Justice Kagan. 
Okay.  So  but I don't 

19

I don't think that that could possibly be right, because 

20

then you would be saying that it would be a different 

21

statute if, instead of just saying here an employer 

22

can't make unavailable, but instead it said an employer 

23

can't act in a way that makes unavailable.  That would 

24

make it completely parallel to the Title VII and the 

25

ADEA statutes.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And  and those two things just can't mean 

2

the same thing.  I mean, all it's doing is to take out a 

3

few words, but it's saying the exact same thing, which 

4

is either way, an employer can't make unavailable. 

5

 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Kagan, I don't think 

6

it's saying the same thing.  And under the reasoning of 

7

Smith, it can't be saying the same thing, because 

8

Section 4(a)(1), the Court unanimously recognized, 

9

didn't give rise to disparateimpact liability; and it 

10

didn't have the phrase that appeared in 4(a)(2) which 

11

was checking to see "in any way which would deprive or 

12

tend to deprive or adversely affect."  Without that 

13

resultsbased language, you can't have disparateimpact 

14

liability.  That's what Ricci said and Sandoval. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but the  but the thing 

16

that's different in this statute is the "make 

17

unavailable," which focuses on an effect in the same way 

18

that the "adversely affect" language does.  And it just 

19

does it a little bit more economically, but the 

20

effectsbased nature of the provision is still the same. 

21

 MR. KELLER: 

It doesn't focus on the 

22

effects.  What Smith said was 4(a)(2) prohibited the act 

23

of limiting, segregating, and classifying.  But Smith 

24

said that's not simply what it was prohibiting.  It was 

25

checking to see if there was also a deprivation or

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

something that tended to deprive or something that 

2

adversely affected, and that was the effectsbased 

3

language.  It wasn't merely dropping in a phrase such as 

4

"make unavailable." 

5

 All actions have consequences, but here 

6

Congress chose active verbs.  As Meyer v.  Holley 

7

recognized, the Fair Housing Act itself focuses on 

8

prohibited acts. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Make  "make unavailable" 

10

is not the same language as "adversely affect." 

11

That's  that's all that I'm willing to concede. 

12

 And I think if you thought that Smith was 

13

wrong, which many people do, I suppose you could argue 

14

we will not expand Smith.  And Smith hung on particular 

15

words, "adversely affect."  Those words don't exist 

16

here, and, therefore, since we think Smith was wrong 

17

anyway, we're not going to extend it.  That's  that's 

18

a reasonable argument, but that's not the argument 

19

you're making. 

20

 What  what hangs me up is not so much that 

21

as it is the fact that Congress seemingly acknowledged 

22

the effects test in later legislation when it said that 

23

certain effects will not qualify.  You know what I'm 

24

referring to? 

25

 MR. KELLER: 

Yes, Justice Scalia.

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, why doesn't that 

2

why doesn't that kill your case?  I mean, when we look 

3

at a  a provision of law, we look at the entire 

4

provision of law, including later amendments.  We try to 

5

make sense of the law as a whole. 

6

 Now, you see this statute which  which has 

7

otherwise what is  make unavailable, and it also has, 

8

however, it will not be a violation if these effects 

9

are  are  you read those together and you say, wow, 

10
11

this  this law must mean mere effects qualify. 
 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Scalia, the 1988 

12

amendments, in enacting three exceptions from liability, 

13

those provisions merely restricted liability, and the 

14

Court rejected a virtually identical argument to what 

15

the Respondent and the Solicitor General are making in 

16

O'Gilvie v. United States.  It's a case that appears at 

17

519 U.S. 79. 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MR. KELLER: 

20

The case was not cited in our 

brief. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

 MR. KELLER: 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

24

 MR. KELLER: 

25

Is this in your brief? 

Oh, I'm sorry. 
At Page 89 of that decision 
Yeah. 
 the Court noted that 

Congress might simply have wanted to clarify the matter

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in respect to the narrow exemption, but it wanted to 

2

leave the law where it found it in respect to the 

3

broader issue. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But the law where it found 

5

it here was very clear, because ten circuits had gone 

6

the other way and had said that disparate impact was a 

7

valid action under the FHA.  So leaving the law where 

8

you found it, and we presume that Congress knows the 

9

law, especially when the law is that clear and that 

10

uniform, means, yes, there will be disparateimpact 

11

actions except in these three circumstances which we're 

12

going to lay out for you very clearly and very 

13

precisely. 

14

 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Kagan, in 1988 the 

15

state of the law was in flux.  The Solicitor General 

16

filed a brief in this Court saying that the Fair Housing 

17

Act only prohibited acts of intentional discrimination. 

18

And two months before the amendments, this Court decided 

19

in Watson and emphasized that the phrase "adversely 

20

affect" was the language that gave rise to 

21

disparateimpact liability.  And if Congress would have 

22

take  if Congress was assumed to have known that this 

23

Court's precedents were in place, then 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How do you put 

"adversely affect"?  Did they have to write it "or

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

otherwise adversely affect someone by making the housing 

2

unavailable"? 

3

 MR. KELLER: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Otherwise 
I mean, it's a little 

5

crazy, don't you think, because otherwise adversely 

6

affecting someone by making it unavailable.  I think 

7

it's otherwise make unavailable 

8
9
10
11
12

 MR. KELLER: 

Well, otherwise it could 

have 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 is the short form of 

that. 
 MR. KELLER: 

Or otherwise limit housing 

13

opportunities in a way that would adversely affect. 

14

Congress could have used the same language that appeared 

15

in Title VII. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But instead what it did, 

17

it took a body of law, some of which had held some 

18

practices as disparately  improperly disparately 

19

impacting, like drug addiction and others  and two 

20

others, and said, no, those two won't count, those three 

21

won't count.  Your reading of those three exemptions is 

22

they were unnecessary. 

23

 MR. KELLER: 

Well, they were absolutely 

24

doing work in 1988, and Congress could take account of 

25

the fact the Court 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, what do you make 

2

with in 1988 where someone wanted to do away with 

3

disparate impact and Congress didn't take up that 

4

invitation? 

5

 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Sotomayor, I believe 

6

you're referring to Representative Swindall's amendment. 

7

And the mere fact that Congress didn't enact a 

8

provision, this Court has not looked to in reviewing a 

9

statute. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But what  you're 

11

you're telling us that these amendments which said that 

12

certain types of effects will not qualify, that the 

13

purpose of that amendment was to prevent erroneous court 

14

of appeals' decisions from affecting those particular 

15

areas? 

16
17
18

 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Scalia, that's part of 

the work that they're doing. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's a very strange thing 

19

for Congress to do, to believe that those court of 

20

opinions  court of appeals' opinions are wrong and yet 

21

to  to enact these exemptions.  So even though those 

22

opinions are wrong, they will not apply to these things. 

23

I  that's very strange. 

24
25

 MR. KELLER: 

Well, in 1988, when Congress 

was legislating, it agreed on one thing, and that was in

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these three narrow circumstances, liability would be 

2

restricted under the Fair Housing Act.  It would be 

3

extremely odd to read into a restriction of liability a 

4

recognition of a massive expansion of Fair Housing Act 

5

liability, and Congress does not hide elephants in mouse 

6

holes. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Exactly.  And ten 

8

circuits had already said there was disparate impact. 

9

If they didn't like the disparateimpact analysis, they 

10

would have taken up the congressman's proposal.  But 

11

they didn't. 

12

 MR. KELLER: 

In the brief that the Solicitor 

13

General filed in 1988, it made the point, which is 

14

absolutely the same today, which is Congress knows how 

15

to enact an effect test. 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It changed when  no, 

17

no, no.  When 1988 happened, the Solicitor General 

18

changed its position, and it has been consistent since 

19

then, that when Congress adopted the three exemptions, 

20

it  it recognized disparate impact as applying to the 

21

Fair Housing Act.  That intentional brief was not in 

22

1988 and not in  it was after  that was before 1988, 

23

the 1988 amendments. 

24
25

 MR. KELLER: 

It  it was before the 1988 

amendments, that's right.  But this Court was

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

considering the issue in Town of Huntington and after 

2

the amendment.  So while Congress was passing the 1988 

3

amendments, this Court has a case where the issue was 

4

raised and it was actively considering it. 

5

 And Congress 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, General, I thought 

7

your argument on the 1988 amendments was as follows: 

8

Either the  the Fair Housing Act contemplated 

9

disparateimpact analysis when it was adopted in, when 

10

was it, 1968 or it didn't.  And the 1988 amendments, 

11

which made it clear that there could not be 

12

disparateimpact analysis with respect to certain 

13

matters surely didn't expand the scope of the 19  of 

14

what was initially enacted.  So the issue is what did 

15

Congress intend, what  what is the meaning of the Act 

16

as originally enacted.  I thought that was your 

17

argument. 

18
19
20

 MR. KELLER: 

Precisely, Justice Alito.  The 

1968 Act 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But If we're going to be 

21

realistic about this, in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act 

22

passed, and in 1968, when the Fair Housing Act passed, 

23

nobody knew anything about disparate impact.  That 

24

didn't come up till the Griggs decision, and it was this 

25

Court that gave that interpretation to Title VII in

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

light of the purpose of the statute. 

2

 So to try to look back and say, oh, did they 

3

mean disparate impact in '64, when Griggs wasn't on the 

4

books till '71, it's a little artificial, don't you 

5

think? 

6

 MR. KELLER: 

The Court has to construe the 

7

plain text of the statute that Congress enacted, and the 

8

text in 1964 did not use effects 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10

 MR. KELLER: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It has to 
Sorry. 
It has to construe the 

12

plain text of the law, and the law consists not just of 

13

what Congress did in 1968, but also what it did in '88. 

14

And you look at the whole law and you say, what makes 

15

sense?  And if you read those  those two provisions 

16

together, it seems to be an acknowledgment that there is 

17

such a thing as disparate impact.  However, it will not 

18

apply in these areas that the 1988 amendment says.  We 

19

don't just look at each little piece when it was 

20

serially enacted and say what did Congress think in 

21

in '68?  What did it think in '72?  We look at the law. 

22

And the law includes the '68 act and the '88 amendments. 

23

And I  I find it hard to read those two together in 

24

any other way than there is such a thing as disparate 

25

impact.

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KELLER: 

The 1988 amendments don't refer 

2

to disparate impact.  This is not like the Title VII 

3

1991 amendment that explicitly used the words "disparate 

4

impact." 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course not, but 
But they make no sense 

7

unless there is such a thing as disparate impact. 

8

It's  they are prohibiting something that doesn't 

9

exist, right?  I mean, you're saying that they prohibit 

10
11

something that doesn't exist. 
 MR. KELLER: 

They could do more work.  They 

12

do work in disparate treatment cases.  Take the 

13

occupancy exemption.  The Fair Housing Act also 

14

prohibits the failure to make accommodations based on 

15

disability.  The occupancy exemption is going to do work 

16

in that case.  This is why  in City of Edmonds, the 

17

Court noted that these were exemptions were complete 

18

exemptions from FHA scrutiny.  Congress didn't say that 

19

it was limiting these to disparate impact.  It said we 

20

don't want these claims to go forward. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So you have an argument, 

22

and so does the other side have an argument.  But I 

23

don't want you not to have the chance to answer what to 

24

me is a pretty important question.  Say there are good 

25

arguments on both sides.  The law has been against you.

1

There's been disparate impact for 40 years.  Now, let me 

2

be fair.  Maybe it's only 35.  And it's universally 

3

against you.  And as far as I can tell, the world hasn't 

4

come to an end. 

5

 I mean, the form of the question I'm putting 

6

is well, maybe Marbury v. Madison was wrong.  I don't 

7

think it was.  But nonetheless, nonetheless, this has 

8

been the law of the United States uniformly throughout 

9

the United States for 35 years, it is important, and all 

10

the horribles that are painted don't seem to have 

11

happened or at least we have survived them. 

12

 So why should this Court suddenly come in 

13

and reverse an important law which seems to have worked 

14

out in a way that is helpful to many people, has not 

15

produced disaster, on the basis of going back and making 

16

a finely spun argument on the basis of a text that was 

17

passed many years ago and is ambiguous at best? 

18

 MR. KELLER: 

19

statute's ambiguous 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you were to believe the 

Oh, well, I don't think. 

21

My goodness, if it isn't ambiguous, it would be 

22

surprising because ten circuit courts of appeals have 

23

all interpreted it the way opposite you and I take it 

24

you don't mean it's unambiguous on their side.

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, no.  I don't want you 

4

to  if you'll do me the favor of answering my 

5

question. 

6

 MR. KELLER: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Sure. 
Which is the question that 

8

it's been the law for 40 years of just a little bit 

9

less, disaster has not occurred, and why when something 

10

is so well established throughout the United States 

11

should this Court come in and change it. 

12

 MR. KELLER: 

There is a serious equal 

13

protection question lurking here.  And as to why you 

14

would change it, disparateimpact liability and where it 

15

leads is being applied in a case like this in Magner v. 

16

Gallagher.  Texas here was trying to give additional 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You don't like the way it 

18

was applied, and I can understand that.  But there are 

19

many remedies that you have.  One is you go to HUD and 

20

you say, look at what is happening; this is happening to 

21

have the opposite effect that you want.  That's one of 

22

your arguments.  Well, try to convince them. 

23

 And if not there, you go to a court and say: 

24

Court, this is a disparateimpact case, and we have a 

25

justification and the justification is strong enough

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it survives the empirical effect, and you see if 

2

you can get them to agree.  You may win; you may lose. 

3

 But what not to do is to overturn the whole 

4

law that has been in effect, I'll repeat for the 

5

nineteenth time, for 40 years with basically helpful 

6

effect.  Now, that's a question.  It didn't sound like 

7

one, but it was one. 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10
11

So I'd like to hear what 

you say. 
 MR. KELLER: 

Sure.  The equal protection 

12

concerns here are stark.  First, the government has not 

13

explained if it's going to enforce the HUD regulation to 

14

protect only minorities.  If it does, that's likely 

15

unconstitutional under Adderand and if it doesn't, 

16

that's going to interfere with Federal and State

programs that help lower income neighborhoods.

courts have  have decided it in a uniform fashion.

Have we ever before reversed uniform holdings of  of 

6

courts of appeals, even those that have lasted 30 years?

The answer is yes.

11

 MR. KELLER: 

You have rejected the 

overwhelming consensus of the courts of appeals. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's why I asked the 

question. 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

We don't rarely
I said why.  Why?  I'm not 

14

saying you couldn't do it.  I'm simply saying why.  And I 

15

don't want to repeat my question for the fourth time, and 

16

you began to give an answer and the answer you began to 

17

give was based on a constitutional problem that has arisen. 

18

And I've taken that in and read it, and do you have 

19

other answers or not?  I want you fully to answer the 

20

question. 

21

 MR. KELLER: 

Sure.  The plain text of the 

22

statute is clear.  Constitutional avoidance compels that 

23

interpretation, and the purposes of the Fair Housing Act 

24

would be undermined by extending disparateimpact 

25

liability to this degree. 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, you're now talking 

2

 about application.  And let's go back to, you made a 

3

 statement earlier that this is going to inhibit 

4

 development of blighted areas.  That has to do with the 

5

 application in this case.  If I'm right about the theory 

6

 of disparate impact, and I can tell you I've studied it 

7

 very carefully, its intent is to ensure that anyone who 

8

 is renting or selling property or making it unavailable 

9

 is doing so not on the basis of artificial, arbitrary or 

10

 unnecessary hurdles, policies or practices, and it's the 

11

 Petitioner who has to identify which they are, and to 

12

 explain why alternatives wouldn't work. 

13

 If someone's developing a blighted area or 

14

 an area subject to crime or something else, that's 

15

 something they can do and that's a criteria, a policy 

16

 that can't be substituted for something else.  So I 

17

 don't know why you keep saying this is going to affect 

18

 private development. 

19

 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Sotomayor, in  in 

20

 Ricci, the Court reserved the question whether 

21

 disparateimpact liability in requiring racebased 

22

 decisionmaking would violate the equal protection 

23

 clause, and there is a 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But this is not 

 racebased decisionmaking.  Are you saying that the 10 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 percent plan in  in colleges is racebased if it's an 

2

 absolutely neutral policy that happens to address a

3

 need, which is to integrate schools? 

4

 MR. KELLER: 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But the 
So why is it wrong to 

6

 have a neutral policy?  Because none of the policies 

7

 that were imposed here and in most  in all other cases 

8

 are racebased.  They're policies that are race neutral, 

9

 but happen to have a better impact in terms of 

10
11

 integration. 
 MR. KELLER: 

Justice Sotomayor, I would 

12

 disagree that it's completely raceneutral, because at 

13

 the outset, statistical disparities based on race, 

14

 racial classifications, are used and this has the 

15

 potential to subordinate traditional 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

18

Well, that 
Which is not the case for 

 the 10 percent plan that Texas uses. 

19

 MR. KELLER: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Absolutely, Justice Scalia. 
There's no racial thing in 

21

 that.  If you're in the top 10 percent of your high 

22

 school class, you go to the State university. 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What was the reason 

 for 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No race about it. 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What was the reason for 

2

 it?  You can say it's a neutral, 10 percent is neutral;

3

 but it's just glaring in the face that the legislature 

4

 that passed this was very much raceconscious.  It was 

5

 the way that they saw of getting a minority population 

6

 into colleges. 

7

 I don't think there's really a doubt that 

8

 factually that's what prompted the 10 percent plan. 

9

 When the University of Texas was told its affirmative 

10

 action plan was no good, then the legislature came back 

11

 with the 10 percent plan. 

12

 MR. KELLER: 

But there's a difference 

13

 between that raceconscious decisionmaking and, here, a 

14

 situation where liability is triggered based on 

15

 statistical disparities. 

16

 That's why the Watson plurality, Justice 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's not  liability is 

18

 not triggered  well, "triggered" is a good word; but it's 

19

 not imposed because of that.  It's imposed because the lower 

20

 court found, rightly or wrongly  I don't want to get 

21

 into the merits of that  that some of the criteria 

22

 being used was  were unnecessary and that was  and 

23

 there was no legitimate business reason for it. 

24
25

 I could, as Justice Breyer said, quarrel 
 with that conclusion; but that's in application.  That's 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

 not in the standard that disparate impact imposes. 

 MR. KELLER: 

But what objective standard is

3

 there to measure whether something is a substantial 


4


 interest in the housing context?  And that's why 


5


 disparateimpact liability can lead to the functional 

6

 equivalent of a quota system.  That's what the Watson 

7

 plurality said, Wards Cove, and Justice Scalia's

 concurrence in Ricci.

17

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. DANIEL: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 please the Court: 
 The remedy in this case is perfectly 

18

 consistent with the interest in revitalizing low income, 

19

 minority areas.  The remedy in this case shows that 

20

 there is nothing about the Fair Housing Act 

21

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

We're not talking about 

 this case. 
MR. DANIEL: 

No.  I'm just using it as an 

 example. 
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  Why don't 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 you get to the legal issue, if you could. 
 MR. DANIEL: 

The legal issue is

3

 "unavailable."  Unavailable is a resultoriented 

4

 measure.  You look to see how many units are available 

5

 in an area.  You count them.  That is the result.  How 

6

 many units are available in another area?  You count 

7

 them.  That's a result. 

8
9

 It's clear from the Congressional Record 
 Congress was worried and concerned about making units 

10

 only available in low income, minority areas that it 

11

 called "ghettos."  The remedy that it wanted 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It isn't the "unavailable" 

13

 word that's the problem.  The problem is unavailable on 

14

 the basis of race.  You can say "unavailable" a million 

15

 times, but the statute requires that it be made 

16

 unavailable for racial reasons. 

17

 And you're saying, no, it doesn't have to 

18

 be; it could be unavailable simply because you use some 

19

 other nonracial reason, which is stupid, right?  That's, 

20

 that's your argument.  If it produces a result that 

21

 is  is not  what, I don't know  that the races 

22

 have to be in the same proportion as they are in the 

23

 general population.  Right?  I mean, that's what you're 

24

 arguing. 

25

 MR. DANIEL: 

The argument is that if, in 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 fact, racial discrimination is a foreseeable consequence 

2

 of what someone is doing 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, no, no, no.  Racial 

4

 disparity is not racial discrimination.  The fact that 

5

 the NFL is  is largely black players is not 

6

 discrimination.  Discrimination requires intentionally 

7

 excluding people of a certain race. 

8
9
10

 MR. DANIEL: 

It certainly includes that, 

 Justice 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So let's not  let's not 

11

 equate racial disparity with discrimination.  The two 

12

 are quite different, and what you're arguing here is 

13

 that racial disparity is enough to make  to make 

14

 whatever the policy adopted unlawful, right? 

15

 MR. DANIEL: 

No, Justice Scalia.  That's not 

16

 what the argument is; and that's not what's in the 

17

 argument, it's not what's in the regulations. 

18

 The argument is, is that if I'm going to 

19

 make a disparate treatment case that there is 

20

 intentional discrimination, I'm going to start with the 

21

 effects, just the same place I start with a disparate 

22

 impact.  I start with the effects:  Has there been an 

23

 effect that is consistent with discrimination? 

24
25

 In disparate impact, I then go on to the 
 next step:  Is there an interest that justifies the 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 discriminatory effect?  It could be the same 

2

 discriminatory effect that is caused by intentional

3

 discrimination. 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Daniel, I had thought 

5

 that Justice Scalia's question was whether the "because 

6

 of" language precludes a disparateimpact theory; in 

7

 other words, whether the "because of" language signals 

8

 that it has to have a certain kind of intent which is 

9

 not part of a disparate treatment, a disparateimpact 

10
11

 theory. 
 And I would have thought that your main 

12

 argument about that is, well, actually, the Court has 

13

 held numerous times, in the Title VII context, in the 

14

 ADEA context, in the Rehabilitation Act context, in the 

15

 Emergency School Aid Act context, that that "because of" 

16

 language can be read to include disparateimpact claims, 

17

 and that it's at least ambiguous as to whether it should 

18

 be read so in this case as to this particular statute. 

19

 MR. DANIEL: 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

21
22

Yes, Justice Kagan. 
I mean, is that your 

 argument, or is your argument something else? 
 MR. DANIEL: 

That is the basic argument on 

23

 "because of," that it has been interpreted both ways; 

24

 and in Title VII and in Smith, it did not require proof 

25

 of intent.  In this case

6

 MR. DANIEL: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, Chief Justice. 
How is a housing 

8

 authority supposed to  if you have a claim of 

9

 disparate impact, how is a housing authority supposed to 

10
11

 cure the alleged problem? 
 MR. DANIEL: 

Assuming that you go through 

12

 the steps and that there is, in fact, a need to cure the 

13

 problem 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Could you 
Well, I'm sorry, I'm 

16

 sorry.  You have made a showing of disparate impact, 

17

 that the impact and adverse consequences for a 

18

 particular race. 

19
20
21

 What is the housing authority supposed to do 
 at that point? 
 MR. DANIEL: 

At that point, the housing 

22

 authority is to say, this is what interest we have that 

23

 is served by the discriminatory practice causing the 

24

 racial segregation.  That's what  and they say, it 

25

 whatever that interest is and they say it, that this 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 is  this interest justifies our practice that we're 

2

 doing.

3

 At that point in time, we come back and say: 

4

 But there are other ways to do it that are less 

5

 discriminatory. 

6

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

7

 MR. DANIEL: 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

Is there 

And 
Is there a way to 

 avoid a disparateimpact consequence without taking race 

10

 into account in carrying out the governmental activity? 

11

 It seems to me that if the objection is that 

12

 there aren't a sufficient number of minorities in a 

13

 particular project, you have to look at the race until 

14

 you get whatever you regard as the right target. 

15

 MR. DANIEL: 

You don't have to look at the 

16

 race at all.  You look at the practice causing it; and 

17

 you stop the practice, like in this case or like in the 

18

 zoning case. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, what was, in fact, 

20

 the remedy?  I mean, this was a case where there was 

21

 litigation, you prevailed, and there was a remedy.  So 

22

 there was disparate impact. 

23

 And what did the Court say had to be done to 

24

 cure it, to cure what it saw as the offense to the Fair 

25

 Housing Act? 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DANIEL: 

It said it had to stop the 

2

 discriminatory housing practice and then it had to 

3

 then it ordered in place the remedy suggested by the 

4

 State that was, in fact, the less discriminatory 

5

 alternative, to a large extent, to what they had been 

6

 doing. 

7

 There's no racial goals in it, there's no 

8

 race conscious in it, there's no racial criteria in it. 

9

 It is a  there is  and it is the remedy that the 

10

 State says will work to stop the discriminatory 

11

 practice. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

 MR. DANIEL: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15
16

Could we go back? 
In fact 
Could we go back?  I 

 think you've been interrupted. 
 The steps are: 

First you show that 

17

 there's  that the numbers are off.  Then the other 

18

 side tells you what the reason is for why the numbers 

19

 are. 

20

 You, then, have an opportunity or an 

21

 obligation to come and suggest alternative methods of 

22

 taking care of the legitimate business need.  Correct? 

23

 MR. DANIEL: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Yes, Justice Sotomayor. 
So you  those are the 

 three steps? 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. DANIEL: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
If you can propose ways

3

 that are race neutral, practices that are race neutral 

4

 that will have  take care of their needs, meaning the 

5

 other side's needs, then you get relief. 

6

 MR. DANIEL: 

And, for example, one of the 

7

 ways proposed was:  Do not continue putting projects 

8

 next to landfills and hazardous industrial uses.  That 

9

 was 

10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Don't you have a tension 

11

 between two statutes here?  I mean, you have the Fair 

12

 Housing Act; and then there is the law that sets up this 

13

 tax credit, right?  And doesn't that law say that there 

14

 should be a priority for revitalizing decaying 

15

 communities? 

16

 MR. DANIEL: 

The law specifically says that 

17

 there should be a preference among all the projects that 

18

 are going to be awarded for applications that contribute 

19

 to a concerted community revitalization plan.  That 

20

 preference is honored in the remedy and it is in the 

21

 remedy.  If you are  if an application is 

22

 concerting  is contributing to a concerted community 

23

 revitalization plan just like in the IRS code, then it 

24

 gets the same points as a  a project that is going to 

25

 be in a higher income, low poverty area with good 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 schools. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why shouldn't it get more

3

 if the tax law expresses that preference for the 

4

 revitalization? 

5

 MR. DANIEL: 

Justice Ginsburg, it could if 

6

 the State set it up that way.  The State just hasn't set 

7

 it up that way.  The State could set it up so that 

8

 there's a pool of units that are going to be awarded 

9

 projects and pick out of there and give preference to 

10
11

 those concerted community revitalization plans. 
 The district court found that the State did 

12

 not do that.  The State instead gave a two point  one 

13

 or twopoint selection criteria bonus for that kind of 

14

 project.  That's  that's  but that's a State choice. 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you go back to Justice 

16

 Scalia's question, please?  Because I took  because I 

17

 just want to hear your answer to it. 

18

 As I understood his question, it was you 

19

 look at the words and the words say, "make unavailable 

20

 because of race."  And what you're saying is those 

21

 words, "make unavailable because of race," can include 

22

 the circumstance where you make unavailable for a reason 

23

 that has nothing to do with race where the effect of 

24

 that reason is to cause a racial disparity of 

25

 significance and it cannot be justified as the least 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 restrictive way to bring about it.  That's the point. 

2

 But you're saying those words are consistent

3

 with the longer phrase I just said.  Okay.  Is there 

4

 case law or other, aside from this area, which builds 

5

 your point and says, yes, those words linguistically and 

6

 legally do include the disparateimpact situation, or 

7

 can.  I take it that's his question and I was looking

MR. DANIEL: 

This Court's two major opinions

 things.  It didn't just say "because of" can mean

 Keller's argument, but it also cited the RFOA provision. 
 Now, none of  neither of those  I think

3

 the latter is more significant and there's nothing like 

4

 that in Title VIII, is there? 

5

 MR. DANIEL: 

The exemptions are  are 

6

 similar in the fact that what those  they do  the 

7

 RFOA in Smith came in and basically said even if you 

8

 have disparate impact on these factors, if it's a 

9

 reasonable factor other than age, we're going to excuse 

10

 the disparate impact.  Okay.  Now the  the exemptions 

11

 speak to the disparate impact and there's no  nothing 

12

 in there that says that there's  that you use by the 

13

 reason  that you can excuse, that those don't count 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So is that critical to your 

15

 argument?  That the exemptions are critical to your 

16

 argument? 

17

 MR. DANIEL: 

We  we think the exemptions 

18

 are text that support the use of a disparateimpact 

19

 liability.  We think there's a lot of other things.  The 

20

 statutory construction used in the congressional record, 

21

 what the Congress wanted to do, 3601, which Congress 

22

 passed to say  and has been used to give an expansive 

23

 interpretation in matters of standing and enforcement. 

24

 We think those  all those tools of statutory 

25

 construction combine to make it at least permissible 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 and, therefore, giving due deference to the HUD 

2

 regulation.

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If there was no disparate 

4

 impact under the Act as initially enacted, do you argue 

5

 that the exemptions expanded the Act so that it then, as 

6

 of 1988, included disparate impact? 

7

 MR. DANIEL: 

Well, it  if there was none 

8

 then, there  there  indicated the 1988 Congress 

9

 thought there was.  We don't think you can look at what 

10

 Congress did in 1968 and say they did not intend to 

11

 cover effects.  They say it time and time again. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that wasn't really my 

13

 question.  What Congress thought the Act meant in 1988 

14

 wouldn't have any significance  wouldn't have much 

15

 significance if they hadn't done anything, would it? 

16

 MR. DANIEL: 

No, I think they were doing it 

17

 in 1988, that counts for 1988.  We think that it  they 

18

 had done it before. 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  So did what 

20

 they  did the things that they actually did in 1988 

21

 expand the coverage of the Act? 

22

 MR. DANIEL: 

No, Justice.  We think that the 

23

 coverage was already there in the 1968 Act.  When you 

24

 look at all the tools of statutory construction, they 

25

 all point in one direction, and that is, to that being 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 a  at least a permissible, if not the best, 

2

 interpretation in 1968 that Congress intended to cover

3

 effects of past segregation and other discrimination, 

4

 whether it was intentional or not.  It's throughout that 

5

 record, it is discussing the major implement of racial 

6

 segregation and how it was brought about.  It intended 

7

 to end the effects of that.  It said it again and again. 

8
9

 We think the 1988, it certainly recognized 
 the disparateimpact rule, it talked about the 

10

 disparateimpact rule in the courts of appeals.  It knew 

11

 it was there.  It was being done in  in the context of 

12

 those courts of appeals. 

13

 No further questions?

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR. 
 ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, 
 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and 

 may it please the Court: 
 The statutory provisions that most clearly 

22

 show that HUD's disparateimpact regulations are a 

23

 permissible interpretation of the Fair Housing Act are 

24

 the three exemptions.  Those exemptions presuppose the 

25

 existence of disparateimpact liability and so serve no 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 real purpose without them  without disparateimpact 

2

 liability.

3

 And the provenance of those exemptions lends 

4

 particularly strong support for the reasonableness of 

5

 HUD's reading.  They were added by amendment in 1988 at 

6

 a time when nine, I think the number is nine courts of 

7

 appeals, had ruled that the Fair Housing Act authorized 

8

 disparate impact, and they  and they were added to 

9

 provide defenses to exemptions from  they're labeled 

10

 as exemptions from, carveouts from, disparateimpact 

11

 liability.  So you've got 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think your case would be 

13

 stronger if there had been no court of appeals that 

14

 had  that had favored disparate impact.  Then  then 

15

 you couldn't possibly argue, well, that was put in just 

16

 to eliminate the erroneous judgments of these courts of 

17

 appeals in  in certain areas, anyway.  It would be 

18

 better if no court of appeals had said that 

19

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

21
22

Well 
 and Congress had enacted 

 these 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

No, I actually think it's 

23

 better the way it happened because  for our case 

24

 because of the reenactment canon.  You have  Section 

25

 805 of this law was reenacted against the backdrop, so 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 you have the reenactment of those nine courts of 

2

 appeals.  So you have the reenactment canon and you have

3

 the canon against  the presumption against superfluous 

4

 amendments both working.  And remember, we're in Chevron 

5

 territory here.  So the question is whether the 

6

 statutory text unambiguously forecloses HUD's 

7

 interpretation. 

8

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Can I ask you a question 
Well, one concern 

10

 one concern about disparate impact is that it's very 

11

 difficult to decide what impact is  is good and bad. 

12

 Take two proposals.  One is a proposal to build new 

13

 housing in a low income area, it would benefit 

14

 primary  primarily minorities; new housing, good 

15

 thing.  The other proposal is to build housing in a more 

16

 affluent area.  It would help promote integration of 

17

 housing; also a good thing. 

18

 Which one gets credit for under  trying to 

19

 decide the impact?  The one that is revitalizing a 

20

 lowincome area or the one that is integrating a 

21

 highincome area? 

22

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Right.  I understand 

23

 that, Mr. Chief Justice, and there may be difficult 

24

 questions.  Of course, the agency here charged by 

25

 Congress expressly, in the 1988 amendments, I would add, 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 with interpreting and enforcing these provisions, has 

2

 concluded that they do  that disparate impact is the

3

 right policy judgment. 

4

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, no.  But 

5

 which  which counts?  I mean, which benefits  you're 

6

 trying to see if there's a disparate impact on 

7

 minorities. 

8

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It may well be 
If you give the 

10

 proposal to the lowincome housing in the affluent 

11

 neighborhood, that certainly benefits integration.  If 

12

 you give the proposal to  fund the proposal in the 

13

 lowincome area, that certainly helps housing 

14

 opportunities there. 

15
16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So I'm going to answer 

 Your Honor's question directly. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Good. 
But I think you've got to 

19

 do it in the context of the way in which a 

20

 disparateimpact case has got to be proven.  It's not 

21

 enough just that there's a statistical disparity.  A 

22

 plaintiff has got to demonstrate that a particular 

23

 practice or criterion being applied is being 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And what is the practice 

 here?  Because that was the question Judge Jones 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, you know, that's a 

2

 very good question.  If I may just answer Justice

3

 Ginsburg, and I'll come back and finish my answer to 

4

 you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

5

 That the  that's a very good point, 

6

 Justice Ginsburg.  And we are  although we are here 

7

 defending HUD's interpretation, and we think the answer 

8

 to the question presented is yes.  That  that's  we 

9

 don't have a position on whether this is a viable 

10

 disparateimpact claim, and we think Judge Jones has 

11

 made a good point in our  in her concurrence because 

12

 it's not clear to us what specific practice that the 

13

 the State agency has engaged in here that would  would 

14

 justify the finding of disparateimpact liability.  And 

15

 one thing that was suggested is maybe that could be 

16

 dealt with on remand from the district court. 

17

 And I do think that's  and that gets to 

18

 what I was trying to say to you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

19

 which is that you've got to apply the test which is 

20

 HUD has set out as a real test. 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, with respect, 

22

 I don't think that's responsive.  You say you look at 

23

 which provision is having the disparate impact, but I 

24

 still don't understand which is the disparate impact. 

25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

In other words, is 

2

 it the provision that causes more proposals to go to

3

 lowincome housing in the affluent area?  Or is it the 

4

 provision that causes more  approval of more proposals 

5

 in the lowincome area?  You've got to know what you're 

6

 shooting at before you can tell if you've missed. 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, the disparate 

8

 right.  The disparity tied to a particular practice, 

9

 it's just the first step in the analysis.  The second 

10

 step in the analysis is justification, what's the 

11

 justification. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry, I  and 

13

 I'll just ask it for the last time and then let you get 

14

 on. 

15

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yeah. 
You're saying you 

17

 need the justification, but for what?  Which is the bad 

18

 thing to do, not promote better housing in the 

19

 lowincome area or not promote housing integration? 

20

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You know, it may be 
You say you look at 

22

 what's causing the bad effect, but what's the bad 

23

 effect? 

24
25

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

It may be that neither is 

 because the state may say the  the government may say 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 in the first case, well, this is our justification, and 

2

 that may be a justification that holds up.  The

3

 government may say in the second case, well, that's our 

4

 justification, and that may be a justification that 

5

 holds up.  So I just think that you've got 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you think that a 

7

 private developer would ever be found guilty of 

8

 disparate impact because he owns a piece of property in 

9

 an affluent neighborhood? 

10
11

No, certainly not, of 

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 
 course not. 

12

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

13

 develop his property, right? 

14

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

15

 thought the question 

16

He's permitted to 

Yes, of course.  And I 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The disparate impact 

17

 would be if he fails to sell or make available to people 

18

 of all races, let's say, the units in that property, 

19

 correct? 

20
21

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 
 specific practice. 

22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

24

 just the first state 

25

There's got to be a 

Practice. 
That's right.  And that's 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  The specific 

43

1

 practice 

2

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

3

 statement in the analysis 

4
5
6
7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 that has a 

 business 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

 and it's got to be 

 unjustified. 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

10

And that's just the first


Exactly. 
That  and that's 

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I thought the 

11

 question was, though, I mean, the  it's not a 

12

 developer, it's the Department of Housing and Community 

13

 Affairs, and I thought the challenge went to where they 

14

 were  been  where they were supporting 

15

 development 

16

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

18
19

Well, this 
 not the 

 developer, but  but 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

This may not be a good 

20

 disparateimpact claim, Mr. Chief Justice.  But the 

21

 cases that are in the Heartland are really pretty 

22

 straightforward. 

23

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But are you saying that in 

24

 each case that the Chief Justice puts, there is 

25

 initially a disparate impact at step one, that is to 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 say, Community A wants the development to be in the 

2

 suburbs.  And the next state, the community wants it to

3

 be in the poor neighborhood.  Is it your position, it 

4

 seems to me, and the position of the Respondents, that 

5

 in either case, step one has been satisfied. 

6
7
8
9
10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

That may be right, 

 Justice Kennedy, but I think the point 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But that  that seems 

 very odd to me. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

But I think that even if 

11

 they're difficult cases under disparate impact, there 

12

 are cases in the Heartland that have been adjudicated 

13

 for 35 or 40 years, cases such as there is a zoning 

14

 restriction that has a disparate impact that it cannot 

15

 be justified on a substantial basis.  There  there is 

16

 an occupancy restriction for an apartment 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Can I ask you a question 

18

 I'm sorry, about Chevron.  Should we be concerned here 

19

 about the use of Chevron to manipulate the decisions of 

20

 this Court?  The  the Fair Housing Act was enacted in 

21

 1968.  For 40 years plus, there were no HUD regulations. 

22

 Then we granted cert in the Gallagher case, and it was 

23

 only after that and within, I think, days after that 

24

 that the HUD regulations were issued.  And then the 

25

 Gallagher case settled, and then we issued  then we 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 granted cert in the Mt. Holly case, and the Mt. Holly 

2

 case settled.  So should we be troubled by this

3

 chronology? 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

So the  I understand 

5

 the import of your question, Your Honor.  I guess I 

6

 would say a couple of things in response.  The first is 

7

 that HUD, in the formal adjudications reviewed by the 

8

 secretary, has found disparateimpact liability 

9

 available under these provisions in the Fair Housing Act 

10

 since 1992, I believe.  And those would be entitled to 

11

 Chevron deference, and I do think, respectfully, that 

12

 that's a point that we made in our brief in  in the 

13

 first case, the  the Gallagher case. 

14

 Second, and I don't mean to be flip about it 

15

 because I understand the import of Your Honor's 

16

 question, but I do think it overestimates the efficiency 

17

 of the government to think that you could get, you know, 

18

 a supposed rulemaking on an issue like this out within 

19

 seven days. 

20
21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It was a 

 coincidence. 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

That was very persuasive. 
I really  and so  so 

24

 I don't  I think, actually, this has been a position 

25

 of HUD for a very long time, and you would get Chevron 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 deference for the adjudications.  I think that's 

2

 pretty  pretty clear, wholly apart from the reg, but

3

 we do have the reg now and I do think it gets Chevron 

4

 deference. 

5

 And if I could turn to the question of 

6

 avoidance, constitutional avoidance, that has come up. 

7

 I don't think this is a suitable case for constitutional 

8

 avoidance, and let me try to explain why.  Whatever one 

9

 might think in the Title VII context about the 

10

 consequences of finding disparateimpact liability, this 

11

 is a very different context.  In a Title VII context, 

12

 the issue has been raised is that the only way to avoid 

13

 disparateimpact liability is to engage in racebased 

14

 remedies, not racebased thinking about what neutral 

15

 criterion to adopt, but racebased remedies. 

16

 And here in the Heartland cases under the 

17

 Fair Housing Act, you aren't going to have that kind of 

18

 an issue.  The remedy is going to be the substitution of 

19

 one raceneutral rule for another raceneutral rule. 

20

 For example, if a  if a landlord cannot justify an 

21

 occupancy restriction that's particularly tight, the 

22

 the remedy there is going to be either no occupancy 

23

 restriction or a looser occupancy restriction.  And the 

24

 consequence in those cases  same thing with zoning and 

25

 other things  the consequence in those cases is  is 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that no one gets classified by race, no one gets a 

2

 burden imposed upon them because of race, and no one

3

 gets a benefit because of race. 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What  what rule you 

5

 select depends on what affect that will have on racial 

6

  racial use of the facility. 

7

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well, I think the 

8

 consequence  no I think, Justice Scalia, with all 

9

 due  all 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You select on the basis of 

 what affect it will have on race. 
 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

Well  well, but that 

13

 kind of consideration, so long as the  the rule that 

14

 comes later is a raceneutral rule, seems to me is 

15

 exactly the kind of thing that the plurality opinion of 

16

 this Court in Croson said in the contracting context 

17

 that governments could do.  They couldn't afford a 

18

 preference to minority contractors, but they could do 

19

 such things the Court suggested as changing the bonding 

20

 requirements or changing other financial requirements in 

21

 order to make the minority contractors which tended to 

22

 be newer, smaller businesses more eligible.  Those 

23

 those 

24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

To underscore that, 

 because I think everybody is getting confused with this, 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 disparate impact does not go to who they take unless 

2

 they set up a practice 

3

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

That's  that's correct. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 that has that affect. 

5

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

And so in the Heartland 

6

 cases, with respect to the Fair Housing Act, the kinds 

7

 of remedies that are going to be imposed are like the 

8

 kinds of remedies that the Court said  or the 

9

 plurality, excuse me, set in Croson would find. 

10

 And, Justice Kennedy, they're like the kinds 

11

 of raceneutral considerations that Your Honor's opinion 

12

 in Parents involves that were refined. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What you're saying is 

14

 suppose that the plaintiffs in this case, that side, 

15

 wins  to try  they're trying to win.  The defense, 

16

 on the other  it's not true that that means all 

17

 Section 8 housing is now going to be  or even a large 

18

 amount is going to be put in rich neighborhoods. 

19

 First, they can defend on the ground that we 

20

 don't have that practice, to put it in poor 

21

 neighborhoods.  Second, they can say, yes, we do, but 

22

 don't you see that isn't going to hurt minorities 

23

 because it puts those minorities in housing where many 

24

 of them are, unfortunately, in poor neighborhoods, and 

25

 it doesn't have the great effect on desegregation that 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 they think.  Or third, if they lose on that, they can 

2

 say but anyway it's justified for a whole bunch of

3

 reasons. 

4

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, but so 
So the answer is case by 

6

 case, they have a specific set of forms that give 

7

 answers 

8

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

10

 GENERAL VERRILLI: 

11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's 
 and judges judge it 
Absolutely. 
 and HUD can come in and 

12

 decide, and there is no need to throw the whole baby 

13

 out  or I don't know whether it's the baby or the bath 

14

 water, whatever you're throwing out.  But you don't have 

15

 to throw out the whole big thing in order to prevent 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So just  I'm 

17

 sorry.  So just so I can understand, because, again, I 

18

 don't know what you're shooting for.  Two different 

19

 communities, okay?  They have these tax credits, 

20

 whatever to give out.  One place, they give it to the 

21

 housing in the affluent neighborhood; the other, they 

22

 give it to the housing in the lowincome neighborhood. 

23

 They're both sued for disparate impact.  In the one, 

24

 they say, oh, no, no, this is good because we're 

25

 promoting integration so the impact on minorities is not 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 a problem.  And the other says, no, this is good because 

2

 we're revitalizing lowincome neighborhoods and that

3

 helps the minorities.  They both win? 

4

 MR. VERRILLI: 

They might both win, yes. 

5

 And if I could, I just want to finish up on the 

6

 constitutional avoidance point, if I could connecting 

7

 something Justice Breyer said. 

8

 If there are particular instances in which 

9

 there is a concern that the recognition of disparate 

10

 impact liability could result in not just racebased 

11

 thinking about neutral means but racebased remedies, it 

12

 seems to me the answer there is the answer that the 

13

 Court usually gives, which is think about them on an 

14

 asapplied basis.  But that isn't a justification for 

15

 denying HUD the authority that we submit that HUD has 

16

 under  under the regulations  under the statute as 

17

 amended in 1988 when Congress specifically gave HUD the 

18

 authority to interpret these provisions and did so 

19

 against the backdrop of imposing the exemptions which 

20

 presupposed disparate impact liability and reenacting 

21

 the statute in which, after nine courts of appeals had 

22

 found that it did impose disparate impact liability. 

23

 The question here is whether under Chevron the statutory 

24

 text read fairly in 1988, taking all provisions of the 

25

 statute together, unambiguously forecloses HUD from 

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 finding disparate impact liability here.  And we assume 

2

 and we a  we submit that the answer to that question

3

 must be no, it does not unambiguously for  forbid HUD 

4

 from reaching the conclusion that it reached and, 

5

 therefore, the answer to the question presented in this 

6

 case, which is whether the Fair Housing Act recognizes 

7

 disparate impact liability, is yes.

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And General, could I just 

 ask  I don't know a lot about this area and I take it 

10

 that one of the things that you are warning us against 

11

 is seeing the entire area through the prism of this one 

12

 quite unusual case.  And you've referred a few times to 

13

 sort of the Heartland cases without really getting out 

14

 what the Heartland cases are.  So, for me, what are 

15

 they? 

16
17

 MR. VERRILLI: 

Sure they're the kind  may 

 I answer, Mr. Chief Justice? 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19

 MR. VERRILLI: 

Sure. 

Thank you.  They're the kinds 

20

 of cases that have been litigated and you'll see in the 

21

 courts of opinions, court of appeals' opinions for 35 

22

 years restrictions  say a town adopts a restriction 

23

 saying you can't convert housing from ownership to 

24

 rental unless you're renting to a blood relative has the 

25

 effect of excluding minorities.  Town adopts an 

52

 occupancy restriction for apartment buildings that's so 

2

 tight that you're not going to be able to  families

3

 with kids aren't going to be able to live there.  That 

4

 disproportionately effects minorities groups with kids. 

5

 Those kind of things, zoning restrictions, housing 

6

 program restrictions, those kinds of rules are the 

7

 Heartland cases.  Thank you.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Thank you, General. 

 General Keller, you have four minutes remaining. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. SCOTT A. KELLER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. KELLER: 

Mr. Chief Justice, to answer 

13

 your question, both would open up liability for 

14

 disparate impact.  Here the Department could have faced 

15

 disparate impact liability if it was going to take tax 

16

 credits and send them to lowerincome neighborhoods or 

17

 more affluent neighborhoods.  And even 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, you keep saying 

19

 that, but that's not what happened here.  The remedy was 

20

 not to tell you to move your development from one area 

21

 to another.  The remedy here was  it did preclude 

22

 development next to landfills, but it also included 

23

 other  other tinkering with the qualifications.  But 

24

 you're going to still need people who want to do 

25

 MR. KELLER: 

But in the remedy in this case

 the district court 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 the development they 

 want to do.
 MR. KELLER: 

 kept it and retained 

5

 jurisdiction for five years so even if the disparity's 

6

 not closed 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That has to go with your 

8

 attacks on the remedy.  That has  doesn't have 

9

 anything to do with what disparate impact as an approach 

10
11

 set out by HUD  direct should be done. 
 MR. KELLER: 

And each regulated entity is 

12

 going to have to examine the racial outcomes of their 

13

 policies in every zoning decision made 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 MR. KELLER: 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No. 
 in every raise in rent 
What they do is what 

17

 everyone should do.  Is before they set up any policies, 

18

 think about what is the most raceneutral policy. 

19

 That's a very different thing.  That, I think, everyone 

20

 is obligated to do. 

21
22
23

 MR. KELLER: 

And that's precisely what the 

 Department 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It's only if the other 

24

 side proves that a qualification has an  a race effect 

25

 that's not necessary, can they win. 

54

 MR. KELLER: 

And here the Department engaged 

 in raceneutral policies. 
 Justice Alito, to your point about Smith and

4

 the ADA's reasonable factors other than age exemptions, 

5

 there are three things that distinguish that from this 

6

 case.  First, there's an important textual difference. 

7

 The ADA's reasonable factor other than age provision 

8

 referred to actions otherwise prohibited.  And the Court 

9

 in Smith interpreted that as recognizing the disparate 

10

 impact liability could lie under the ADA.  In the Fair 

11

 Housing Act, we don't have that language.  The 

12

 exemptions say nothing in the FHA prohibits or limits. 

13

 So this is truly a safe harbor. 

14

 Second, Smith already noted that the ADA 

15

 used adversely effect.  And third, Smith didn't involve 

16

 race and so no constitutional avoidance can and would 

17

 have applied there. 

18

 And on constitutional avoidance, the reason 

19

 we're here today is because the Texas department did not 

20

 use racebased decisionmaking.  Take a hypothetical 

21

 from Gruder.  If the University of Michigan had said, 

22

 the incoming class must have 30 percent of its incoming 

23

 class of a certain race and we prefer that 

24

 raceconscious or raceneutral means were used to do 

25

 that, but if those aren't available, racebased means 

55

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 must be used, that would be suspect.  At the very least 

2

 all we need to show is a constitutional doubt for the 

3

 constitutional avoidance canon to apply here and the

4

 remedy said that there was one. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What in the remedy 

6

 ordered here was racebased?  What remedy said you have 

7

 to take in 10, 20, 15 percent? 

8
9

 MR. KELLER: 

The particular remedy here 

 wasn't racebased, but the liability to begin with and 

10

 whether the disparity is going to close and whether the 

11

 Department is going to remain not in compliance with the 

12

 Fair Housing Act, is still racebased. 

13

 Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

15

Thank you, Counsel. 

 The case is submitted. 

16

 (Whereupon, at 11:21 a.m., the case in the 

17

 aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
