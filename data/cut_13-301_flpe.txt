 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON

11

 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 In this case, the Eleventh Circuit 

12

unambiguously held that a district court always abuses 

13

its discretion when it denies a summons opponent's 

14

request to examine IRS officials based on an unsupported 

15

allegation of improper purpose.  That holding was wrong 

16

for at least three reasons, and even Respondents don't 

17

defend it at this point. 

18

 The three reasons are: 

First, the Eleventh 

19

Circuit's rule ignores Congress's intent that IRS 

20

summons enforcement proceedings be summary in nature. 

21

Second, the automatic examination rule is inconsistent 

22

with this Court's treatment of analogous, 

23

administrative, and grand jury subpoenas in other 

24

contexts.  And the third, the rule fails to respect the 

25

district courts' core discretion to govern its own

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

proceedings, including governing when and how evidence 

2

should be developed. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

As you say, the Respondent 

4

concedes all that.  So why don't  why don't you talk 

5

about what the difference is between you and the 

6

Respondent?  Nobody defends what the lower court said 

7

here, right? 

8

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I'm happy to.  The 

9

Respondent suggests two what we think of as unworkable 

10

limitations or potential limitations on the rule.  The 

11

first is that there be a requirement that the allegation 

12

be plausible, though, totally unsupported by evidence. 

13

And in our view, any plausibility requirement that is 

14

untethered to a requirement that a summons opponent 

15

actually point to some evidence that would substantiate 

16

the allegation is really not a limitation at all. 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is  is there really a 

18

difference between those two?  Can it be plausible if 

19

there is  if there is no evidence that suggests that 

20

it's true? 

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, in our view, no.  I 

22

mean, I think that's the question that you might want to 

23

direct to Respondents.  They seem to suggest that 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It may well be that the two 

of you agree in other words, depending on what they

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

think. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

And if that's true, then we 

3

invite the Court to reverse the Eleventh Circuit.  I 

4

mean, the rule we want 

5

 (Laughter.) 

6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

What we would like is that 

7

there  that before a district court is actually 

8

required to allow examination of IRS officials, a 

9

summons opponent has to put in enough evidence to at 

10
11

least raise an inference of 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

It all depends on what  it 

12

all depends on what you mean by "evidence."  Do you mean 

13

direct evidence?  Is circumstantial evidence enough? 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Circumstantial evidence is 

15

enough.  And  and, again, what we're asking for is 

16

really a modest rule.  A district court, in our view, 

17

has discretion to allow examination of an IRS official. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Could you  could you 

19

apply your rule, district court discretion in this 

20

particular case?  There were two allegations, I think, 

21

that  the first one was that the  this was in 

22

retaliation for the taxpayers' refusal for the third 

23

time to extend the limitation period.  And the other was 

24

this was an effort to circumvent the limited discovery 

25

that's allowed in the tax court.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 Now, those were the allegations. 

What would 

2

the taxpayer have to say in addition to those two 

3

allegations to pass your test? 

4

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, so I think there 

5

there are sort of two threshold questions that the 

6

district court would consider.  The first is whether 

7

those would actually be improper purposes.  And the 

8

second is whether if they would be, they were actually 

9

the motivating purposes in this case.  The district 

10

court  the court of appeals in this case only 

11

considered the statute of limitations question, and it 

12

found that  that issuing a summonses after a taxpayer 

13

declined to extend a statute of limitations would be an 

14

improper purpose.  We disagree with that legal holding, 

15

but that's not the question on which we sought this 

16

Court's review 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let  let's assume 

18

that it is inappropriate for the IRS to avoid 

19

taxpayer  tax court limitations on discovery.  Let's 

20

assume that a subpoena cannot do that.  The Supinski 

21

declaration, it seems to me, is quite sufficient to make 

22

that showing. 

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, I would just say 

24

so there's a case we cited in our reply brief called Ash 

25

v. Commissioner, which is a tax court case, which says

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that in the tax's court view, there's no problem with 

2

enforcing a summons that was issued before  tax court 

3

proceedings were initiated, as was the case here, that 

4

there's no problem  there's no interference with the 

5

tax court discovery rule when we need to do that. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But my supposition was 

7

that assume that you cannot avoid taxpayer  or tax 

8

court discovery limits.  If  if that is so, it seems 

9

to me the Supinski affidavit is quite sufficient. 

10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, it may or may not be. 

11

And, again, if this Court corrects the  the Eleventh 

12

Circuit didn't consider that because in the Eleventh 

13

Circuit's view, there didn't need to be any evidence. 

14

And so the Eleventh Circuit did not examine the 

15

sufficiency of the evidence that the Respondents 

16

presented.  And so if this Court corrects that legal 

17

rule, Respondents can make these arguments on remand to 

18

the Eleventh Circuit. 

19

 But I would just point out with respect to 

20

that  that proposed improper purpose that the  the 

21

validity of a summons is judged at the time that the 

22

summons was issued.  And in this case, the summonses 

23

were issued before there was any tax court litigation. 

24

There's always the possibility, when a summons is 

25

issued, that there's going to be tax court litigation

7

Alderson Reporting Company

1

down the road after the IRS makes its determination of 

2

the 

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why is that? 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's a point  that's a 

5

point for argument.  I mean, you can argue that to 

6

the  to the district court. 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Absolutely. 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You don't want us to 

9
10

resolve that here. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, you can easily 

11

imagine circumstances where there's a subpoena, an 

12

administrative subpoena issued against Mr. Smith.  By 

13

the time he comes around to enforcing it, where there's 

14

very little reason to enforce it, Mr. Smith is suffering 

15

an incurable disease and the district court would say, 

16

no, it's oppressive.  Right?  I mean, I've never heard 

17

of this rule that you  a district court would be 

18

forbidden to look at the circumstances in which the  a 

19

subpoena or any other discovery document is being asked 

20

to enforce it now.  I mean, where does this rule come 

21

from that the district court can't look at the 

22

circumstances now? 

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I'm not saying the district 

24

court can't look at the circumstances at the time of 

25

enforcement.  There may be circumstances where 

8

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Very well.  Once we say 

2

that, they've asked this question on the merits here. 

3

They say, why in heaven's name have they issued  why 

4

have they asked this enforcement?  There are only two 

5

possible reasons.  One is to get some information in the 

6

years 2005, 2007 that would show that they owe more 

7

money than you claim they do owe, since you issued a 

8

final thing, which would be impossible because the 

9

statute of limitations has run. 

10

 And the other possible reason is that you want to 

11

obtain information to put in the tax court proceeding, 

12

which, in fact, is supported by the fact that the agents 

13

who came to enforce it were tax court lawyers and not 

14

the regular lawyers.  And, in fact, it would be 

15

absolutely illegal under the law  the rules of the 

16

tax court.  So they said, that's our information. 

17

That's why we think this is oppressive.  And your 

18

response to that is if they're wrong, why do you want 

19

this information? 

20
21
22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we think they're sort 

of wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Very good.  Then you will 

23

explain to me why is it  why is it that the government 

24

wants this information?  To do what? 

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Because so  just to take

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a step back.  The courts have upheld that the inquiry is 

2

whether the summonses were issued for a proper purpose. 

3

This Court said in Couch that the legal parties  the 

4

parties' legal duties are fixed at the time that the 

5

summons was issued.  So if you adopt the type of 

6

approach that they're asking for, what you're going to 

7

do is give taxpayers an incentive not to comply with the 

8

legal duty that's imposed on them by operation of law, 

9

which is to disclose information related to their tax 

10

liabilities, and then to comply with summonses that are 

11

validly issued.  You give them incentive to drag 

12

things out until the statute of limitations is about to 

13

run and they file a tax court 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

15

you want the information? 

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

My question was:  Why do 

We want the information 

17

because the IRS wants to make a determination of their 

18

tax liability. 

19
20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Wait, wait.  Now, explain 

that one to me. 

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Okay.  So that's 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, when you say 

23

information, isn't the final partnership 

24

determination  the final partnership for the years 

25

2005, 2007, is it you want the information to revise

10

that?  Is that why you want it? 

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

That is  I mean, yes. 


So 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  So you want the 


information 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, that's a  that's 

one possibility. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I want to know yes or no. 

What are the reasons you want this information?  One is 

10

you want to change the number on the final partnership 

11

assessment of liability.  Is that one of the reasons? 

12

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

It could be. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes or no, please. 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

We want the right answer. 

15

And if the right answer is that we were wrong in the 

16

FPAA, then we would revise the FPAA. 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You want  in other words, 

18

I want to be quite precise.  I've asked the question, do 

19

you want the information with the idea in mind that it 

20

might show you should change the final number? 

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes. 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  Is there any other 

23

reason you want the information? 

24

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

No. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Okay.  Thank you.

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

Well, can I ask you this 
Could I just go back to 

Justice 

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

5

JUSTICE ALITO: 

Justice Alito. 

Can I ask you this on a 

6

related point.  The IRS has to, as an initial step, 

7

if  if the person who's subpoenaed resists 

8

enforcement, the IRS has to submit an affidavit saying 

9

it has a proper purpose. 

10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

11

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes. 
Right?  Suppose that that 

12

affidavit says:  We have a proper purpose and our proper 

13

purpose is solely this:  We want discovery for the Tax 

14

Court case.  In your view  in your view, is that a 

15

proper purpose? 

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So I guess  so the 

17

premise of your question assumes that there is already a 

18

Tax Court proceeding underway? 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right. 
And so that may  that 

21

might not be a proper purpose because the IRS has said 

22

you need extraordinary circumstances  the internal IRS 

23

guidelines say you need extraordinary circumstances to 

24

issue a summons after Tax Court proceedings are 

25

underway.  And the Tax Court has similarly said you can

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

only use evidence obtained through those summons in 

2

extraordinary circumstances.  But in almost every case, 

3

a summons is issued long before or at least somewhat 

4

before a Tax Court proceeding is initiated because 

5

it's  the IRS is trying to get information to make a 

6

determination about the taxpayer's liability. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

All right.  Well  so 

8

suppose the  the answer is this:  We have a proper 

9

purpose.  We have no interest whatsoever in changing our 

10

assessment.  However, we anticipate that there's going 

11

to be a Tax Court proceeding and we want to get 

12

discovery for the Tax Court proceeding.  Is that a 

13

proper purpose? 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I think that would be a 

15

question that would need to be decided in a particular 

16

case.  The reason I'm hesitating to give you a straight 

17

answer is because I  that's just not the way the IRS 

18

works.  The IRS is trying to get the right answer.  And 

19

believe it or not, sometimes when the IRS gets more 

20

information, it will actually give money back to a 

21

taxpayer.  It might  if it gets information that might 

22

exonerate the IRS's finding of improper liability or it 

23

might actually bring to light to the IRS the fact that 

24

the taxpayer has overpaid.  And there are some case 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Could I go  interrupt

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

now, just to get back to the question that Justice Alito 

2

started with earlier and finish it.  What do you mean by 

3

"evidence"?  And  and I ask this because I'm trying to 

4

figure out whether we're in the IqbalTwombly world, 

5

where what you mean by "evidence" is sort of a sworn 

6

complaint that points to facts from which a plausible 

7

inference can be drawn, or whether you're talking about 

8

evidence as a summary judgment standard where they have 

9

to proffer affidavits and show documents and sort of go 

10

through a summary judgment standard.  Because 

11

evidence 

12

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

14
15

Right. 
 is a  it  it has 

a lot of meaning and I'm not quite sure which one 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So it's more like summary 

16

judgment than Iqbal.  You know, I don't think summons 

17

enforcement standards exactly map onto any other civil 

18

standard like this.  I'll tell you why we think the 

19

Iqbal standard does not apply.  There's a couple 

20

reasons. 

21

 First, the IqbalTwombly standard is a 

22

pleading standard, it's not about what kind of 

23

evidence.  It's  it's not about production of evidence 

24

to support your pleadings.  And so in this case what 

25

we're saying is it doesn't matter how artfully you plead

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there is an improper purpose; you need to be able 

2

to point to some kind of evidence to support that to 

3

raise an inference of improper purpose. 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that  that means 

5

point to some facts, point to some facts that 

6

that 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

8

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

saying  I don't know that 

10
11
12
13

It certainly 
That's  that's why I'm 

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But you can't just allege 

things 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let me tell you what I 

would have done if I had gotten this. 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Okay. 
All right?  If I had 

16

gotten their information, I would have looked at the 

17

government and said:  Explain to me why you need this 

18

I would have done what Justice Breyer did.  And then I 

19

would have figured out and asked you enough questions, 

20

without holding a hearing, just through your attorney, 

21

until I got to a point where I decided whether or not 

22

your answers, like the district court did here, made 

23

sense or not. 

24

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Okay. 
And if they didn't make

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

sense, then I would say, no, let's go a little further. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

And absolutely, we would 

3

say you would have discretion to do that as the district 

4

court.  We  we're not looking to constrain the 

5

district court's discretion here.  And I think it's 

6

important to keep in mind, another reason that the Iqbal 

7

standard really doesn't work here is that by the time 

8

you're getting to this question about whether there's an 

9

improper purpose, as our opponent has alleged, the 

10

government has already made a substantial showing of 

11

good faith.  The government has filed the Powell 

12

affidavit, a district court has satisfied itself that 

13

the government has established a proper purpose.  And 

14

then the presumption is that the government's acting in 

15

good faith and for a proper purpose. 

16

 And so when you're  in the Iqbal context, 

17

the person who files a complaint is entitled to the 

18

presumption that what they say is true.  It's the 

19

opposite here. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So why not  why not 

21

make life very simple  and I think that's what your 

22

counterpart  simply to say you have to point to facts 

23

from which a reasonable inference of improper motive can 

24

be drawn. 

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

That's what we're saying.

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That's exactly the standard that we think should have 

2

been applied.  And if it  and as long as an opponent, 

3

a summons opponent, can do that, can point to facts that 

4

raise an inference of improper purpose, then a district 

5

court needs to allow examination of IRS 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But that doesn't  that's 

7

doesn't really seem very helpful because there are 

8

inferences and there are inferences.  There are weak 

9

inferences and there are strong inferences.  I don't 

10

think it's very helpful to a district judge for us to 

11

send this back and say:  Figure out whether there is an 

12

inference here of  of some unspecified strength. 

13

 Take the retaliation issue. 

You have 

14

let's say these are the facts.  The  the IRS asks for 

15

a further extension of the statute of limitations, the 

16

taxpayer says no:  I'm not going to agree to any further 

17

extensions, and then a half an hour later the summons 

18

are served.  So you have one thing happening shortly 

19

after another.  That gives rise to an inference of 

20

retaliation.  Maybe it's a very weak inference; maybe 

21

it's a stronger inference.  Do you see what I'm saying? 

22

We have to specify something other than it gives rise to 

23

an inference of some unspecified strength. 

24
25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, with respect, Your 

Honor, that  that's the rule that's applied in the 11

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

other courts of appeals that have jurisdiction over 

2

these matters and it really has not been a problem in 

3

the district courts in those courts of appeals.  It's 

4

only the Eleventh Circuit that has held you don't have 

5

to point to any evidence, you don't have to raise an 

6

inference, a district court has no discretions 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Counsel, could I 

8

we hear that argument a lot, that there's never been any 

9

showing of any problem in these other circuits.  But do 

10

you have any study to support that?  I mean, is it  I 

11

don't know that we  how you would tell.  I mean, 

12

because these  these proceedings, not everybody is 

13

going to say I'm going to appeal, particularly facing 

14

the IRS, and go forward.  Do you have any basis for the 

15

argument that this has not been a problem in the other 

16

circuits other than the fact that what, we haven't had a 

17

case yet or the courts of appeals haven't had a case? 

18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I can't point to any study, 

19

but I have to think that if there were serious problems, 

20

you would see a lot more litigation about this issue. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What  what do you mean 

22

about a problem?  I mean, some of them are applying a 

23

requirement of a strong inference and others are 

24

applying a requirement of a weak inference.  How is that 

25

a problem?  I mean, you could say no problem, they're

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

just doing what they want to do. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But none of them is 

3

applying the rule that the Eleven Circuit applies, which 

4

is you don't have to have  you can just have an 

5

unsupported allegation. 

6
7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh.  We're  we're way 

beyond that. 

8

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay.  Great. 
Well, not 

10

necessarily great.  One thing that  when we articulate 

11

a new standard, sometimes we like to apply it to the 

12

particular case to give clearer guidance over exactly 

13

what we mean. 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Okay. 
And in this case 

16

and particularly here when we're not being asked to 

17

resolve a legal question in the particular case, we're 

18

just trying to say what do you need to show a hearing 

19

require a hearing.  They've got more  you know, 

20

they've got more than just a bare allegation.  They've 

21

got the summons  first of all, it's the third request 

22

for an extension.  They've got the summons immediately 

23

after they refuse to grant it.  They've got a contention 

24

that this is to circumvent the Tax Court's limits.  They 

25

support that by the fact that when Moog came for the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deposition, you only had the Tax Court lawyers there, 

2

not Mr. Freefielder who was  Frierfielder, who was 

3

running the investigation.  That's more than just a bare 

4

allegation. 

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, if I can separate the 

6

two allegations.  On the  on the statute of 

7

limitations issue 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

were three or four, not two. 

10
11
12

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

There were  there 

Well, I'm sorry.  There are 

different allegations, but they're sort of two reasons. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry.  Maybe 

13

because it's a tax case, if you could slow down just a 

14

little bit. 

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

16

 (Laughter.) 

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

18

 So the two purposes, improper purposes that 

I'm sorry. 

I'm with you. 

19

they discussed before this Court, are:  First, 

20

retaliation for refusing to extend the statute of 

21

limitations; and second, circumvention of Tax Court 

22

discovery rules.  So as to the first, again, I think you 

23

need to step back and ask:  Well, would it be an 

24

improper purpose for the IRS to issue a summons after a 

25

taxpayer declines to extend the statute of limitations.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No.  It's a little 

2

bit more than that.  It's the third request for an 

3

extension.  And how often does the IRS request the 

4

taxpayers to waive the statute of limitations? 

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I can't give you 

6

statistics, but my understanding is that the IRS does 

7

everything it can to get the information voluntarily and 

8

in a cooperative way from taxpayers before it has to 

9

resort to a summons.  And so that often involves asking 

10
11

for extensions of the statute of limitations. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I know.  But 

12

Congress has established these statutes of limitations, 

13

and the IRS has enormous leverage.  They're sitting here 

14

saying, well, we could file this thing saying you owe 

15

$150,000 in taxes or you might  or you could give us 

16

more time and we'll think about it longer. 

17

 And my sense, just from looking at the cases 

18

that come in and cert petitions, that happens almost 

19

always.  They're always saying give us more time, give 

20

us more time.  And I don't know how many times it 

21

happens three different times  I mean three 

22

successive 

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

To be honest, I don't know 

24

how often that happens either.  I don't think it's 

25

infrequent.  But I think you have to understand it

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

within the context of the tax system.  This isn't a 

2

system where the obligation is on the IRS to figure out 

3

how much each of us owes and to come after us for that 

4

amount.  The obligation  Congress has put it on the 

5

taxpayer to determine.  Everyone has to do their own 

6

taxes, figure out how much they owe, and to give 

7

documentary evidence supporting their determination of 

8

how much they owe.  And Congress has also told the IRS, 

9

we want you to go out and inquire into the liabilities 

10

of taxpayers with respect to any tax and figure out if 

11

people are doing this correctly. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And we want you to 

13

do it within whatever the statute of limitations period 

14

is. 

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

That's right.  But if the 

16

 if the IRS goes to taxpayers, they don't  they 

17

don't just go to a taxpayer and issue a summons right 

18

off the bat.  They go to a taxpayer, in this case the 

19

partnership.  They made two deductions, questionable 

20

interest deductions totaling $34 million.  The IRS said 

21

we're not sure about this.  They asked for information 

22

that would allow the IRS to determine whether the 

23

deductions were correct.  Now keep in mind

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Just so  just so I  I 

know what your position is in this case and your answer

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to the Chief Justice, is it your contention that on this 

2

showing, that on these affidavits, a district court may 

3

not order a hearing? 

4
5
6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

No.  We're not offering a 

line that a district court would not 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

All right.  So you say 

7

that the district court  that there is a sufficient 

8

showing here so that a district court, in the exercise 

9

of its discretion, could order a further hearing. 

10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.  I mean, we think 

11

almost any time a district court thinks there's a reason 

12

to hold the hearing, that it would allow examination by 

13

IRS officials 

14

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the problem is, you 

15

say the district court could say, yes, I'm going to 

16

I'm going to require this agent to testify or no, I'm 

17

not going to. 

18

 You're using a discretion test, but you're 

19

not giving the district judges all over the country a 

20

clue about appropriate exercise of that question.  And 

21

if I understand your most recent answer, you're saying 

22

it could go either way, it's up to the district judge. 

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, I mean, I think any 

24

time you're talking about the district court's exercise 

25

of its discretion, you're going to have a range of

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

situations in which the district court could do A or it 

2

could do the opposite of A, and it wouldn't be an abuse 

3

of discretion either way.  That's the nature of 

4

discretion. 

5

 In our view, in this case, if a district 

6

court sees a reason to hold the hearing and allow 

7

examination, it should do that, and the IRS, the 

8

government may argue 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Can I  can I ask, 

10

Ms. Harrington, in the 11 circuits that follow what you 

11

think is the right approach, what actually happens?  How 

12

often do courts ask IRS agents to come in and to give 

13

testimony about why they're  why they've issued a 

14

summons? 

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I don't have statistics. 

16

It's really hard to get numbers on all of these sort of 

17

numbersbased questions and I apologize for that.  But 

18

my sense is it doesn't happen very often.  But 

19

sometimes 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But there was a time when 

21

the government thought that was the right procedure. 

22

The Salter case has been mentioned and there the 

23

government itself made the suggestion that if there's an 

24

allegation, an allegation of improper purpose, the court 

25

should have a hearing at which the taxpayer gets an

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

opportunity to question the agent. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, Justice Ginsburg, 

3

it's not quite right that  first of all, we offered 

4

testimony just in that case.  I don't think we offered 

5

that as a rule to govern all cases.  But also, it wasn't 

6

just about any allegation of improper purpose.  It was 

7

about a particular type of purpose that was  that was 

8

relevant then, which is that an allegation that the IRS 

9

had a criminal investigation only purpose.  And when 

10

Congress enacted TEFRA in 1982, it took that allegation 

11

of improper purpose off the table by sort of drawing 

12

making irrelevant whether the IRS  whatever its 

13

internal motivation was, whether it was looking at 

14

criminal or civil liability, it took that off the table. 

15

 And so all the courts of appeals from the 

16

'70s and '80s that allowed examination of IRS officials, 

17

as a matter of course or more frequently, all of those 

18

courts of appeals except the Eleventh Circuit changed 

19

their rule after TEFRA was enacted because all of those 

20

holdings were really just about whether the IRS had a 

21

solely criminal investigation purpose. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Ms. Harrington, can I go 

23

back?  You said it's rare.  Does that mean it's 

24

really  it never happens? 

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I think it happens

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sometimes.  It doesn't happen very often.  And again, I 

2

think that's because before you even get to the 

3

question, the IRS has already made a significant showing 

4

through the Powell affidavit.  It has established that 

5

it has a proper purpose.  And the IRS doesn't just say, 

6

we have a proper purpose.  They have to identify the 

7

purpose.  And if you look on pages 24 and 25 of the 

8

Joint Appendix, you will see the purpose that's alleged 

9

in this case, which is looking into these questionable 

10
11

interest deductions. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  But there's more 

12

that's why  what I don't have clear in my mind is how 

13

to write the facts into this.  I mean, before we had our 

14

previous colloquy, I guess they had no idea why you 

15

wanted this information more specifically than you're 

16

saying.  And then you say, quite truthfully  it only 

17

took three seconds  and you said no, we want it 

18

because we might want to revise the  the final 

19

partnership  final partnership administrative 

20

adjustment.  And then what perhaps they'll say next 

21

I'm just getting this out of their brief, they'll say  in your own 

22

handbook you say, once that's issued, "The examination 

23

has been concluded and the Service should no longer be 

24

in the process of gathering data to support a 

25

determination."

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And then they have a whole paragraph full of 

2

similar things from the IRS.  So they'll read them to 

3

you, not you, but the lawyer, and they'll say, well, 

4

what was special about this that you decided to have 

5

this extra examination?  And there'll have to be an 

6

answer to that.  Well, as a  as a sort of lay person 

7

in this area reading that, that sounds like a good set 

8

of questions to ask.  You'd be interested in what the 

9

answer is and they should be able to ask them. 

10

 Now, am I missing something? 

Can I say 

11

would I cause some kind of big problem for something or 

12

it's  if I were to say in an opinion, look, this is 

13

the kind of thing that they want to know, and it sounds 

14

as if, since we don't know your side of it, but it 

15

sounds as if this is the situation, and they should be 

16

able to find out. 

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, the problem is that 

18

the IRS seeks the information when it issues the summons 

19

and that happens before the FPAA was issued.  It 

20

happened before there's tax court proceedings.  And so 

21

if you write an opinion that says, well, if you  you 

22

know, if the  if the summonses don't get enforced 

23

until after the FPAA is issued and at that point, the 

24

taxpayer is entitled to examine IRS officials, then 

25

you're giving taxpayers an incentive not to comply with

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

summonses that are validly issued. 
 Now, the order to show cause was issued by 

3

the district  excuse me 

4

the taxpayer has an obligation even before the summonses 

5

are issued to provide information to the IRS to support 

6

its tax liability.  Once the summonses are issued, it 

7

certainly has an even stronger obligation, and just 

8

because that hasn't yet been enforced through the 

9

district court, just because the Respondents refuse to 

10
11

that was issued afterwards.  But 

comply with their obligation 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I am trying to figure out 

12

the difference between the two sides here.  And I guess 

13

you can only answer for half of it.  But I suspect the 

14

difference is you are saying that there is enough 

15

evidence here to allow a district court to exercise its 

16

discretion, but not enough to reverse a district court 

17

if it did not exercise its discretion in favor of 

18

allowing the hearing.  Is that right? 

19
20
21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.  That's exactly what I 

was 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And I suspect the other 

22

side will be saying there is not only enough to enable 

23

the district court to make the finding of  of a 

24

hearing, but there's enough to compel the district court 

25

to do that.  We'll  we'll see what they say about

28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

3

that. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

If I could reserve the 

balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Marod. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD A. MAROD 

7
8
9
10

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. MAROD: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 A taxpayer is entitled to an 

11

evidentiary  a limited evidentiary hearing when he 

12

presents specific facts from which an improper purpose 

13

in issuance or enforcement of a summons may plausibly be 

14

inferred from those facts. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you would reverse the 

16

district court here if the district court  you're 

17

you're not defending what  what the court of appeals 

18

said, that you're entitled to a hearing in every case 

19

whenever you  you say improper motive.  Yes, you 

20

have  you don't defend that. 

21

 MR. MAROD: 

If we read the case that 

22

way, I don't defend it.  I read it to say that you look 

23

at pleading standards, including Iqbal, you look at all 

24

of the other cases that it relied upon. 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Where do we have the 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we have the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit.  Where does 

2

it say that? 

3

 MR. MAROD: 

It doesn't say those words.  It 

4

says, we made a complete and detailed review of the 

5

entire record.  We are applying pleading standards in 

6

the course of this and we are relying on Nero and  and 

7

its predecessors, all of which say, for instance, you 

8

can't get this hearing by just saying denied or just 

9

saying I think they were acting with an improper 

10

purpose.  And so therefore, if you put all these things 

11

together in an unpublished opinion that's deciding my 

12

case, we think that that's what the result was of what 

13

they were doing.  But the rule 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Counsel, I'm  you 

15

know, what the Eleventh Circuit is doing is a little 

16

confusing to me.  I understand what motivated it.  You 

17

use the word "evidentiary hearing."  In my mind, 

18

evidentiary hearing by definition is live witnesses.  Is 

19

that your definition? 

20

 MR. MAROD: 

What I'm talking about is a 

21

limited evidentiary hearing and at that hearing there 

22

would be 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So define what "hearing" 

means to you. 
 MR. MAROD: 

It could very well be live

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

witnesses.  It would be up to the discretion of 

2

the court, based on what allegations were made in that 

3

particular case.  But the typical case 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But that's the problem. 

5

I think the Eleventh Circuit means a live hearing 

6

because of its jurisprudence in this area, which has 

7

barred any other kind of evidence to be sought from the 

8

IRS.  It has a case that says you can't have 

9

depositions, you can't have discovery, discovery in its 

10

traditional sense, documents or other things.  But I 

11

don't know; has it also said you can't have affidavits. 

12
13

 MR. MAROD: 

No.  It doesn't say you can't 

have affidavits, and we have provided affidavits 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 MR. MAROD: 

Not you.  Them, the IRS. 

Right.  No, the Eleventh Circuit 

16

has not said you can't present evidence by means of 

17

affidavits in order to try and support your position. 

18

What it has said 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Not you.  I'm talking 

20

about the government, because I started by asking you, 

21

are you looking to crossexamine IRS agents. 

22

 MR. MAROD: 

We believe that what the 

23

Eleventh Circuit says we have the right to do and what 

24

we want to do is to get at least Mary Frierfelder in so 

25

that we can crossexamine her 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's what I thought 

you 
 MR. MAROD: 

 with respect to her 

affidavit, which we have serious doubts about. 
 Now, as Ms. Harrington indicates, the 

6

taxpayer does have a duty to provide information to the 

7

IRS, but in this particular case what doesn't appear in 

8

the record is that the IRS lived at Dynamo for 2 years 

9

before these requests for enlargement of time.  They 

10

weren't doing anything for a long period of time.  As we 

11

indicated in our submissions, our allegations, our 

12

affidavits, they didn't do anything for a long period of 

13

time.  Then they suddenly asked for a new extension of 

14

the statute of limitations.  Then when we denied it, 

15

they promptly filed these summonses and 

16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

In Powell we said 

17

similar allegations weren't enough.  The fact that the 

18

documents had already been reviewed or that the statute 

19

of limitations has passed, that that wasn't enough.  So 

20

what have you given us that  here, what have you 

21

alleged that's greater than Powell? 

22

 MR. MAROD: 

All right.  We're not saying 

23

it's because the statute of limitations has passed. 

24

We're saying it's because the FPAA has been issued; and 

25

the FPAA, according to the statute, you are only

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

permitted one FPAA.  You can't go back and modify or 

2

amend the FPAA.  Once you've done that, as Justice 

3

Breyer indicates, the matter is completed in terms of 

4

the examination. 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That's just the opposite 

6

of what Ms. Harrington told us.  She said the only 

7

purpose of enforcing these subpoenas was the possibility 

8

of amending the FPAA.  I thought I understood her to 

9

have said that. 

10
11

 MR. MAROD: 

Ms. Harrington said that that 

was what she thought one possibility might be. 

12

 We contend they cannot amend the FPAA. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, I think she said it was the 

14

possibility.  I asked her. If there were others, she didn't 

15

say any others. 

16

 MR. MAROD: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18
19

Right. 
But there will be an 

argument whether they can or can't. 
 MR. MAROD: 

Right.  We believe the law makes 

20

it clear that they can't amend the FPAA and that once 

21

the FPAA is issued, the possibility of amendment of 

22

what's in there moves to a court.  It either moves to 

23

the Federal Court of Claims or it moves to a district 

24

court, a bankruptcy court or the Tax Court.  And when 

25

someone is asked to pay as much money as was asked for

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in this case, the Tax Court is the logical place to go 

2

because it's the only one you can go to without first 

3

paying all the money and try to challenge 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Could you have said in 

5

the Tax Court  now that the proceeding has begun in 

6

the Tax Court  say, Tax Court, there is  the 

7

subpoenas, they are attempting to get information that 

8

they could not have gotten from this court through 

9

discovery.  So, court, say no enforcement. 

10

 MR. MAROD: 

11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Correct.  We're saying 
Did you ask  I mean, 

12

that would be a possibility.  You're saying that once 

13

the case shifts to the Tax Court, it should be the Tax 

14

Court judgment, not a district court reviewing the 

15

subpoena. 

16

 MR. MAROD: 

I understand.  We can't ask the 

17

Tax Court to not enforce the summonses, because Congress 

18

has given exclusive jurisdiction to enforce or not 

19

enforce summonses to the district court and, in fact, 

20

the Ash case that Ms. Harrington referenced actually 

21

held, we don't have jurisdiction to determine whether 

22

these should be enforced or shouldn't be enforced.  If 

23

they go ahead and allow them to be enforced and the 

24

information is gathered, we will then consider the 

25

information that is gathered for whether it is

34

The "we" is who?  The "we" 

I'm sorry? 
Whose words are you 

repeating? 
 MR. MAROD: 

The words of the Ash case from 

the Tax Court. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

11

Court that's talking? 

12

 MR. MAROD: 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Okay.  So it's the Tax 

Correct. 
Do you know offhand what is 

14

the provision of law in which you rely for the 

15

proposition that the FPAA cannot be amended? 

16

 MR. MAROD: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

18

 MR. MAROD: 

19

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

20

 MR. MAROD: 

It's 26 U.S.C. 6223 sub (f). 
Could you say that again? 
Yes.  6223 sub (f). 
Thank you. 
So our belief is that once the 

21

Tax Court case has begun, all discovery in that case 

22

should be there, and we have already said that when 

23

that once that case started was the first time they 

24

tried to enforce these summonses.  The summonses were 

25

issued back in October and September of 2010.  They

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

weren't obeyed back in 2010.  The IRS manual says, and I 

2

know it's not the force of law, but it does say what the 

3

IRS says, which is, if they don't perform the summonses, 

4

you must come in and seek enforcement of that summons 

5

within 3 days, and then it moves up the channel and then 

6

you must pursue that as quickly as you can, and they 

7

didn't do that. 

8
9

 Nothing happened in terms of trying to 
enforce these summonses at any time until the FPAA was 

10

issued.  In addition to that, we know that the FPAA that 

11

was issued on December 28 of 2010 was actually signed by 

12

this agent on August 11th of 2010 and was issued without 

13

any change. 

14

 And so what we're looking at here is an 

15

agent who has finished the FPAA in August, suddenly 

16

issues summonses in September and October; when they're 

17

not performed, doesn't try to get them enforced because 

18

if she had wanted that information for the purpose of 

19

completing her FPAA, which she had already completed and 

20

might be considering revising, she didn't do that and 

21

she had the opportunity to do that, and she was implored 

22

by the IRS manual to do those things and she didn't do 

23

those things. 

24
25

 Then the FPAA goes out, we file a Tax Court 
case, they answer.  A month later is the first time that

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we get any indication from them that they want to try 

2

and enforce these summonses, and what they are looking 

3

for is documentation that they could easily get through 

4

a request for production of documents in the Tax Court. 

5

The only problem in the Tax Court with getting those 

6

documents would be it would be subject to a scope 

7

objection with respect to discovery; whereas, under a 

8

summons there is no objection to scope.  They can ask 

9

for anything that they want that has anything to do with 

10

the finances of the particular taxpayer, and that's why 

11

we make the analogy to Rule 2004 of the Bankruptcy Court 

12

Rules, where trustees and creditors and other parties in 

13

interest can ask for information about the finances of 

14

the debtor without any limitations on what they can ask. 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I just want to make sure I 

16

understand.  The district court has in front of it a 

17

request to enforce a subpoena.  The district court has 

18

no authority at all, either on its own motion or by 

19

request from the taxpayer, to limit that scope, the 

20

scope of discovery?  Millions of documents, he just has 

21

to sign it?  Is that what I'm hearing? 

22

 MR. MAROD: 

There are cases in which 

23

district courts have, in fact, limited the scope of 

24

summonses.  In the typical enforcement of a summons, if 

25

they serve you with a summons, you are not entitled even

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to have a lawyer at the examination.  You have to give 

2

them everything.  If you don't give them everything or 

3

make an excuse why there isn't  that something doesn't 

4

exist, then you are into these enforcement proceedings 

5

and then you have to go into that litigation. 

6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

You are in the litigation, 

7

in that litigation in the district court.  Once you are 

8

before the district court, you can make an objection as 

9

to excessive scope. 

10

 MR. MAROD: 

Yes.  We didn't make an 

11

objection as to scope because they made such a broad 

12

FPAA  or they were making such broad allegations at 

13

the time these summonses initially came out, and they 

14

were making such broad allegations in the Tax Court, 

15

that that would not be successful, and we don't think 

16

that the district court should be deciding what the 

17

correct scope is.  That is something that the Tax Court 

18

should be deciding based on what the issues are in the 

19

Tax Court.  The Tax Court was designed to especially 

20

know about all of these issues that come up relating to 

21

tax returns and examination of tax returns and 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But at the point where 

23

the summons is sought to be enforced, it may be that 

24

there is no Tax Court proceeding yet, and there may be 

25

never any Tax Court proceeding.  So how can the district

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

judge make the ruling predicting the future course? 
 MR. MAROD: 

I don't think it can, Your 

3

Honor.  I  I don't believe that if  if these 

4

summonses had been  if enforcement proceedings had 

5

been begun in 2010 before the FPAA had been issued, 

6

before any tax court proceeding had begun, that we could 

7

at that time in good faith have signed the paper under 

8

Rule 11 saying they're only going to use this for the 

9

use in the tax court, they're not going to use it for 

10

the FPAA.  We haven't  we hadn't seen the August 11th 

11

FPAA that was signed by Ms. Frierfelder until after it 

12

was issued in December of 2010.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

3
4

What  what general 

areas of inquiry would you like to explore? 
 MR. MAROD: 

I'm pretty sure the surprise is 

5

gone at this point, Your Honor.  But why did you delay 

6

in issuing these summonses until the very end of this 

7

case, of the statute of limitations period, when you had 

8

had people in the store for two years looking at 

9

everything that was available.  Why did you delay? 

10

 Why did you sign the FPAA, which is your 

11

Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment, on August 

12

11th of 2010, if you hadn't completed your examination 

13

already?  When did you send this Final Partnership 

14

Administrative Adjustment up to be issued? The way I 

15

understand this works, it has to go up through the 

16

ranks, she can't just issue the FPAA herself, it has to 

17

be issued out of Washington, D.C. 

18

 And, of course, the last one would be 

19

questions related to and what role would the enforcement 

20

of these summonses have in helping your examination, 

21

which is one of the two purposes that might possibly 

22

apply to this case, in view of the fact that there's a 

23

tax court case pending and an FPAA has already been 

24

filed.  What could you possibly use this for in the course 

25

of your examination of these tax returns for 2005 to

40

Alderson Reporting Company

2000 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to me that if 

3

those are the questions you're going to ask, that almost 

4

every taxpayer's lawyer could ask those questions in 

5

almost every subpoena case.  I'm  I'm now concerned, I 

6

thought that there was agreement.  I now think there's 

7

much more to the government's position than I had 

8

thought with reference to harassment.  I think you can 

9

ask that in any tax case I've ever heard of. 

10

 MR. MAROD: 

Well, until the FPAA has already 

11

been issued, I'm sure you can't ask it.  And in most of 

12

these cases, the summonses are being enforced long 

13

before the statute of limitations comes.  If  if you 

14

look even at the tax advocate report that is included in 

15

the reply brief of the  referenced in the reply brief 

16

of the government in this case, you see that there were 

17

117 cases that were  had reported decisions over the 

18

last year.  And it lists who was represented and who 

19

wasn't, and almost no one was represented.  It simply 

20

was 12 people had lawyers, and only a couple of them 

21

resulted in IRS  in the IRS losing.  They said we 

22

lost, that they lost in this case.  We're not sure that 

23

they've lost yet.

Just to be clear on what 

you're  what you're asking us to do.  You want us to

affirm the judgment on  but on a different basis 

2

well, on  you do not concede it's a different basis. 

3

But the reason you want us to confirm the judgment

not to have the  the hearing.

 MR. MAROD: 

We believe it would be an abuse 

12

of discretion not to do it on the facts of this case 

13

because on the pleading standards established in Iqbal 

14

and Twombly, we did it in allegations and 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If I look at the statute 

16

you cited and come to a contrary conclusion, you're 

17

right, it takes a showing of fraud  what's the 

18

words  fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a

material fact

That's correct.

 to amend a Final 

And I apologize.  That's true. 
But since  yes, but 

that's a really big issue, because I think an IRS agent

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who says I want to make sure there's none of those 

2

things and that's why I'm issuing the subpoena has a 

3

legitimate basis.  So if I don't think it's an abuse of 

4

discretion or that you showed me much with respect to 

5

that issue, what's left for you?  What  what other 

6

fact would you  could you plausibly have stated? 

7

Because we already said in Powell that the expiration of 

8

the statute of limitations doesn't make a difference. 

9
10

 MR. MAROD: 

Correct. 

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They can always have a 

11

legitimate statement of wanting to make sure that none 

12

of those three things happened.  So what else in your 

13

allegations stands up? 

14
15

 MR. MAROD: 

Well, I'm not sure it's in my 

allegation.  I think it's in the affidavit.

right.  So what  I'm sorry.

 MR. MAROD: 

The affidavit that was

that was submitted.

In the facts.  Yes, all 

 by Frierfelder 
What else? 

 which said  which said I 

wanted to complete this examination and never mentioned

43

Alderson Reporting Company

1

anything about fraud or malfeasance, none of which have 

2

been even hinted about or suggested in this case as far 

3

as we're aware. 

4

 Now, that would be something  there's this 

5

 always this dual purpose problem that we have with 

6

the enforcement of these summonses.  If a summons has a 

7

proper purpose and an improper purpose, I'm not sure we 

8

can possibly win in that situation.  When we go to this 

9

preliminary hearing, we're trying to develop what 

10
11

evidence we can from the 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

There's an IRS 

12

regulation that says they can't use it in the 

13

criminal  in a criminal prosecution. 

14

 MR. MAROD: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Correct. 
So even if it was a dual 

16

purpose, what difference does it make since they can't 

17

use it? 

18

 MR. MAROD: 

Well, it's not the dual purpose 

19

 that's not the dual purpose I'm talking about.  The 

20

dual purpose that I'm talking about is, for instance, to 

21

use this evidence solely in the tax court after the tax 

22

court case has been filed, after the FPAA has been 

23

issued.  Just  Mary Frierfelder did not say that she 

24

was going to use this to try and investigate a fraud or 

25

a malfeasance or anything else like that.  She only said

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

she wanted it  she didn't say why she wanted it.  She 

2

said she had examined the tax returns and she had issued 

3

the FPAA and a tax court case is underway and seems to 

4

be just buying into the idea that the IRS has, which is 

5

that as long as you issue your summons before the FPAA 

6

comes out and a tax court case starts, you can enforce 

7

it no matter what.  There's no 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9
10

In your  in your 

experience, how often does the IRS ask a taxpayer to 
waive the statute of limitations? 

11

 MR. MAROD: 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Too much. 

I suspect that's 

14

your judgment.  But in your experience, how often do 

15

they do it? 

16

 MR. MAROD: 

I'd have to confer with my tax 

17

counsel, but in almost every significant case, they will 

18

ask for at least one extension of the statute of 

19

limitations.  They  all right. 

20

 Now, going back to Powell, which 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22
23

And what normally happens 

if you say no? 
 MR. MAROD: 

Usually they go forward and 

24

issue their Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment 

25

or their statutory notice of deficiency within the time

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's permitted.  Or if they don't think they've got a 

2

problem, they let it go.  That almost never happens, but 

3

the statutory notice of deficiency or the FPAA will come 

4

out.  You usually don't get, when you're nearing the end 

5

of the statute of limitations, a raft of summonses like 

6

this, except apparently in this case and in this 

7

particular district where it happens quite a bit. 

8

 We think that the rules set forth relating 

9

to grand jury subpoenas not being able to be used to 

10

bolster a criminal case after an indictment has already 

11

been issued is universally accepted.  We think that the 

12

Rule 2004 rule relating to bankruptcy subpoenas, which 

13

says that the bankruptcy subpoena can no longer be 

14

enforced once litigation is underway between the 

15

discovering party and the nondiscovering party about 

16

the subject of the actual subpoena is universally 

17

accepted. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you told me before, I 

19

think, that the tax court can stop it.  I asked you a 

20

question, could the tax court say now we're in court, 

21

any information has to be in compliance with the scope 

22

of discovery we allow.  You said because there's a 

23

separation and the summons is enforced by the district 

24

court, the tax court will do nothing and indeed will 

25

accept the information that is made available as a

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

result of the summons. 
 MR. MAROD: 

We believe that that is 

3

ordinarily true.  We can always make an argument to try 

4

and prevent particular evidence from coming in in the 

5

tax court, but we can't absolutely know that we're going 

6

to be able to stop it in the tax court.  It's going to 

7

be up to them to decide whether to accept the 

8

information. 

9

 The real issue in this case isn't the documents; it's the 

10

examination.  The examination that the IRS wants to take 

11

is an examination that basically has no strictures.  It 

12

has no absolute right for counsel to be in attendance. 

13

It has no right for crossexamination.  It has no limits 

14

on what the scope of the examination can be.  It can be 

15

what is referenced in a lot of the cases about IRS 

16

summonses, a fishing expedition. 

17

 And that's what the IRS wants to do here. 

18

And we're positive about that because of the way they've 

19

been pursuing this, including the deposition taken of 

20

Ms. Moog by  that Mr. Supinski attended.  He was 

21

permitted to attend.  We weren't invited to attend. 

22

 The matter was  ultimately came out that 

23

they didn't get much from Ms. Moog.  I'm sure that's why 

24

she agreed to go ahead and give that deposition.  But we 

25

couldn't insist on being there.  We couldn't have

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

insisted on crossexamining her.  And what the IRS 

2

attorney who's handling the Tax Court case we're 

3

positive wants to do, from all the things that have 

4

happened in that case, is to get the examinations of the 

5

individuals who were summoned without us being able to 

6

control it and without us being able to examine at 

7

those  at those examinations. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Do you agree with 

Ms. Harrington that the Salter case, where the 

10

government said in Salter, the First Circuit case, that 

11

the way to proceed is call  call the agent? 

12

Ms. Harrington said, if I remember correctly, that the 

13

Salter decision became academic when TEFRA passed. 

14

 Do you agree with that? 

15

 MR. MAROD: 

I do not agree with that.  We 

16

believe that, as Nero said, and I believe it was 

17

footnote 4 of Nero, that the TEFRA enactment only 

18

affected issues relating to potential abuse of process 

19

relating to criminal prosecutions, and  and it was to 

20

resolve a problem that was created by the decision 

21

that you couldn't go based on the intention of a single 

22

agent having an intention of pursuing criminal 

23

prosecution.  You had to look at the institutional 

24

intention of the IRS.  And that meant you had to take 

25

the testimony of everybody in the IRS to establish what

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the institutional intention was. 
 That got eliminated by TEFRA, because now it 

3

has to be  there's a referral or there is not a 

4

referral, and otherwise that issue doesn't come up.  But 

5

it doesn't deal with the situation in which Powell says 

6

we're entitled to show at a meaningful adversary hearing 

7

anything else showing abuse of the court process.  And 

8

that means abuse of the district court's process. 

9

 And to us, the use of the district court's 

10

process in enforcing an IRS summons that's supposed to 

11

be used only for examinations, one of which has already 

12

been completed, solely for the purpose of evading the 

13

rules of the  of the Tax Court that control discovery 

14

is an abuse of process.  And we believe that that's what 

15

all the 2004 cases talk about, the Rule 2004 cases, 

16

Szadkowski, Bennett Funding, and Snyder, which I believe 

17

we've  we've cited in our briefs. 

18

 We believe that if we don't get the ability 

19

to come forward with allegations that under Iqbal and 

20

Twombly would pass muster to support our allegations, 

21

that we're going to go back into the impermissible 

22

Catch22 that the  that the Eleventh Circuit talks 

23

about, and there'll be an unreasonable circular burden 

24

because we have to have evidence to get evidence, and we 

25

can't get the evidence without already having the evidence.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 In our case, with respect to the evasion of 

2

the Tax Court rules, we believe that we already 

3

presented enough evidence, but the trial court judge 

4

didn't even look at that evidence and said that you 

5

absolutely  that's  as a matter of law, that can't 

6

possibly be a defense to these summonses. 

7

 Congress intended the courts to be a check 

8

on abusive use of administrative summonses.  We believe 

9

that these  that we have shown by allegations and by 

10

our evidence that these were abusive attempts to use 

11

these administrative summonses.  We believe that the 

12

judgment of the Eleventh Circuit should be affirmed, and 

13

if necessary to clarify what appears that  a rule 

14

clarifying it as I've indicated with requiring pleadings 

15

that would pass muster under Iqbal would get you the 

16

entitlement of a preliminary hearing.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

Thank you, counsel. 

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON 

20

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Thank you.  If I just 

22

I'd like to start by clarifying the finality of the FPAA 

23

issue.  I tried to be very careful in my answer to 

24

Justice Breyer, and if I misspoke I apologize.  What I 

25

intended to say or what I wanted to say was that the

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ongoing issue for the IRS is  it might amend its final 

2

determination of liability for the taxpayer.  Once 

3

you're in the Tax Court, that happens in the Tax Court, 

4

not by amending the FPAA, and I didn't mean to suggest 

5

otherwise. 

6

 But  so thinking about the Tax Court 

7

Tax Court, once you have the proceedings going there, 

8

the Tax Court itself has said that if you have a summons 

9

that was issued before the FPAA, it can be helpful to 

10

have that summons enforced because the information that 

11

would be acquired through enforcing that summons would 

12

be relevant to the ultimate question in the Tax Court. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, I mean, if you change it to that, 

14

the only reason there that she in her affidavit, the 

15

agent, just says she wants the information to help 

16

decide the tax liability.  She doesn't say anything 

17

specific.  So you're saying the reason we wanted it is 

18

we wanted to change the tax liability possibly.  That's 

19

a matter in the Tax Court.  And therefore, you wanted it 

20

for the Tax Court. 

21

 So now there's a question. 

Can you use a 

22

subpoena enforced through a court to get information 

23

that you, I think, are saying  correct me if I'm not 

24

right  has no purpose other than to change, modify, or 

25

help our case in the Tax Court.

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, that is the reason 

2

for enforcing the summons.  That was not the reason for 

3

issuing the summons. 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I realize that. 

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

And Powell has pointed to 

6
7

the 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So if that is the only 

8

reason for enforcing the summons, I don't know, is there 

9

any more need for a hearing?  I mean, it's a legal 

10
11

question. 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

And the Tax Court has said 

12

that issuing a summons in that circumstance doesn't 

13

offend anything that's happening in the Tax Court.  As 

14

Justice Ginsburg said 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You said you can get 

16

information to help their case or change the liability 

17

in the Tax Court.  And they say you can't. 

18

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

And they can go, as Justice 

Ginsburg suggested, they can go to the tax 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I don't think we can decide 

that, can we? 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, they can go to the 

23

Tax Court and say:  Look, we don't think this 

24

information should be included.  That's what happens in 

25

the grand jury cases they cite.  They don't try  you

52

1

don't go and quash a grand jury subpoena.  What you do 

2

is you go in your criminal case in the district court 

3

and say:  You shouldn't use that information because it 

4

was obtained pursuant to a subpoena that was improperly 

5

issued. 

6

 Now, the taxpayer  it's the taxpayer's 

7

duty to establish that the deductions it's taking are 

8

justified.  And in this case, the IRS didn't have enough 

9

information to make its own determination about that. 

10

And so what it decided was the taxpayer hadn't met its 

11

burden, and it issued the FPAA.  And the IRS is entitled 

12

to take that protective step if the  if the taxpayer 

13

is refusing to turn over information. 

14

 Now, Respondents sort of pointed to several 

15

questions that they might want to ask the IRS agent who 

16

issued the summons.  Those questions are clearly not 

17

relevant to the purpose for issuing the summons.  Again, 

18

they just go to the purpose for enforcing the summons. 

19

 And just one last point on Iqbal. 

We really 

20

don't think Iqbal applies here, because in this  in 

21

this instance, what you are talking about is you already 

22

have a showing by the IRS that it has a proper purpose. 

23

And a district court is not going to issue an order to 

24

show cause unless the district court is satisfied that 

25

the IRS has established a proper purpose.

53

1

 And so the presumptions shift, are the 

2

opposite of Iqbal in that context.  In that context, 

3

there's a presumption that the IRS has a proper purpose. 

4

And this Court said in the LaSalle National Bank case 

5

that then the duty is on the summons opponent to 

6

disprove a proper purpose.  And so the opponent isn't 

7

entitled to a presumption that what they say is correct. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So could you say a little 

bit more, Ms. Harrington, about what  what kind of 

10

evidence would overcome the presumption in a particular 

11

case? 

12

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, so this Court 

13

identified in Powell two potential improper purposes: 

14

One would be harassment and one is an attempt to kind of 

15

leverage a settlement in a collateral matter.  And I 

16

think to take the second one, if the IRS were really 

17

trying to pressure a taxpayer into settling a collateral 

18

matter, the IRS would have some evidence of that; 

19

otherwise, it would be a pretty ineffective attempt to 

20

leverage a settlement.  So they're going to have some 

21

communications from the IRS or something like that, and 

22

the taxpayer can submit affidavits or any kind of 

23

documentary evidence that's in the taxpayer's possession 

24

or the summons recipient's position to the district 

25

court and then the district court has discretion if it

54

wants to hear more from the IRS, to ask for that more

information in whatever way it deems appropriate.
