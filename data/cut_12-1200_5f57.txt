 (10:11 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We will hear

5

Benefits Insurance Agency v. Arkison, the Chapter 7 

6

Trustee of the Estate of Bellingham Insurance Agency.

 Mr. HallwardDriemeier. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARDDRIEMEIER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Mr. Chief Justice 

and may it please the Court: 
 The judgment enforced against EBIA in this 

13

case was entered by a nonArticle III bankruptcy court 

14

pursuant to a statute that this Court has declared 

15

unconstitutional as violating the separation of powers. 

16

 The entry of a judgment of the United States 

17

is not nearly a matter of private interest to the 

18

litigants.  Rather, it carries the force of law that is 

19

binding on other courts, binding on the executive branch 

20

which must enforce the judgment, and even binding on the 

21

legislature which cannot reopen the judgment. 

22

 The entry of final judgment of the United 

23

States is the ultimate exercise of the judicial power 

24

under Article III, just as the enactment of legislation 

25

is the ultimate exercise of the legislative power under

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

Article I. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why should that matter 

3

given that, after the bankruptcy judge ruled, the U.S. 

4

District Court gave de novo review to this case and 

5

entered a final judgment that met all the requirements 

6

of Article III? 

7

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

The judgment that 

8

was entered by the district court was not an exercise of 

9

original jurisdiction but rather appellate jurisdiction. 

10

In fact, Section 1334 is clear that it confers the 

11

district court original jurisdiction, but once a 

12

judgment has been entered by the bankruptcy court, the 

13

review by the district court is an exercise of appellate 

14

jurisdiction under Section 158. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Here's something  I'm 

16

sorry.  Here's something that happens every day.  A 

17

district judge refers to a magistrate judge a motion for 

18

summary judgment.  The magistrate judge issues a report 

19

and recommendation.  The district judge reviews it de 

20

novo and may agree or disagree.  If it agrees, the 

21

district court will enter summary judgment. 

22

 I don't see a difference other than a purely 

23

semantic difference between that situation and what 

24

happened here. 

25

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Your Honor, the

Official

1

entry of judgment is the act of the judicial branch that 

2

carries the force of law.  The issuance of a report and 

3

recommendation by a magistrate does not.  It's only 

4

after the exercise of judgment and the entry of judgment 

5

that it has binding effect.  Binding on the other branches 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Are you talking about a 

7

mere formality?  Are you arguing that because it was the 

8

bankruptcy judge and not the district court judge who 

9

signed the final judgment, that that makes a difference? 

10
11
12
13
14
15
16

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

It  yes, Your 

Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's the essence of 

your argument. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

Because the active entry of judgment 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So if we vacated and 

17

remanded, and the district court looked at this, because 

18

it's already seen it, and basically just signed below 

19

the line that the bankruptcy judge signed, you would be 

20

okay? 

21

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

22

But the act of entering judgment is, both as a legal 

23

matter and as a practical matter, different from the 

24

appellate  exercise of appellate jurisdiction.  The 

25

act of entering judgment, the district court must  if

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it is the one entering the judgment, has to determine 

2

that judgment is properly entered.  It's a proper 

3

exercise of the appellate  of the Article III power. 

4

 The district court would have the 

5

discretion under Ninth Circuit law consistent with 

6

Anderson v. Liberty Lobby to carry a motion for summary 

7

judgment to allow the record to develop further.  That 

8

option, available to the district court when it's 

9

sitting as a matter of original jurisdiction, is not 

10
11
12

available to the district court sitting on appeal. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It reviewed this case de 

novo. 

13

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's true. 
And it decided that 

15

there were no issues, no factual issues in dispute and 

16

that the law clearly applied the way it did.  I don't 

17

understand why that option was taken away from it on 

18

appellate review. 

19

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

On appellate 

20

review, it had two options:  Affirm or reverse.  As an 

21

original matter, though, it would have had a third 

22

option, which would have been to deny the motion at that 

23

time to let the record develop more fully. 

24

 But more fundamentally 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why would the  why

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would the district judge do that when the district court 

2

said that there are no disputed issues, no relevant 

3

disputed issues of fact and it's a pure legal question? 

4

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, Your Honor, I 

5

truly believe that on this record, where there clearly 

6

were disputes between the two affidavits, that an 

7

Article III judge would not have entered summary 

8

judgment as an original matter.  Sitting as an appellate 

9

court where its decision was going to be subject to 

10

appellate review immediately, perhaps its analysis was 

11

different. 

12

 But I think more fundamentally, the absence 

13

of a judgment entered by a court with authority to do so 

14

means that the appellate court also lacks appellate 

15

jurisdiction, and this Court has so recognized in 

16

Ayrshire Collieries, in the Glidden case 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Will it be conceded, so 

18

far as you know, by your friends on the other side that 

19

this was appellate? 

20
21
22
23
24
25

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, I don't 

know 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What is it that makes it 

appellate? 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, 

Section 158(a) speaks in language of the district court

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exercising appellate jurisdiction.  It uses the word 

2

"jurisdiction."  So once the  in 157(b), a core matter 

3

such as this, the bankruptcy court is delegated 

4

authority to hear and determine and enter final judgment 

5

subject to review pursuant to Section 158. 

6

 Section 158(a) specifies that the district 

7

court is exercising appellate jurisdiction in that 

8

event.  So the district court 

9
10

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

It uses the word 

"appellate" 

11

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

13

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15
16

It uses 
 in 158? 
Yes, 158(a) says 

Which is where?  Where are 

you reading? 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I'm using the 

17

government's amicus brief, the statutory appendix that's 

18

on page 4a. 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I don't know why it wasn't 

in your brief. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

It is in our brief. 

22

The reason I cite to the government's brief is it also 

23

has 1334.  It's slightly more comprehensive. 

24
25

 So on page 4a of the government's statutory 
appendix, Section 158(a), "The district courts of the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

United States shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals." 
 This Court has, in numerous decisions, 

3

attributed significance to Congress's use of the word 

4

"jurisdiction," that Congress knows what the word means 

5

and when it uses that word, it means it is 

6

jurisdictional. 

7

 The  Section 1334, on the other hand, 

8

which is on page 14a of the government's statutory 

9

appendix, 1334(b) says that "The district courts shall 

10

have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all 

11

civil proceedings arising under Title 11." 

12

 So the district court does have original 

13

jurisdiction at the outset, but when it has referred the 

14

matter to the bankruptcy court and the bankruptcy court 

15

has entered final judgment, then pursuant to 157(b) and 

16

pursuant to 158(a), the district court is now exercising 

17

appellate jurisdiction. 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There is a  I 

19

want you to get on a bit, because I'd say the question 

20

that we're, at least for me, is one of congressional 

21

intent, not in necessarily your case but in future 

22

cases.  And the argument that is that the statute can be 

23

read, it silences, to say if Congress wanted to allow 

24

people in noncore cases to submit reports and 

25

recommendations, they surely would have wanted it in

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what they thought was a core case that turned out to be 

2

noncore. 

3

 So I want your response to that, and I would 

4

couple that with my own research for an opinion when I 

5

was one the First Circuit about the fraudulent 

6

conveyances, and they are about bankruptcy. 

7

 I grant you that there is a Statute of 

8

Elizabeth, it's a legal matter for several hundred 

9

years, but the person who is defrauded, the people 

10

defrauded are the creditors.  And in most instances, the 

11

fraud consists of transferring property to a friend, 

12

rather than a creditor, where you know you are 

13

insolvent. 

14

 Now, that is a legal matter. 

But it is 

15

about bankruptcy.  And it's State law, but it is about 

16

bankruptcy.  And it is, according to you  I may not 

17

agree with that, but I think we have to take it as 

18

noncore.  But why wouldn't Congress have, of course, 

19

wanted reports and recommendations if they couldn't get 

20

what they really wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy 

21

judge decide it? 

22

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

To be clear, 

23

Congress designated fraudulent conveyance actions as 

24

core. 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I know that, and I would

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have said they were right.  But, nonetheless, I am faced 

2

with case law that says to the contrary.  Okay.  So my 

3

question is, if they couldn't get  if they couldn't 

4

get what they wanted, which is to have the bankruptcy 

5

judge decide it, why wouldn't they at least have wanted 

6

the bankruptcy judge to write a report and 

7

recommendations and send it on to the district judge so 

8

he can review it de novo? 

9

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, I think that 

10

what's constraining the court is the language that 

11

Congress enacted.  Congress 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If I find an ambiguity in 

13

that language, then you would say I would be sensible to 

14

read it contrary to what you want. 

15

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

16
17

I  I don't 

believe there is an ambiguity, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, okay.  That's  I 

18

got that point.  One is you say, It's totally 

19

unambiguous, you can't do anything about it.  But if, in 

20

my opinion, it is  take it as a hypothetical  it's 

21

ambiguous enough to get what Congress wanted.  Now, can 

22

you give me any argument against what I just said? 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What is the ambiguity we 

are talking about? 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, the

Official

1

ambiguity  I actually think there is no ambiguity 

2

because 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

4

we are talking about? 

5

 (Laughter.) 

6

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

What is the nonambiguity 

Congress 

7

Congress very clearly distinguished a dichotomy between 

8

those cases in which the bankruptcy courts were to issue 

9

proposed findings and rec  conclusions and those that 

10
11

it was to hear and determine. 
 The cases that bankruptcy courts were to 

12

hear and determine were cases in which the bankruptcy 

13

courts were to enter final judgment subject only to 

14

appellate review 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I've got it.  I'd like an 

16

answer to my question.  My question is I want you to 

17

assume that the language is at least somewhat ambiguous. 

18

And on that assumption, is there any reason not to adopt 

19

the government's position. 

20

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

There are  there 

21

are several, Your Honor.  And part of the problem is 

22

that the question of how to construe that language in 

23

157(b) does not only affect how Stern claims are going 

24

to be handled, but also, all other claims under 157(b). 

25

Congress very clearly wanted an efficient system in

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which bankruptcy judges would enter judgment and there 

2

would be only appellate review by the district courts. 

3

 If the Court reads 157(b)'s "hear and 

4

determine" language to also encompass the authority to 

5

issue nonfinal reports and recommendations, that would 

6

not be limited to the class of cases covered by Stern 

7

that are core, but not 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

9

Well, why would we have to 

do that, Mr. HallwardDriemeier?  Why couldn't we say 

10

that this presents a distinct problem, these Sterntype 

11

claims, and it's really a problem of severability, and 

12

that we should understand this statute in light of Stern 

13

as essentially creating this middle category which 

14

Congress clearly meant to have the treatment that the 

15

noncore claims get. 

16

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

It's 

17

unfortunately, the statutory language does not admit 

18

of severance of the kind that Respondents suggest.  And 

19

that's because fraudulent conveyance actions are core, 

20

not simply because they're listed in 157(b)(2)(H), but 

21

because they are proceedings that arise under Title 11. 

22

That's the definition of core proceedings.  And so even 

23

if the Court were to line out 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But the definition  the 

definition was linked to a purpose.  You you laid out

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

very nicely the two categories; the one category where 

2

the bankruptcy judge enters a judgment, the other 

3

category where the bankruptcy judge makes 

4

recommendations.  So, if you  the purpose of the 

5

classification was to indicate the bankruptcy judge can 

6

make the final judgment, can only make recommendations. 

7

 Suppose the district judge had said, I'm 

8

uncertain after Stern about whether the bankruptcy judge 

9

had authority to enter a final judgment.  So I am going 

10

to treat that summary judgment as a recommendation. 

11

I'll treat it as a recommendation and I will review it 

12

de novo.  I agree, I enter final judgment. 

13
14
15

 If the district judge had said that, then 
you would have no case, right? 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I  I don't think 

16

that 157(b) envisions that the district court could do 

17

that.  The district court's review under  of a 

18

judgment entered under 157(b) is, on appeal, pursuant to 

19

158, which is an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, not 

20

original jurisdiction. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

If  if  if we believe 

22

that the word "determine" means make a final judgment, 

23

which you assert it means, so that there's no ambiguity, 

24

it seems to me you have a statute in which the 

25

bankruptcy judge is only authorized to make

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

recommendations in some situations and to make final 

2

judgments in others.  And surely, there's a problem with 

3

a district judge altering that disposition 

4
5
6

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

That  that's 

right. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 by just saying, oh, I 

7

know you're supposed to make a final determination, but 

8

just for fun, give me your recommendation.  I mean, 

9

that is just contrary to the statute. 

10
11
12

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

That's clearly not 

what Congress provided.  It had different 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Congress might have 

13

might have provided that if it had known about Stern, 

14

right? 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

17
18
19

true.  And 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But do we sit here to write 

the statutes that Congress would have written 

20

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, Your Honor. 

 if they knew about some 

22

future events?  I don't think so. 

23

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

24

fact, there are a number of 

25

That's  that's 

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And  and, in 

Well, we do try though,

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

again, to apply severability principles to write the 

2

statute that Congress would have written if it had known 

3

about a constitutional ruling.  And that's essentially 

4

what Justice Breyer is suggesting. 

5

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I think, Your 

6

Honor, there are two problems with that.  First is that 

7

by changing the definition of "core proceedings," there 

8

are other collateral consequences for other provisions 

9

of the code.  Under Section 1  1334(c), for example, 

10

there is an abstention in certain noncore proceedings. 

11

And so Congress has defined the scope of the abstention 

12

according to the same language that it uses in 157(b) 

13

whether a proceeding arises under Title 11 or does not 

14

do so, but is merely in relation to a case under Title 

15

11. 

16

 So if the Court goes and revises what 

17

Congress has provided as the definition of core in 

18

157(b), there will be collateral consequences for other 

19

statutes that Congress had enacted. 

20

 But the second point is that there are, as I 

21

think Justice Scalia was suggesting, policy decisions 

22

that really only Congress can make in deciding how to 

23

respond to Stern, because one can compare, for example, 

24

the provisions of 157(c)(1), which is the bankruptcy 

25

judge issuing a proposed findings and conclusions, and

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Magistrates Act, 636.  The two are actually quite 

2

different. 

3

 The magistrates, for example, are assigned a 

4

specific motion to consider and issue a report and 

5

recommendation on.  By contrast, the bankruptcy court in 

6

(c)(1) exercises jurisdiction over the entire 

7

proceeding, including up to conducting a trial in 

8

something that isn't subject to jury trial, and then 

9

issuing a report and recommendation to the district 

10
11

court. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But none of that is involved 

12

in this case.  We have this case in front of us.  We 

13

don't have every other possible case that could 

14

implicate this issue.  We have one case and it involves 

15

summary judgment. 

16

 And so there isn't  there are no findings 

17

of fact, and there is no substantive difference between 

18

a district court's reviewing a report and recommendation 

19

on summary judgment and what happened here.  I  I have 

20

heard nothing other than formalities. 

21
22
23

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

But the formalities 

matter. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why do they matter for 

24

Article III?  Maybe they matter for statutory reasons. 

25

Why do they matter for Article III?  What your client

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

got was exactly  substantively exactly what your 

2

client would have gotten had this been referred to a 

3

magistrate judge for a report and recommendation. 

4

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, I  to 

5

begin, I think the formalities do matter and not only do 

6

I think so.  This Court has repeatedly said that the 

7

absence of a judgment entered with authority means the 

8

absence of appellate jurisdiction as well.  And all the 

9

appellate court can do is to vacate and remand. 

10
11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, is Article III not 

violated so long as the parties are happy? 

12

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, Your Honor. 

Can the parties agree to 

14

have a  an Article III court decide a case it has no 

15

jurisdiction to decide, and so long as no harm is done 

16

to the parties, it's okay? 

17

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Quite  quite the 

18

contrary, Your Honor.  The Court has repeatedly stressed 

19

that the parties may not, by their agreement, confer 

20

jurisdiction that would not otherwise exist. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I thought there were two 

22

aspects to the Article III problem.  One affects the 

23

individuals and it's an unfairness, and the other is 

24

structural, as Justice Scalia has said.  But both are at 

25

issue.  And so where you have only a structural issue

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and it's a question of getting the bankruptcy courts to 

2

work and nobody's hurt by it, doesn't that at least cut 

3

in favor of interpreting a statute to prevent chaos 

4

not chaos, that's too strong  but to prevent  to 

5

allow the function of the court to work better? 

6

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

To the contrary, 

7

Your Honor, in Schor, the Court made clear that where 

8

the structural features of the Constitution are at 

9

issue, that is precisely where parties cannot be 

10

depended upon to assert the interest, and it cannot be 

11

joined by consent.  And here we have an example. 

12

 The constitutional violation identified by 

13

the Court in Stern existed for 25 years before the issue 

14

finally made it to this Court.  In part because parties 

15

were reluctant to assert that issue before a bankruptcy 

16

court in which its fate held. 

17

 The  the issues here, the other side says 

18

there is no structural problem because there's no 

19

aggrandizement or encroachment.  But to the contrary, 

20

Congress has reserved to itself power over bankruptcy 

21

judges that the Constitution denies it over Article III 

22

judges. 

23
24
25

 The President's power to appoint has been 
encroached upon. 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, couldn't you say the

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

same thing once again about magistrates, the exact same 

2

arguments would apply to them? 

3

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I think in large 

4

part they do.  Although there is a distinction, perhaps 

5

an important distinction, that in the Magistrates Act, 

6

the consent requirement is built into the statute. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I don't see why that 

8

would make a difference if you say the problem is 

9

congressional aggrandizement or congressional 

10

encroachment of a certain kind.  It doesn't seem to me 

11

to make any difference in that case, if Congress says, 

12

by the way, you can consent to it. 

13

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

You're absolutely 

14

right, Your Honor.  And I think that the problem that 

15

this Court identified in Stern and that we identify here 

16

applies equally to the magistrates.  But we have 

17

explained that that argument, even if not accepted in 

18

full, would distinguish our case from the Magistrates 

19

Act, because here, the Act enacted by Congress was 

20

unconstitutional.  It assigned, irregardless of consent, 

21

this action to determination and final judgment by a 

22

bankruptcy judge.  The Court considered this statute and 

23

held it unconstitutional in Stern. 

24
25

 So if consent were to cure the problem here, 
then the jurisdiction of the Court would depend solely

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on the consent of the parties.  If, on the other hand, 

2

the Court was considering in the first instance whether 

3

consent as a limiting feature on the jurisdiction of the 

4

nonArticle III body meant that there was not the types 

5

of structural problems that the Court identified in 

6

Stern, then it would be as part of the determination 

7

whether there was or was not an Article III violation in 

8

the first instance. 

9

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

May I ask you to clarify 

10

what you're saying about the constitutionality of the 

11

Magistrates Act?  Are you saying that it is 

12

unconstitutional insofar as it allows magistrate judges 

13

to try matters by consent, or are you saying further 

14

that it is unconstitutional insofar as it allows a 

15

district judge to refer a dispositive matter to a 

16

magistrate judge for a report and recommendation subject 

17

to de novo review, or both? 

18
19
20
21
22
23

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Only  only the 

former, Your Honor. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

The former is not implicated 

in this case. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

That  that's 

right.  I was answer  just answering the question 

24

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

25

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I see. 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

 about the logic

Official

1

of the argument and how far it went. 

2

 And  and, I guess, again, what we suggest 

3

is that there might be a distinction when the Court is 

4

considering a statute.  And as Schor lays out the many 

5

factors that the Court might consider, the fact that 

6

consent is a limiting feature on the nonArticle III 

7

body's jurisdiction might lead the Court to conclude 

8

there was no Article III violation. 

9

 But here, where there was no consent in this 

10

statute, the Court has already held in Stern that there 

11

was an Article III violation.  The statute does not 

12

constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the bankruptcy 

13

courts.  So if there is jurisdiction here, it would be 

14

purely a matter of private party consent.  And that's 

15

precisely what the Court has held is not permissible as 

16

a matter of jurisdiction. 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So are you saying, 

18

contrary to our case law, that you can never have 

19

implied consent?  We have held differently in other 

20

cases. 

21

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I'm not arguing 

22

that there cannot be implied consent, but in Roell, 

23

as  as a construction of the Magistrates Act, the 

24

Court held that consent must be knowing and voluntary. 

25

There, of course, the litigant had notice because the

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute had advised the litigant that it had the right 

2

to refuse consent. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You're confusing me.  I 

4

thought you  you did say that there can't be implied 

5

consent or even express consent to what happened here. 

6

Isn't that your position? 

7

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

I'm  I'm sorry. 

8

I was  I was  I thought I was answering a different 

9

question.  In our view, consent cannot be the basis for 

10

the exercise of jurisdiction by a nonArticle III court. 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

12

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Express or implied. 

13

That's right, Your Honor. 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Express or implied. 

I thought that's what 
So this is the 

16

subsidiary argument, our, really, fallback argument, 

17

which is to say, even if consent could play a role, it 

18

would only be where that was part of the statute, and 

19

thus, part of the Court's analysis of whether this 

20

statute was constitutional. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

22

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

23
24
25

I'm a little confused. 
I'm sorry, Your 

Honor. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Let's just save your 

time.  I'll ask on rebuttal.

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

So there  there 

2

were two cases that the other side had cited, Roell and 

3

McDonald, for that point.  But in each case, the statute 

4

itself featured consent as a limiting feature on the 

5

nonArticle III court's authority. 

6
7

 If there are no further questions, I'll 
reserve the balance of my time.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

 Mr. Pottow. 

10

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN POTTOW 

11

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 

12
13
14

 MR. POTTOW: 

Thank you, counsel. 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, 

and may it please the Court: 
 Justice Alito is entirely correct, for the 

15

reason we can win the most straightforward way is 

16

because he got everything he wanted in the courts below. 

17

And I would like to also address Justice Ginsburg's 

18

question about what could have happened in the 

19

hypothetical situation. 

20

 But if I may begin, please, I'd like to 

21

address Justice Scalia's point about where's the 

22

ambiguity in the statute.  And unfortunately, my friend 

23

and I disagree, because I think the statute under 

24

157(b)(1) is unambiguous in my favor. 

25

 So if I could take you back to the statute,

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and I'll use the Solicitor General's brief for 

2

convenience.  157(b)(1) is the provision by which 

3

district courts, if they want to  there's no 

4

compulsion on these Article III officers  if they want 

5

to, they can refer matters to bankruptcy judges.  And it 

6

says, when there is a matter referred, that they may 

7

hear and determine the matter and may enter an order or 

8

judgment. 

9

 My interpretation, I believe, is the more 

10

natural one of "may enter an order and judgment," it's a 

11

permissive grant of authority.  There's no compulsion to 

12

enter an order and judgment.  They can simply hear and 

13

determine the matter and not enter an order and 

14

judgment.  And I can contrast this textual language 

15

you don't have to go very far  down in (c)(1) and 

16

(c)(2), where (c)(2), there was only one "may," they 

17

don't have the double "may permissive grant of 

18

authority."  And there's  and in the noncore matters, 

19

there's a  a "it shall," when "it shall determine." 

20

They use the verb "shall" in (c)(2).  So I think that 

21

(b)(1) with two uses of "may" is very clear that when a 

22

matter is referred under (b)(1), they may enter an order 

23

of judgment, but don't have to enter an order of 

24

judgment.  And I think that gets us around his 

25

difficulty 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Does that bear on the 

2

question whether this is appellate?  Do you agree that 

3

this is appellate, once the district judge  district 

4

court has the matter in front of it? 

5

 MR. POTTOW: 

So if there is a judgment, I 

6

would concede that we then have an appeal that occurs, 

7

Justice Kennedy. 

8
9
10

 But what is critically important why I think 
that doesn't create a problem 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If there is a judgment in 

11

the bankruptcy court, you would concede there is an 

12

appeal to the district court? 

13
14

 MR. POTTOW: 

If there is a district  for 

example, in a noncore proceedings 

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

 MR. POTTOW: 

Yes. 
I'm sorry.  In a core 

17

proceeding where there would be a judgment in the 

18

bankruptcy court, I would concede that that would be an 

19

appellate matter before the district court, if there was 

20

a full judgment. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you  you read me 

22

want me to read that  that when a district judge 

23

refers the matter to a bankruptcy judge to hear and 

24

determine and to enter an appropriate order, the 

25

bankruptcy judge can say, you know, I'm just too busy.

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. POTTOW: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  No. 
I'm on Easter vacation and 

3

I may hear and determine it, and I may enter appropriate 

4

orders, but I don't feel like it. 

5

 MR. POTTOW: 

No.  The "may  the "may" 

6

prerogative, Justice Scalia, is with the district court. 

7

The district court may refer to it and it may refer to a 

8

final judgment or may not. 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It doesn't say that it may 

10

refer.  It says, "bankruptcy judges may hear and 

11

determine." 

12

 MR. POTTOW: 

At the instruction of the 

13

district judge.  I don't believe the bankruptcy judge 

14

has the authority to feel lazy or disinclined. 

15
16
17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How do you bring the "may" 

over to the district court? 
 MR. POTTOW: 

In the order of reference, so 

18

we have to go back to 157(a), which is what  what 

19

starts with the whole reference of cases from district 

20

courts.  Recall that a bankruptcy court is a unit of the 

21

district court.  So as an institutional matter, it's the 

22

district court that exercises jurisdiction. 

23

 Under 1334, the Federal subject matter 

24

jurisdiction of bankruptcy is vested in the district 

25

court.  Now, as a matter of which officer 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Then then the "may" that you're 

2

concerned with is the "may" in (a), not the "may" in 

3

(b). 

4

 MR. POTTOW: 

I  I use both of those "mays" 

5

if I may, Justice Scalia.  And  and I think that 

6

the  that the revision post Stern of many district 

7

courts that government puts forward in appendix of how 

8

these courts have changed their orders of references 

9

have explicitly used this power.  And they say for 

10

matters in which we refer a statutorily core proceeding, 

11

we would  but there is a Stern claim that arises.  So 

12

when we refer a claim and you think that Article III 

13

presents a problem, we do not want you to enter a final 

14

judgment.  On those referred proceedings, we only want 

15

you to enter a report and recommendation. 

16

 So the district courts below are working 

17

this out by changing their orders of references and not 

18

having them enter judgment. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And what the other side 

20

says is that's very nice, but that's not what the 

21

statute says.  The statute does not give the bankruptcy 

22

court the authority to enter a  a simply 

23

recommendation for what has been defined as a core 

24

proceeding. 

25

 For core proceedings, what the statute says

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is you'll  is you'll determine it.  And you're saying, 

2

well, it says that, but since it's been held 

3

unconstitutional, we're going to shift this over to 

4

the  to the category in which they  they can issue 

5

an order and recommendation.  Where does that come from? 

6

 MR. POTTOW: 

I think it has to come from a 

7

textual disagreement with my friend.  He says the phrase 

8

"may hear and determine" should be read to mean must 

9

determine and enter a final judgment.  And I think the 

10

textual phrase "may hear and determine" and "may enter 

11

an order or judgment," suggests that they, if referred 

12

to by the district court, may enter a judgment. 

13

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, that's not my problem. 

14

My problem is  is not why they don't have to enter an 

15

order and judgment.  My problem is why they are 

16

authorized to issue a recommendation. 

17

 MR. POTTOW: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, because I don't think 
Where does that come from? 

19

They're not issued  they're not authorized to issue 

20

recommendations for core proceedings. 

21

 MR. POTTOW: 

I see.  I don't believe, 

22

Justice Scalia, that the issuance of a report is a 

23

matter of such significance that there would need to be 

24

an explicit reference to what issue in a report.  A 

25

judgment, if you contrast Section 157 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Oh, really?  I mean, can a 

2

district judge sort of  you know, it's not terribly 

3

important because it's just a recommendation.  So I'm 

4

going to refer it to my former partner, you know, my 

5

former law partner. 

6
7
8
9
10

 MR. POTTOW: 

But with the consent of the 

parties? 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, even with the consent 

of the parties. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

That would be a special master 

11

situation, I think, Justice Scalia.  If they  if they 

12

referred, and the district  yes, the district court 

13

would have inherent authority to refer an issue to a 

14

special master. 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

 MR. POTTOW: 

17

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

To a special master. 
Yes. 
But it has statutory 

18

authority to do that.  There is no statutory authority 

19

here to refer a matter to a bankruptcy judge for nothing 

20

other than a recommendation, except for noncore matters. 

21

 MR. POTTOW: 

And  and our position would 

22

be that the issuance of report does not require a 

23

statutory authorization the way the entry of a judgment 

24

requires a statutory authorization.  So the contrasting 

25

treatment under 157(c) of noncore matters is very 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You're saying basically, I 

2

think, the words are, for core proceedings, it 

3

gives the power to the bankruptcy judge to hear and 

4

determine. 

5

 MR. POTTOW: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes. 
And if I tell the assistant 

7

chef, you deal with orders for bacon and eggs, that 

8

might mean that the assistant chef can deal with eggs 

9

orders alone, or it might mean only those that order 

10

both. 

11

 MR. POTTOW: 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

13
14

Yes. 
That's why I thought 

perhaps it's ambiguous. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

Yes.  And  and if there's 

15

further, Justice Breyer, if there's a successive "may" 

16

afterwards, after the bacon and eggs, "and may prepare a 

17

dessert as well," that's even more permissive in 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So it can do that for core 

19

 for those core proceedings that were not held 

20

unconstitutional under Stern, right? 

21

 MR. POTTOW: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

say just give me the eggs. 

Yes.  And that was 

24

 MR. POTTOW: 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It can just refer them and 

Yes, that's right. 
I don't need the bacon.

31

Alderson Reporting Company

 MR. POTTOW: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3
4

And that was the practice 
You don't have to determine 

it; just give me your recommendation. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

Yes.  And that was a practice 

5

even before Stern.  Some courts did that; they had them 

6

just refer on straightup core claims to give the 

7

reports and recommendations.  There's a case out of the 

8

Tenth Circuit called 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It seems to me the 

10

dichotomy set forth in the statute disappears once you 

11

say "hear and determine" means either "hear and 

12

determine" or "hear or determine." 

13

 MR. POTTOW: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

15
16

But I don't think 
The whole dichotomy of the 

statute disappears. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

Justice Scalia, I don't think 

17

 I don't think it's a dichotomy.  I think that  what 

18

they're worried  I believe what the Congress is 

19

worried about is by putting express constraints on the 

20

entry of a judgment, for precisely the reasons Mr. 

21

HallwardDriemeier says that judgments are a matter of 

22

some, at least formalistic significance, that they put a 

23

constraint on what you can do regarding entry of a 

24

judgment. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  Can I go to

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that for a second? 

2

 MR. POTTOW: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
Because let's deal with 

4

statutory language, okay?  I get the core of your 

5

argument to be as follows; pardon the puns. 

6
7

 That for statutorily core proceedings that 
constitutionally are not core 

8

 MR. POTTOW: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

10
11

Yes. 
 we should treat them 

as noncore proceedings.  Am I at your point? 
 MR. POTTOW: 

Yes.  But I  I want to be 

12

clear.  I'm not shoehorning them into the category of 

13

noncore.  I'm saying we should accord them the same 

14

treatment that is accorded to noncore proceedings. 

15
16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

accord them the same treatment 

17

 MR. POTTOW: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

So if we're going to 

Yes. 
 what do I do with 

Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012 

20

 MR. POTTOW: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
 which explicitly 

22

states, quote:  "In noncore proceedings, final orders 

23

and judgments shall not be entered on the bankruptcy 

24

judge's order except with the 'express consent of the 

25

parties.'"  So, now you're telling me we're going to

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have a third category.  Makes very little sense to me, 

2

okay?  Which is you need express consent for a 

3

magistrate judge to issue a final judgment in a noncore 

4

proceeding, but you can have express or implied consent 

5

to enter the final judgment in core proceedings. 

6

 MR. POTTOW: 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think 
That  that makes 

8

very  I understand treating it like noncore 

9

proceeding, but if we're going to treat it that way, 

10

then I think you have to treat it that way for all 

11

purposes, not pick and choose the ones you want. 

12

 MR. POTTOW: 

I  first of all, I'd like to 

13

give you some hope, Justice Sotomayor, which is there is 

14

amendments to Rule 7012 that's percolating up to this 

15

Court for  for consideration to address this issue.  In 

16

the interim, this is what happened in Roell.  In Roell, 

17

we had a rule of procedure that said there must be 

18

express consent before there is the  the trial before 

19

a magistrate judge, a civil trial before a magistrate 

20

judge, which we do believe is the exact same system as 

21

the bankruptcy court judge. 

22

 And what this Court held was when there's a 

23

violation of that rule, right?  When there's not express 

24

consent, if there is, in fact, true consent based on the 

25

conduct, then consent is what matters and it can trump

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the rule.  And that's the square holding of Roell.  So 

2

we would argue that 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The language of Roell, 

4

the magistrate judge's language didn't use the word 

5

the language in Roell, the magistrate judge's language 

6

didn't use the word "express consent."  It just  the 

7

part  "the clerk shall give written notice to the 

8

parties of their opportunity to consent to the 

9

exercise." 

10

 MR. POTTOW: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

12
13

No, but 
So the word "express" 

was not in the magistrate judge's act. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

No, no, no, no.  So in the act, 

14

in the statute, there was just a reference to consent, 

15

just like we have here in noncore proceedings reference 

16

to consent.  In the rules 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, here you have to 

express consent. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

Yes.  In  in the rules, there 

20

is a requirement under bankruptcy for express consent, 

21

and under Roell, there was a rule for a

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

 MR. POTTOW: 

Got it. 
Okay. 
Okay.  Now I understand. 
May I  if I may, I'd like to

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

go back to the question that Justice Kennedy raised and 

2

also back to Justice Alito's and Justice Ginsburg 

3

before. 

4

 What makes this unusual if  even if I do 

5

concede that it's an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, 

6

is unlike all the cases cited when talked about the 

7

limited appellate jurisdiction of something like a 

8

circuit court of appeals.  There's a statutory 

9

constraint.  A circuit court of appeals can't enter 

10

judgment if it wants to to fix a trial court that forgot 

11

to enter judgment. 

12

 By contrast, district courts in bankruptcy 

13

can enter judgments; they have both appellate and 

14

original jurisdiction.  They can withdraw the reference 

15

from a bankruptcy court under 157(d) and they can enter 

16

judgment.  So the Petitioner in this case got everything 

17

it wanted.  It had an Article III consideration of its 

18

fraudulent conveyance defense before Chief Judge Pechman 

19

of the Western District of Washington, and they lost. 

20

And on  on page 45A of the Pet. App, you can see that 

21

Chief Judge Pechman meticulously spells out her standard 

22

of review.  She says  she spends a whole page on it 

23

saying this is going to be de novo review, and she 

24

writes a 12page opinion with complete de novo review, 

25

saying this is why you lose on the State claim; this is

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

why you lose on the Federal claim; this is why you lose 

2

on the alter ego claim.  And she says there is no 

3

genuine issue of material fact that has been submitted 

4

on this record. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You would concede 

6

that your case would be  you would not have a case if 

7

we were dealing with factual findings? 

8
9

 MR. POTTOW: 

Yes, that is  I believe, 

Mr. Chief Justice, this is a unique factual posture, 

10

because other  you can't have de novo review of a fact 

11

that there'd be a clearly erroneous standard.  But 

12

that's not what we have here today. 

13

 And regarding his  my friend's secondary 

14

argument that even if consent is permissible under the 

15

Constitution, and with respect, I do believe this Court 

16

has held that consent is permissible as a grand 

17

constitutional matter, the trilogy of magistrate cases 

18

of Peretz and Roell and Gonzales make it clear that 

19

consensual voir dire is okay; and in discussing 

20

consensual voir dire, this Court explicitly says because 

21

voir dire is comparable in importance to entry of civil 

22

judgment with the consent, which is what magistrate 

23

judges can do.  So I believe this Court has already 

24

blessed the entry of civil judgment by magistrate judges 

25

upon the consent of the parties as a constitutional

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

matter for 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I want to go back to your 

3

statement that the district court here has both original 

4

and appellate jurisdiction because it can recall the 

5

reference to the bankruptcy judge.  Can it recall the 

6

reference after the bankruptcy judge has issued his 

7

decision in the case? 

8

 MR. POTTOW: 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

10
11

I don't 
Has entered a judgment in 

the case? 
 MR. POTTOW: 

I think that would be  I 

12

don't have any case authority for whether they can do 

13

that or not.  And I share Your Honor's skepticism that 

14

that would be  that would create a statutory problem. 

15

But the question we have here is whether there's an 

16

article  even if we concede a statutory violation, 

17

which I don't, by the way; I think that this is  it's 

18

very clear that there was consent of the parties, that 

19

they went before the bankruptcy judge, and he went in 

20

with wide  eyes wide open.  So I'm spending all this 

21

time talking about a backup argument, as to if we 

22

assume, arguendo, that the bankruptcy judgment was 

23

illegitimate, we still win.  And that's why I said it's 

24

the most straightforward way to resolve this case.  If 

25

it was illegitimate, we still win because of the de novo

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

review. 
 My friend tries to disparage Chief Judge 

3

Pechman's and say well, it really wasn't de novo because 

4

even though she spent a page saying I'm doing a de novo 

5

review, I found the word "substantial" and "evidence" 

6

juxtaposed on page 50A of the Pet. App.  And I don't 

7

think that's a fair reading of her opinion.  I think if 

8

you read her analysis, it's quite de novo; she goes 

9

through all the evidence that's submitted and says no 

10

genuine issue of material fact; judgment as a matter of 

11

law. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But she did say that EBIA 

13

had the burden to demonstrate error in the bankruptcy 

14

courts. 

15

 MR. POTTOW: 

That  she does say that at 

16

one point in her opinion.  But I believe if we read the 

17

analysis in its context, it is clear that she's 

18

according a full de novo review of the claims.  And I 

19

think that  I don't think she misunderstood the  the 

20

standard of review that should be done and the true de 

21

novo nature of it. 

22

 But if I may, I'd like to comment on my 

23

friend's backup argument.  If  if the Court agrees 

24

with me that Article III is not imperiled by consensual 

25

adjudicative regimes like the magistrate's civil

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

judgments and the bankruptcy court noncore proceedings 

2

which, by the way, I would like to remind the Court that 

3

in Stern itself, you did quote Section 157(c)(2), which 

4

is the noncore consensual proceedings in an opinion 

5

exclusively devoted to Article III. 

6

 My friend says, well, as a backup, even if 

7

that's constitutionally okay, I have to have notice that 

8

I can withhold my consent.  And under the statute, it's 

9

clear that on a noncore claim under 157(c)(2), the 

10

parties have to consent.  And he says, but I had a Stern 

11

claim so I didn't really know that I was a noncore claim 

12

and could withhold my consent. 

13

 So it's a oneoff, quirky argument he's 

14

making because he had a Stern claim before Stern. 

15

That's belied  sorry. 

16
17
18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry.  Go 

ahead. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

I was going to say, that's 

19

belied by the pleadings in his  in his answer to the 

20

complaint, which is at page 80 of the Joint Appendix on 

21

the jurisdictional allegations of the Trustee, this is a 

22

core proceeding.  He says denied.  So he thought he had 

23

a noncore proceeding. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You're right.  We've 

been talking about backup arguments to backup arguments.

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Your central argument is that the consent of the parties 

2

can overcome what Stern identified as a structural 

3

separation of powers problem. 

4

 MR. POTTOW: 

I would  I would  I would 

5

slightly rephrase that, Mr. Chief Justice, and say what 

6

Stern defined as the problem was the adjudication of the 

7

private right without the consent of the parties.  So I 

8

think it's already intrinsic in how Stern 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I guess that's 

10

my question.  Is there any other case where we've said 

11

the consent of the parties can overcome a constitutional 

12

structural separation of powers? 

13

 MR. POTTOW: 

Well, in the Heckers case, 

14

which we cite in our material, the old  the old 

15

Special Master's case, that's what happened.  There was 

16

a reference to a referee.  And when there's  and it's 

17

a  it's a twopart thing, Mr. Chief Justice.  It's not 

18

just the consent of the parties, remember; it's the 

19

referral by the district court.  So if the district 

20

court feels that its Article III authority is being 

21

impinged upon, it has no obligation to refer matters out 

22

to a bankruptcy judge.  The parties can say, we consent. 

23

We want to go to the bankruptcy judge. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We've already told 

the district court, haven't we, that its Article III

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

status is infringed when he refers or when there's a 

2

reference to a nonArticle III tribunal? 

3

 MR. POTTOW: 

No, in  I  that's why I 

4

said I think it's two necessary conditions.  I think 

5

there has to be both district court permission to grant 

6

the reference out and the consent of the parties.  Okay. 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if the district 

8

court refers the case to his law partners, and that's 

9

fine with the parties, that law partner can enter a 

10

final judgment in the case subject only to appellate 

11

review? 

12
13
14
15
16

 MR. POTTOW: 

That's what Heckers said. 

Heckers  and that  that's basically 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is that what you're 

saying? 
 MR. POTTOW: 

Yes, that's a Special Master. 

17

That's what a Special Master is. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The Special Masters 

19

do not enter final judgment subject only to appellate 

20

review. 

21

 MR. POTTOW: 

Well, technically if we want to 

22

go to the procedure of what these equity officers 

23

did, was they would prepare their report, and because 

24

they're acting as officers of the court, and then the 

25

clerk of court enters judgment.  So the adjudicative

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

thinking 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But the appellate 

3

review is the important thing.  The Article III court, 

4

under your submission, is giving up its authority to 

5

enter factual findings.  It's giving that authority to a 

6

nonArticle III tribunal, and it can only review those 

7

findings under clearly erroneous standard. 

8
9
10

 MR. POTTOW: 

That  that is the current 

system of the magistrate judges under 636. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, I know it's 

11

the current system under the magistrate judges.  We held 

12

that unconstitutional in the bankruptcy context. 

13

 MR. POTTOW: 

No, you held it 

14

unconstitutional regarding an objecting defendant. 

15

There's been hundreds of years of consensual 

16

adjudication with these inferior judicial officers, as 

17

that they were called in the earlier cases, such as 

18

GoBart. 

19

 They are officers. 

They're inferior 

20

judicial officers, and they are controlled by the 

21

Article III judiciary.  The Article III judiciary 

22

retains the control to use them or not use them as they 

23

want, and parties can't be forced to do them over their 

24

 without their consent. 

25

 So when this Court has had opportunity to

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

address Article III concerns of this, they have always 

2

relied upon the lack of consent as a problem.  And 

3

that's why this Court's formulation in Stern, I think, 

4

is critical, just following Union Carbide, and indeed 

5

every opinion in Northern Pipeline, going back to the 

6

MacDonald case under the old act.  What matters 

7

is the lack of consent.  Plenary matters can't be tried 

8

without consent under the old Bankruptcy Act.  When 

9

there is consent, this Court held in MacDonald, 

10

that's fine.  Indeed, when there's implied consent, this 

11

court held in Klein against Baker in the American 

12

College's amicus brief, that's fine. 

13

 And as the American College also lays out 

14

well, these old statutory cases under the old Bankruptcy 

15

Act were interpreted with constitutional values in mind. 

16

The old act was very cryptically drafted and tersely 

17

drafted, so this Court used constitutional principles in 

18

interpreting the scope of the old Bankruptcy Act and 

19

upholding the consensual adjudication of plenary matters 

20

when there is consent. 

21

 So our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, is 

22

yes, we do think that the consent matters.  And the final 

23

thing I'd like to say is, my friend cast this narrative. 

24

He said, well, how do you know I consented through my 

25

implied conduct to the noncore claim?  Remember, he did

44

Alderson Reporting Company

4

plead it was noncore in his answer, and  my red light. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Finish your 

sentence. 
 MR. POTTOW: 

I was going to say is that his 

5

codefendant won before the very same bankruptcy judge. 

6

So he made a tactical decision he is trying us to 

7

secondguess ex post now that he's lost. 

8

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

9

 Mr. Gannon. 

Thank you, counsel. 

10

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON, 

11

 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 

12

 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT 

13

 MR. GANNON: 

14

please the Court: 

15

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 We believe that a party may consent to have 

16

a fraudulent conveyance claim determined by a bankruptcy 

17

judge.  And even in the absence of consent, principles 

18

of severability justify treating such an action as a 

19

noncore proceeding in which a bankruptcy judge may enter 

20

proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 

21

There's also one other aspect of our argument that has 

22

not yet been mentioned this morning, which is that we 

23

think that even if consent is not adequate to cure the 

24

constitutional violation or if you find that there is 

25

not adequate consent on this record, we think that it

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would still be open to you to find that petitioner has 

2

forfeited this constitutional argument. 

3

 Constitutional arguments can be forfeited. 

4

He has not  he did not advance this argument at any 

5

point  any reasonable point before the bankruptcy 

6

judge, before the district judge, until he was before 

7

the Court of Appeals.  Indeed, I think it's telling that 

8

this Court had already granted certiorari in Stern and 

9

had already heard oral argument in Stern before the 

10

district court even ruled on the motion for summary 

11

judgment. 

12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's true, but if you were 

13

in the Ninth Circuit, and I would have  you would have 

14

thought this was a core proceeding. 

15
16
17

 MR. GANNON: 

You might have thought the same 

thing. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

So he says, you know, of 

18

course I didn't object.  I am faced with all kinds of 

19

precedent that say it's impossible; and therefore, there 

20

is no reason to object.  That wasn't consent. 

21

 MR. GANNON: 

If there was true futility 

22

and I'm not talking about the consent argument now, 

23

Justice Breyer.  I'm talking about a forfeiture argument 

24

for purposes of preserving an argument on appeal.  And 

25

if it were truly futile, I think that a Court of Appeals

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could overlook that type of forfeiture.  I don't think 

2

that it was futile here.  I think it is demonstrated by 

3

the fact that Stern itself came out of the Ninth 

4

Circuit.  The litigants there were making those 

5

arguments, and indeed the Healthcentral.Com case the 

6

petitioner relies upon just had a discussion of the 

7

Seventh Amendment. 

8

 I don't think it clearly foreclosed this 

9

claim for purposes of the constitutional argument 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And the answer suggested 

11

it because we he was claiming the fraudulent conveyance 

12

claim in his answer was noncore.  So he had the basis of 

13

the argument. 

14

 MR. GANNON: 

Yes, I think it's  he 

15

certainly did, as my colleague already pointed out on 

16

page 80 of the Joint Appendix and paragraph 2.1 of the 

17

answer denied the allegation that this was a core 

18

proceeding. 

19

 And if you look, then, to 157(c)(1) and (2), 

20

the statute made consent relevant at that point, and 

21

Rule 7012, which, Justice Sotomayor, you were earlier 

22

quoting, made it clear that he was obliged, then, to 

23

or petitioner was obliged, then, to  to give consent 

24

or not. 

25

 But if I can turn to the severability

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question, which was also the focus of a lot of the 

2

argument before, Justice Scalia, you pointed out that 

3

Congress can rewrite the statute the way it wants to. 

4

And that's, of course, true.  But it is always the case 

5

when this Court gets to a severability analysis that 

6

Congress didn't get its first option.  Here, Congress 

7

did include a severability clause in the 1984 Act.  It's 

8

in Section 119, and it says, if any provision of this 

9

statute or any application thereof is held to be 

10
11

unconstitutional we want the rest to stand. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

That's what I 

12

thought severability was.  If you carve  if you find 

13

part of it unconstitutional, you ask whether what is 

14

left can stand.  You don't say that we're going to 

15

rewrite what is left. 

16

 MR. GANNON: 

I don't think any rewriting is 

17

required here, Mr. Chief Justice.  And I think that this is 

18

actually essentially what the Court has already said in 

19

Stern.  In Stern, on page 2620, this Court characterized 

20

the effect of its decision as being, "The removal of 

21

Vicky's counterclaim there from core bankruptcy 

22

jurisdiction." 

23

 And the consequence of that is that, because 

24

the Congress had divided the world into core and noncore 

25

proceedings in the wake of Northern Pipeline, thinking

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that the distinction between them was core proceedings 

2

were ones in which bankruptcy judges would have 

3

authority, constitutional authority to enter final 

4

judgments; noncore proceedings were ones in which they 

5

could not do that without consent, or they would only be 

6

able to provide proposed findings of fact and 

7

conclusions of law. 

8
9

 And in the same paragraph where this Court noted 
that the effect of its decision was effectively to 

10

remove this, that type of counterclaim from core 

11

jurisdiction, it said that it did not expect that this 

12

decision would meaningfully change the division of labor 

13

between the bankruptcy and district court judges, 

14

precisely because Pearce Marshall was not contesting the 

15

idea that bankruptcy judges would still be able to enter 

16

proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law. 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Or it may be because 

18

the particular claim at issue in Stern was one that 

19

wasn't expected to arise in the normal course in 

20

bankruptcy proceedings. 

21

 MR. GANNON: 

Well, that  that may be 

22

something the Court was thinking.  In that particular 

23

paragraph, the Court mentioned the fact that Pearce 

24

Marshall was not contesting the district court's ability 

25

to take proposed findings of fact and conclusions of

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

law. 
 And as Mr. Pottow already observed, many 

3

district courts have already taken this action in 

4

response to Stern.  In the appendix to our brief at 

5

pages 15A to 17A, we list 25 of those districts.  Since 

6

our brief was filed, two more districts have adopted 

7

similar provisions in Rhode Island and in New Hampshire. 

8

And we think that that is telling. 

9

 I also think, with respect to the underlying 

10

constitutional claim, if I could elaborate a little bit 

11

on what my colleague was saying in response to the 

12

questions from the Chief Justice about instances in 

13

which Article III judges may indeed delegate the ability 

14

to enter certain decisions with which the district 

15

court's subsequent ability to over  to look over that 

16

decision will be cabined by the action that has happened 

17

with the consent of the parties. 

18

 My friend was talking about the Heckers 

19

case.  That was one in which the order of reference 

20

specifically provided that judgment would be entered in 

21

conformity with a referee's report, "as if the cause had 

22

been heard before the court." 

23
24
25

 And so that was  that was one where the 
district court didn't come into it at that point. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Your  your

Official

1

position is  I mean, the authority to decide cases, 

2

which is our Constitutional birthright, we said in Stern 

3

that Congress can't take that away from us.  And your 

4

position is that two parties who come in off the street, 

5

if they agree, they can take that away from us. 

6

 MR. GANNON: 

Depending.  I think that under 

7

the circumstances here  and this Court has repeatedly, 

8

in the context of considering Article III objections in 

9

bankruptcy, has repeatedly recognized that the absence 

10

of consent is relevant.  Under Schor, and the Court is 

11

obliged, I think, to look into all the circumstances 

12

surrounding this, and there are lots of things that make 

13

this far from the hypothetical that you pose, because 

14

this is more like the magistrate judge scheme.  And, 

15

indeed, in some ways it's slightly more limited. 

16

 This is an instance where bankruptcy judges 

17

are not just somebody off the street that a district 

18

court is choosing to decide 

19
20
21
22
23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, it's the 

parties, the parties who are 
 MR. GANNON: 

It's not the parties that are 

choosing. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You said, "It's the 

24

consent of the parties that allows a proceeding we have 

25

determined to be unconstitutional to go forward."

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GANNON: 

You determined that it was 

2

unconstitutional in the absence of consent, and it's not 

3

just the consent of the parties.  I think it is 

4

important here, as it was in  in the magistrate judge 

5

context in Roell, in Peretz, in Gomez.  This Court has 

6

previously recognized that in the magistrate judge 

7

context, consent makes or breaks the difference between 

8

whether it's okay for a magistrate judge to oversee 

9

felony voir dire, and it has subsequently compared that 

10

to entry of civil judgments.  In Roell, it sustained the 

11

ability of a magistrate judge to enter a civil judgment. 

12

 Here, bankruptcy judges are not just people 

13

off the street chosen by the parties.  They are people 

14

who are appointed by Article III judges.  They are 

15

removable only by Article III judges.  They never get a 

16

case 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The point of 

18

everything that you said is, they do not comply with 

19

Article III. 

20

 MR. GANNON: 

They themselves are not Article 

21

III judges, that is certainly true.  But they never get 

22

a case unless it is referred to them by an Article III 

23

judge, and then the Article III judge reserves the 

24

ability to withdraw the reference and, therefore, they 

25

don't have  they are now unable to do anything without

that imprimatur from the district court, and I 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Mr. Gannon 
Does the district 

court have that authority after the entry of judgment? 
 MR. GANNON: 

I  I don't think as a 

6

statutory matter that 157(d), which is the provision 

7

that allows the district court to withdraw the 

8

reference, it's possible that that can't be done at that 

9

point, but I think that it is sensible as a matter of 

10

constitutional remedy.  If the  if the entry of final 

11

judgment by the bankruptcy court was a constitutional 

12

violation, I think it is a sensible remedy, as I 

13

discussed before, to deem that final judgment to be 

14

proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. 

15

This Court concluded in Stern, that subject matter 

16

jurisdiction is vested in the district court and that 

17

the allocation of authority between bankruptcy judges 

18

and district judges contained in Section 157 is not of 

19

subject matter jurisdictional consequences. 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Gannon, could you say a 

21

word about the relevance of arbitration here?  Because 

22

I've been trying to figure out, if there's an Article 

23

III problem irrespective of consent when Congress adopts 

24

some kind of scheme for alternative adjudication, why 

25

schemes of mediation and arbitration wouldn't similarly

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

be constitutionally problematic. 
 MR. GANNON: 

I  obviously, we don't think 

3

that  that these schemes here in the bankruptcy judge 

4

context and the magistrate judge context, which are 

5

which are hedged around with lots of procedural 

6

protections and statutory protections, rise to that 

7

level.  But I do think that a principal difference, if 

8

the Court were looking to distinguish arbitration from 

9

these types of concerns, is that the arbitration is more 

10

purely private. 

11

 Although there's statutory authorization, 

12

the arbitrators are generally not Federal employees. 

13

Bankruptcy judges, by contrast, are actually units of 

14

the district courts.  They are within Article III.  They 

15

are 

16

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, but that would suggest 

17

that arbitration is more constitutionally problematic 

18

because it  it extends  you know, it goes  it's 

19

further away from the supervisory authority of the 

20

district court. 

21

 MR. GANNON: 

I'm  I'm loathe to say that 

22

it's further away because I think that there may be a 

23

separation of powers distinction between 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Arbitration is a 

matter of contract between two parties.  Nothing happens

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in an arbitration until you get a district court to 

2

enter a judgment enforcing the contract.  It seems to me 

3

totally different from the situation we're talking about 

4

here. 

5

 MR. GANNON: 

6

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I do 
A matter of contract versus 

7

a matter of consent?  Like I said, you understand the 

8

difference. 

9
10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But you  I'm 

posing a question to you, I guess. 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Courts enforce 

13

contracts all the time.  They don't enter judgments 

14

beyond their Article III authority simply because the 

15

two parties before them agree that they should. 

16

 MR. GANNON: 

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice. 

17

In cases like Heckers and Kimberly, courts, in light of 

18

a previous reference from the Court and the consent of 

19

the parties agreed to have their power of de novo review 

20

limited.  Obviously that's not what happened here, but 

21

we think that the judgment of the decision below should 

22

be affirmed. 

23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

24

 Mr. HallwardDriemeier, you have five

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARDDRIEMEIER 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Thank you, 

Mr. Chief Justice. 
 I have four points in response. 

First with 

6

respect to the history.  Hecker's and Kimberly were not 

7

instances in which the nonArticle III actor entered the 

8

judgment of the United States. 

9

 In Hecker's, the Court compared the 

10

referee's actions akin to a jury.  And a jury, of 

11

course, only finds facts.  Only the court can decide 

12

whether to enter judgment on the basis of the jury's 

13

verdict.  Likewise an arbitrator can decide facts 

14

pursuant to the parties' contract, but until they bring 

15

it to the court and judgment is entered confirming 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What are we supposed to 

17

assume here on this point?  In Thomas, this Court held 

18

that what Northern Pipeline establishes is that Congress 

19

cannot vest in a nonArticle III court the power to 

20

adjudicate without consent of the litigants.  So that's 

21

the holding. 

22

 Now, if we are going to go back into Crowell and 

23

Benson and the power of agencies and whether we want to reverse 

24

the things that were held in 1938 and so forth, I guess we 

25

should have briefing on that.  Am I supposed to assume

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that this is a case  I thought I assumed what we have 

2

held before in respect to constitutionality.  Not 

3

whether Northern Pipeline extends to where it is with 

4

consent of the parties. 

5

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Although Northern 

6

Pipeline, because the party had objected, did not 

7

address the question whether consent 

8
9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, you heard what I read 

from Thomas.  I was just reading it, and it talks about 

10

without consent.  So what I want to know is are we going 

11

to open up these issues again?  Because I have my own 

12

views on that, but they don't necessarily  they won't 

13

necessarily command a majority, but I think we should 

14

have briefing. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

No, Your Honor. 

17

Because the earlier cases do not establish an authority 

18

to enter judgment of the United States by a 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

My question is are we 

20

supposed to go into that or do we just take as assumed 

21

what Thomas said and Stern said, and I think  you know 

22

what I said.  I don't want to repeat myself. 

23

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

Well, Thomas 

24

certainly does not foreclose the argument that I'm 

25

making because 

57

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

okay without consent. 

They didn't say that it's 

3

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

5
6
7
8
9
10

Right. 

They just say it is okay 

with consent.  They didn't address the point. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

That's right, Your 

Honor. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think we should have 

briefing on the point if we are going into it. 
 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

And Kimberly, 

11

again, referred to the confirmation of the award, again 

12

the judgment being entered by the court. 

13

 The  in Roell, which really marks the 

14

furthest extent of the recognition of consent and the 

15

role that it can play with respect to judgments and, of 

16

course, the Article III argument was not advanced by the 

17

parties there.  Both parties agreed that consent would 

18

be sufficient.  But significantly, even in Roell, the 

19

Court said that the consent would have to be knowing and 

20

voluntary consent.  And we have the opposite of that 

21

here.  Because both the legislature and the judiciary 

22

had told EBIA that it had no right to an Article III 

23

judge for pretrial motions. 

24

 And although my friend 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But you had an

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

outstanding motion to withdraw the reference.  And the 

2

district court gave you the option of proceeding with 

3

that motion and having it determine the rest of the case 

4

or to go and listen  or go back to the bankruptcy 

5

court and let the bankruptcy court manage this and you 

6

chose the latter.  I think obviously for the reasons 

7

your  your adversary speaks about, because your 

8

codefendant had won in bankruptcy court.  I think you 

9

were riding your chances. 

10

 MR. HALLWARDDRIEMEIER: 

No, Your Honor, to 

11

the contrary, and we don't need to hypothesize because 

12

the record is clear, the motion was to withdraw for 

13

purpose of conducting a jury trial because our client 

14

recognized that Ninth Circuit precedent 

15

Healthcentral.Com explicitly held after Granfinanciera, 

16

that although you might have a Seventh Amendment jury 

17

trial right to an Article III judge, that did not 

18

entitle you to Article III determination of pretrial 

19

motions including summary judgment motion on a 

20

fraudulent conveyance claim.  It was directly on point. 

21

Our client cited that, recognized it, it had no right to 

22

Article III court prior to trial. 

23

 So the motion to withdraw was limited to the 

24

motion for a trial if the court got that far.  So the 

25

suggestion that in the answer we disputed that

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fraudulent conveyance actions are core is not consistent 

2

with the record. 


3


 The complaint had listed eight causes of 


4


action, several of which were core, several noncore, and 

5

then a single concluding allegation that the proceeding 

6

was core.  Under Ninth Circuit law we rightly denied 

7

that allegation.
