 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll here argument 

next in case 13517, Warger v. Shauers. 

5

 Mr. Shanmugam. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 

7
8
9

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 

10

 In McDonough v. Greenwood, this Court held 

11

that a party is entitled to a new trial where it can 

12

show that a juror was materially dishonest at voir dire, 

13

regardless of whether the juror's dishonesty actually 

14

infected the verdict. 

15

 A McDonough claim is thus an inquiry into 

16

the composition of the jury.  It is not an inquiry into 

17

the validity of the verdict.  And for that reason, 

18

Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) unambiguously permits 

19

the introduction of testimony about statements made 

20

during deliberations in support of a McDonough claim. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but wasn't that a 

22

case in which a third party came and gave the 

23

information? 

24
25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

That is correct.  And so we 

are certainly not arguing that McDonough itself resolved

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the question of the scope of Rule 606(b).  But we do 

2

think that the nature of the McDonough inquiry is really 

3

critical here in determining whether Rule 606(b) 

4

applies. 

5

 And in particular we think that the critical 

6

fact is that McDonough in no way requires an inquiry 

7

into what actually took place in the jury room.  It is, 

8

as we say in the briefs, a type of structural error. 

9

And by that, I mean that it has no prejudice component. 

10

 And in that regard it is critically 

11

different from other types of claims, such as a claim of 

12

outright jury bias, where prejudice is required.  And 

13

it's really for that reason that we think Rule 606(b) 

14

unambiguously permits evidence of this variety to be 

15

admitted. 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that the whole 

17

rationale behind this is we don't want to invade the 

18

jury province with information about what went on in the 

19

jury room.  And that's a pretty old rule.  And some 

20

people might think it makes no sense.  You can have an 

21

eavesdropper, and that's okay, but you can't have a 

22

juror itself. 

23

 So this, what's involved here is a juror 

24

reporting what she heard during the deliberations.  And 

25

it seems to me that's exactly the kind of thing that is

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

not permitted. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Justice Ginsburg, we're 

3

certainly talking about statements made during 

4

deliberations, and we are not disputing that this is the 

5

type of evidence that is subject to the rule.  Our 

6

argument concerns the first requirement of Rule 606(b), 

7

which goes to the type of inquiry during which evidence 

8

that is otherwise covered by the rule would be 

9

admissible.  And I do think that Rule 606(b) embodies a 

10

balance.  It isn't simply about the countervailing 

11

policy concerns, which Respondent and the government 

12

understandably emphasize, of finality and jury secrecy. 

13

 There is, of course, a countervailing 

14

concern here about fairness.  That is, after all, the 

15

principal concern on which the rule of McDonough itself 

16

was based. 

17

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But it's too easy to 

18

convert anything that occurs into the jury room as 

19

reflecting on the voir dire.  So the judge instructs the 

20

jury.  Can you follow my instructions?  Oh, yes, I can 

21

follow my instructions.  In the jury room, that juror 

22

says:  Oh, come on, let's just average it all up and go 

23

home.  Didn't  didn't follow instructions.  On your 

24

theory that could come in, because it goes to dishonesty 

25

at the voir dire stage.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So two responses to that, 

2

Justice Ginsburg.  First of all, as we point out in our 

3

reply brief, our rule has been the rule, both on the 

4

Federal level and on the State level, in numerous 

5

jurisdictions.  And we would respectfully submit that 

6

there is really no evidence of the floodgates problem 

7

that Respondents suggest will follow if this Court 

8

adopts our interpretation. 

9
10
11

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, perhaps if you 

prevail.  Why not? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, that goes to my second 

12

response, which is that I think that it is going to be 

13

very difficult in the hypothetical you posit for a party 

14

to make out a successful McDonough claim.  And that is 

15

simply because the requirements of McDonough are in fact 

16

quite stringent. 

17

 And in particular, the first requirement of 

18

McDonough is that the moving party must show that the 

19

response was intentionally dishonest.  And by that, I 

20

think that the Court really meant intentionally 

21

dishonest at the time of  voir dire.  So to take the 

22

hypothetical that the government uses in its brief 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I think you're missing the 

24

point of Justice Ginsburg's question.  The question is 

25

not whether the McDonough claim ultimately would

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prevail.  The question is whether the testimony from 

2

jurors about what went on in the jury room is going to 

3

be solicited in an effort to prove a McDonough claim. 

4

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

And I guess your answer to 

6

 what's implicit in what you're saying is that it 

7

would be permissible to receive that testimony in that 

8

situation. 

9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, Justice Alito, I think 

10

there are two separate issues here.  The first is the 

11

concern about undue solicitation.  And as we have 

12

explained, there are a variety of rules that I think 

13

impose appropriate limits on a lawyer's ability to go 

14

out and get evidence of this variety.  And of course 

15

lawyers always have an incentive to talk to jurors if 

16

they are able to do so. 

17

 Our point is simply that, to the extent that 

18

there is a concern raised about harassment of jurors, 

19

that is already dealt with, and appropriately so, by 

20

governing rules. 

21

 Now, I think Justice Ginsburg's question 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry.  I didn't 

23

follow that.  You said lawyers always have an interest 

24

in talking to  what's to prevent them from doing so if 

25

the payoff could be as significant as you're looking for.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I think at a minimum, 

2

Mr. Chief Justice, lawyers certainly would have that 

3

incentive, even if we were to lose this case, because in 

4

talking to jurors, that conversation could very well 

5

lead to evidence that unquestionably would be 

6

admissible, because, after all, a party can always make 

7

a McDonough claim based on extrinsic evidence. 

8
9

 And so, for instance, if in fact a juror had 
posted something on Facebook that indicated that the 

10

juror had been dishonest at voir dire, there's really no 

11

debate that that would be admissible. 

12

 But to go to Justice Ginsburg's question, 

13

really sort of the second part of this, I think it's 

14

important to remember that the mere fact that the 

15

evidence is admissible under Rule 606(b) is not the end 

16

of the inquiry.  The evidence still has to be probative 

17

and probative with regard to the requirements of 

18

McDonough. 

19

 And I think perhaps the best example that I 

20

would give is actually an example that the government 

21

uses in its brief, the example of the situation where 

22

the jurors go back into the jury room and they flip a 

23

coin in order to resolve the case. 

24
25

 Now, the government suggests that perhaps a 
party could seek to use that as evidence that the jurors

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were in fact dishonest when they said that they could be 

2

fair and impartial at the time of voir dire.  But if so, 

3

that is pretty weak evidence of that for the simple 

4

reason that the requisite showing under McDonough is 

5

that the juror intended to be dishonest at the time of 

6

voir dire. 

7

 And in the coin flip hypothetical, it might 

8

very well have been that the jurors flipped a coin 

9

because they were frustrated with their inability to 

10

reach a decision.  They may have wanted to go watch the 

11

football game.  There any number of reasons.  But that 

12

is not really very strong evidence of intentional 

13

dishonesty at the time of voir dire.  I think this 

14

case 

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But what is the strong 

16

evidence of intentional dishonesty in this case?  The 

17

woman says:  I can judge this case fairly, I can award 

18

damages.  And one of the other things that the judge 

19

instructs the jury:  You can take account of your own 

20

life experience. 

21

 What is so blatant about that? 

How do we 

22

infer that she intended to be dishonest at the time of 

23

the voir dire? 

24
25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, again, I think that 

this really goes to the requirements of McDonough as

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

opposed to the interpretation of Rule 606(b).  But I 

2

think that there's a meaningful difference between a 

3

juror simply bringing personal experiences to bear on 

4

the one hand and a juror doing so in a way that 

5

indicates that the juror was, as was true in this case, 

6

simply unwilling to award damages to Petitioner in a 

7

case of this variety. 

8
9

 And I think it's important to underscore the 
extent that the facts of this case shed some light on 

10

the legal question.  But this is not simply a case about 

11

a question involving fairness and impartiality.  There 

12

were also questions asked about whether the jurors would 

13

be willing to award damages of various types in a case 

14

of this variety. 

15

 And to point to the evidence of dishonesty 

16

in the record at pages 40a, to 41a of the appendix to the 

17

petition, Juror Titus said that Juror Whipple said in the 

18

discussions that if her daughter had been sued for the 

19

accident for which she was responsible, it would have 

20

ruined her life. 

21

 In our view, that is evidence that the juror 

22

was unwilling to follow the instructions and to apply 

23

the law to the facts.  And we believe that it also 

24

strongly supports the inference that the juror was 

25

dishonest at the time of voir dire when she answered 

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, it's pretty 

2

ambiguous.  She said if  if she had been sued, she 

3

would have to pay a lot of damages, right?  Well, this 

4

guy has been sued.  I mean, I don't know that you can 

5

just take that and says that means she's not going to 

6

award a judgment in favor of the  of the plaintiff. 

7

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, she said it would have 

8

ruined her life if she had been sued.  And to be fair, 

9

this is obviously not smoking gun evidence.  This is not 

10

a situation where the juror comes into the jury room and 

11

says, look, I really lied when I answered those 

12

questions at voir dire. 

13

 It is inferential evidence, and it will be a 

14

matter for Judge Viken on remand if this Court agrees 

15

with our interpretation to determine first of all 

16

whether this affidavit is in fact probative evidence of 

17

intentional dishonesty, and second 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well I guess the reason 

19

I ask is precisely for that reason.  In other words, it's 

20

a fairly broad inquiry.  The circumstances in which you 

21

would allow an inquiry are fairly broad.  It's not 

22

simply when there's a smoking gun, but a very debatable 

23

point about, well, she  she didn't want to award 

24

damages because if her daughter had been sued it would 

25

ruin her life, as opposed to, well, she realized there'd

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 be a lot of damages here because the guy was sued. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

And again, that really goes 

3

 to the application of the McDonough standard.  And we've 

4

 now had 30 years of experience with the McDonough 

5

 standard.  This is not a recent decision of this Court. 

6
7

 Justice Kennedy: 

But McDonough did not 

 have 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

 that, the difficulty 

My problem is not  is not 

10

 of proving that it did demonstrate dishonesty during the 

11

 voir dire.  My problem is what you also have to 

12

 establish, namely that this does not constitute an 

13

 inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment. 

14
15
16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, thank you, Justice 

 Scalia, because this is obviously 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's 606(b)(1), and why 

17

 are you raising this issue?  Because you want to set 

18

 aside the verdict, right? 

19

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

20

Well, this is obviously a 

 case about the interpretation of that language. 

21

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Right. 
But I think it's critical to 

23

 realize that that language does not simply refer to any 

24

 challenge to the verdict.  It refers to inquiries into 

25

 the validity of the verdict.  And in our view, that 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 language unambiguously 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Except  why  why

3

 would you have an inquiry into the validity of the 

4

 verdict absent juror misconduct?  You're not going to 

5

 use that statement in any other part of your case. 

6

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But the critical point, 

7

 Justice Sotomayor, is that that language focuses on the 

8

 inquiry and it focuses on the substantive inquiry 

9

 mandated by the claim at issue. 

10

 And again, as I indicated at the outset, a 

11

 claim of juror dishonesty during voir dire does not 

12

 require any examination of the verdict itself.  It does 

13

 not depend in any way on what took place in the jury 

14

 room.  And it's really for that reason that we think 

15

 that a McDonough claim is qualitatively different from a 

16

 claim 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess I don't understand 

18

 that, Mr. Shanmugam.  I mean, one reason that a verdict 

19

 can be invalid has to do with what happens in the jury 

20

 room.  And another reason why a verdict can be invalid 

21

 might have to do with the composition of the jury 

22

 itself. 

23

 And why we should read that language to 

24

 include the first but not the second I guess I'm just 

25

 not getting as a matter of language. 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Sure.  Well, I do think that 

2

 you have to give meaning to every word in this

3

 provision.  And I really do think that this provision is 

4

 different from a provision that just refers to 

5

 challenges to the verdict.  And it certainly it true 

6

 that in this case, as in many others, we are seeking as 

7

 the remedy on our McDonough claim a new trial.  And a 

8

 component of that, once a verdict has been reached, is 

9

 obviously that the verdict should be set aside. 

10

 In other words, I'm not disputing the 

11

 proposition that our purpose here is to obtain a new 

12

 trial, and of course, therefore, to set aside the 

13

 verdict that has already been reached. 

14

 My point is simply that a McDonough claim in 

15

 no way turns on the manner in which the jury has reached 

16

 the verdict. 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I know, but  so maybe 

18

 we're just going back and forth here.  But an inquiry 

19

 into the validity of the verdict means asking the 

20

 question, is the verdict valid?  And the question, is 

21

 the verdict valid, can have answers that refer either to 

22

 the deliberative process itself or to the composition of 

23

 the jury. 

24
25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But that is not the question 

 that a McDonough claim asks.  And I think the best 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 evidence of that is that I think it's really undisputed 

2

 that a McDonough claim can be brought even before a

3

 verdict has been reached. 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I haven't  I haven't 

5

 quite counted, but you keep saying this is a McDonough 

6

 claim.  If you read the McDonough case, Chief Justice 

7

 Rehnquist does not cite Rule 606.  He does not cite. 

8

 I think I'm correct. 

9
10

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

You're absolutely correct. 

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And so you want to tell 

11

 us, don't look at Rule 606.  Just look at McDonough. 

12

 That's what you're telling us.  It's a whole 

13

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I am eager for you to look 

14

 at the language of Rule 606 because I think it supports 

15

 our position.  The only reason that we're talking about 

16

 McDonough at all is because Rule 606 requires you to 

17

 look at the type of inquiry that the claim at issue 

18

 mandates.  And I think in many ways this nature 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But it also requires you 

20

 to look at who is producing the evidence.  And here, the 

21

 juror is producing the evidence and McDonough was a 

22

 third person.  It's different. 

23

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, the rest of Rule 

24

 606(b)is, of course, all about that, because it is all 

25

 about the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion. 

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And again, there's no debate that that portion of the 

2

 rule sweeps quite broadly and would otherwise include

3

 the evidence at issue here. 

4

 Our point is simply that a McDonough claim 

5

 is a type of structural error and I think that that 

6

 points up the 

7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But you're taking a case 

8

 that had nothing to do with a juror testifying about 

9

 what  what  the deliberations in the jury room.  I 

10

 think you're using the case for much more than it's 

11

 worth, much more than the opinion writer put into it. 

12

 It just didn't present the question of what about a 

13

 juror testifying about the deliberations in the jury 

14

 room. 

15

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But, Justice Ginsburg, I do 

16

 think that the nature of a McDonough claim points up one 

17

 of the oddities of Respondent's position, which is that 

18

 there's really no dispute that if a McDonough claim is 

19

 brought before a verdict has been reached, that 

20

 evidence  even evidence from the jury room would be 

21

 admissible.  And so, for instance, if a juror came 

22

 forward before the jury actually completed its 

23

 discussions and reached a verdict, I think there's no 

24

 dispute here  at least I don't see any dispute in the 

25

 briefs  that that evidence would be admissible. 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And so, too, of course, in Clark, this Court 

2

 held that evidence of this variety would be admissible

3

 in a contempt proceeding after the verdict has been 

4

 reached.  And so 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This is what troubles me 

6

 about your  your argument.  I suspect, maybe I'm wrong 

7

 and you tell me if I am, that in a case where there's a 

8

 lot at stake, a really good lawyer loses a case and 

9

 there was a lot on the line.  And let's suppose this 

10

 lawyer gets a transcript of what was said in the jury 

11

 room.  Do you think it is going to be very hard for the 

12

 lawyer to find something that some juror said that can 

13

 be used to make out a somewhat plausible claim that 

14

 the  that the juror was dishonest during voir dire? 

15

 The juror promises during voir dire to be fair, and it 

16

 appears from this transcript the lawyer was for the 

17

 plaintiff or for the defendant from the first minute of 

18

 deliberations.  Or the juror says, I will follow the 

19

 jury instructions.  And then at some point, the juror is 

20

 making an argument that's inconsistent with the jury 

21

 instructions.  Do you see the problem? 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I  I see the problem.  I 

23

 would just respectfully submit, Justice Alito, that it 

24

 hasn't proven to be a problem in practice.  And as we 

25

 note in our reply brief, this has been the rule in the 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 Ninth Circuit, it's been the rule in the nation's 

2

 largest State jurisdiction, California, for decades.

3

 And yet in those jurisdictions, there is less than one 

4

 decision per year that we've been able to find involving 

5

 a McDonough claim based on this type of evidence. 

6

 And, of course, as we  I was just going to 

7

 say, one last thing, Justice Alito, which is that, of 

8

 course, as we also point out, our rule was, if anything, 

9

 the prevailing rule at common law even before the 

10

 enactment of Rule 606(b) and there's no evidence that 

11

 there was a floodgates problem at common law either. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is  under your 

13

 reading of 606(b), is there anything that is an inquiry 

14

 into the validity of a verdict other than a motion to 

15

 set aside the verdict? 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I think that there 

17

 might be certain types of claims of which prejudice is a 

18

 component.  And certainly, if you brought a motion that 

19

 was based on pure juror bias of the type that was at 

20

 issue in cases such as Remmer v. United States and Smith 

21

 v. Phillips 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what would 

23

 that motion would be presumably a motion to set aside 

24

 the verdict. 

25

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I assume it would be framed 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 that way rather than as a motion for a new trial. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The reason I ask is

3

 because they don't say that.  It seems to me a broader 

4

 definition of any inquiry into the validity of a 

5

 verdict.  If they wanted to say, you know  if they 

6

 only meant a motion to set aside a verdict, you'd think 

7

 they would have said that. 

8
9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yeah.  I mean, I  off the 

 top of my head, I can't think of another type of motion 

10

 for new trial that would be treated differently.  But 

11

 certainly, wherever the claim depends in any way on what 

12

 took place in the jury room, the evidence would, of 

13

 course, still be subject to the rule.  And again, that 

14

 sweeps in claims of juror bias, it sweeps in all of the 

15

 types of claims about which the framers of Rule 606(b) 

16

 were clearly concerned.  Claims involving the manner in 

17

 which the jury reached the verdict, claims involving 

18

 compromised verdicts, quotient verdicts and the like. 

19

 And I think if anything, to the extent that 

20

 the drafting history of Rule 606(b) is relevant, it 

21

 tells us two things.  First, there's no indication that 

22

 the framers of the rule intended to disturb what was the 

23

 prevailing practice at common law, particularly after 

24

 this Court's decision in Clark.  There is simply nothing 

25

 in the history of the rule that suggests that.  And if 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 anything, I think that the history of the rule suggests 

2

 that the central focus in framing the rule was on

3

 excluding evidence concerning the manner in which the 

4

 jury reached its verdict, and not evidence that was used 

5

 to demonstrate that the jury was improperly constituted. 

6

 Now, again, because the rule focuses on the 

7

 inquiry mandated by the claim at issue, we think that 

8

 ours is the better textual interpretation.  But at a 

9

 minimum, if the Court thinks that the rule is somehow, 

10

 by its terms, ambiguous, I would simply make two points. 

11

 First, we do think that the canon of constitutional 

12

 avoidance would apply in this context.  At least one 

13

 court of appeals has held that there would be a 

14

 constitutional problem with excluding evidence in cases 

15

 involving racial bias.  We believe that there would be a 

16

 serious constitutional concern.  More generally, because 

17

 the right to adequate voir dire is, as this Court has 

18

 said, part of the right to trial by an impartial jury. 

19

 But even if the Court doesn't think that 

20

 this is a matter for constitutional avoidance, we 

21

 certainly think that there is a constitutionally based 

22

 interest here.  The interest in protecting a litigant's 

23

 right to a fair trial.  And we believe that that 

24

 interest does outweigh the countervailing interest in 

25

 finality in jury secrecy.  Now, in Clark 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

A party has a right to a 

 competent jury, doesn't it?

3

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yes, that is true. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Constitutional right to 

5

 that.  And yet, you couldn't inquire  we  the Court 

6

 has held that there can't be an inquiry into whether the 

7

 jurors were intoxicated? 

8

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

9

Well, that is true.  But I 

 think that the Court reached that conclusion based 

10

 entirely on the outside influence exception.  And I 

11

 think part of the reason why that is true is that I 

12

 think that the Court viewed the inquiry in that case in 

13

 Tanner as requiring a showing of prejudice.  In other 

14

 words, I think that the Court was operating on the 

15

 premise that the underlying claim there would require a 

16

 showing that the drunkenness actually redounded to the 

17

 moving party's prejudice. 

18

 My point is simply that when we're looking 

19

 at the policy balancing that is required here, the 

20

 better point of reference is this Court's decision in 

21

 Clark where the Court suggested  albeit in the context 

22

 of contempt proceedings  the concerns about fairness 

23

 outweighed the litany of concerns about jury secrecy and 

24

 harassment.  And to be sure 

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

That was leaving out the 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 conspicuous difference, there was no jury verdict 

2

 impugned in the contempt case.

3

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

That is correct.  Although 

4

 the Court did indicate that its rule was consistent with 

5

 the common law no impeachment rule.  But I think with 

6

 regard to the policy considerations, it certainly is 

7

 true that this case is different because it does possess 

8

 a final verdict.  But I think with regard to finality, I 

9

 would point to the experience in the jurisdictions that 

10

 have adopted our rule, which confirms that if evidence 

11

 of this variety is admissible, verdicts are only rarely 

12

 set aside and that is because McDonough itself sets an 

13

 appropriately high standard. 

14

 And, of course, the only question before the 

15

 Court in this case concerns the admissibility of this 

16

 evidence.  It would be open to the district court on 

17

 remand to decide what to do with this evidence if it is 

18

 admitted.  Our submission is simply that Rule 606(b) by 

19

 its terms permits the admission of this evidence because 

20

 it is not being admitted in an inquiry into the validity 

21

 of the verdict. 

22
23

 And if I can reserve the balance of my time 
 for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

Thank you, Your Honor.  May 

 it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice: 
 What the Petitioner would do here is change 

6

 the rules of 606 and how it would apply.  606 is clear. 

7

 This Court has said its language is clear.  What 

8

 Petitioner does not emphasize is that what they did 

9

 below was to make a motion for a new trial and to 

10

 invalidate the verdict.  The fact that the ground was 

11

 dishonesty of the juror doesn't change anything from the 

12

 Tanner case where the grounds for the new trial was that 

13

 the jurors were drinking during the trial and during 

14

 deliberations. 

15

 McDonough doesn't change the nature of 

16

 606(b).  All McDonough says, I think as you have pointed 

17

 out, is that if there is an inquiry, that inquiry would 

18

 have to be such, but it does not tell you why it's 

19

 admissible.  And Rule 606 tells us what's admissible. 

20

 And this, the Petitioner has conceded is not admissible. 

21

 It is jury testimony of what happened during 

22

 deliberations.  So that's clear. 

23

 So what are we fighting about? 

We're 

24

 fighting about what did Congress mean by during an 

25

 inquiry into the validity of the verdict.  This is an 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 inquiry into the validity of the verdict.  You can't 

2

 just separate the grounds.  What they want here is a new

3

 trial and the verdict invalidated. 

4

 And so it falls exactly into 606(b), and the 

5

 legislative history absolutely supports that.  Congress, 

6

 this Court made decisions and balanced the fairness on 

7

 one hand of allowing in this testimony and problems 

8

 about the sanctity of a jury trial and the entire 

9

 structure of our judicial system.  And to adopt 

10

 Petitioner's analysis would put this all on its head. 

11

 What would we have?  I think we all know what we would 

12

 have here.  Every lawyer, good ones or bad ones, Your 

13

 Honor, would try to ask generalized questions  can you 

14

 be fair  and then wait and see what happens. 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Your friend says 

16

 that hasn't been the experience in a large portion of 

17

 the country. 

18

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

Well, that's not true 

19

 because, first of all, my friend doesn't tell you that 

20

 there are only five States that allow in this kind of 

21

 evidence at all. 

22
23

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is California one of 

 them? 

24

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

California is one of them. 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Well 

Official

1

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

But even in California, Your 

2

 Honor, there are different requirements.  These cases go

3

 off  I'll just give you a perfect example.  He cites a 

4

 bunch of cases in the Ninth Circuit that he says these 

5

 are the cases that apply the rule.  Well, they don't. 

6

 Even the cases that they rely on from the Ninth Circuit, 

7

 Henley and Hard, it is dicta in those cases that you can 

8

 admit testimony on  of a juror on what happened during 

9

 deliberations if you're trying to determine whether 

10

 there's dishonesty.  In those cases themselves, that was 

11

 not the holding of the case.  There was dicta that says 

12

 you should be able to do that, but the holdings of the 

13

 case went off on extraneous prejudicial influences or 

14

 extraneous prejudicial information. 

15

 And there are 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

But your argument 

17

 your argument is this is going to be something lawyers 

18

 are going to ask about in every case. 

19

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And they will 
It seems to me  it 

21

 seems to me if you're dealing with California, you would 

22

 have a lot more evidence of that, since they operate 

23

 under the rule that your friend is arguing for. 

24
25

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

Well, they do and they don't, 

 Your Honor.  They  you can introduce certain things in 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 California, but you can't introduce the mental processes 

2

 in California.

3

 But the answer to that is we don't know 

4

 what's happening in California.  There is no  no 

5

 experience that anybody has about what's going on in 

6

 California or how the courts are applying it.  We didn't 

7

 have an opportunity to respond to all those California 

8

 cases, because they are only cited in the reply.  But 

9

 we've gone through all those cases and in many of those 

10

 cases this kind of testimony was not let into evidence. 

11

 So we don't know what the experience was in 

12

 California, but we do know what Congress said.  And we 

13

 do know what Congress had before them and what Congress 

14

 wanted.  Congress did the balancing here.  Congress 

15

 balanced the fairness of jurors, the fairness of a jury 

16

 trial against all of the issues and policies of keeping 

17

 the jury in a black box because it's good for the 

18

 system.  Without it, we couldn't function. 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Ms. Birnbaum, what sense 

20

 does it make to do what we did in Clark, which is to say 

21

 you can invade the jury deliberations in a contempt 

22

 proceeding.  So that  the jury is not sacrosanct.  The 

23

 court has already said that the proceeding for contempt 

24

 doesn't involve the verdict and it's a criminal action, 

25

 and not permit the use of that evidence in the civil 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 trial. 

2

 The same thing will have happened in both

3

 situations.  The jury's sanctity has been invaded. 

4

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

But, Your Honor, the reason 

5

 that we allow it in a contempt proceeding is it doesn't 

6

 affect the validity of the verdict.  It doesn't go to 

7

 what happened with regard to the verdict. 

8

 And the contempt proceedings are few and far 

9

 between.  Jurors aren't going to be harassed on a 

10

 regular basis, and if you have a criminal contempt 

11

 proceeding, you have a prosecutor who is going to make a 

12

 determination and stand between the jurors and the 

13

 and the contempt proceeding before they will bring a 

14

 contempt proceeding.  We know how few these are. 

15

 Here we're talking about in every criminal 

16

 case, in every important civil case, or not such an 

17

 important civil case.  This is a runofthemill case we 

18

 have here, a simple accident case. 

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Is  Ms. Birnbaum, is 

20

 there no way, is there no way to police the honesty of 

21

 jurors' answers on voir dire?  This is an obvious way, 

22

 if it were permissible, to police the honesty.  But is 

23

 there any other way? 

24
25

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

Your Honor, in this case 

 especially, and I'm not sure I'm answering your 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 question, we could have had a different kind of voir 

2

 dire.  There was no  there was no specific question

3

 here:  Has any member of your family or you been 

4

 involved in an automobile accident?  That was never 

5

 asked of the jury.  And bad if a juror lied about that; 

6

 well, they could, or the juror could have said yes. 

7

 Assuming there was  assuming that the juror 

8

 foreperson's daughter was involved in an auto accident, 

9

 she could have said that, and they could have inquired. 

10
11

 But they didn't do that. 
 And look at the gamesmanship that can be 

12

 played with lawyers.  They don't ask specific questions 

13

 which they should to get to the right answers and to get 

14

 to the right jurors in voir dire, and then they sit back 

15

 and wait and game the system and see how the verdict 

16

 comes back, talk to the jurors, and then they have a 

17

 ground to set aside a verdict. 

18

 This is not what Congress wanted. 

That's 

19

 not what the Supreme Court said should happen in Tanner. 

20

 And the Petitioner here says under the common law, this 

21

 was the rule.  You could admit this kind of testimony. 

22

 That's utterly untrue.  In Tanner, this Court said under 

23

 the common law, it is clear that you could not admit 

24

 this evidence. 

25

 That was the majority rule. 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

There was a 

Official

1

 minority rule.  And you know what happened?  When 

2

 Congress looked at this issue, they adopted the majority

3

 rule.  They said the jury room is a black box except for 

4

 certain extraneous influences, extraneous prejudicial 

5

 information.  This is not it.  Doesn't fall within that 

6

 category. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

8

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

9

And why not? 
Because, Your Honor, this is 

 generalized information.  When we talk about extraneous 

10

 prejudicial information, I think the case law is 

11

 absolutely clear.  It has to be about the case, about 

12

 information that you put into the jury room about the 

13

 defendant or about the incident, the accident. 

14

 If you went and looked at the scene of the 

15

 accident and then came back and talked to the jurors 

16

 about it, that would be extraneous.  But this kind of 

17

 generalized information, assuming it's true  my 

18

 daughter was in an auto accident.  Okay, the Petitioner 

19

 talks about her unwillingness to determine certain 

20

 damages.  This case never came to damages.  What 

21

 actually happened in this case is the jury met for two 

22

 hours.  This was a question of contributory fault and 

23

 what happened was the jurors came, asked the court a 

24

 question:  If we apply  if we apply contributory 

25

 negligence and we find that there's slight contributory 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 negligence, must we find for the defendant? 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What would happen in the

3

 really egregious case?  The jurors are asked during voir 

4

 dire, can you be fair to every  to parties regardless 

5

 of race.  Oh, yes, yes, we can.  And then after there's 

6

 a verdict, a juror comes  comes forward and says 

7

 during the jury deliberations, the jurors were making 

8

 all kinds of biased statements and they were clearly 

9

 prejudiced.  What would happen there? 

10

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

I think, Your Honor, under 

11

 606(b), there would be no difference.  You still could 

12

 not introduce that juror testimony.  Now, maybe that's 

13

 wrong and maybe Congress should change 606(b), but 

14

 that's a job for Congress in connection with the 

15

 judicial conference and with all of the people that 

16

 would ask Congress to come in and testify and Congress 

17

 can make that decision if they want to have an 

18

 exception. 

19

 But Congress knew about that when  when it 

20

 passed 606(b), and it  it didn't make an exception for 

21

 racial bias.  And if Congress wants to do it, it could 

22

 do it, but this Court can't do it or shouldn't do it 

23

 because it's not part of what Congress intended. 

24

 Congress knew quite well, there was a lot of discussion 

25

 here, and the Petitioner is correct.  Most of the 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 discussion did not go to the words "during an inquiry 

2

 into the validity of the verdict."

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, do you think that with 

4

 respect to the kind of case that Justice Alito has in 

5

 mind, a case of racial bias and let's put it in a 

6

 criminal context, that maybe it's not up to Congress, 

7

 that at some point one begins to run into constitutional 

8

 issues? 

9

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

Well, I think at least if 

10

 this Court, in Tanner, looked at those constitutional 

11

 issues not in  not in the racial bias context, but in 

12

 the context of having a drunk juror deciding a 

13

 particular case 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why  why is that the  I 

15

 mean, would we make an exception to normal hearsay rules 

16

 where racial bias is the issue? 

17

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

You would not, Your Honor. 
I don't think so. 
But the  but the further 

20

 answer to that is this Court has already said there are 

21

 other safeguards that are in place that we feel will be 

22

 sufficient in order to safeguard the Sixth Amendment 

23

 rights in that particular instance, or the Seventh 

24

 Amendment rights, of a fair trial.  This Court has said 

25

 we can't give litigants a perfect trial.  We  we know 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 that there are going to be some cases where a juror acts 

2

 improperly, acts with bias, but we can't change the

3

 system and open it up to jurors being harassed, to 

4

 jurors being asked what happened in the jury room, 

5

 because we will then take a private process and make it 

6

 a public inquiry.  And Congress didn't want that.  This 

7

 Court in Tanner said that was not 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I suppose one idea 

9

 because we have relied a lot on the efficacy of other 

10

 safeguards, and this isn't this case, so you can just 

11

 say it's not this case.  But  that those safeguards 

12

 might not be so effective in certain contexts and 

13

 particularly with respect to ferreting out racial bias 

14

 or religious or ethnic or something like that. 

15

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

I think, Your Honor, again 

16

 I'll come back to really this is an issue for Congress. 

17

 The rules of evidence are now adopted.  Even if the 

18

 Court feels there is unfairness in them, they have to 

19

 interpret them.  And they have to interpret them as 

20

 Congress wrote them.  Certainly, Congress knew about 

21

 racial bias and ethnic bias when it was writing these 

22

 rules and passing these rules in 1972.  There were 

23

 not 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Is there any  is 

 there any alternative remedy available that doesn't go 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 to the validity of the verdict?  You know, the 

2

 Petitioners allegedly were injured to a great extent by

3

 the jurors'  I could call it fraud, I guess.  Can they 

4

 bring an act  direct action against her? 

5

 MS. BIRNBAUM: 

No, Your Honor, I don't  I 

6

 don't think so.  I think the only thing is if a juror 

7

 lies, there is the contempt proceeding that can be 

8

 brought.  It's  it's part of what we have to live with 

9

 in the system because we can't provide perfect trials 

10

 for people.  We can only provide as fair as they can. 

11

 And in this particular case, the broad 

12

 questions that were asked, the fact that  there was 

13

 no  they didn't  the Petitioner says there was an 

14

 unwillingness on this  on this juror to find damages. 

15

 There's nothing in the affidavit that was presented that 

16

 even hints at that.  It says she may have influenced 

17

 other jurors.  By the way, do we bring in the other 

18

 jurors?  Well, this is what this would open up. 

19

 Let's say we go back. 

The juror that put in 

20

 the affidavit goes and testifies.  The forelady goes and 

21

 testifies.  They have diametrically different views of 

22

 what happened in the jury room.  Do we then bring in all 

23

 the rest of the jurors?  That's what  and the fact 

24

 that McDonough may, in certain circumstances, allow 

25

 jurors to  and by the way, McDonough does not allow 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 jurors to testify.  As you said, there was no juror 

2

 testimony there.

3

 And the fact is that the rule is clear on 

4

 its face.  This falls exactly within 606(b) and the 

5

 legislative history and the policy behind it, and we 

6

 should not be extending it to this kind of situation.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON 
 FOR THE UNITED STATES, 
 AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT 
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 Any hearing on a motion for a new trial is 

16

 an inquiry into the validity of a verdict.  That's true 

17

 when a plaintiff  when a litigant brings a McDonough 

18

 claim because of what it  the litigant is arguing is 

19

 that verdict that was issued in his case is invalid 

20

 because the tribunal that issued the verdict was 

21

 improperly constituted.  It would be the same if the 

22

 litigant were arguing that the judge that issued a 

23

 decision in a case should have recused herself from the 

24

 case based on some sort of conflict.  It would be the 

25

 same if a litigant were arguing that the jury had 5

 members or 25 members. 

2

 In each of those examples, how the argument

3

 goes is that the  the tribunal was improperly 

4

 constituted and so the verdict that was issued was 

5

 invalid because an improperly constituted tribunal 

6

 cannot issue a valid verdict. 

7

 Now, Mr. Shanmugam says that we should limit 

8

 the phrase "inquiry into the validity of a verdict" to 

9

 cases where what you're inquiring into is what happened 

10

 in a jury room.  But just as a matter of normal English 

11

 usage, I think we  it's not hard to imagine an inquiry 

12

 into the validity of a verdict that would not look into 

13

 what happened in a jury room.  For example, if a 

14

 criminal defendant who's convicted files a motion for a 

15

 new trial based on sufficiency of the evidence, I think 

16

 anyone would think that the hearing on that motion is an 

17

 inquiry into the validity of a verdict because a verdict 

18

 that's based on insufficient evidence is not valid.  You 

19

 wouldn't look at what happened in the jury room and so 

20

 you may have no occasion to apply Rule 606(b) in that 

21

 kind of inquiry, but it would certainly be an inquiry 

22

 into the validity of a verdict. 

23

 When someone brings a McDonough claim, it's 

24

 just not a freestanding thing.  They bring it as part of 

25

 a motion for a new trial; that's part of an inquiry into 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 the validity of a verdict. 

2

 Now, there's been some questions about

3

 what's happened in California where this type of 

4

 evidence is admitted.  What Mr. Shanmugam says is that 

5

 there have not been  there hasn't been an appreciable 

6

 increase in the number of successful McDonough claims in 

7

 California.  Of course, the problem that Rule 606(b) 

8

 targets is not too many successful McDonough claims, 

9

 it's overly intrusive inquiries into what's happened 

10

 in  during jury deliberations and so that's really not 

11

 responsive. 

12

 But it is true that in California and in 

13

 about five other States, this type of evidence is 

14

 admitted because those States apply the common  the 

15

 Iowa version of the common law rule.  And under the Iowa 

16

 rule, anything that jurors said during deliberations you 

17

 can admit testimony about because it wasn't something 

18

 that was internal to a juror's mind, it was something 

19

 that could be corroborated or rebutted by other jurors. 

20

 And so this type of evidence would be admissible in 

21

 those five or six States because of they apply a 

22

 different type of  different version of  in the 

23

 noimpeachment rule. 

24

 Of course, Congress was aware that that was 

25

 an option available to it when it adopted Rule 606(b) 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 and that was the version of the rule that the House of 

2

 Representatives wanted.  There's lots of back and forth

3

 that's covered in the briefs. 

4

 It's not true that that was the prevailing 

5

 rule of common law.  The Wigmore Treatise of 1961 

6

 identifies 12 out of 50 States that apply the Iowa 

7

 version.  The other 38 States applied the majority 

8

 version, which was more restrictive or  you know, 

9

 excluded more evidence.  That was plainly the version of 

10

 the rule that was adopted by the Senate. 

11

 And so I think that really points up the 

12

 fact that in this kind of area where you have these 

13

 competing important interests, it's really up to the 

14

 legislature to decide where it's going to draw the line. 

15

 Here the line is pretty clear.  Congress couldn't 

16

 have  it would have been hard for them to write the 

17

 rule any more broadly than they wrote it.  It applies in 

18

 any  during any inquiry to the validity of a verdict. 

19

 It covers anything that happens in the jury room unless 

20

 one of the specific exceptions applies. 

21

 The exception for extraneous information 

22

 does not apply here, it's our view, because that 

23

 exception has been construed only to apply to evidence 

24

 that specifically related to the case.  Congress 

25

 understood that.  That's reflected in the legislative 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 history.  It's reflected in the common law.  And if the 

2

 Court doesn't have any questions, I think I've hit the

3

 highlights.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Shanmugam, you

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

 Justice. 
 I think there are just four very quick 

13

 points that I'd like to make.  First of all, with regard 

14

 to the text of the rule and this question of whether 

15

 this constitutes an inquiry into the validity of the 

16

 verdict, I would just say one thing in response to what 

17

 Ms. Harrington has just said.  If, for instance, a party 

18

 files a motion for a new trial based on the 

19

 insufficiency of the evidence, that is, by definition, a 

20

 claim that can be brought only at the close of the 

21

 evidence in the case. 

22

 A McDonough claim is critically different 

23

 because that claim ripens at the point at which the 

24

 allegedly dishonest juror is actually empaneled.  And so 

25

 a McDonough claim could be brought before the verdict 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 has been reached or after the verdict has been reached. 

2

 And to the extent that the argument here is that the

3

 jury is a black box and that one shouldn't look into the 

4

 jury's deliberations, I would note, again, that evidence 

5

 of this variety would plainly be admissible either 

6

 before a verdict has been reached or in a contempt 

7

 proceeding after a verdict has been reached. 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.  But, of course, 

 you'd  you'd have no incentive to do that until you 

10

 lose, right?  So you would rather sit around and see if 

11

 the verdict goes against you at which point you  you 

12

 would make the claim. 

13

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

14

 certainly true, but the 

15

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, that is  that is 

Nobody is going to make the 

16

 claim before verdict comes out.  Is anybody going to do 

17

 that? 

18

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, there are cases where 

19

 the evidence comes to light, typically when a juror 

20

 actually comes to the judge and then the judge takes 

21

 some action based on the statements that have been 

22

 recorded.  But I think it's important to realize that a 

23

 McDonough claim doesn't in any way depend on the 

24

 outcome.  One could be the prevailing party and seek 

25

 relief on a McDonough claim, although one would, 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 obviously, have no incentive to do so. 

2

 That simply points up the fact that a 

3

 McDonough claim, again, in no way depends on what

4

 actually took place in the jury room in terms of the 

5

 manner in which the jury reached its verdict. 

6

 Second, I want to address this question of 

7

 the state of the law which I think is critically 

8

 important here because it really goes 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Can you explain the 

10

 manner in which the jury reached its verdict?  I thought 

11

 that the testimony of Titus was she made this statement 

12

 about her daughter and she persuaded all the other 

13

 jurors to go along with her.  That's the manner in which 

14

 the jury reached its verdict.  It didn't follow the law, 

15

 it followed what this woman was alleged to have said. 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Justice Ginsburg, the Titus 

17

 affidavit does contain those allegations, but those 

18

 allegations are utterly irrelevant to the resolution of 

19

 a McDonough claim.  In other words, it doesn't matter 

20

 for purposes of the McDonough claim whether the other 

21

 jurors were influenced or whether the other jurors said, 

22

 we don't care about your daughter's experience, that 

23

 doesn't affect our decisionmaking in the slightest.  And 

24

 that is because a McDonough claim is designed to 

25

 identify juror dishonesty at voir dire without regard to 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

 the impact on the jury's deliberations. 
 Now, second, I want to say something about 
 the current state of the law 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, presumably that's 

5

 because we assume impact, isn't it?  So the impact is 

6

 sort of built into the rule. 

7

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, it's built into the 

8

 rule only in the sense that it has to be material 

9

 dishonesty.  And so, if a juror dishonestly answered a 

10

 question about his or her name at voir dire, a court 

11

 would say that that's immaterial.  My point is simply 

12

 that McDonough does not require any analysis of actual 

13

 prejudice as the proceedings actually played out, and 

14

 that in our view is the critical distinction. 

15

 Now, let me say something about the current 

16

 state of the law because I think there's a certain 

17

 amount of uncertainty based on this argument about that 

18

 and I want to clarify that.  It has unambiguously been 

19

 the rule in the Ninth Circuit since its decision in Hard 

20

 that evidence of this variety is admissible.  And I 

21

 respectfully submit that my friend Ms. Birnbaum simply 

22

 misreads the Hard case when she argues that that is 

23

 dicta, and the best evidence of that is how that rule 

24

 has been applied in the Ninth Circuit because I think it 

25

 has been treated as the law now for some three decades. 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And it is clearly the law in California in the wake of 

2

 the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. 

3

 Castaldia.

4

 Our point is that there has been less than 

5

 one decision that we've been able to find, whether 

6

 reported or unreported, in each of those jurisdictions 

7

 per year since those rules were adopted.  And when I'm 

8

 talking about decisions, I'm not just talking about 

9

 decisions in which McDonough claims were successful. 

10

 I'm talking about decisions in which evidence of this 

11

 variety has even been sought to be admitted.  And so 

12

 there's really no evidence that this is a problem in 

13

 those jurisdictions and we have been unable to find any 

14

 suggestion in the secondary literature that this is a 

15

 problem either. 

16

 And to the extent that Ms. Birnbaum 

17

 complains that we only cited those cases in our reply 

18

 brief, I would note that it's really Respondent's burden 

19

 here to identify evidence that this is, in fact, proven 

20

 to be a problem. 

21

 Now, Respondent and the government say that 

22

 there are five States in which evidence of this variety 

23

 is admissible.  I think that actually understates the 

24

 current state of the law.  We've identified 

25

 approximately 14 States where the evidence is 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 admissible.  But this points out another point of 

2

 confusion here.  Respondent and the government talk 

3

 about this distinction between the Iowa rule and the

4

 Federal rule, and the Iowa rule applies to jurisdictions 

5

 where only evidence of the jurors' thought processes is 

6

 subject to exclusion and the Federal rule, like Rule 

7

 606(b), covers a broader type of evidence. 

8
9

 But even in jurisdictions that apply the 
 Federal rule, courts have held that evidence of this 

10

 variety is admissible.  And that's simply because we're 

11

 talking about two separate questions:  On the one hand, 

12

 the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion; and 

13

 on the other hand, the type of inquiry during which such 

14

 evidence is excluded. 

15

 So again, we would respectfully submit that 

16

 there is no evidence that this is anything other than a 

17

 speculative concern that our interpretation would lead 

18

 to these difficulties with juror harassment and 

19

 undermining the finality of verdicts. 

20

 Let me say just a word about the issue of 

21

 racial bias.  I think this is critically different from 

22

 a case involving, say, the application of the hearsay 

23

 rule, because this really goes to the fundamental 

24

 question of whether the factfinder itself was racially 

25

 biased. 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

2

 Is that also an exception? 

3

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

How about religious bias? 

Well 
What about bias against 

5

 handicapped people?  I mean, all of those things are 

6

 difficult to find.  Right? 

7

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, it raises 

8

 constitutional concerns, beyond the constitutional 

9

 concerns that we think are applicable in every case of 

10

 this variety, because, after all, regardless of the type 

11

 of bias, what we're talking about here is the right to 

12

 trial by an impartial jury.  A right that is founded 

13

 both on the specific constitutional rights involving 

14

 jury trials and the fundamental right to due process. 

15

 And our point is simply that to the extent that the 

16

 Court thinks the rule is ambiguous, those concerns 

17

 should come into play and support our interpretation. 

18

 I would just say one last thing before the 

19

 end of the argument and that is simply that Ms. Birnbaum 

20

 referred to this as a runofthemill case and my 

21

 client, Petitioner Greg Warger, I think would strongly 

22

 object to that.  He, after all, lost his leg in this 

23

 accident.  And so, while this case doesn't involve 

24

 multiple millions of dollars or some fundamental 

25

 constitutional right, it is vitally important to him.
