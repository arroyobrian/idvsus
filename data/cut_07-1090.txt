ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN S. FRANKLIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FRANKLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Acting with express statutory authority and

12

in furtherance of important foreign policies following

13

the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime, the President

14

made inapplicable with respect to Iraq all provisions of

15

law that had applied to countries that sponsored

16

terrorism.

17

Under the plain language of the statute,

18

those provisions included former section 1605(a)(7),

19

which was a provision of law that applied only to such

20

countries.

21

inapplicable as to Iraq effective on the President's

22

determination, it cannot now serve as the applicable

23

statutory basis for abrogation of Iraq's foreign

24

sovereign immunity and therefore subject matter

25

jurisdiction in this case.

Because section 1605(a)(7) was made

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Franklin, even if you

2

are right about that, the legislation was an emergency

then no more.

5

of immunity -- didn't the immunity come back?

6

the bar to immunity come back again once the emergency

7

law sunsetted?

It was revived for 1 year, but

So, didn't this suspension of Iraq's lack

No, Your Honor.

section would expire.

13

that the effect of what the President had done would be

14

That means the authorities to the

And it's important to recognize that the

The Iraq Sanctions Act has never been

So, if it were correct that the -- that the

22

-- everything that the President had done became

23

nullified upon the expiration of his authority to act,

24

then the Iraq Sanctions Act would not only currently be

25

in effect today, but would have been in effect since

September 30th, 2005.

And if there's -- that is not

what Congress intended.

4

independent of the legislative determination of Iraq as

5

a state sponsor of terrorism.

The Iraq Sanctions Act has a

6

But if there's any question about this, when

7

Congress acted again, the same Congress acted in 2003 to

8

extend the expiration date, Congress -- the -- when that

9

Congress acted, the legislative history said quite

10

expressly that the extension was not necessary to extend

11

what the President had already done, because that had

12

already happened and that was permanent.

13

necessary according to Congress for other reasons.

14

But it was

So both because of the plain language of the

15

sunset provision and because of what Congress

16

subsequently did in 2003 to extend it, as well as the

17

interpretation of the United States on this point, the

18

President's actions didn't sunset.

19

legislation to be sure, but the emergency was to give

20

the President the authorities.

21

time and our foreign policy was changing 180 degrees

22

almost overnight away from penalizing the government of

23

Saddam Hussein as a state sponsor of terrorism, as an

24

outlaw regime, and immediately towards helping the

25

people of Iraq.

It was emergency

We were at war at that

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And Congress gave the President the broad

2

catch-all authority to, if he deemed it appropriate, to

3

relieve the people of Iraq from all, not just some, of

4

the very onerous restrictions and disabilities that had

5

applied to them as a result of the prior regime's

6

support for terrorism.

7

The President did this in exercise of his

8

foreign policy judgment in order that the people of Iraq

9

could better rebuild their country and establish a new

10

democratic government that would in fact prove to become

11

one of the United States' most trusted allies in a

12

region that has not always had very many of them.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what do you make of

14

the fact that in -- in 2008 Congress said that that was

15

never its intention, it was never its intention for the

16

President to have the authority to -- to do this?

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

Two things, Justice Alito:

18

The -- the first point is that this was not the Congress

19

that acted in 2003.

20

And that statement occurred almost 5 years after the

21

legislation had been enacted and almost 3 years after

22

the President's authority to act had expired.

23

that statement is nothing more than subsequent

24

legislative history that cannot be determinative in

25

deciding whether the President acted validly in 2003.

This was a subsequent Congress.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

As such,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

That determination should be judged according to the

2

statute that was in front of the President when he

3

acted.

4

But if there's any question at all in the

5

Court's mind about the application of that provision,

6

the President waived it.

that provision in it.

He waived its application as

It is important to remember that the President

only because of its effect that it might have on Iraq,

the authority to waive any and all of the provisions of

18

MR. FRANKLIN:

So if

So that would

Well, we don't agree with

19

that, Your Honor, because we think that the scope of the

20

waiver would have been to make inapplicable or to waive

21

application of extant provisions of law to the extent

22

they might affect Iraq.

The waiver was just like the

2

existing provisions of law.

3

there is any question about that, Title 1, U.S.C.

4

section 108 answers that conclusively.

5

provides that even if Congress itself had repealed

6

section 1083 in its entirety, that would not bring

7

section 1605(a)(7), which had been repealed by that

8

section.

9

But again, to the extent

That section

And that is the plain language of 1 U.S.C.

Obviously the President by exercising a blanket

10

waiver authority can't have a better or more effective

11

ability to bring back into existence expired statutes

12

than Congress itself could have done.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because technically it's

14

just suspension, it's not -- it's not reenactment.

15

suppose you could say a suspension is a partial revival,

16

but the provision doesn't exactly fit, does it?

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

I

Well, we are talking here

18

about a waiver applied to a repeal.

And

3

contrary I think to 1 U.S.C. section 108, but also

4

common sense as well.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I agree.

6

MR. FRANKLIN:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.
Do we have any other

8

instance in which a jurisdictional provision is

9

withdrawn applicable to pending cases without Congress

10
11

having mentioned the jurisdictional provision at all?
MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, I think the closest

12

analogy that I can give you, Your Honor, is in fact the

13

precise circumstances we have here, and that is the

14

doctrine of foreign sovereign immunity.

15

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, determinations

16

upon foreign sovereign immunity were made by the

17

executive, and they had the effect, as the Court stated

18

in the Republic of Mexico case and the Ex parte Peru, of

19

requiring the courts to, quote, "surrender their

20

jurisdiction," even if it had previously attached.

21

Prior to the

So here we have the precise situation that

22

had always happened.

It had always been this way prior

23

to the FSIA.

24

determinations on foreign sovereign immunity that would

25

have the immediate effect of divesting the courts of

The President had always been able to make

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

their ability to hear cases.

2

jurisdictional provisions at the time that conferred

3

jurisdiction over foreign sovereigns, and the Court had

4

no trouble -- and this was 150 years of practice, dating

5

from Chief Justice Marshall's first recognition of

6

sovereign immunity up until the Foreign Sovereign

7

Immunities Act.

8
9

Now, there were of course

So this is actually not any different really
than what had occurred before.

We have also cited

10

numerous or several examples of jurisdictional statute

11

that do depend on executive determination.

12

really nothing particularly unusual about that as well.

13

So there's

I would like to turn at this point, if I

14

might, just briefly to our alternative argument in case

15

the Court might find it relevant.

16

alternative argument.

17

to reach, but it is certainly another basis for reaching

18

the same result in this case.

19

fact in 2008 section 1605(a)(7), regardless of what the

20

President had done previously to it, was repealed.

21

it was not just repealed, but it was repealed with a

22

simultaneous bestowal of a replacement jurisdictional

23

provision that encompassed every single pending claim

24

that was then pending at the time.

25

This is an

It's not one that the Court needs

And that is the simple

So this is the classic example of a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

jurisdictional repeal that applies to all cases.

2

Congress didn't just repeal a statute, but it gave

3

another provision that encompassed every pending claim

4

and allowed every single pending plaintiff to be able to

5

refile their cases.

6

Now, to be sure, the plaintiffs against Iraq

7

were not able to exercise their ability under the new

8

statute -- that is 28 U.S.C. section 1605(A) -- but the

9

only reason they were not allowed to do that was the

10

President's waiver, and the President's waiver was

11

expressly made applicable both to pending cases and to

12

preexisting claims.

13
14

So, for both of those reasons the
alternative ground is also one that warrants reversal.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Were there judgments,

16

outstanding judgments that had become final -- judgments

17

outstanding against Iraq, that were not challenged on

18

appeal?

19

MR. FRANKLIN:

There is at least two that I

20

am aware of, two default judgments.

They are cited in

21

our brief.

22

judgment creditors, as it were, to execute on those

23

judgments would depend on the application of the new

24

statutes that Congress enacted about judgment execution.

25

Those are not at issue in this case.

And the effective ability of those default

12
Alderson Reporting Company

But the answer to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your question is yes, there were at least two judgments

2

that I am aware of that were default judgments where

3

Iraq had not appeared and did not contest the case.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

that those could be reopened?

6

MR. FRANKLIN:

And you're not claiming

We are not claiming in this

7

-- in this proceeding they could be reopened.

We're

8

actually not claiming -- we haven't claimed in any

9

proceeding that they can be reopened.

But there is a

10

serious question as to whether or not the plaintiffs

11

would be able to execute in the United States on those

12

judgments.

13

are subject to all of the usual rules to the extent

14

about reopening default judgments, not on the grounds of

15

this sovereign immunity issue, but on the normal grounds

16

of reopening of default judgments.

17

there are such bases, I don't want to give up on those.

18

But we are not -- we are not making -- this

Also, they are default judgments and so they

So, to the extent

19

argument's immunity argument today applies to these

20

pending cases and the ability of courts to enter

21

judgments, not to existing default judgments, but the

22

execution on those judgments may well be affected by the

23

arguments we are making today.

24
25

In the final analysis, I think this -- this
is a case that turns ultimately on the President's

No, it doesn't depend on it,

made these determinations, and to also recognize that

the people to rebuild their country and also their new

be thwarted or seriously disrupted if the Court were to

hold that Iraq's sovereign immunity has been abrogated

22

in these cases.

23

It is still towards supporting

I also gather that the

24

ability of the President or the United States to seek

on behalf of these plaintiffs is not affected at all by

2

this outcome, right?

3

MR. FRANKLIN:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

4

That is the way that these kinds of claims have always

5

been addressed in the past and these are the way that

6

these kinds of claims, particularly between friendly

7

allies, ought to be addressed.

in this instance the Court in its Republic of Peru case

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

5
6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

7

EWSAA section 1503 authorized the President

8

to make inapplicable with respect to Iraq any provision

9

of law that applies to countries that have sponsored

10

terrorism.

11

Sovereign Immunities Act falls squarely within the plain

12

language of that authority.

13

question about that, certainly the President's exercise

14

of his authority under that statute would be entitled to

15

deference.

16

The terrorism exception to the Foreign

But if there were any

Even if one were to add the atextual

17

additional limitation that the Acree court majority

18

tried to, that it only encompassed statutes that would

19

stand as an obstacle to the funding of the Iraqi regime

20

in the aftermath of removing the Hussein government,

21

still the President's memorandum to Congress makes clear

22

his determination that the threat of billions of dollars

23

of judgments against Iraq and the seizure or freezing of

24

their assets by attachment constituted an immediate

25

threat to the foreign policy interests of the United
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

States and our critical foreign policy goals in Iraq.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought we were just

3

told that because there -- of the limitations on

4

enforcement, the -- there would be no realistic threat

5

to the Iraqi assets in the United States because the

6

judgment creditor wouldn't have access to them.

7

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That is because of

8

the authorities that the President exercised under the

9

second proviso of 1503.

There are exceptions to the

10

immunity of foreign states with respect to attachment.

11

There is one that specifically applies to countries that

12

have been designated as having sponsored terrorism, and

13

that exception as well was rendered inapplicable to Iraq

14

pursuant to this same authority.

15

And so, again, it is essential to the

16

government's foreign policy interests in Iraq that these

17

judgments, the ability to attach Iraqi assets -- in

18

fact, at the time, in the summer of 2003, there were

19

plaintiffs that were running around trying to attach the

20

very assets, the very bundles of cash, that the United

21

States Government was attempting to shift to Iraq in

22

order to pay immediate needs in -- in Iraq in the

17

On a -- on a dime, our policy shifted

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is -- is all of this -- I

18

won't say academic, but it ultimately doesn't matter if

19

the D.C. Circuit was right in the Acree case in saying,

20

well, 1605(a)(7) allowed suit against Iraq, but there's

21

no cause of action.

22

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No, Your Honor.

23

The judgment in the Acree case dismissing the claims for

24

failure to state a claim was because counsel in that

25

particular suit was unable to identify a source of law
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for their claim.

The D.C. Circuit has correctly held

2

that Federal law did not at that time provide a cause of

3

action under 1605(a)(7), and counsel was unable when

4

pressed at oral argument to identify the source of law.

5

But numerous district court judgments exist

6

where the courts have upheld the availability of

7

transitory tort under the law of the forum State, under

8

the law of the residence of the plaintiff, or under the

9

law of the -- of the place where the wrong occurred to

10

provide a cause of action.

11
12

So -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where the wrong occurred

would have been Iraq.

13

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right.

And

14

-- and, of course, the courts have to apply a choice of

15

law analysis.

16

apply the law of the forum State where the plaintiff

17

resided.

18

there are constitutional limitations on the ability of a

19

State to project its substantive law to a tort that

20

occurs abroad, but -- but those issues have not yet I

continue for any claim that arose from acts committed

statutes immediately inapplicable to Iraq.

course, it would not be inapplicable to Iraq to hold

that today a court would have jurisdiction over Iraq and

authority to enter a judgment against Iraq pursuant to

But the authority that

10

So the only way that one can give full

effect to the plain language of the statute, "make

exercised that authority, 1605(a)(7) became

14

inapplicable, unavailable, as the basis of exercising

jurisdiction over Iraq.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Court will want to have available to it

22

23

text of the statutes.

24
25

And I do want to talk about the

And the point that I'm going to make from
the text of the statutes is that the Solicitor General
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just correctly described to you what it was that

2

Congress was trying to accomplish when he said that the

3

structure of 1605 -- 1605(a)(7) of the Foreign Sovereign

4

Immunities Act says if you are the victim of torture by

5

a nation designated as a state sponsor of terror and

6

that designation changes so that you are no longer on

7

that list, then you still have a cause of action under

8

the FSIA.

9

and gets de-designated doesn't change that result.

The fact that the country changes its ways

10

Now, what the Solicitor General says is that

11

Congress changed that rule in 1503 and that's the debate

12

in this case:

13

President may make inapplicable various statutes which

14

they say include section 1605(a)(7), did it change the

15

basic rule about what the effect of a designation and a

16

rescindment of a designation was, or instead was it

17

giving the President a special power to remove the

18

designation?

Did Congress when it said that the

19

If all it was doing was giving the power to

20

the President to immediately rescind Iraq's designation

21

as a terrorist state, if it was a more modest power

22

rather than effectively writing into 1605(a)(7) "except

23

for Iraq," if it's just a power about rescindment, then

24

the rule of 1605(a)(7) that the Solicitor General just

Congress have wanted to make that distinction?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.
Okay, this is how you get

designated:

"Prohibition.

The United States shall not

principal foreign aid statute -- "the Agricultural

Trade, Development, and Assistance Act of 1954, the

10

Peace Corps Act, or the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945

11

to any country" -- and here's how you get designated "if

12

the Secretary of State determines that the government of

13

that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of

14

international terrorism."

15

Iran, Sudan.

16

So we've designated Syria,

Now, that designation can be rescinded and

17

that's usually what happens.

But there are important

18

restrictions on the rescindment that gave rise to the

19

enactment of section 1503, and they are in C, recision.

The Congress limited the President's ability to

So here's the dilemma and, Justice Souter,

7

this is the complete explanation for why Congress gave

8

the President the power it did in section 1503.

9

Remember when the EWSAA is enacted there is a whole

10

discussion in the first 30 minutes about the new regime.

11

There was no new regime.

how the Saddam Hussein regime had been toppled.

13

enacted, Baghdad had fallen seven days earlier.

There

We would not recognize an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there may have

19

not been a new one, but there certainly was not the old

20

one either.

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

But, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, I'm making a very particular point, and that is

23

that the President lacked the power under this statute

24

that I have just cited to you, 620A -- and it is also

25

the statute that is cited in 1503 -- the President
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lacked the power at that time because there was no new

2

government and there wasn't a change in policy in the

3

old government.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But there's nothing better

5

settled -- well, perhaps that's broad.

6

settled that the President is the one to determine who

7

is the lawful and legitimate government that he would

8

deal with.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's correct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

13

It is very well

That's all that was

And it's not just a question of one
It's a question of what government

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Exactly right -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that is under -- and

16

under the law something that has always been committed

17

to the very large discretion of the President.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I couldn't agree with you

19

more, Justice Kennedy.

And here's the relevant point.

20

In the spring of 2003 when Congress enacted this

21

statute, we had not recognized a new Iraqi government.

22

We did that in June of 2004.

23

think this is very clear from the history, Congress

24

enacted section 1503 of the EWSAA because the President

25

was powerless under the existing state of the law to

So my point is, and I

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rescind Iraq's designation as a terrorist state.

2

what -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it was -- the text of

4

it was not limited to rescinding that designation.

5

mean, that's the problem, it seems to me.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's

Okay.

I

Well, let's go to the

7

text, if we could.

8

in the appendix to the blue brief.

9

it's the second proviso, of course, and it appears seven

10

And that is in the blue brief.

It's

And it's at 4A.

And

lines down.

11

"Provided further, that the President may

12

make inapplicable" -- that's the language that we are

13

going to focus on, Justice Souter -- "make inapplicable

14

with respect to Iraq" -- and then it identifies the

15

statute -- "section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act

16

of 1961 or any provision of law that applies to

17

countries that have supported terrorism."

18

Now, we are putting aside the debate of

19

whether section 1605(a)(7) is such a law.

20

assuming it is and you say it, Justice Souter, but he is

21

given the power to make inapplicable section 1605(a)(7).

22

He isn't just given the power to rescind the

23

designation.

that applies and make it inapplicable.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

purpose of it is that the normal process is going to

take time, and therefore it's being replaced with an

emergency measure that becomes effective immediately.

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But this statute
It says the
The very

Yes, the de-designation

23

becomes effective immediately.

What -- the distinction

24

that I am drawing is that there is a strong version of

25

the words "make inapplicable," and there is a more
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

modest version of the words "make inapplicable."

2

Iraq and the United States say that when he

3

made it inapplicable he in effect essentially wrote it

4

out of the U.S. Code or wrote in the exception that says

5

"except for Iraq."

6

this context is a term of art that deals with

7

designation and rescindment.

8

that Congress was trying to do, was to allow the

9

President to immediately -

10
11

We say that "make inapplicable" in

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that process is all

All right.

Let's -- let's

assume -

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- for the sake of argument

14

that the reasons for -- otherwise the reasons for and

15

against the point you've just made are evenly balanced.

16

We are on the fence.

17

we resolve this in favor of the President's position,

18

simply because in the absence of the statutes that we're

19

talking about, starting with the Foreign Sovereign

20

Immunities Act, the President would have had under the

21

foreign policy power of Presidents the authority to stop

22

suits like this dead in the water simply by taking the

23

position that that should be the result?

24

doubt, shouldn't we construe these statutes consistently

25

with the traditional foreign policy authority of the

Don't we resolve this -- shouldn't

So that if in

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

President, in which case we get off the fence and we go

2

in the way of the Petitioners rather than your way?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I would say, no, because

4

that regime, as was indicated in the first 30 minutes,

5

has been profoundly changed by the enactment of the

6

FSIA.

We adopted a different -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's been profoundly

8

changed if we accept your argument.

I mean, at the

9

moment the question is whether it has been profoundly

10

changed or not.

11

case in which the statutes are seemingly subject to -

12

to -- to arguments either way, why don't we go with

13

tradition?

14

We've got a statutory mess.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

And in a

Well, I do want to

15

come to whether we are in equipoise in just a second.

16

do think the fact that Congress changed the model so

17

that we don't use, in effect, the Tape Memorandum model.

18

Second, remember, Justice Souter, that this

19

isn't a return to that model.

What used to happen

20

before the FSIA is the President would come into court

21

and say I think that this nation has immunity and the

22

court would decide on the basis of that case by case.

23

But it was the President making the determination, case

24

by case.

25

different, if I could just explain how on their -

This is something unknown.

32
Alderson Reporting Company

This is very

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but the President,

2

quite apart from the immunity designation, the President

3

had the authority to compromise suits.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, fine, and if that is

5

espousal power continues to exist, then the President

6

can attempt to exercise it.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't know whether it

8

continues to exist or not for the sake of this argument,

9

and I'm not -- I'm not making that point for the sake of

10

this argument.

11

otherwise unclear, given that that power was

12

traditionally enjoyed by the President, why do we not

13

construe the -- or resolve the equipoise if it gets to

14

that point, in the President's favor rather than your

15

favor?

16

I'm simply saying that if it is

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

So the -- two

17

reasons, the first is this is not an attempt at

18

espousal, unlike Dames & Moore and cases like that.

19

Remember the President hasn't set up some sort of

20

mechanism for resolving these claims.

21

saying that they are -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

He is simply

Well, he hasn't set it up

23

because he thinks he has got the authority under this

24

statute or had the authority under this statute.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Souter, it wouldn't

act of espousal then he would have set up some mechanism

3

for resolving the claims.

4
5

If the President were engaging in an

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, I -- I quite agree with

that.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So can I -

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So I suppose the first step

8

in that direction is to stop the suit that's going on

9

now.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, the President

11

purported to do that nine -- excuse me, five or six

12

years ago and if he were going to set up a mechanism, I

13

think he would have.

14
15
16

But can I just then just come to the premise
of whether we are JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why -- why shouldn't

17

we treat this -- yes, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities

18

Act said Congress is setting the rules.

19

this emergency measure effectively restore to the

20

President under these special circumstances the power

21

that he once had?

22

23

dealing with Iraq, the authority -- the control

authority he once had?

25

But why doesn't

Congress ceding back to the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

So let's -- if I

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could accept the premise that -- and not try to combat

2

the premise of what we would do in the case of

3

equipoise, let me turn to the question of what statute

4

really means and why we shouldn't be in equipoise.

5

Court generally has not assumed that emergency

6

appropriations measures issues, particular their

7

provisos, changed the jurisdiction of the Federal

8

courts, much less give the President the power to change

9

the jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

The

And it has in

10

related context taken language like "any provision" and

11

said well, we are looking for a clear statement of law

12

by Congress to make sure it has confronted this

13

situation.

14

When it attempts to -- when the argument on

15

the other side is that the Congress has passed a law

16

that shifts the balance of power between Congress and

17

the legislature and the executive in cases like

18

Atascadero, in cases like Raygor, Will, these are all

19

cases that had said statutes that said "any," and the

20

Court said well, because this a -- a relatively strange

21

thing to provide in the proviso to an appropriations

22

measure, for example, we would ask that there be a clear

23

statement.

24

in equipoise.

25

So that would be one reason that we are not

JUSTICE ALITO:

But as a practical matter,
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

isn't this closely associated with appropriations and

2

with foreign aid?

3

going to be needed to reconstruct Iraq in -- in the wake

4

of the war and the money could be provided directly by

5

the United States through foreign assistance, which is

6

part of the thrust of -- of this provision, certainly.

7

And the argument is that this is closely related to it,

8

because it freed up other money that would be used for

9

reconstruction.

The issue is billions of dollars were

So why is there anything odd about this

10

being in an appropriations provision?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because this -- well,

12

because what Congress was doing was confronting an

13

emergency.

14

President's transmittal of the statute, the legislative

15

history of the statute, or anything else that says that

16

Congress was dealing with the sort of medium to

17

long-term health of the Iraqi population or the Iraqi

18

government or the Iraqi economy.

19

you would have expected if that was Congress's intent is

20

that Congress would have dealt with Iraq's debts, Saddam

21

Hussein's debts, and would you also suspect that this

22

wouldn't sunset, which is the eighth proviso that hasn't

been discussed never much.

There is not a breath, in either the

goes to other things that involve aid to the Iraqi

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I actually do disagree and

2

believe you can logically look at the statute -- in the

3

sense that the word "any" means "every," that is true.

4

But if you look at what Congress was trying to

5

accomplish, it was much more focused on questions of the

6

immediate economic impact of the need to begin

7

reconstruction in Iraq right away.

JUSTICE STEVENS:
this question?

Mr. Goldstein, could I ask

You are reading into it the exception,

10

of the words "any other provision of law."

11

12

be sure which.

13

provision of the law, except those that affect the

14

jurisdiction of courts?

15

provisions of law that relate to foreign assistance?

16

And I can

Are you saying it means any other

Or are you saying any other

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I am saying that except for

17

those that relate to jurisdiction, because that is the

18

kind of thing that you would expect Congress to deal

19

with correctly.

20

The answer to Justice Ginsburg's question in

21

the first 30 minutes is has this Court ever confronted a

22

statute and construed it to remove the jurisdiction of

23

the Federal courts without expressly saying so, is no.

categories, A is the category which you could see that

2

other questions of law apply to.

3

C, is the other -- other things -- other things that it

might apply to, but in your opinion it would be absurd

5

to apply them to that.

B, is this case, and

All right, what's in category C?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If it's anything, it would

7

be the export of military hardware.

In the immediate

8

wake of the fall of Baghdad, when there is no new

9

government, right?

There is no replacement regime.

If

10

you read "any" to mean literally "every" then you could

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, Justice Breyer, in -

the same point was made in cases like Atascadero and

6

"Any" means "every" except for the States.

In

But can I just make quite clear, we have two

lines of argument.

And I think it's important to

8

recognize that.

9

means and does that include section 1605(a)(7).

We have the debate over what any other
That's

10

what we have been discussing here, and the idea that any

11

means every, and Congress spoke broadly and so that's

12

what we have.

13

But we have the other incredibly important

14

arguments of what it means to make a sanction

15

inapplicable.

16

point, and the question of whether the statutes sunset

17

as the Acree court did.

18

those point of what it is to make inapplicable a statute

19

that applies to nations that have supported terrorism.

20

And I want to return to the statutory text and explain

21

why our more modest reading of "make inapplicable" is

22

the right one.

23

Which is separate and independent of that

And I want to return First to

So the statutory text again is at 4a.

Here

24

are, I think, the strong statutory indications that we

25

are right, that what Congress was trying to do was to
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

allow the President to immediately de-designate Iraq as

2

a terrorist state.

3

between the language "a statute that applies to

4

countries that have supported terrorism" and the

5

directive that the President can make it inapplicable.

6

That tells you, look at how it is that these statutes

7

apply in the first place, and the linguistic term of art

8

is to do the reverse.

9

make it inapplicable.

10

First, there is a direct parallel

Take something that applies and

And something that applies to an -- statutes

11

apply to countries that have supported terrorism under

12

American law only in one way, through designation.

13

what happens is that the President was allowed to

14

rescind it.

15

And

The second textual reason for our more

16

modest reading of make inapplicable is reference to

17

section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act.

18

one thing:

19

Breyer, about what any means in this context, we know

20

the Congress told the President he could immediately

21

make inapplicable section 620A.

22

So we know

even if we debate and disagree, Justice

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why did -- why did he need

23

the statute to do that?

In other words if the President

24

had the power to designate in the first place, normally

25

that assumes the power to -- to rescind the designation.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's exactly right, but

2

that's the point.

When I took you to the text of 620A,

3

which was at 344 of the joint appendix volume 2,

4

Justice Souter, he didn't have the power to do it right

7

ways.

8

And I can prove that to you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

just a belt-and-suspenders act.

15

difficult, he has to envision there may be people who

16

challenge that -- his interpretation of the law.

17

there's the other provision that will make it

inapplicable under that as well.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So

I -- I disagree, but we will

20

accept that.

Mr. Chief Justice, my point isn't, hey,

21

look, he himself acknowledged that he needed to exercise

22

his de-designation power.

23

that is the fact that he didn't do this under the

24

Foreign Assistance Act until 2004 is a strong indication

25

that he couldn't do it before.

My point is different, and

If he could have done it

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

before, he would have.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it may also be an

3

indication that he thought he had effectively

4

accomplished what he wanted by -- by acting under this

5

statute, and therefore he had other fish to fry.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I -- I don't understand,

7

Justice Souter, why he would in 2004, after a new

8

government is recognized, suddenly decide to

9

de-designate Iraq.

10

There wasn't any -- the only -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -- I don't know, either.

11

I mean, I can't -- I can't read minds, but there is an

12

interpretation that is quite possible consistent with

13

the text of this statute, that he thought that by acting

14

under 1503, he had done everything that he needed to do.

15

Why he had at some subsequent time said, well, you know,

16

I'll -- I'll use belt as well as suspenders, I don't

know.

18

that he had the authority here.

But it would be consistent with the assumption

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, it -- I agree it would

20

be consistent with the assumption that he had the

21

authority here.

22

that.

23

under 620A -- the fact that he exercised it in 2004 is a

24

strong indication that that's -- it's not the only

25

possible reading, but it's a strong indication that

That's -- I'm not trying to negative

But, Mr. Goldstein,

3

before you finish your argument, I'd like to know what

4

you think about the claim for relief.

5

said this is a mere jurisdictional provision, and it

6

doesn't provide a private right of action; the new

7

statute does, but that doesn't apply to Iraq.

8

was the source of the claim -- what is the source of

9

these plaintiffs' claim for relief?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The D.C. Circuit

So, what

The Solicitor General has it

11

right.

Post-Acree, these claims -- these types of

12

claims were pleaded principally as State-law claims, and

13

that has been recognized as providing a substantive

14

cause of action.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

17

Which -- which State law?

The State law generally of

the home State of the plaintiffs.

reasoning, people all over the world could sue the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes, I understand,

12

Justice Ginsburg.

13

1605A, the statute that's created by the 2008 NDAA,

14

creates an affirmative U.S. cause of action.

always going to be an underlying domestic cause of

action that underlies the FSIA, whether it's State law

"make inapplicable."

23

of these statutes are applied and made inapplicable.

24

also want to draw the contrast between the two operative

25

powers that are given to the President.

I pointed out how it is that all

47
Alderson Reporting Company

At the

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

beginning, the statute says the President may suspend

2

the application of any provision of the Iraq Sanctions

3

Act, which is the kind of power that they are talking

4

about, essentially to lift the statute; whereas, the

5

term of art, we think, "make inapplicable" in the

6

context of these statutes is the narrow power to

7

de-designate the state as a state sponsor of terror.

8

But let me just return, if I can -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It could have been an argument that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's not

23

presented because your friends on the other side think

24

the -- on a narrower ground, that the statute applies.

25

But if we agree with you and disagree with that, it
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

seems to me that he has an argument -- the President has

2

the argument that he has this authority under the

3

Constitution.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I agree he has that

5

argument; he just hasn't made it in -- in this case -

6

in his -- in the Iraq's -- Iraq hasn't made it in the

7

cert petition, I should say, in the question on this

8

Court -- on which this Court granted certiorari.

9

I think to decide the debate, Justice

10

Souter, of whether we're in equipoise here and the

11

debate about whether or not the power was grand or

12

instead more modest, we have to resolve the -- the

13

question of what it is that Congress intended to do in

14

this proviso to this emergency appropriations measure.

15

Was it confronting a very specific moment in time at

16

which Baghdad had just fallen and we needed to get

17

emergency -- emergency aid to Iraq?

18

fundamentally changing our policy, making Iraq an ally

19

despite the fact that there wasn't even an Iraqi

20

government there?

21

the power to the President to immunize Iraq permanently

22

from liability under the FSIA, which doesn't even exist

23

with respect to our closest allies, Britain and France?

24

That is a significant over-reading of what -

25

Or was it, instead,

Was he given -- was Congress giving

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why do you say

49
Alderson Reporting Company

"permanently"?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because -

3

5

the action that made it inapplicable.

I don't understand how,

The -- the powers of the President

This statute sunset.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Their whole point is -

Well -- no, but during the

10

period in which the statute is applicable, I don't know

11

of any reason why he cannot change his designation of

12

inapplicability.

13

change in the foreign policy of the United States or the

14

-- or the powers relating to the foreign policy of the

15

United States doesn't seem to me a legitimate argument.

16

So that the argument of a permanent

17

effect, but it's not anymore.

18

permanently made the FSIA -- the -- section 620A of the

19

20

and that would be incredibly unusual.

were designated.

inapplicability survived the sunset of the statute in

It is our position that it

will be permanent because the Government of Iraq is now

15

a very strong ally of the United States in the fight

16

against terrorism, not a sponsor of it.

17

Just a few other points based on the

18

argument that just occurred.

They are interpreting the

19

statute apparently now to say that the President only

20

had the power to rescind the -- the previous

21

designations, but that's not what the statute says.

22

that's what Congress had meant, they would have done

that.

case depends on that statute being applicable today

It cannot be both applicable and having been

5

The other point that was mentioned -- and

6

also I would also say in this regard that our foreign

7

policy towards Iraq is different than our foreign policy

8

towards other former state-sponsored terrorism.

9

for example, was taken off the list, but there was an

Libya,

10

express requirement that Libya answer to the claims that

11

were before it.

12

the government that sponsored that terrorism, the -- the

13

Khadafi Government, was still in power.

14

And, of course, that was because the -

Here we had gone into the country with U.S.

15

military force aided by our allies, and we have ousted

16

the regime, and we were seeking to support Iraq in its

17

efforts to rebuild.

18

There was a point about the de-designation

19

that was done in 2004.

The Secretary of State -- and it

20

is cited on page 25 in the blue brief.

21

State said in the de-designation that it was largely

22

symbolic or perhaps a belt and suspenders, but he said

23

it was largely symbolic in light of the prior EWSAA

24

determination.

25

something else that occurred.

The Secretary of

However -- and this is relevant to
The de-designation was

specifically exempted from the President's authority.
