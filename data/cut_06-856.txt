ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. STRIS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

Let me begin with the first question on

12

which this Court has granted certiorari.

13

502(a)(2) and 409 of ERISA permit restoration of "any

14

losses to the plan."

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What are the code numbers

16

of those?

18

Section 3 of ERISA.

19

sections are you talking about?

20

I really get confused with you people who

I use the code.

MR. STRIS:

What -- what code

I never thought the day would

21

come, Justice Scalia, when I was described as working

22

with ERISA all of the time, but I will tell you the code

provision.

2

1109(a), and that is found on page 9a of the blue brief.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. STRIS:

Thank you.

Now, the statute plainly states

5

that "any losses to the plan" may be recovered if they

6

were caused by fiduciary breach.

7

(a)(2) question is straightforward.

of "any losses to the plan" includes any diminution in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right, the summary.

16

And I looked at the summary and saw nowhere the rules

17

about investment options, what you get to choose, how

18

often -- and for all we know, the plan might say you

19

have no choice about investment options, it's all going

20

to be invested in T-bills or whatever.

21

MR. STRIS:

Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice,

22

that's not true.

I would point your attention to page

23

19a of the appendix to the brief in opposition.

24

this is the page of the summary plan description that

25

makes clear that participants in the plan like Mr. LaRue

this case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, that's the

summary of the plan.
MR. STRIS:

The summary plan description,

20

that's correct.

21

there is a conflict between the summary plan description

22

and the plan, the summary plan description governs; it's

23

a legitimate document.

And as you know, Mr. Chief Justice, if

If true, then that would constitute a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would also

13

presumably more obviously constitute a breach of the

14

plan, correct?

15

MR. STRIS:

Yes, that's correct; and that is

16

a fiduciary breach.

17

in accordance with the terms of the plan is a classic

18

example of breach of fiduciary duty.

19

Under 404 (a)(1)(D), failure to act

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your position is

20

anything that is remediable, if that's a word, under

25

MR. STRIS:

No, that is not my position.

My

position CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let me step back.

Do you agree that you could bring an action under (a)(1)
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for this breach of the plan?

2

MR. STRIS:

I think that's far from clear,

3

but what is clear is that we could not recover what we

4

wanted under (a)(1).

5

against the plan.

6

that are relevant.

7
8

(a)(1) only permits a lawsuit

Here the plan doesn't have the funds

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

doesn't state that.

11

he proceed first under (a)(1)(B), against the plan?

MR. STRIS:

Well -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because the plan owes him

21

this money.

22

you know the fiduciary didn't invest your funds the way

23

it was supposed to, the plan still owes him the money,

24

doesn't it?

25

And if the plan turns around and says well,

MR. STRIS:

I think the answer to that -- I
7


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think there are two reasons why that's incorrect.

2

the first reason is 502 (a)(2), unlike 502(a)(3), is not

3

a catchall provision, so if he has a remedy under

4

502(a)(2) -

5
6
7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

I'm talking about

(a)(1)(B).
MR. STRIS:

Right.

And it is -- there is

8

nothing to suggest that that provision is mutually

9

exclusive with another provision.

So my first response

10

to your question, Justice Scalia, is that even if he

11

could have proceeded under (a)(1)(B), there is nothing

12

to suggest that he had to, if he wanted to proceed under

13

the express terms of (a)(2).

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there is -- there is

15

this to suggest that only -- only that manner of

16

proceeding preserves the structure of -- of the

17

legislation which is that you're supposed to first apply

18

to the plan and exhaust your remedies there before you

19

come into court; and interpreting it that way would

20

preserve that -- that exhaustion requirement.

21

to apply to the plan first, and if you establish that

22

the plan owes you money, then it's a loss to the plan

23

and you can sue in court.

24
25

MR. STRIS:

You have

Well, what I would say to that,

Justice Scalia, and is that this administrative
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exhaustion requirement that you're referring to is a

2

judicial gloss on the statute.

3

believe that the express terms of (a)(2), which the

4

plain language authorizes restoration to the plan of any

5

losses to the plan for any breach of duty -

6

I find it hard to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your approach, if

7

can you go under (a)(2) -- you're right that we

8

judicially have developed a number of glosses on (a)(1),

9

including I think most importantly the Firestone

10

deference principle.

11

go under (a)(2), then all of that work has been in vain.

12

You can avoid all the limitations on (a)(1) just by

13

saying we want the same relief under (a)(2).

14

MR. STRIS:

But if you're right that you can

I would not agree with that

15

characterization because there are very few cases where

16

the specific conditions for (a)(2) are met.

17

need to prove a loss to the plan.

18

cases, for example, you would not be able to proceed

19

under (a)(2) because you would never be able to show

20

that the fiduciary breach caused a loss to the plan.

21
22

In welfare plan

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You told me earlier

that any breach of the plan was a fiduciary duty.

23

MR. STRIS:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

You would

That's correct.
Now you're -- the -

what is it -- the obverse or the converse of that you're
9

Alderson Reporting Company

saying is not true.

2

MR. STRIS:

No, that's not true.

There are

3

two requirements for an (a)(2) action.

4

there be a fiduciary breach.

5

to when you referred to a breach of the term of the

6

plan.

7

goes to the heart of why (a)(2) is what it is.

8

must be a loss to the plan.

9

One is that

That's what you just spoke

But there's a second important requirement which

argument had been waived?

15

that it was waived?

writer, and if you use the subjunctive there -- "even if

2

the argument were not therefore waived" -- doesn't that

3

mean it was in fact waived?

4

MR. STRIS:

Not in my opinion, but that's an

5

issue that the Fourth Circuit and the lower courts will

6

need to resolve.

7

having held that, certainly we would be precluded.

8

don't think that that is what they held, and I think we

9

have a very strong argument that we pled a 502(a)(2)

10

If they interpret their opinion as
I

claim as required under the Federal rules.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let me come back to your

12

earlier point that the second requirement of (a)(2) -

13

it's actually a requirement of 1109 -

14

MR. STRIS:

That's correct.

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- is not met.

And that is

16

-- that is to -- to make good to such plan any losses to

17

the plan resulting from each such breach.

18

welfare plans, if you sue the plan, claiming some

19

welfare benefits that haven't been provided, wouldn't

20

the plan have to provide those benefits?

21
22

MR. STRIS:

25

That is a classic action

under (a)(1)(B), Your Honor.

23
24

Yes.

In these

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that would be a loss to

MR. STRIS:

I don't agree with that

the plan.
No.
11

characterization.

In a defined benefit plan of which a

2

welfare plan is the classic example -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. STRIS:

5
6
7
8
9

Right.

-- there are no assets that you

have an entitlement to as a beneficiary.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I have an entitlement to

certain -- certain welfare payments.
MR. STRIS:

That's -- you have entitlement

to a contractually provided benefit.

So, if there is a

10

fiduciary breach in terms of the administrator stating,

11

"We're not going to give you this cancer treatment that

12

really was provided under plan" -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. STRIS:

15

Or, "we're not going to give you

this drug" -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. STRIS:

18
19

Right.

Right.

-- that breach doesn't cause any

diminution in value in plan assets.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It does if you sue the plan

20

and require the plan to pay what the plan has committed

21

to pay, whereupon the plan would have a right of action

22

against the fiduciary, I assume, for the fiduciary's

23

failure to do what he was supposed to.

24
25

MR. STRIS:

Well, that may be true, but with

respect, I think that that is -- that's the tail wagging

That's another statute.

requirement first.

You apply to the plan and say the

If it says "yes, we

10

11

MR. STRIS:

Let me take a step back because

12

I think we are 100 percent in agreement, but I want to

13

be clear what our position is.

14

scenario that you described, I agree with you 100

15

percent that you would need to proceed under (a)(1)(B),

16

because you would be requesting a benefit that you are

17

entitled to under the plan.

18

Under the factual

In this case, the only benefit that you are

19

entitled to, if you are a participant in an individual

20

account plan, is the value of the contributions that

21

you've put or your employer has put into the account, as

22

they have either appreciated or depreciated.

23

first response -- it's actually the second response I

24

was going to give earlier that I never got to is that I

25

believe that it's not clear that there is even a
13
Alderson Reporting Company

So my

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

legitimate (a)(1)(B) claim that Mr. LaRue could have

2

asserted here because -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it isn't just if the

4

5

rights under the terms or to clarify his rights to

6

future benefits under the terms of the plan."

7

MR. STRIS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

It says, "to enforce his

That is correct.
And if there's no money in

his account, it seems to me he could bring an action to

10

clarify that even if there is no money in his account

11

the plan owes him future benefits in that amount.

12

MR. STRIS:

And then one of two things at

13

that point would happen, Justice Scalia.

14

would get paid by the plan, which would pick the pockets

15

of the other participants and require the plan to then

16

bring an action under (a)(2) -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. STRIS:

Either he

Right.

-- which is perfectly

19

legitimate, but my response to that is there is no

20

language in the statute to suggest that that is

21

required.

22

(a)(2), there's no language in the statute to suggest

23

that he need bring an (a)(1) action first and require

24

the plan to then proceed under (a)(2).

25

If he has an action to do that directly under

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
14
Alderson Reporting Company

I -- I'm not sure

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about your characterization that he would pick the

2

pockets of the other plan participants.

3

he only prevails if this was a benefit to which he was

4

entitled under the plan.

5

the other plan participants.

6

MR. STRIS:

By definition

So that doesn't seem unfair to

Well, a defined contribution

7

plan is nothing more than a collection of assets that

8

have been allocated to a group of participants.

9

those assets are depleted through fiduciary breach,

So, if

10

which is what occurred here, and you bring a claim

11

saying that your interest in the plan was depleted, if

12

you brought that claim against the plan, the plan no

13

longer has the money.

14

So either they can pay you -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it may or may

15

not have the money.

16

instructions in a way that enriched the plan, and it's

17

simply a question of getting that money properly

18

allocated rather than improperly allocated to the other

19

plan participants who are picking the pocket of your

20

client.

21

You could have failed to follow his

MR. STRIS:

Well, I think under the example

22

that you just gave, Mr. Chief Justice, there would not

23

be a loss to the plan.

24

Our fundamental argument about the plain

25

text of this statute is that a loss to the plan is a

diminution in plan assets.

2

plan, and the administrator doesn't like me and takes my

3

money and allocates it, just because they feel like it,

4

to another participant in the plan, it is not our

5

position that there would be a claim under (a)(2)

6

because there has been no diminution in plan assets.

7

One would need to proceed under (a)(3).

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

If I'm a participant in a

But the plan wouldn't

necessarily pay out any money.

What would happen is,

10

after the administrative determination by the plan that

11

it does owe the money, he would sue the plan for the

12

money and the plan would implead the trustee who was

13

responsible for this.

14

It ends up the same way.

MR. STRIS:

Well, I would say two things

15

about that.

17

for my point, which is 502(a)(3) of ERISA has been

20

and very specific relief that is available if those

21

conditions are met.

precludes a remedy under (a)(2).

24
25

First, it may end up the same way depending

MR. STRIS:

I

I don't think there's any

ERISA imposes a duty of loyalty to

And that really goes to the core of the

One thing is clear here.

Whether or not

14

Mr. LaRue could have brought an (a)(1)(B) claim, it

15

would not under any circumstances have resulted in

16

getting money from the fiduciary back into the plan.

17

Absent money being returned to the plan, there can be no

18

meaningful remedy for the breach that occurred.

19
20

So it returns us to the core question in
this case, which is were the terms of (a)(2) satisfied?

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we agree to you on

(a)(2), is there any need to get to (a)(3)?

3

MR. STRIS:

Certainly if you agree with us

on (a)(2), the court of appeals can be reversed on that

5

issue.

6

because this case was decided at the pleading stage.

We ask that you also reach the (a)(3) question,

7

Although it may be unlikely, there are two

8

reasons why we might need to avail ourselves of (a)(3)

9

on remand.

The first is that facts could develop.

I

10

don't have any reason to believe they will, but facts

11

could develop where there is a loss to Mr. LaRue's

12

beneficial interest but not a loss to the plan.

13

16

cognizable claim under two statutes, both of them and

The second reason why you should reach the

19

(a)(3) question is additional relief may be available

20

under (a)(3) that is not available under (a)(2).

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

MR. STRIS:

What would that be?

Well, our theory of surcharge,

23

and it's also the government's theory, is that surcharge

clear that at the end of the day if the release is

coterminous under the two provisions, it would not be

2

appropriate for us to proceed under (a)(3).

3

But that is not a pleading question.

My

4

position as to why you should reach (a)(3) is if we have

5

a cognizable theory under (a)(2) and (a)(3), and we

6

believe we do, we shouldn't be required to choose at

7

this point in time if, as the litigation proceeds, it

turns out that the relief we would be entitled to is

coterminous, then we concede it would not be appropriate

to proceed under (a)(3).

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

ERISA authorizes a participant in a defined

the plan to follow this individual's instructions, any

2

participant in the plan can bring suit under (a)(2)?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

It's -- that's theoretically

4

possible because the loss to the -- loss to this

5

individual account is a loss to the plan.

6

unlikely that a participant that has no -- that is -

7

whose own benefits are not going to be affected has much

8

incentive to sue, and it's also possible that a court

9

might conclude if such a participant did bring suit,

Although it's

10

that such a suit shouldn't proceed under prudential

11

standing principles or because the suit wouldn't be

12

appropriate, but here -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Wouldn't the theory be that

14

if ultimately the other accounts could be robbed to sort

15

of make up for at least part of the loss of this one,

16

that for a loss to any account is a threat to all the

17

others?

18

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we agree that a loss to

19

any account is a threat to the plan as a whole, but I

20

think for a different reason.

21

could rob the other accounts to pay this -- this

22

participant.

duty of loyalty to those participants, the fiduciary

duty of prudence under -- under ERISA.

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I find it very curious that (a)(1)(B)

10

benefits due to him under the terms of his plans or to

clarify his right under the terms of the plan.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

there is that the suit -- the suit is against the plan.

24

even more, Your Honor, that Petitioner's cause of action

25

here arises under (a)(2) because he is seeking relief
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

for the plan not relief from the plan.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It may well.

But I'm just

3

talking right now of (a)(1)(B), and it would seem to me

4

that the logical reading of that is that the suit is

5

against the plan.

6

MR. ROBERTS:

Under (a)(1)(B), most courts

7

require that the suit be brought against the plan.

I

8

think the suit in certain circumstances could be brought

9

against the fiduciary to require the fiduciary to take

10

action that is required by the terms of the plan such as

11

if you fought against the fiduciary to pay benefits out.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do we know that

this is a breach of fiduciary duty under (a)(2) without

14

having the plan before us?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I thought his

argument -- his argument reduces to the fact that it's a

breach of fiduciary duty because it's a breach of the

5

plan.

6

7

But if not a breach of the plan, then it's not a

It's a breach of fiduciary

8

11

investments -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

(a)(1)(B) argument?

3

(a)(2) is available?

4

Are you saying it is available, but

MR. ROBERTS:

We don't think that there is a

5

claim at this point under (a)(1)(B), because the -- the

6

money the Petitioner seeks -- what's happened here is he

7

has alleged that there has been a fiduciary breach that

that is a recovery from the fiduciary in its personal

12

the plan and then it's allocated pursuant to the duty of

13

prudence to the Petitioner's account, then if the plan

14

didn't pay out the money to him when he was entitled to

15

it, which he appears to be entitled to it now since he

16

has withdrawn his account balance, he would have a 502

17

(a)(2) claim -- a 502(a)(1)(B) claim, excuse me -- but

18

he doesn't have a claim under that provision now.

19

at least we think it's very unlikely that he does,

20

because generally plans provide that the benefits that

21

are owed to people are the money that are in -- in the

22

account.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's what

Once the money is back in

We -

Well, now we know what

24

benefits would be due because he has withdrawn, but when

he made this complaint and he hadn't been withdrawn, he

MR. ROBERTS:

That's right, and then he

would -- it would be even clearer, I think that he has

still participating in the plan and he wasn't -- he

7

hadn't withdrawn his account balance and didn't have a

8

right to withdraw his account balance at that time, then

9

he wouldn't have a right to any benefits from the plan.

10

The crux of the matter here is that the plan

11

has suffered a loss and that the appropriate remedy is

12

against the fiduciary in his personal capacity;

would be a suit under (a)(1)(B) and there would be no

There's only a suit under (a)(2) if there

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS P. GIES
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GIES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner in our view suggests an awkward
reading of Section 409, one that is particularly hard to
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reconcile with the structure of the civil enforcement

2

provisions of Section %02, 1132 of the U.S. Code,

3

starting of course with Section (a)(1)(B).

4

To us this is the opposite end of the

5

spectrum of the kind of case the Court was talking about

6

in Russell and what Russell has been assumed to have

7

been meant -

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Russell was about a

welfare plan, not a pension -- and as I recall, the

10

plaintiff in Russell was seeking medical benefits that

11

she didn't get and she wanted, not the benefits because

12

she did get those, she wanted straight out damages,

13

compensatory and punitive damages, for delay in the

14

receipt of benefits.

15

from saying I want the contributions made so that I will

16

get the benefits to which I'm entitled.

17

MR. GIES:

That's quite a different thing

You're right, Your Honor, that

18

that is certainly distinguishable on the facts.

We

19

think the central teaching of Russell, though, applies

20

with equal force to a defined contribution case like

21

this, for several reasons.

22

The first of which is that Russell has been

23

assumed to reflect the dicing that we are talking about

24

which provision in Section 502 is appropriate.

25

Individual claims have traditionally been brought either
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

under (a)(1)(B) or under (a)(3).

2

brought on behalf of the plan as a whole, Russell

3

4

available.

5

defendant, to at the same time assert that this claim is

6

being brought on behalf of the plan.

7

When a claim is being

It is an odd case here, where the plan is a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that is an oddity but

8

what do you say to Mr. Roberts' argument that the only

9

recovery under (a)(1)(B) is against the plan, and the

10

plan doesn't have the money in the account so that if

11

there is going to be any relief it's got to come from

12

the fiduciary and that gets you into (2).

13

MR. GIES:

Well, because neither (a)(2) or

14

(a)(1)(B) were invoked in the district court and the

15

case comes up on a very spares record, it's hard to -

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but we've got to

17

assume at this point that we've -- we've got a -- a

18

Section (2) claim before us and the argument simply is,

19

is that in effect to be disallowed because it should

20

have been an (a)(1)(B) claim?

21

United States has made, the argument that the other side

22

has made is, we cannot get to any money under (a)(1)(B).

23

We've got to get that from the fiduciary and we can only

24

do that under (2).

25

MR. GIES:

And the argument that the

The difference between defined
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

contribution plans and defined benefit plans in ERISA is

2

an important consideration in answering that question.

3

4

benefits due to him.

the term in Firestone.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So then you would agree

that (a)(1)(B) is not available?

10

MR. GIES:

No, Your Honor.

We believe that

11

(a)(1)(B) definitely was available for the Petitioner

12

here.

13

(a)(1)(B) had he invoked that provision remains to -

14

would have remained to have been seen had it been

15

invoked.

16

What relief he might have recovered under

There are three JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the argument of the

17

United States is you can't rob Peter to pay Paul, so

18

that if in fact his account didn't have the money, the

19

plan didn't have any place to get the money, and the

20

only way the money could be had would have been from a

21

fiduciary, which again gets you to subsection (2).

22

MR. GIES:

It would only get you into

23

subsection (2) if it could be argued that that claim was

24

for the benefit of the plan as a whole, as this Court

25

has taught in Russell; and it seems to me, Your Honor,
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that one way to think about this in terms of which

2

provision applies to which of these claims, is whether

3

Congress really intended for these individual kinds of

4

"he said; she said" claims to be brought.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

We think not.

But it seems to me

6

you're answering a different question in that response.

7

The argument here is basically an argument between the

8

possibility -- an argument based on the claim that under

9

(a)(1)(B) you can't go against the fiduciary.

The only

10

way you can get the money is from a fiduciary and

11

therefore (a)(1)(B) would have been of no value to you.

12

Do you -- do you take issue with that premise?

13

MR. GIES:

14

Honor.

15

premise.

16

Well we think --

no.

No, Your

In general we do not take issue with that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, then doesn't that

17

leave you in the position of having to say that you've

18

either got to bring the claim under (a)(1)(B), or you've

19

got -- subsection (2) -- or you've got to bring it under

20

subsection (3)?

21

MR. GIES:

We think not for this reason.

22

The second clause of (a)(1)(B) permits a cause of action

23

to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan.

24

is a case that if you give the Petitioner full benefit

25

of the doubt probably could have been resolved with a

(a)(1)(B) permits an action to enforce

here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If there is a suit

5

under (a)(1)(B) for a breach of the plan by a fiduciary,

6

do you agree that the plan, if it's liable, could then

7

sue the fiduciary?

8

by one of your clients against the other, but would that

9

be a feasible result under the statute?

I realize I'm talking about a suit

10

MR. GIES:

11

possible depending on the facts.

12

sparse record, it's hard to know that there could be an

13

action filed against whoever it was who is alleged to

14

have made the mistake.

15

this case is it's not clear who made the mistake or

16

whether or not the mistake was in fact a breach of

17

fiduciary duty.

18

Yes, it is, and it's also
And again, from this

One of the issues, of course, in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it entirely clear that

19

the plan itself does not have any money to pay this off

20

unless it takes the money from other individual

21

accounts?

22

some plans have independent funds.

23

sources they came from, but some slush fund that they

24

could use for this purpose.

25

I thought one of the briefs said that -- that

It wasn't called a slush

(Laughter.)

MR. GIES:

-- was a plan that provides for

6

This plan does not.

And so the answer

7

to your question is no, there is no other place to get

8

the money from, which we think is another reason why

9

this is not on appropriate claim under (a)(2).

It is

10

not losses to the plan in the conventional way we

We're talking

Let me ask you a slightly different

question.

You said there's no -- there's no, as Justice

Scalia put it, there's no slush fund; there's no pooled

assets here.

Therefore there can be no -- there can be no loss to the

15

plan which is not a loss to an individual account, can

16

there be?

All the assets are assets which are

17

MR. GIES:

Yes, sir.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's correct.

Then what is your theory on

19

how we determine whether a loss to the plan from an

20

individual account suffices as a loss to the plan for

21

purposes of pleading?

losses out of 1000?

question.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but why doesn't the -

In the "stock drop" cases There's something I'm not

understanding about your argument.

When you say the

9

question whether on the merits ultimately there will be

10

question that comes after you answer the question before

question of pleading at this stage?

MR. GIES:

That is correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said it has to be

7

more than one.

How then do we read the statute to say,

8

well, it doesn't have to be the plan as a whole because

9

there may be some people that are not entitled to this?

10

How do we get that number between more than one and less

11

than everybody?

12

MR. GIES:

I would -- I don't think that

13

that's a useful way to think about it either, Justice

14

Ginsburg, which is why I think the right way to think

15

about it in the context of this statute is to think

16

about the nature of the allegation at the pleading

stage.

18

alleged is an imprudent investment in holding company

In the stock drop cases, the fiduciary breach

I think the diamond analogy is closer to that.

just -- in your -- you have said, you conceded, that to

bring the suit against the trustee, it doesn't have to

involve every member, every contributor to this defined

So in that lawsuit, how many people would

MR. GIES:

You say not everybody, but

Well, as we've argued we think it

ought to be a substantial subset reflecting the nature

10

of the breach alleged.

That is, something systemic,

11

something that affects the interests of the plan as a

whole rather than just -

and I still don't get this, but if it is the nature of

we need more than one?

6

MR. GIES:

Because the nature of the

of a more individualistic kind of a breach.

should that make any difference?

MR. GIES:

That's a very difficult question

to answer because this is a defined contribution plan

And we think the Congress -- no remedy?

We think that Congress did not

11

want those kinds of claims to be brought under (a)(2)

12

precisely for that kind of reason.

13

end to the kind of arguments about damages.

14

kind of cases impose costs that will ultimately be borne

15

by the plans, which is inconsistent with the

16

congressional purpose in ERISA to encourage plan

17

formation.

There would be no

So this statute on this kind of a situation

19

may provide him some remedies but maybe not a complete

remedy for loss of all the profits that he claims he was

denied.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You view it as a

lost profits claim.

Would your position be different if

down 30 points instead of going up?

profits.

That's avoiding losses to the plan.
MR. GIES:

We think we have a different

3

situation indeed if there actually had been a

4

distribution here and the amount of the account had gone

5

down between the alleged mistake and the distribution.

6

There is clear as a claim for benefits under (a)(1)(B),

7

and there I think quite easily the Court could say that

8

in that situation the full value of the account at the

9

time of the alleged mistake would be benefits under the

10

terms of the plan.

distinction between this case and others, including the

12

case called Glories v. Charles Schwabb that comes out of

13

the Ninth Circuit.

14

And we think that's a material

Now with respect to (a)(3), we think that

15

the equitable relief is properly understood not to

16

include compensatory damages and that this Court's

17

decisions have been clear on that.

18

would seem to me that the one -- the best that one could

19

say is that it was the exception and not the rule and

Court has understood -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then what is it?

It's got to be something.

3

MR. GIES:

Well, I think what it was, as I

4

understand the history of the equity jurisprudence, is

5

that you could only sue the trustee in the equity

6

courts.

7

a damages claim, that was the only place where you could

8

bring the action.

And so if you needed to get money and if it was

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This isn't like a

cleanup.

11

MR. GIES:

It is not, Your Honor.

As we

12

understand the argument on surcharge, it is separate

13

from clean up and we understand that and accept that.

14

But it still sounds more like damages.

15

something very different from what Congress, we think,

16

meant when they wrote the language of 502.

17

It sounds

Unlike the Landrum Griffin Act, which

18

permits actions for damages, ERISA does not, and Landrum

19

Griffin was one of the statutes on which ERISA was

20

based.

21

It also has fiduciary duty obligations.

22

also has the interests of beneficiaries, members of

23

labor unions at heart.

24

ERISA, the Landrum Griffin act explicitly permits an

25

action for damages.

And unlike this provision in

in a situation like this under (a)(3) does not include a

claim like this for compensatory damages.
