ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARILYN G. BURKHARDT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MS. BURKHARDT:

9

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief

In Crawford this Court made clear that in

11

order to determine the scope of the Confrontation Clause

12

we look to the common law and particularly as it existed

13

at the time of the framing.

14

our briefs, the -- California's forfeiture rule did not

15

exist in common law.

16

the framing.

17

embodied in the Confrontation Clause has grave,

18

practical importance to defendants, and particularly to

19

the defendant in this case, because the application of

20

this new forfeiture rule that California created

21

deprived the Petitioner of his right to present a fair

22

claim of self-defense.

23

And, as we have shown in

It did not exist at the time of

And the common-law concept that is

Basically, the statement that was admitted

24

accused the Petitioner of having viciously attacked

25

Miss Avie and having threatened her at knifepoint and
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

having threatened to kill her.

2

this statement, which he never had a chance to

3

cross-examine or attempt a cross-examination, obviously

4

was highly prejudicial because it indicated to the jury

5

that he was planning to kill her.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the admission of

But he got -- he got on

7

the stand, and he said some very nasty things about her.

8

I mean he painted her as aggressive, vengeful.

9

there a legitimate rebuttal when he is painting her as

Isn't

10

the aggressor, and she has given a statement that

11

suggests that he is the one who was aggressive?

12

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

13

-- her statement came in, in the prosecution's

14

case-in-chief.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But could it have come in

16

as rebuttal of his testimony, the same testimony by the

17

police?

Was it the police officer that --

18

MS. BURKHARDT:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- took her statement?

20

Okay.

He gets on the stand, and he says all of these

21

unpleasant things about her.

22

okay, now we have our chance, and we are going to put in

23

her statement through the testimony of the police

24

officer to rebut what he has just said.

25

MS. BURKHARDT:

And then the State says,

Well, the difference is that
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

his statements about her went solely to his state of

2

mind.

3

statements came in for their truth.

4

an apples-and-oranges comparison.

5

They did not come in for their truth, but her

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it really isn't

I would think that the

6

difference is that his statements about her were subject

7

to cross-examination.

8

MS. BURKHARDT:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Indeed, of course.
And her statements about

him were not.

11

MS. BURKHARDT:

Exactly.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we are not -- well,

13

but we are talking about the door -- the door opening

14

here at trial.

15

testify in California?

16

you're going to testify, you have to give notice?

17

Did he give notice that he was going to
Do they have some rule that if

MS. BURKHARDT:

He did indicate that he was

18

going to present a claim of self-defense, and I believe

19

he indicated that he was going to testify.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That tends to diminish

21

somewhat, but not entirely, your, I think, quite proper

22

response that this came in on direct not -- not cross.

23

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, the

24

fact that it was a self-defense claim is irrelevant.

25

This testimony would have come in -- her testimony or
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hearsay statements would have come in even if he hadn't

2

presented a self-defense claim.

3

coincidence in this case.

4

It just was a

And California claims that they have a right

5

to introduce such testimonial statements in any case in

6

which they can show that the defendant was the cause of

7

the witness's absence.

8
9

I mean the case --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Maybe they would be wrong

-- maybe they would be wrong in another case, but we

10

have this case, and Justice Scalia has suggested, I take

11

it, that this testimony could not come in even by way of

12

rebuttal.

13

MS. BURKHARDT:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

cross-examination.

16
17

Right.
Even by way of

Do you -- do you share that view?

MS. BURKHARDT:

I do.

It -- it doesn't

really go to any of the claims --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It may go to his

19

credibility.

20

woman which is quite different from what her statement

21

to the police officer would portray.

22

He has just painted a picture of this

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, the injustice here,

23

Justice Ginsburg, is that he doesn't have a -- any

24

meaningful opportunity to contest what the police

25

officer says she said because he never had an
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

opportunity to cross-examine her.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course -- of

3

course, that's true.

4

confrontation -- confrontation rule.

5

to me that this is responsive to his defense; and you

6

say, well, it's his state of mind, and her testimony was

7

general.

8
9

That is the reason for the
But it does seem

I think it does go to his state of mind.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not following you.

Is

there -- is there an exception to the hearsay rule so

10

long as the hearsay is brought in, in rebuttal?

11

there a rebuttal exception to the hearsay rule?

12

MS. BURKHARDT:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is

Not to my knowledge.
But we are talking here

14

about the definition or the contours of the equitable

15

rule, the forfeiture rule, for confrontation.

16

think perhaps what Justice Ginsburg was suggesting, and

17

certainly what I was suggesting, is that when we are

18

looking at whether or not there is a forfeiture, we are

19

talking about equitable considerations.

And I

20

Now, it's true in this case we are presented

21

with an instance that I've never seen, which is that the

22

murder itself makes the declarant unavailable for

23

purposes of the equitable exception.

24

that that goes much further than the common law did.

25

MS. BURKHARDT:

And it is true

It goes much further; and,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

indeed, the State has not cited one single case at

2

common law or after that supports its view that this

3

rule is proper.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

How much are we supposed to

5

follow the common law, in your opinion, as it was in the

6

18th century or 12th century, or something?

7

suppose, to take a fanciful example -- I mean -- but

8

suppose there was a common-law rule.

9

wasn't, but suppose there was a common-law rule that

10

said in cases involving witches you cannot admit any

11

evidence because either the witch, the accused witch,

12

came up out of the water when they were dunking her,

13

and, therefore, she is guilty, so there is no need; or

14

she is under water, which shows she is, you know,

15

guilty, but you can't cross-examine a person under

16

water.

17

I mean

And I know there

Now if there were a rule like that, would we

18

now incorporate it into the Constitution of the United

19

States?

The answer is meant to be no.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. BURKHARDT:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

realistic.

Yes.
Now, let's get more

There are all kinds of rules -JUSTICE SCALIA:

He is thinking about

Cambridge and not England.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So there are all

3

kinds of rules of disqualification of witnesses in the

4

17th and 18th century.

5

case there would have been no admission if she had been

6

married to the man instead of being his girlfriend.

7

couldn't have a spouse; you couldn't have an interested

8

party; you couldn't have a child who didn't understand

9

the oath; you couldn't have a person who was an atheist;

10

You

So now are we supposed to incorporate all of
these things into the Confrontation Clause?

13
14

In this

you couldn't have somebody who was a convicted felon.

11
12

You couldn't testify.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do any of them have

anything to do with the Confrontation Clause?

15

MS. BURKHARDT:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.
It doesn't have to do with

17

the Confrontation Clause that you couldn't cross-examine

18

person who didn't understand the meaning of the oath?

19

MS. BURKHARDT:

Justice Breyer, the

20

Confrontation Clause sets forth a basic policy, which is

21

that we are to have live testimony in court.

22

have witnesses available in court.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

We have to

So what about a person who

24

-- the same facts that he could not -- wasn't eligible

25

to testify?

At common law you never could have gotten
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that person to testify in court, no matter what.

2

therefore, what?

3

supposed to follow all of the contours of that rule.

4
5

And,

That's what I'm asking, if we are

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, in Crawford this Court

said we do look to --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But, now, does

7

that make sense?

For example, if this woman had been

8

married, she could not.

9

your client deliberately procured her absence,

She -- her testimony -- whether

10

accidentally procured her absence, whatever he did, that

11

testimony could not have come in, is that right, if she

12

was married to him?

13
14

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, that's sort of -- that

sounds like, say, the situation in Crawford that --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

Justice Breyer is saying --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

the contours are.

19

don't --

20

Well, but I think what

I'm trying to drive at what

Which ones do we ignore, and which

MS. BURKHARDT:

-- sets forth the proper

21

contours, which is that any exception to the

22

Confrontation Clause must be very, very narrow.

23

they approved an exception for witness tampering which

24

is deeply embedded in the common law.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

But I think what Justice

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Breyer's line of questioning points out is that there

2

were other provisions of the evidence rule followed in

3

England which would not allow the testimony to come in,

4

in the first place.

5

the issue before us if the testimony were not admissible

6

as an exception to the hearsay rule.

7

In this case, we wouldn't even have

It is admissible.

Then we have to ask if it conforms with the

8

Confrontation Clause, which is the issue we have.

9

because of the restrictions he points to, there was

10

never the occasion for the common law to explore the

11

boundaries of the forfeiture exception in the

12

confrontation context.

13

MS. BURKHARDT:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

Well, Your Honor -And besides which, the

15

question that Justice Breyer was asking was already

16

answered in Crawford; wasn't it?

17

MS. BURKHARDT:

Yes, it was.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A case from which he

19

dissented.

But we did say that the meaning of the

20

Confrontation Clause is the meaning it bore when the

21

people adopted it.

22

MS. BURKHARDT:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

That is right.
I don't think I did -There was a dying

declaration rule at the common law; wasn't there?
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. BURKHARDT:

Yes, there was.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that didn't

3

require any inquiry into the intent of the person

4

responsible for the death, or the imminent death, right?

5

MS. BURKHARDT:

That's correct.

But the

6

dying declaration -- the fact that the dying declaration

7

rule existed with its very specific elements shows

8

powerfully that no general rule existed such as the

9

California rule, because if the California rule had

10

existed --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if the dying

12

declaration rule didn't require intent, why should

13

yours?

14

MS. BURKHARDT:

Because the forfeiture rule

15

at -- which is a separate -- entirely a separate rule of

16

common law, did require intent to prevent testimony.

17

has always been viewed that way from its inception in

18

Lord Morley's Case --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Instead of intent, the

20

dying declaration rule required knowledge by the

21

declarant that the declarant was about to die.

22

MS. BURKHARDT:

Correct.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right?

24

MS. BURKHARDT:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.
And the evidence of

12
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

truthfulness was apparently that the person was about to

2

enter the next world.

3

MS. BURKHARDT:

That's right.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And most of us don't lie at

5

that particular moment.

Whereas, in the Confrontation

6

Clause situation you have a totally different situation.

7

MS. BURKHARDT:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9
10

Correct.
I joined Crawford, and

Justice Scalia would like to kick me off the boat, which
I'm rapidly leaving in any event, but the --

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You jumped off in Crawford,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

13

I thought.

14

But my question --

15

I want to go back because what I'm finding difficult

16

is -- well, let's take the specific case.

17

had been married.

18

guess, or 1750, or 1400, or whenever, her testimony

19

would not have come in regardless.

20

that.

Suppose they

If they had been married in 1789, I

21

MS. BURKHARDT:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think I'm right on

Yes, as a spouse.
Yes, as a spouse.

And,

23

therefore, whether he procured her absence or not is

beside the point.

Now, do we follow that rule under the

spouse; wasn't it?

4

MS. BURKHARDT:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

MS. BURKHARDT:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think your answer was

I'm sorry?
In Crawford.

In Crawford it was a spouse.
And it was the defendant

8

who said he didn't want her to testify.

9

MS. BURKHARDT:

10

It was a

That's right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under the -- the

11

testimony of someone who heard her say something, was

12

that admissible?

13

MS. BURKHARDT:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Under -- under Crawford?
No.

No.

Under the

case they set forth rules.

25

Like in the case of

an unavailable witness?

22

24

And there were

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
that are not just testimonial.

Especially in

In Lord Morley's

There are some things
For example, suppose she

14
Alderson Reporting Company

left a sealed letter.

2

letter is to be opened only upon her death, and the

3

letter says:

4

5

She has been murdered, and the

If I was done in, go after him.

MS. BURKHARDT:

Could

Well, Justice Ginsburg, it

6

depends on whether it was deemed to be testimonial or

7

not.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, is it?

I'm just

giving you --

10

MS. BURKHARDT:
I mean perhaps.

It's not an issue in our

11

case.

I mean obviously, as you point

12

out, if she had made a statement to a -- not a police

13

officer -- to a friend, family member, or whatever, a

14

nontestimonial statement, then that probably could come

15

in.

But what is at issue here --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what's the line

17

between what -- I understand that she is accusing him to

18

a police officer.

19

MS. BURKHARDT:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

Yes.
So you say that's

testimonial.

22

MS. BURKHARDT:

The courts --

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If she is talking to a

24

friend and saying that she is scared to death of this

25

man -15
Alderson Reporting Company

MS. BURKHARDT:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MS. BURKHARDT:

That's perhaps

nontestimonial.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MS. BURKHARDT:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

-- the friend could

testify?

4
5

That is --

Why?

Well -What's the difference?

If this rule is going to separate the testimonial from

10

the nontestimonial, you have to be able to tell when

11

it's one and when it's the other.

12

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, the Court hasn't fully

13

described all of the parameters of "testimonial."

14

our case does not involve that issue, because this

15

statement is clearly testimonial.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

Could I ask you whether

17

there is really anything involved in this case?

18

the California Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals

19

said it is inconceivable that any rational trier of fact

20

would have concluded that the shooting was excusable or

21

justifiable.

22
23
24
25

Both

Doesn't that virtually guarantee that if
there was an error here, it was harmless error?
MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, no, not necessarily.

I think it's very significant that the court of
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appeals -- neither the California Supreme Court nor the

2

Court of Appeals engaged in a harmless-error analysis.

3

And that statement that you quote presupposed that the

4

testimonial hearsay statement at issue was a large

5

factor in coming to that conclusion.

6

I don't think it's necessary.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, you know, no,

No.

That really went -No.

Is that correct?

8

Weren't they concluding that, based on the independent

9

evidence, it was virtually inconceivable --

10

MS. BURKHARDT:

No.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

No?

12

MS. BURKHARDT:

No.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How do we know in

14

this case that part of his intent was not to prevent her

15

from testifying at trial?

16

was upset about something else, but maybe in his mind he

17

is saying, oh, boy, if she has talked to people about

18

how I'm going to kill her, I'd better do it so that she

19

can't testify.

20

MS. BURKHARDT:

I mean, it's obvious that he

There was a specific finding

21

of fact by the court of appeals that he did not intend

22

to kill her -- he did not kill her to prevent testimony.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How are we ever

going to know that in a typical case?
MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, by, you know,
17

analyzing the evidence.

2

many ways, and perhaps he made a statement.

3

I mean, obviously, there are

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, take a case

4

like this, I don't understand how that finding could

5

have been made.

6

she had said to her friends he is going to kill me; he

7

is going to kill me.

8

it or it's going to -- his self-defense claim is going

9

to look a lot weaker.

10

He knew that she had reported -- that

And then he figures he'd better do

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, that -- I think, Mr.

11

Chief Justice, that doesn't make an awful lot of sense

12

because that indicates that he killed her in order to

13

prevent her from --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, I'm sorry it

15

doesn't.

Well, first of all, the

her to prevent testimony.

challenged it.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

7

don't understand under the legal standard we might

MS. BURKHARDT:

Correct.

No.

That is the common law.

Let's -- let's assume that

the only case on the books pre-1789 was Morley, in which

20

the defendant did specifically intend to keep the

21

witness away from the trial.

22

to fact, that the Morley case gave a -- a very sweeping,

23

expansive definition of the equitable forfeiture rule

24

and said the defendant cannot profit by his own wrong.

25

But let's assume, contrary

Could we take that general language pre-1789

and say that it supports the rule today, assuming we

could find that in the Morley case or other aspects of

the common law?

4

understand Crawford, to the specific holding of Morton

5

that there has to be a specific intent?

6

MS. BURKHARDT:

Or would we be just confined, as you

Well, the hypothetical

assumes something which is -- which Your Honor admits is

8

-- is simply not the case.

9

assuming --

10
11

I'm going to suppose

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Please -- please make the

supposition.

12

MS. BURKHARDT:

-- that it was there, I

13

suppose the Court could -- could rule on the basis of

14

that, but that it's definitely not the case and has

15

never been the case.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

Well, suppose

17

we read the English authorities that it does not

18

foreclose the expansion of the equitable forfeiture

19

rule.

20

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, I -- I think the

21

English authorities do foreclose it, because the dying

22

declaration cases, and there are dozens of them, would

23

not have come out as they did if this expansive

24

forfeiture rule had existed.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would make no sense.
I -- I find that difficult

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to understand because the dying declaration rule came up

2

in many instances when the confrontation rule was not

3

involved at all.

4

MS. BURKHARDT:

That's right.

But with

5

this -- but the point I'm making is this:

that under

6

California's theory, if the defendant is -- causes the

7

absence of the witness, and all you need to show is

8

causation, then the witness's testimonial statement will

9

come in; but under the dying declaration rule mere

10

causation is not sufficient.

11

other factors in very -- particularly that the -- that

12

the witness was aware of impending death.

13

You have to also show

That requirement is totally superfluous

14

under the California theory; and yet it -- the fact that

15

no lawyer or no judge for hundreds of years ever

16

suggested that in those cases --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but I -- I agree --

I'll check the, -- check --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the rationale for the

5

dying declaration rule has nothing to do with who caused

6

the death.

7

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, you know, it

8

specifically goes to -- the element of the dying

9

declaration is that the statement has to relate to the

10

specific cause of the death.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

So it really does.
But it has to be imminent,

too.

13

MS. BURKHARDT:

Well, the death doesn't have

14

to be imminent specifically.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He has to think it's

MS. BURKHARDT:

different rationale from the issue we have here, because

it applies across the board to civil cases and all sorts

MS. BURKHARDT:

It applies powerfully in

many, many instances to criminal cases; and that fact --

and that has existed for -- for centuries -- shows that

Alderson Reporting Company

there was no general rule that all, you know, needed to

2

do was to be accused of murdering the victim; because

3

otherwise if California rule had existed, there would be

4

no need to make this other showing in the dying

And in many cases, as we have cited in our

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. DE NICOLA

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17

MR. De NICOLA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

18

I think I want to start off by correcting, I

19

think, the impression that the common law ever stated a

20

rule that intent to tamper was a prerequisite for

21

keeping out the evidence of a -- of a victim of a

22

murderer.

23

case, has ever -- or in the subsequent cases, has ever

24

stated such a rule.

25

And I don't think this Court, in the Reynolds

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it didn't put it in

25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

those very words, but I think a lot of -- of the

2

quotations from opinions cited by your friend seemed to

3

me to say that.

4

But why don't you start off by telling -- by

5

explaining to us why these many cases excluded the dying

6

declaration of the murdered person when -- if it could

7

not be shown that the murdered person knew when the

8

declaration was made that he or she was dying?

9

rule that you're announcing was the rule at common law,

10

all of those would have come in because that declaration

11

said this Defendant killed me.

12

have been true in all of those cases that this defendant

13

procured the absence of the witness from the trial.

14

do you explain that.

15

If the

And, therefore, it would

How

It's not just a

16

few.

17

that the -- that the declarant be aware of impending

18

death is uniform.

19

if it could all come in under -- under this procurement

20

of the absence-of-the-witness rule?

21

The requirement in the dying declaration cases

Why even bother with that requirement

MR. De NICOLA:

Well, I think, as Justice

22

Kennedy's question suggested, that there are different

23

elements to -- that need to be surpassed before the

24

dying declaration would come in.

25

What happens in the dying declaration
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

situation, Your Honor, is that there is no validation or

2

vindication of the defendant's cross-examination rights;

3

and that's what we are interested in here today:

4

the common law would have treated the cross-examination

5

right of a defendant who killed a witness.

6

declaration rule certainly cabins the admissibility of

7

dying declarations for reliability reasons, but it did

8

not detract from the fact that the evidence of the dying

9

declaration came in peculiarly when the defendant killed

10

the victim of the crime, the witness whose testimony was

11

coming in.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How

The dying

I'm not sure you've

13

answered my question.

Why wasn't it enough for the

14

prosecution to say:

15

defendant killed her; therefore, this declaration can

16

come in because this defendant procured the absence of

17

this declarant by killing her?

This dying person said that this

18

MR. De NICOLA:

It wouldn't --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Nobody even ever makes

20

those arguments.

21

declarant was aware of impending death or not, but that

22

would have been totally irrelevant if it all comes in

23

under -- under the rule that you're arguing for here.

24
25

They fight it out on whether the

MR. De NICOLA:

No, because under the rule

I'm arguing for, and why the prosecutor wouldn't have
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

succeeded in making that argument, the rule I'm arguing

2

for is simply that in the situation where the defendant

3

kills the witness the common law did not recognize, or

4

there is no strong case authority that would indicate

5

that the common law would recognize, a confrontation

6

right with respect to that defendant against his

7

witness's statement.

8
9

Nevertheless, the common law puts some other
nonconfrontation restrictions on the admissibility of

10

the dying declaration.

11

restrictions.

12

determine the scope of the confrontation right.

13

Those were reliability-based

Reliability-based restrictions can't

Under Crawford, the confrontation right is a

14

separate process that has to be adhered to and can't be

unless there is a rule that would have let that

statement in that doesn't depend on a reliability

assessment.

regimes.

We have two

We have the constitutional condition and we

MR. De NICOLA:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But with respect to the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

common law as it stood at the time that the Bill of

2

Rights was adopted, there wasn't such a distinction; was

3

there?

4

confrontation right is informed by the common- law

antecedent, the common-law antecedents were not drawing

6

the line that you are drawing; were they?

In other words, to the extent that the

8

MR. De NICOLA:

I think that's right, Your

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if that is the case,

Honor.

9
10

then it seems to me you haven't answered Justice

11

Scalia's question.

12

says:

13

a moment; and, given common-law antecedents, why were

14

people worried about the consciousness of death under

15

the dying declaration rule if there was this broader

16

rule which is supposed to inform our understanding of

17

the confrontation right, which would have let it in

18

simply because the crime had forfeited the right to

19

object.

20

answered his question.

21

Because Justice Scalia's question

Let's just talk about common-law antecedents for

And it seems to me that you still have not

MR. De NICOLA:

Well, let me -- let me take

22

a different tack.

Under the common-law rule, if the

23

defendant killed the witness and the witness's statement

24

met the dying declaration criteria, that statement would

25

come in against the defendant.

But if the defendant

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

killed the same victim and you had another witness who

2

witnessed the crime and made a dying declaration that

3

qualified under the rule, that dying declaration

4

describing the defendant's infliction of the mortal

5

blow, that dying declaration would not have come in.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If it was -- if it was

7

testimony.

8

testimonial, and the rule is very important for those.

9
10

There are a lot of declarations that are not

MR. De NICOLA:

Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There are also

11

declarations that are testimonial, in which case we look

12

to the confrontation concept.

13

MR. De NICOLA:

Yes, but I think -- but I

14

think, with respect to testimonial statements, it -- I

15

think it gives you an insight into what the common law

16

would have done with respect to the alleged

17

confrontation rights of the murderer against the victim

18

to know that when the defendant murdered the victim, the

19

victim's dying declaration came in without regard to

20

confrontation.

21

It might not have been excluded because it

22

might not have met other criteria, but it would have

23

come in without confrontation.

24

in without confrontation in a way that the -- the mere

25

witness who makes a dying declaration and witnesses the

And it would have come

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

same crime would not have come in.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would suppose that

3

there are a lot, a lot of situations in which a dead

4

victim has made statements pertinent to the murder.

5

wouldn't your rule drive a pretty big hole through

6

Crawford?

7

This is not an isolated instance where the

8

victim said something about the murderer.

9

seem to be a fairly common situation, because most

10

So

That would

murders involve people who know each other.

11

MR. De NICOLA:

Well, I think it would -- it

12

-- I think it would, it would apply in murder cases with

13

respect to the statements of the victim.

14

-- I think the application of the forfeiture rule on a

15

murder basis as we are suggesting here, yes, I think it

16

would --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So I think the

But to the extent that

18

Crawford is confined simply to testimonial statements,

19

any number of statements --

20

MR. De NICOLA:

Right.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- that will come in under

by the Confrontation Clause anyway.

24

standard hearsay problem.

25

MR. De NICOLA:

Yes.

It's just -- it's a

Like the California

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Supreme Court recognized, and it was buttressed, I

2

think, by this Court's decision in Davis, simply because

3

the defendant might forfeit his confrontation rights

4

because he murders the victim, that doesn't necessarily

5

mean that he forfeits his other hearsay- rule

6

protections or his other constitutional-reliability

7

protections or his right to impeach the hearsay

8

declarations of the unavailable witness or his right to

9

contradict them or his right --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that mean, what you

11

just said, that this is not a problem in States that

12

have adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence?

13

I understand it, there is an exception, the standard

14

exception, for when the defendant procures the witness's

15

absence for the very purpose of preventing the witness

16

from testifying at a particular trial.

17

exception that's in the Federal Rules of Evidence.

18

don't have an exception, a hearsay exception, for just

19

being responsible for the witness's unavailability.

20

Because, as

That's the

So practically, this couldn't come in under

21

a hearsay objection in places that have the Federal

22

Rules of Evidence; is that right?

23

You

MR. De NICOLA:

Yes.

If the Federal rule

24

were interpreted to require the intent to tamper, in any

25

jurisdiction that decided as a matter of their own
32
Alderson Reporting Company

hearsay policy that they wanted to govern the

2

admissibility of evidence along those lines, then, yes.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

interpreted that way?

5

interpreted differently?

6

Doesn't it have to be

You don't contend it could be

MR. De NICOLA:

Well, I don't know exactly

7

whether the Federal rule has uniformly been -- been

8

interpreted to require a specific intent.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Just because it says so, I

mean.

11

MR. De NICOLA:

Well, there is -- I don't

think -- for example, I don't think there is a Federal

13

case that's been cited where the forfeiture has been

14

denied in a situation where the defendant murdered the

15

witness.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you give us one case

17

from the common law, just one, in which the procurement

18

of a witness's absence exception to the Confrontation

19

Clause was applied where there was no intent to prevent

20

the witness from testifying?

21
22

MR. De NICOLA:
have the case --

23
24
25

I don't -- I don't think I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think you do

either.
MR. De NICOLA:

-- that -- that applied the
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

rule.

But I don't think there is a case that

2

articulated the rule in a way that would have limited

3

its application.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

The reason, I think, is --

5

I think, if I understand Justice Scalia's question, take

6

ordinary hearsay?

7

MR. De NICOLA:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Yes.
Okay.

There's a reason for

keeping it out, though there are many exceptions.

Now

10

take that subset of ordinary hearsay where it was a

11

statement made purposefully to go to trial.

12

is especially good reason for keeping it out, so like a

13

double reason.

14

under the common law, putting us back then, would say

15

there's an exception where there's especially good

16

reason for keeping it out, see, in the testimonial case,

17

an exception where you go get the person murdered, but

18

you didn't do it purposefully.

19

exception in just where there's only the ordinary reason

20

for keeping it out.

21

way around.

22

Now there

And I think he finds it odd that we,

It should seem to work the other

Now, to me that suggests that maybe we

23

shouldn't follow completely the common law as it evolved

in evidentiary principles.

25

intent to allow the contours of the Confrontation Clause

Maybe we have to assume an

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to evolve as the law of evidence itself evolves.

2

Otherwise, we get caught up in these logical

3

contradictions.

4

What do you think of that?

MR. De NICOLA:

Well, I think that -- I

5

think that we can certainly take account, for example,

6

of situations that the common law might not have faced

7

or might not have recognized as representing a problem

8

of relevant evidence to a crime.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You wouldn't want us to get

10

caught up in the limitations of the Confrontation

11

Clause?

12

MR. De NICOLA:

No, I'm not saying that,

13

Your Honor.

14

although the Confrontation Clause under Crawford would

15

be accepted under the governing common-law rule at the

16

time, the governing common-law rule at the time included

17

this forfeiture doctrine, and the forfeiture doctrine I

18

think has been recognized -- has been based on the maxim

19

and the principle that no one may profit from

20

wrongdoing.

21

What I'm saying is that I think that,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you see what my question

22

was?

My question is the same question I asked your

23

fellow counsel.

24

point where you were willing to say maybe there is some

25

flexibility here, what?

My question is, since I led you to the

35

trouble.

What precisely are the principles I should

2

follow to prevent my going back to look at they dunked

3

witches, but allowing the heart of Crawford to be

4

maintained.

5
6

How do I do it?
I don't know if you can answer that

question, but that's the problem that I'm having.

7

MR. De NICOLA:

Well, again, I think -- I

8

think the resort to the -- to the maxim and the

9

equitable principles that we know that common law

10

subscribed to and that common law subscribed to those

11

principles in this precise -- as a rule to decide how to

12

resolve this particular kind of issue where the

13

defendant's wrongdoing makes the witness unavailable,

14

that the -- that because the common law accepted this

15

maxim, that we can -- we can look and apply those

16

principles to the situation even though there might not

17

have been the precise common-law case an all fours.

it?

the admissibility of the statement.

did the trial indicate anything that he told the police

on the prior occasion?

the extent that this is a case where the -- the crime

astonishingly broad exception you're asking for.

balances out.

The defendant gave notice that he

MR. De NICOLA:

Prior to trial, there was a

2

discussion about what sort of defense he was going to be

3

putting on, and he clearly indicated --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

California law requires

that?

6

MR. De NICOLA:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. De NICOLA:

9

No.

No.

It just --

Or it does not require it?
It doesn't require that.

It

just -- it happened that, in discussing the

10

admissibility of all this other evidence he wanted to

11

bring in to put words in the mouth of the victim, the

12

court inquired about how that would be linked up to the

13

defense of self-defense.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. De NICOLA:

All right.
And that's why the

16

defendant's lawyer indicated that the client would be

17

testifying and putting on -- putting on a defense of

18

self-defense.

19

Now, I think if you look at the -- if you

20

look at the maxim, the logic or the rational of the

21

forfeiture rule, it doesn't admit of any exception for

22

motive to tamper.

opponent is proffering here I think is alien to the

24

rationale of the maxim.

The maxim is that no one shall

25

profit from wrongdoing.

The superimposition of an

The motive-to-tamper rule that my

intent requirement or a motive requirement wouldn't

2

change the fact that, with that intent or without the

3

intent, there would be the same profit from the

4

wrongdoing.

5

integrity of the criminal trial because the

6

truth-finding function of the criminal trial would be

7

damaged by allowing the wrongdoing to be used as the

8

basis for keeping out the statement of the -- of the

9

witness, of the victim of the crime, and allowing the

10

defendant to substitute in its stead his own one-sided

11

or half-true version of the --

There would be the same damage to the

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

MR. De NICOLA:

Suppose it's negligence.
If it's mere negligence?

If

21

it's mere negligence, certainly that's a -- that's a

22

tougher call, and it might be that in a situation of

23

noncriminal conduct the intent to tamper conceivably

24

could play a role in elevating that conduct to the kind

25

of wrongdoing that would trigger the rule.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

But I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

as long as you have criminal conduct and certainly where

2

you have a murder, the rule would be triggered and the

3

-- the inquiry would then be whether or not there was

4

causation and whether or not there would be this profit.

5

And the intent to tamper doesn't really relate to the

6

purpose of the rule to prevent the profiting.

7

So you have the same profit, the same damage

8

to the criminal justice system, and the same prejudice

9

to the State, which is denied the live testimony of the

10
11

victim.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't there a problem

12

that was brought out in the briefs with -- this man is

13

standing trial before a jury that's going to determine

14

guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but if this testimony

15

is going to come in, the judge has to make some kind of

16

a preliminary finding that he killed her in advance of

17

the jury making that determination.

18

MR. De NICOLA:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that

19

happened -- that didn't happen in this case, so that

20

would be, I think, the template for what would happen in

21

future cases.

22

the California Supreme Court, Giles essentially conceded

23

that the forfeiture rule, when it was otherwise

24

applicable, does apply in the case where you have the

25

wrongdoing being the same crime that's charged.

One I think preliminary point is that in

And it's also -- it's not -- it's not unlike the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe I have to take that

back.

that someone would kill a victim in order to prevent her

to find the defendant guilty of the very crime for which

he's being prosecuted in order to apply the -- the

exception to the Confrontation Clause.

MR. De NICOLA:

Maybe it -- it's very -- it would be very unusual

So these

would be rare.

MR. De NICOLA:

It happens all

But nevertheless I think the

-- the idea that you could have the hearing even though

6

it's the same issue that goes before the jury, I think

7

is not an obstacle to applying the rule in this case.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would think these cases

9

come in -- this problem comes in with spousal abuse.

10

Now, I don't know what the numbers are, but I bet you

11

could find numbers.

12

in many cases where there's a death in that kind of

13

situation, maybe it is accidental.

14

the man who is beating up his wife didn't really want

her to die.

So that to me,

think.

Isn't it?
MR. De NICOLA:

Yes, I think it -- I think,

again, regardless of what defendant's intent is, the

rule and the logic of the rule applies.

MR. De NICOLA:

5

know, as was said before, the argument that what came

in, in this case, was this damaging evidence that --

7

that undermined the defendant's self-defense claim.

8

Well, that evidence would come in even under the theory

that intent to tamper were required for -- for the

it's certainly true that this issue would come up in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. De NICOLA:

Yes.

come up in cases of -- of abuse of children, as another

example.

18

So I think because there's no equitable

19

argument on the part of the defendant about why this

20

rule, this no-profit rule, would depend on an intent to

21

tamper, I think if you transport that back into the

22

common law, the same rule and the same principles of

applying, and you would -- you would have I think the

Alderson Reporting Company

want to repeat myself, but I guess I just want to again

2

emphasize that the -- that the logic of the rule really

3

doesn't admit of an intent requirement.

4

Court's cases has ever dictated an intent requirement.

5

Nothing in the common-law cases has ever articulated an

6

intent requirement, and in the common-law cases the rule

7

that we are advancing is justified by the maxim that

8

applied at the common law, and it was also justified --

13

ultimately have proved inadmissible on another ground,

where the special criteria for the dying declaration

instances where the evidence comes in against the

defendant where he kills the victim.

Because even though they might

under this maxim.

statement; under Crawford, it clearly must be excluded;

5

and for the reason that it is -- you know, he has been

6

deprived of his right to test the accuracy of that

7

statement and to expose its falsity.

8
9

The statement is a testimony

He claims the statement isn't true; and
under Crawford, the -- the Framers have prescribed a

10

categorical procedural rule for testing whether a

11

statement is reliable, and that's the right to

12

confrontation; and he was deprived of that right and

13

this in turn derived him of fair -- of a fair trial.

14

Now, the Framers in adopting the

15

Confrontation Clause understood its parameters to

16

include certain narrow exceptions.

17

one of the exceptions was a witness tampering exception;

18

and that had a very rational basis, because what it

19

meant, in essence, is if the defendant is going to act

20

against the criminal trial system from which he demands

21

and requires justice, he cannot at the same time

22

intentionally, deliberately manipulate and thwart the

23

criminal justice system by preventing the appearance of

So in that case, when he

3

And that maxim that a person cannot profit

4

from his own wrong was meant to apply to that situation.

5

It wasn't meant to apply in the broad, generalized,

6

amorphous sense that the State suggests, because that

7

would effectively substitute in some sort of amorphous

8

notions for reliability of -- I'm sorry, fairness -- for
