Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In 1995 Congress acted decisively to curb

12

abusive private securities litigation.

13

extraordinary step of rejecting categorically the

14

traditional rule of notice pleading in complaints that

15

are filed under the securities laws.

16

declared that, and this is at page 2 of our petition,

17

"The complaint shall state with particularity facts

18

giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant

19

acted with the required state of mind."

20

It took the

Instead it

The fundamental error in the court of

21

appeals analysis in this case was in writing out of the

22

statute the strong inference language that Congress

23

clearly intended to be not only in those statutes, but

24

obviously applied rigorously.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At some point during your

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument -- and I know you only have 20 minutes -- will

2

you tell me whether or not in your view the pleading

3

standard that the judge must follow is equivalent, is

4

the same as the instruction that's given to the jury?

5

Because if it isn't, then the Seventh Amendment argument

6

may have some more force.

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the answer to the

8

question is that it does not have to be the same.

I

9

think Congress actually has greater authority in dealing

10

with pleadings that is distinct from the Seventh

11

Amendment right, but the Court doesn't need to go that

12

far in this particular case because I think the

13

inferences that we are asking the Court to draw from the

14

record in this case would avoid any -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, in writing -- I take

16

it, so far as the jury, it's just whether it's more

17

likely than not, preponderance of the evidence.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

held in Huddleston, yes, Your Honor.

20

That's what the Court held -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So your submission is,

21

maybe not in this case, but insofar as your theory of

22

the case, that the trial judge can, and in fact must

23

basically apply a standard of fact -- standard of proof

24

that's higher than that what the jury would.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it's important as a
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

standard of allegation, because what we're talking about

2

here is an analysis of the allegations of the lawyers,

3

and not any kind of an evidentiary showing by any of the

4

plaintiffs.

5

Court has really never addressed the issue of the extent

6

to which the Seventh Amendment extends to pleadings.

7

And I don't think this is the case in which to take up

8

that issue because I think it is quite clear that what

9

at least we're asking for as the appropriate

So I do think it's removed.

I mean, this

10

interpretation of the Reform Act is that you need to

11

apply -- that you simply follow Matushita and Monsanto,

12

and that is to force the plaintiffs to demonstrate that

13

innocent explanations can be set aside.

14

that particular approach, which clearly is consistent

15

with the Seventh Amendment, then it seems to me you -

16

the Seventh that you followed under the Constitution, is

17

eliminated.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if you take

Mr. Phillips, the Seventh

19

Amendment or not, the question in 12(b)(6) is has the

20

plaintiff stated a claim, and at the end of the line

21

it's has the plaintiff proved a claim.

22

stating two different claims.

23

stated is a stronger claim than the claim that must be

24

proved, and I don't know of any other instance where

25

that is so.

But you're

The claim that must be

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know that there are

2

any other instances in which that's true,

3

Justice Ginsburg, but I don't think it's a

4

constitutional problem.

5

the question is, does Congress have the power to enforce

6

its view of the appropriate way to proceed as a matter

7

of policy at the pleadings stage, and I think the answer

8

to that question is yes.

9

--

10

I think at the end of the day

But again, you don't have to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I wasn't asking it as a

11

matter of constitutional law but I'm thinking, how do

12

you construe these words, what is it, "strong

13

inference?"

14

it, a Second Circuit decision.

15

most logical thing is that you'd look at the Second

16

Circuit decision and say ah, Congress picked up those

17

words from the Second Circuit decision, then we should

18

pick up the standards that the Second Circuit applied.

19

But your definition of strong inference is

20
21

And the words come out of, as I understand
So I would think the

quite different from what the Second Circuit's was.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'm not sure that's 100

22

percent true.

I think the real problem with the Second

23

Circuit is there's no monolithic Second Circuit rule

24

that's out there.

25

of cases under its particularity standards under 9(b)

The Second Circuit applied a number

prior to the time Congress adopted the strong inference

standard.

comfortable with the analysis in Shields versus

analyzed the complaint in that case is precisely the way

6

we're trying to analyze the complaint in this case.

if you -

Some of them -- I think we would be very

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The way Judge Jacobs

So

Mr. Phillips, can I ask

this question?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

One of the amicus briefs

12

talks in terms of the percentages, how likely the

13

inference, the word strong inference means 50 percent,

14

30 percent, 60 percent.

15

to be stronger or less strong than the inference of

16

probable cause in an affidavit for a search warrant to

17

get access to the privacy of a home and so forth?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Do you think the inference has

I think it would have to be

19

stronger than that, although I don't know how to

20

translate that into percentages, Justice Stevens.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

A civil case would impose

22

a higher standard for getting discovery in a civil case

23

than they would for getting access to a citizen's

24

private papers and the like?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think the use of the
7


Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

language "strong inference" carries with it a very

2

significant burden that has to be demonstrated by the

3

buyer.

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

A burden of over 50

percent?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, to be sure.
In a criminal case, the

8

person seeking that action is a government officer who

9

presumptively is not acting out of selfish motives,

10

whereas we're talking about private suits and some

11

private litigants are selfish.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Absolutely, Justice Scalia.

13

And if you read the Securities Industries amicus brief,

14

it ticks off all of the instances of harm that are

15

caused by allowing -- too much of the private litigation

16

is precisely that, which Congress was responding to.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I just have to make it

18

clear.

19

greater than more likely than not?

20
21
22

Is the high likelihood, or strong inference, is

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

I believe Congress

would have intended it to be more JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't the -- doesn't the

23

standard at the pleading stage have to be the same as

24

the standard at the summary judgment stage?

25

suppose that a certain set of facts is sufficient to
8

Alderson Reporting Company

If -

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defeat summary judgment.

2

of those facts in the complaint, are you saying that

3

that complaint could be dismissed even though supporting

4

those facts at the summary judgment stage would be

5

enough to defeat a summary judgment motion?

6

If the plaintiff alleges all

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think at the end of the day

7

I would make that argument.

8

argument here because it's clear to me that the same

9

standards of Matushita and Monsanto that say you have to

10

exclude innocent explanations would apply at the summary

11

judgment stage as we're trying to apply at the pleading

12

stage, so there is no disconnect.

13

I don't have to make that

But if I were actually forced into that

14

position, I think I would take that view, although I

15

probably would argue first that the standard of

16

Huddleston ought to be reconsidered, rather than

17

rejecting clearly what Congress had in mind in 1995 when

18

it acted to curb the abuses of private securities

19

litigation.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't the difference

21

between Matsushita and this particular case at least as

22

you are presenting this case, the -- the -- focused on

23

the strength of this exclusion of innocent conduct?

24

As, as I recall Matsushita, there -- there

25

had to be at that stage, there had to be evidence from
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which one could infer that the -- that the conduct was

2

not innocent; but you're arguing for something stronger

3

than that.

4

ultimate conclusion that excludes innocent conduct.

5

aren't you asking for more than just what Matsushita did

6

at -- at that later stage?

7

You're arguing for, in effect, an -- an

MR. PHILLIPS:

And

I think there may be a slight

8

semantic difference there, but the truth is at end of

9

the day all we're asking for the Court to do is to

10

evaluate the complaint, taking both the positive and the

11

negative inferences from it, excluding ambiguities,

12

interpreting them not in favor of the plaintiff, as you

13

traditionally do, take into account whether there is an

14

allegation of motive, and say at the end of the day

15

whether or not that reaches a -- rises to the level of a

16

strong inference.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but Matsushita as I

18

recall did not require it to rise beyond the level of a

19

plausible inference.

20

something stronger than that.

21

of Congress forces you to do it but I -- I'm just

22

finding it difficult to conclude -- to equate the

23

plausibility standard in, in Matsushita with the strong

24

inference standard here.

25

And I think you're arguing for

MR. PHILLIPS:

And I think the language

If you Well, if I'm going to err on
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

either side, I obviously prefer that the Court carries

2

out Congress's intent.

3

further than Matsushita did in order to reverse the

4

court of appeals in this particular case.

5

We thing you needn't go any

Obviously there is probably some potential

6

distance between the two, where you could certainly

7

interpret the strong inference standard more in the line

8

the way the United States interprets it, as creating a

9

high likelihood of scienter.

And we don't -- we're

10

certainly not objecting to that.

11

the Court that you needn't go that far in order to

12

decide this case, although obviously we would welcome a

13

ruling along those lines if the Court's inclined to go

14

that far.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We're just saying to

Is it fair to say at the

16

pleading stage it's the equivalent of a clear and

17

convincing standard, whereas at the end of the road it

18

would only be more probable than not?

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, again, I think it -- I

20

think it puts an issue -- and we raised this in our

21

reply brief, whether or not Huddleston should be

22

reconsidered in light of this sort of basic change in

23

the way Congress is approaching private securities

24

litigation.

25

But, so my JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you do -

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

There are a number of ways to

2

go at it.

3

would not offend at least my sense of what Congress was

4

trying to achieve here.

5

But if it turned out to be a disconnect, that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah.

Well, I don't think

6

Congress was trying to achieve an alteration in the

7

ultimate standard, either, in the jury standard.

8

it was concerned with is the enormous expense of -- of

9

discovery.

What

And, and tried to set a high wall to get to

10

the discovery stage.

11

to affect or should logically affect the standard that

12

the jury is told to use.

13

I don't know why that should have

MR. PHILLIPS:

All I'm suggesting is that if

14

the Court were concerned that somehow there is a

15

disconnect between the pleading standard and the

16

ultimate standard of proof, the way to resolve that

17

incongruity -- if it is one -- would to be reconsider

18

the ultimate standard of proof, not to throw out the

19

clearly congressionally approved baby as part of that

20

bath water.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you tell me a little

22

bit of how -- how this should work in your view?

23

the CEO makes misstatements as to the earnings report

24

and the acceptance of one of its new products.

25

assume that.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Assume

Just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can we make a strong

3

inference that a CEO knows what his own earnings reports

4

are?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

You mean with a specific

6

earnings report rather than just simply sort of sales

7

projections and demand?

8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

inference that a CEO knows the status of current
earnings -

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

Can we make a strong

Well, my guess is they -- when he makes, when he

makes a statement.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think they would have

15

to make an allegation that the -- that the CEO routinely

16

is provided with that information rather than simply

17

assume it.

18

their -- with their allegation that it's common sense

19

that CEOs will act to protect their own personal self

20

interest and the overall welfare of the company by

21

misrepresenting the status of events.

22
23

I think it's the same problem you have with

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How about just saying that

he knew it?

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm not -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Just saying that he knew

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it.

2

You're saying they have to give a reason why they knew

3

that he knew it, namely he routinely read these reports?

4

Suppose they didn't say that.

5

that the -- that the figures were otherwise, he -- he

6

set them forth.

7

Without saying why they knew that he knew it?

MR. PHILLIPS:

They just said knowing

I don't think that's

8

sufficient, because it requires for the facts that

9

particularly show -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

But suppose it says, which

11

I think it did say, that Mr. Notebaert typically stayed

12

on top of the company's financial health by having

13

weekly conversations with other executives.

14

hands on the pulse of the company.

15

reports and product -- projection -- production

16

projections.

17

very specific.

18

He had his

He saw weekly sales

Now it seems like an allegation that's

MR. PHILLIPS:

But the -- but the problem

19

with that allegation, and we're talking about the 6500,

20

the Titan 6500 product specifically, in that context,

21

the report is, there's nothing in there that says what

22

those reports say about the 6500.

23

a case where the plaintiffs have 27 whistleblowers

24

inside the company who could provide you with all of the

25

detail in the world; and yet when it comes time to tell

And remember, this is

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you what was in the 6500 report that would -- that would

2

suggest that it's not available, there's not word one in

3

the allegation.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I thought they

5

alleged at least that for about a year previously in

6

respect to the 506500 that it was wrong known throughout

7

the company that the 6500 had been delayed.

8

make an allegation like that?

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Don't they

Right but that's -- that

10

being delayed for a year is not the basis for the claim.

11

The question was is the, is the 6500 being sold; and

12

that was the allegation.

13

-- I -- he had every reason to believe that, based on

14

what they've claimed because they've not produced a

15

report or said that there's anything inside the report

16

that says to the contrary about that.

And the answer to that is he

17

Again, it seems to me -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

The 6500 has long been

19

delayed.

Everyone knows that in the company.

20

knows it's long been delayed.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

I think Then what he says is it is

being shipped and delivered.
MR. PHILLIPS:

So he

Something like that.

But Justice Breyer, that -

that long been delayed period runs all the way back to
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

1998.

And we're talking about events in 2000 and 2001.

2

So the notion that it's been long delayed says nothing

3

about what Mr. Notebaert was -- was revealing in March

4

and April and June of 2001.

5

It, it could potentially, but it equally, it

6

couldn't.

It's the same problem you get with the 5500,

7

where the court of appeals specifically said it is quite

8

plausible that Mr. Notebaert never saw those reports.

9

Now how you can make that concession and

10

nevertheless say there is a strong inference that he

11

acted to deceive, strikes me as absolutely implausible.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

April '01, he says

13

everything we can build we are building, and shipping.

14

The demand is very strong.

15

course nobody wanted any of it, it was long delayed, and

16

they've known that since 1998 and he has his finger on

17

the pulse of the company.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

And then what they say is of

But you -- you -

19

Justice Breyer, you make a leap there.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh.

Yeah.

Is that they all knew that.

22

The point is they knew that it was delayed back in 1999.

23

What they don't do is tie that in to what he knew in

24

2001; and that, to me, that's the central point in this

25

case, is do you require that kind of specificity?

position on Justice Alito's earlier question about

whether the standard at the summary judgment stage is

the same as the standard at the pleading stage?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

First of all to be clear,

5

Mr. Chief Justice, we don't believe that the Court needs

to address that question in this case, because we don't

7

believe that that sort of disparity would present any

8

Seventh Amendment concerns.

9

believe that any disparity in the degree of probability

However, if the Court does

required does present Seventh Amendment concerns, we

11

believe that it is more consistent with Congress's

intent to apply the strong inference requirement at the

13

proof stage as well as the pleading stage rather than to

14

water down the strong inference requirement that

15

Congress adopted at the pleading stage.

impose a very high burden.

In our view, it requires a

mean both summary judgment and submission to jury?
MR. SHANMUGAM:
Justice Kennedy.

I think that that is right,

I suppose that if the perceived
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

constitutional concern is solely regarding the degree of

2

likelihood that is required, it could be applied simply

3

at the summary judgment stage; but to the extent that

4

the Court believes that it is a matter for the jury to

5

determine whether a given set of facts gives rise to an

6

inference of the requisite strength then yes, the jury

would need to be instructed in a manner consistent with

question.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

answer is yes if the Court feels it needs to address
19

that question.

standard that Congress adopted was framed only in terms

of the pleading stage.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- there was a pleading

is a 12(b)(6) motion, you look only to the face of the

It has been the understanding that when there

ordinary civil case, the case is governed of course by

20

facts in order to survive a motion to dismiss.

21

In an

And in some sense the rule that the allegations

What Congress did in the Reform Act was to

22

require first of all some degree of particularity in

allegation; but Congress went further than that; and to

24

the extent that Congress spoke in terms of the

inferences that can be drawn from those allegations, we
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

do believe that Congress abrogated the background rule

2

that the allegations must be read in the light most

3

favorable to the plaintiff, or as some courts have put

4

it, that all reasonable inferences that can be drawn

5

from the complaint should be drawn in the plaintiff's

6

favor.

7

That clearly is a change on the preexisting

8

law; and it is a change with regard to the law that

9

circuits were applying before the enactment of the

10

Reform Act.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why don't we simply assume

12

that the read most favorable to the plaintiff rule is

13

still in place, but that reading it most favorably to

14

the plaintiff, it must rise to the level of supporting

15

the strong inference?

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I guess, Justice Souter,

17

that I would wonder what it would mean to say that you

18

read the allegations in the light most favorable to the

19

plaintiff.

20

simply accumulate reasonable subsidiary inferences in

21

order to create the strong inference of state of mind

22

that is ultimately required, then I think I would

23

disagree that that rule remains in effect.

24

because our view is that in applying the strong

25

inference standard, a court should consider other

If what it means is that a plaintiff can

possible explanations for the defendant's conduct that

2

are not foreclosed by the allegations -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but I was using the

4

word inference to -- to refer to some reasoning process

5

based upon what is stated.

6

to the plaintiff.

Not on assumptions favorable

7

And if inference is to tie -- is, is a term

8

that is tied to what is alleged, then I don't see any -

9

any contradiction between reading those allegations most

10

favorably, but saying the statute in each statute

11

requires that the -- that the total force of the

12

inference rise to the level of strength that you speak

13

of.

14

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think our only concern,

15

Justice Souter, would be that where a plaintiff includes

16

ambiguous allegations in the complaint, a court should

17

consider the possibility that those ambiguities work to

18

the defendant's favor as well as working to the

19

plaintiff's favor.

20

this case are the allegations that concern the Titan

indicated that demand for that product was declining.

Mr. Shanmugam, could -

could I get you back to -- to your, your assertion of we

don't have to reach in this case the question of whether

5

the same standard applies at trial as, as at the

6

pleading stage?

7

It seems to me a Seventh Amendment claim has

8

been raised.

It's our usual policy to avoid unnecessary

9

constitutional adjudication.

If indeed the two

10

standards are the same, there's certainly no Seventh

11

12

decide, in resolving the Seventh Amendment claim,

whether the two standards are the same?

So why don't we have to first of all

MR. SHANMUGAM:

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, to the extent that the

3

Court views the constitutional issue in this case as

4

sufficiently substantial to trigger the canon of

5

constitutional avoidance, then we do believe that the

6

better view, the view that is more consistent with

7

Congress's intent, is that if the Court is choosing

8

between raising the standard at the pre stage and

9

watering down the standard at the pleadings stage, we

10

believe that the former is more consistent with

11

Congress's -

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Even if there is no Seventh

13

Amendment problem, what sense would it make to have a

14

regime that says plaintiff has to plead more than the

15

plaintiff has to show at summary judgment or prove at

16

trial.

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, Congress was

18

concerned, Justice Alito, with the problem of abusive

19

pleading.

20

that concern, Congress was concerned that plaintiffs

21

could readily allege fraud by hindsight, and Congress

22

may have been concerned that the plaintiff could do so

23

not only by making a conclusory allegation of state of

24

mind, but also making a slightly less conclusory

25

allegation of state of mind by alleging facts that

That much is crystal clear.

If Congress hadn't had that concern, it

courts.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

One,

Which

Justice Breyer, our primary

16

concern in this case is with the way that the Court of

17

Appeals articulated the applicable standard, which we

18

believe may have pernicious effects in future cases.

19

And so we certainly believe that it would be appropriate

20

for the Court to vacate and remand for the Court of

21

Appeals to apply the correct standard.

22

clear -

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But just to be

You said the Court of

Appeals to apply it.

Could the Court of Appeals

the same decision that it came to using a different

verbal formula.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

In our view,

decision of the Court of Appeals in this case should be

say in answer to my question, which I would like to

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think it was just that

14

point, Justice Breyer, namely, that if the Court

15

believes that it would be useful to provide guidance to

16

the lower courts by applying the standard itself in this

17

case, we do believe that the decision of the Court of

Appeals should be reversed rather than vacated.

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court?

We believe the Seventh Circuit had it right.

We believe that what the Seventh Circuit, and this is in

partial response to you, Justice Breyer, is take more or

less a holistic view of the entirety of the complaint.

The business about the 5500, the business about the 6500

there were, as one judge once referred to it, accounting

shenanigans going on, designed to shift income into the

you would have said so.

ambiguity is in a sense humorous, given the obstacles

Just think about the investigation efforts that went

into this case.

What you do, Justice Breyer, is -- and

10

I think this is what the Seventh Circuit did -- look at

everything, look at the fact that you have got

I don't understand

the Seventh Amendment argument here.

Congress can

10

surely articulate the standard that's going to be

11

applied as a matter of substantive law.

12

says, you have to prove by clear and convincing

evidence, that doesn't interfere with the Seventh

that standard.

MR. MILLER:

The entry points you referred

to, the so-called pleas in abatement, to put on my

common law hat, a jurisdiction venue, et cetera, they

9

may raise issues of fact and Congress, in control of the

Federal courts, can calibrate it any way they want.
But when you are dealing with the core

function of the jury -- and matters of abatement were

13

never considered to be core functions of the jury -- I

14

think a whole range of cases starting with Slocum versus

15

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you told

me that Congress could set a high level of burden on

18

factual issues, and that that wouldn't intrude upon the

Seventh Amendment.

22

MR. MILLER:

I'm distinguishing, Mr. Chief

Justice, between the merits and the entry point.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Congress can not set a fact burden on the merits that is

different than preponderance of the evidence.

MR. MILLER:

Markman as the core function of the jury.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I'm with you so

2

far, why would you suppose that Congress would create a

3

different standard on the motion to dismiss than they

4

meant to apply at the merits standard?

5

MR. MILLER:

I don't think Congress would.

6

I do not believe Congress ever intended -- it's not in

7

the statute, it is not in the legislative history, it is

8

not in any case, Matsushita, Monsanto are unique

9

antitrust cases, and in both cases, the Court, if you

10

read the opinions fully, protected the jury function.

11

They said there was simply nothing beyond the assertions

12

standing alone when you have competitive and

13

anticompetitive conduct to protect substantive antitrust

14

law.

15

That doesn't do it.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then what was

16

Congress trying to do when they said strong inference?

17

It seems to me that if you think the standards have to

18

be the same at pleading and at proof, and Congress says

19

strong inference at pleading, it means you have to show

20

a strong inference at proof, and that's why there's no

21

Seventh Amendment problem.

22
23

MR. MILLER:

What you have to show at proof

is preponderance.

MR. MILLER:
we think -

4
5

Our standard, as proposed, and

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You don't want to answer

6

MR. MILLER:

-- is reasonable jurors, who

7

are finders of fact, could find by a preponderance of

8

the evidence that the defendants acted with scienter.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you're saying those

10

words, strong inference, mean essentially the same thing

11

as reasonable inference.

12

MR. MILLER:

No.

You can have lots of

13

reasonable inferences that don't meet a preponderance

14

notion.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true, but imagine a

16

case where the plaintiff with tremendous candor sets

17

forth every bit of testimony that's going to be heard on

18

both sides.

19

And then you read that document and you

20

conclude this is the weakest case I've ever heard, but I

21

do think a reasonable juror could find for the

22

plaintiff.

23
24
25

And that would be the weak evidence
standard.
And lo and behold, that could be -- you
35
Alderson Reporting Company

you send it to a jury test, we could easily imagine

the inferences that could be drawn from those facts?

24

just don't understand that argument.

25

You see somebody -- let's say you saw
36
Alderson Reporting Company

I

somebody today walking east on Pennsylvania Avenue in

you could draw an inference that the person is coming to

from the allegations that it's the bad stuffing that's

at issue.

It could mean discounting and

MR. MILLER:

So there's good

The Seventh Circuit reached

that conclusion, I think, by looking at some of the

10

confidential sources which sort of indicated that there

11

was channel stuffing in the sense of pushing product out

12

which was coming back.

13

about the channel stuffing, so there's reason to believe

14

that at least some of it is bad.

15

The head of Verizon complained

Just enough.

Now, is that in and of itself determinative?

No.

17

Seventh Circuit did is look at the 5500, look at the

18

6500, look at the earnings projections which proved

19

false, looked at back-dating, channel stuffing.

20

at all of that and said okay, even if I treat channel

21

stuffing as weak, I have these other things.

I think it is a tough line.

I

think this is the kind of line district judges have to

draw.

11

Anderson versus Liberty Lobby and all of those jury

trial cases, you see the repetition of the notion that

13

judges do not balance inference chains on a matter going

to the core function of a jury.

I think if you look at your own precedents like

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But all of those

cases were before the PSLRA where Congress, it seems to

me, established a very different standard.

they have to support a strong inference.

Right.

And then on appeal,

we would say, no, it's not a strong inference, or yes,

it is a strong inference.

standards for how you go about determining whether

there's a strong inference or not.

or not because labor unions are bringing the cases and

they're not going to bring a frivolous case?

what concerns me is that the very standard that the

And

The notion of strong inference

The notion of strong inference

believe the Seventh Circuit applied is not the classic

9

least traditionally, under notice pleading, you can

10

march through that.

11

This test, if you follow that time line

backward, is in effect asking that district judge to

It's a curious

3

and I have to make a judgment because Congress was

4

pushing here.

5

I'm looking at the motion to dismiss

There's no doubt about it.

I have to make a decision on the basis of

6

what I've got, which is virtually nothing -- let's face

7

that -- I think -- I think if these allegations are

8

proven, it is certainly trial worthy.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It sounds to me like -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's not trial worthy, but

11
12
13
14

rather discovery worthy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

Justice Stevens, say it again.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think the question is

15

not whether it's trial worthy, it's whether it's worthy

16

for discovery.

17

That's really what's at issue in this.

MR. MILLER:

Well, the realities out there

18

are they built a wall.

They put in all of these

19

procedural protections and they said no discovery until

20

you climb the wall.

21

Was it a Dutch dike or the Berlin Wall?

22

that statute, contrary to what Mr. Phillips urges, there

23

are multiple policies expressed in that statute, one of

24

which is, private cases are good.

25

right people to run those private cases.

Now what kind of a wall was it?
If you look at

Let's just get the

them.

Let's, let's have a greater threshold, but let's

2

not throw the baby out with the bath water.

3

everybody seems to agree private cases help.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because

I want, I want to be fair.

5

I interpreted your argument -- and please tell me if

6

this is incorrect -- as indicating that if I think

7

strong inference is greater, more onerous than more

8

likely than not, at the pleading stage, I then also have

9

to say this is the instruction that must be given to the

10

jury?

In order to avoid the, the discontinuity between

11

the pleading stage and what -

12

MR. MILLER:

The way you state it, Justice,

13

is something very hard for me to respond to.

14

did not change the persuasiveness, the proof burden.

15

you go through the statute, you will see spots where

16

they did.

17

Congress knew how to change Federal rules.

Congress

Congress knew how to change proof standards.

Congress did not change the proof in private

actions.

reached the jury, you would have to charge above

And I, I think we've got a stone rolling
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

downhill to the dismissal point, which is why we have

2

urged in the brief and why the Seventh Circuit was

3

concerned as was the Sixth about this jury trial

4

implication -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, and so I think we

6

have to reach it, because it can't possibly be you would

7

instruct the jury you need a strong inference, and it

8

couldn't possibly be that a predominance standard if

9

imported into the pleading would always mean a strong

10

inference.

11

I don't see how to remain true to the words of the

12

statute which are strong inference, without actually

13

producing a dichotomy.

14

or it can't, and -- and -- and that's -- and we could

15

fudge it by just, you know, avoiding it at this moment.

16

But I don't -

17

You see, that's -- that's the dilemma.

And

And so either Congress can do it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Miller, suppose

18

Congress set up a entirely separate cause of action.

19

It's caused -- it's called a discovery cause of action,

20

okay?

21

that cause of action a standard that your, your

22

allegation has to be indeed clear and convincing.

And it sets forth as the condition for pursuing

23

Okay?

24

And then if you win that, you can take

25

whatever you get out of the discovery and bring a
49

lawsuit.

2
3

Would that be unconstitutional?
MR. MILLER:

Why do I feel wind whipping

past my ears as I go through a trap door?

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. MILLER:

Ironically, ironically, I think

6

I have to say if Congress, leaving to one side

7

justiciability problems with the discovery cause of

8

action, if Congress created a discovery cause of action

9

it could ascribe to it whatever incidents it wanted

10

to -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Surely it could prohibit

12

discovery altogether which it did before they adopt in

13

1938.

14

MR. MILLER:

That is correct.

And I don't

15

think anybody seriously argues that discovery is a

16

constitutional right.

17

The jury trial implications of this new

18

cause of action are interesting.

19

protected post-1791 statutory claims and their right to

20

jury trial, but you're positing one that wasn't known in
