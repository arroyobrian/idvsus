CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

this morning in Case 11-1347, Chafin v. Chafin.

Mr. Manely.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MANELY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. MANELY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
United States courts have the power to

10
11

effectuate relief in the Hague Convention cases under

12

circumstances presented here in this international

13

treaty.

14

Sergeant First Class -- First Class Chafin's

15

appeal from the district court's decision is not moot

16

because reversal of the district court's judgment could

17

grant Sergeant Chafin relief in three ways, each

18

sufficient to preclude mootness.

19

First, a reversal would mean that the United

20

States is the child's habitual residence.

Second, the

21

district court or court of appeals should order

22

Ms. Chafin to bring the child back to the United States

23

and overturn the monetary award.

24

effectuate relief in the ongoing Alabama case and the

25

Scottish case by, one, letting Alabama courts proceed to

And, third, it would

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

determine custody and, two, cause the Scottish court to

2

stay or dismiss its proceeding.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would it make any

4

difference?

Once -- once the decision -- the district

5

court decision is vacated, then the State court can go

6

forward.

7

so.

8

point, I think, is --

There is nothing that inhibits it from doing

There is no Federal court order.

9

MR. MANELY:

So your third

Yes, Your Honor.

Under the

10

UCCJEA, which is what the State of Alabama would use,

11

there is a home State requirement that the child must be

12

presently -- six months before the action is commenced.

13

Not so much from the district court order,

14

but coming down from the Alabama Supreme Court, but

15

premised upon the original district court order, it was

16

determined that Alabama was not the home State of the

17

child.

18

talk about in our brief.

19

courts to say --

It would allow the Alabama

20
21

So it's sort of like the traffic light that we

that.

The child is now in Scotland.

22

MR. MANELY:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24
25

Now, I don't understand

Yes.
So how would these six

months be satisfied?
MR. MANELY:

It would toll because the
4


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

child, we would argue, is wrongfully in Scotland based

2

upon an errant district court --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you can argue that on

4

the basis of the vacation of the district court's Hague

5

Convention order.

6

anything, as far as I can see, that the Federal court

7

has done.

8

never happened.

9
10

You -- you're not inhibited by

Since it's been vacated, it's as though it

MR. MANELY:

Except for the fact that there

is an error in the determination of habitual residence.

11

And I understand what you're saying, but

12

the -- the res of the controversy needs to be brought

13

back here.

14

here, so that we have not only the habitual court -- or

15

habitual residence determination in the district court

16

because of reversal, but that we have the child brought

17

back here.

18

That -- that would be the appropriate remedy

And then that six -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you don't have -- you

19

don't have that individual -- the residence -- habitual

20

residence determination because it's been wiped out.

21

MR. MANELY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I understand.

22

What our argument is, is that there is an

23

ability to grant a remedy here, and that is the reversal

24

of that determination, so that we go back to habitual

25

residence in the United States.

That's what avoids

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mootness in this case.

2

provided here.

There is a remedy that can be

It is not impossible.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. MANELY:

Bring the child back.

Yes,

Your Honor.

8
9

What you're saying is

the return of the child, essentially, back to Alabama?

6
7

Wouldn't the Alabama --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so once the child is

back in Alabama, that's the remedy, then the State court

10

would be seized of jurisdiction sufficient then to

11

determine the habitual residence.

12

MR. MANELY:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

Yes, Your Honor.
Whatever the State --

well, presumably, the child only comes back if you win.

15

MR. MANELY:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So presuming you win,

17

the child would come back, and the Alabama courts could

18

then seize the custody determination.

19

MR. MANELY:

Right.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Proceed under --

And the Alabama court would

21

not have jurisdiction if the child had been wrongfully

22

removed?

23

MR. MANELY:

The Alabama --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. MANELY:

Is that what you're saying?

No, the Alabama court would
6


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have jurisdiction under the UCCJEA presently, unless

2

this Court should determine that it is moot when a child

3

is removed from the boundaries of our -- of our nation.

4

The Alabama --

5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MANELY:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

The

opinion below has been vacated.

7

9

Wait, wait, wait.

Yes, sir.
So there's -- there's

nothing which says that this child -- this child's
habitual residence was -- was in the U.K.

11

MR. MANELY:

Yes, sir.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.

That being the case, the

13

only question is will the Alabama court proceed, even --

14

assuming that it finds the child's habitual residence

15

was in Alabama, would it proceed, even if the child had

16

been taken out of the jurisdiction?

17

that it would.

18

MR. MANELY:

And I understand

If there never had been a

19

district court determination in the first place,

20

certainly --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

hasn't been.

23

never happened.

24
25

There hasn't been.

It's been vacated.

MR. MANELY:

There

It's as though it

The posture below is that the

Eleventh Circuit vacated the opinion in February; but,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

as recently as July of this year, the Alabama Supreme

2

Court said, well, since the matter was determined moot,

3

then only the divorce can proceed.

4
5
6

What we hope to do is, by going back down to
the Eleventh Circuit, obtaining a reversal -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's bad law.

I

7

mean -- you mean the Alabama court is bound by a vacated

8

decision of a Federal court?

9

of anything like that.

My goodness, I never heard

10

MR. MANELY:

Yes, sir.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It goes --

Was their reasoning that

12

the child was initially removed properly because there

13

had been an order permitting the mother to go?

14

MR. MANELY:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

removal at that moment.

17

MR. MANELY:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it was a lawful

At that moment, yes.

And by --

And what they're saying

19

is, since the case is moot, nothing has vacated the

20

order, but it didn't make her action illegal?

21

MR. MANELY:

Correct.

And by reversing,

22

then we're going back to what was argued to make the

23

case moot in the first place.

24

back, and we'll reverse --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We can bring the child

When you say, "bring the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

child back," there's an impediment to that because now

2

this court in Scotland has told her don't -- the child

3

stays here.

4

removed from Scotland, and there is also -- doesn't the

5

mother have -- wasn't this mother deported?

There's an order that the child not be

6

MR. MANELY:

The mother --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if she -- she -- if

8

she -- the mother comes back into the United States,

9

she's committing a criminal offense.

10

MR. MANELY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Absent -- and

11

she was present at the trial in the district court.

12

there are provisions that would allow her to return for

13

that particular reason.

14

reapply, I think, after something like five years.

15

And, of course, she can

16

But --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18
19

So

She

But what about the order

of the court in Scotland?
MR. MANELY:

The order of the court in

20

Scotland, we would refer to on a State level, as being a

21

standing order.

22

Class Chafin that he can't remove the child.

23

no prohibition to the mother.

24

Scotland has assumed authority over this child -- should

25

become a ward of the country.

And what it does is tell Sergeant First
There is

There is no sense that

9

Alderson Reporting Company

1

It's more that, since the mother has filed a

2

custody action there, it's a -- Dad, you can't remove

3

the child from Scotland.

4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a stand-still order

there.

6

MR. MANELY:

Yes.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How long has the child

8

been -- now since -- since the return, pursuant to the

9

Federal court's order, how long has the child been

10

residing in Scotland?

11
12

MR. MANELY:

October 13th of last year, I

believe, so approximately 14 months now.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the Alabama courts

14

were to conduct a custody proceeding?

15

has now been in Scotland for over a year, would they

16

consider the child's habitual residence to be Scotland?

17

MR. MANELY:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Since the child

The Alabama courts -And if they did that,

19

wouldn't they defer to the Scottish courts for custody

20

determination?

21

MR. MANELY:

No, Your Honor, I don't think

22

so.

Again, applying UCCJEA, which all of the States

23

have, but for one, they are to look at Hague orders in

24

the same way that they would apply UCCJEA, and there is

25

a tolling provision.

If a child has been wrongfully
10


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

removed from that jurisdiction, then the child is still

2

presumed to have retained a home State status with

3

Alabama.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, there is a

5

judgment against your client, isn't there, for $94,000

6

or so?

7

MR. MANELY:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
Could you break down

that figure?
MR. MANELY:

10

The lion's share of it is

11

attorneys' fees, but, also, within the Hague, there is a

12

mandatory provision for costs; not just costs of court,

13

but the costs of mother's flying over here from

14

Scotland, staying here for approximately a week and a

15

rental car.

16

of the $94,000, it was a substantial portion of that.

So while that isn't the predominant share

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19
20

proceedings been dismissed?
MR. MANELY:

So -So have the State

Or are they in suspense?

Neither, Your Honor.

Where

21

they are is the trial level court is waiting to grant a

22

divorce, but that is kind of effectively held up by the

23

parties, in hoping that we can use Alabama Rule of Civil

24

Procedure 60(b)(5); that, if we get a reversal from the

25

Eleventh Circuit saying habitual residence is the United
11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

States, we can reopen the custody matter.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it would be your

3

position that the Alabama courts still have jurisdiction

4

over the child and the mother?

5
6

MR. MANELY:

Certainly, if the Eleventh

Circuit reverses, yes, sir.

7

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, that cost that

8

you have to pay for the mother, even though the case was

9

mooted, that judgment is still outstanding for the

10

monies you have to pay?

11

MR. MANELY:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

It still is, Your Honor.
If you win on this

appeal, is that wiped out?

14

MR. MANELY:

We believe that it is.

The

15

energy of our case is thrust into having habitual

16

residence determination reversed and bringing the child

17

back; but we think that when -- the provision of ICARA

18

that allows for the costs, the travel costs and the

19

attorneys' fees to be awarded, is also obliterated.

20

that is also --

21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
separate judgment?

23
24
25

So

Is that done in a

The --

MR. MANELY:

It's a separate order, same

case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And is there any problem

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about the time to appeal from that having run?

2

MR. MANELY:

We don't think so, but, again,

3

that's not the thrust of our case.

4

government's argument, and we certainly agree with that.

5

Our energy, all along, has been spent exclusively on

6

reversing habitual residence determination.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I understand the

But, as far as mootness

8

is concerned, if you have not appealed from that order

9

and the time has run from your appeal, you can't rely on

10

that to avoid mootness.

11

MR. MANELY:

Your Honor, I believe I

12

understand your question, and I -- and I think you're

13

correct.

14

the United States loses power over children when they're

15

removed from our borders, then the rest kind of falls in

16

line.

17

If we're talking about a determination that

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
happens --

19
20

Counsel, what's -- what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand your

answer.

21

MR. MANELY:

I'm sorry.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is your -- I don't

23

understand that answer.

Are you -- are you saying

24

that -- that your failure to appeal that in a timely

25

fashion makes it impossible for the Court of Appeals to
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

obliterate that award?

2

MR. MANELY:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

I thought the question was.

5

MR. MANELY:

No, sir.

And it may be --

Well, that's -- that's what

I apologize.

And it may be

6

just the -- the tunnel vision that we have in this case.

7

We're solely focused on reversing the district court

8

order on habitual residence and returning the child.

9

The rest is -JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Well, then -- then retain

11

your tunnel vision.

And don't say that the case remains

12

non-moot simply because of this other issue.

13

issue is either in the case or out of the case.

14

it part of your case?
MR. MANELY:

15

The other
Now, is

We agree with the government's

16

position that it keeps this case alive, and it is not

17

moot.

18

particularly since our focus on the case is otherwise.

19

But I certainly understand the -- the issue,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if you -- if you could

20

take an appeal and got a reversal of the decision -- of

21

the order removing the child to -- allowing the child to

22

be removed to Scotland, wouldn't that undermine the --

23

the judgment for costs?

24

would be a separate order -- why that would be something

25

that has to be appealed separately.

I don't understand why that

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Why wouldn't that

Official

1

be included with the final order in the case?

2

MR. MANELY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I agree.

And

3

the -- allowing the child to leave was the linchpin that

4

allowed the costs.

5

removes the costs.

6

Removing that impediment also

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, that's

7

lovely, but -- so you are saying that you don't have to

8

appeal that separately; is that what you're saying?

9

MR. MANELY:

I'm saying I trust that that is

10

the resolution of this; but, again, our focus is on the

11

child, not costs.

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you've got to answer my

question.

14

MR. MANELY:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you have to appeal that

16

separately or not?

17

Justice Alito's question was -- was the way you did, you

18

are saying that it's unnecessary to appeal that monetary

19

aspect of the judgment separately, that it goes -- it

20

goes with the rest of it.

21

position?

22

If -- if the way you answered

MR. MANELY:

Is that -- is that your

Your Honor, I think that it is

23

correct that if the -- the basis for the award is

24

removed, then the award is removed; but, if the basis

25

for the award remains, then it would be difficult to
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assert that there is some reason to appeal that award.

2

I don't think there is any great answer.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

doesn't have to be appealed separately.

I think you're saying it

5

MR. MANELY:

Yes, sir.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.

Can you tell me what's

7

happening -- what is the status?

8

return custody order -- return order, will the Scottish

9

court ever determine habitual residence?

10

MR. MANELY:

Given the vacated

The Scottish court has no need

11

to determine habitual residence because that was

12

determined by the -- by the district court.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that order has been

14

vacated, so can they revisit that question is really

15

the -- the issue.

16

MR. MANELY:

I don't -- they wouldn't

17

revisit within the context of a Hague proceeding, unless

18

a Hague proceeding were brought there.

19

context of their own custodial determination, like the

20

Alabama court would in the divorce, there is a

21

determination of -- of jurisdiction over the child.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Within the

But you could bring a Hague

proceeding there, right?
MR. MANELY:

We could bring a Hague

proceeding there.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could say -- you know,

2

there having been no decision in the United States, we

3

want you to decide what habitual residence is, and we

4

think it's the United States.

5

MR. MANELY:

You could do that.

We could do that.

The problem

6

with that is that we're talking about different points

7

in time.

8
9

For our Hague -- actually, the mother's
Hague proceeding, she's the one that filed it -- for the

10

mother's Hague proceeding, the time period that we're

11

looking at was February of 2010 until the child left in

12

October of 2011, that is the time frame we'd really like

13

to stay with.

14
15

That's an important time frame.

If we go to Scotland, we're talking about a
different time frame.

16

It's a different animal.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you said

17

that that time period was tolled -- the period that she

18

was in Scotland would be tolled.

19

MR. MANELY:

From a United States

20

perspective, more specifically an Alabama perspective,

21

yes.

22

Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in Scotland, it's --

23

it would be a custody proceeding.

24

Hague.

25

custody proceeding.

The child is there.

Forget about the

The mother is bringing a

And the question for that court is
17

Alderson Reporting Company

where is the child's habitual residence now?

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And at the Hague, it's

what was it then.

4

MR. MANELY:

Yes.

Yes.

And -- and the

5

Scottish court -- our -- our briefs are filled with the

6

citations of authority, but the Scottish court -- there

7

is no reason to believe that the Scottish court wouldn't

8

honor what the United States court has said about

9

habitual residence, the case brought by the mother in

10

the Federal district court in Alabama.

11

So that if that was the linchpin to allow --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was only for

13

determining the Hague Convention; and, if the Hague

14

Convention is out of it, then there is a custody

15

proceeding.

16

get the case to a forum that's an appropriate forum to

17

decide the custody question, right?

18

MR. MANELY:

19

21

The idea of the Hague Convention is just to

Yes.

Custody is the second and

crucial element of the Hague Convention as well.
If -- if there are no further questions, I'd

MS. SAHARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

Put simply, this case is not moot because an

5

appellate decision on the merits would matter.

6

Court has been discussing today is there are various

7

ways in which the appellate decision might matter.

8

There are ways that there would be a judgment that the

9

father either did or did not wrongfully retain the

child.

11

Part of the wrongful retention determination

to say it might make a difference, and that's enough,

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, this Court has said

that, as long as there's any possibility of effectual

relief, that the case is not moot.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Saharsky, not to -- I

2

mean, the whole object of the Hague Convention is to

3

stop this shuttling the child back and forth.

4

because of this unfortunate situation we have, where the

5

district judge wouldn't give a stay, you're -- what 


6

you're -- what you're urging is exactly what this 


7

Convention was meant to stop. 

This child has been in Scotland for 14

months.

Now, you say bring it back to the United 


10

States, and we -- we start over.

11

the return procedure is so that you get the child to a

12

place that's a proper place to determine custody; isn't

13

that right?

14

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

The whole object of

We share your concerns

15

about not wanting the child to be shuttled back and

16

forth.

17

concerns are by stays in appropriate cases, where the

18

four factor test that -- with respect to a likelihood of

19

success on the merits and a balancing of the equities is

20

met; and that, when stays are put in place pending

21

appellate proceedings, that those proceedings be

22

expedited, the decisions made quickly.

23

And we think that the way to accommodate those

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And would you go further

24

and say that, if a stay is not in place, that that still

25

does not deprive the Court of Appeals of jurisdiction to

Alderson Reporting Company

resolve the case on the merits? 

Yes.

That's what we would 


3

say, that the case is not moot.

The court of appeals 


4

should be able to go forward with the case. 


2

5

MS. SAHARSKY:

But if the case for a stay has not been made

6

by the losing party, then the child should be returned

7

to the country of habitual residence because a

8

determination has been made that that's the country

9

where the child should be, and there's not a good

10
11

argument that the other side has put forth for a stay.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You agree that the

12

ideal -- the ideal procedure would be, and I quite

13

agree, that you have a very fast track stay pending

14

appeal and an expedited appeal.

15

that -- that requires that, so how -- how could that

16

sensible procedure be put in place?

17

MS. SAHARSKY:

But there is no rule

Well, we think that just,

18

under the normal court appellate rules, that that

19

effectively is what happens using the American stay

20

standard for a four factor test, not that there would be

21

a stay in every case, but, when the showing -- the

22

appropriate four factor showing is made for a stay, that

23

then a stay would be appropriate, and an expedited

appeal would be appropriate.

risk to the child under the Convention and not order the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we just don't know

what the court's going to do, but some form of relief is

possible.

position of the other side is that there is absolutely

2

nice.

What does that have to do with this case?

3

don't understand that. 


4

MS. SAHARSKY:

I 


Well, the question is just 


5

what -- what might happen in this case, in terms of if

6

there would be competing court orders or whether the

7

courts would -- what the courts would do in response to

8

each other.

9

And I think the point, at least, that I was

10

getting from Justice Sotomayor's question is that there

11

is a measure of cooperation here, so that the Court need

12

not be particularly concerned about parallel proceedings

13

or competing proceedings in other countries.

14

The way that, for example, this case has

15

played out is that, while the Hague Convention dispute

16

has been litigated in Federal court, the Alabama custody

17

court has appropriately stayed its hand, as it's

18

required to do under Article 16 of --

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, do you

20

agree with your -- with the Petitioner, just reading a

21

sentence from its brief, that "mootness requires that

22

relief be impossible"?

23

standard?

24
25

Do you think that's the right

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, we -- we think that the

Court essentially said that in Knox, that it said -27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that asked whether there is a possibility of relief, if

2

the question is one of literal impossibility, we don't

3

think that the Court needs to ask --

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What this Court --

5

Court has always said, if it's an Article 3 inquiry

6

under standing, and it said that it's not supported by

7

injury that is speculative or conjectural.

8

me, when you start talking about, well, the Scottish

9

court might do this or the Alabama courts might do this,

10
11

It seems to

that -- that sounds pretty speculative and conjectural.
MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I think the Court has

12

made those comments more in the context of the standing

13

inquiry at the beginning of a case, as opposed to the

14

mootness inquiry after a case has gone on for a while,

15

and the burdens there are different.

16

At the standing -- at the beginning of a

17

case in the standing inquiry, the party coming into

18

court really has a burden of showing that this case --

19

that there's something to be adjudicated in court.

20

the case continues, it's the party who doesn't want the

21

case to be in court anymore to show that there's nothing

22

the court can do; that even though the court has put

23

those resources --

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As

Well, the burden is

different, but I don't agree that the standard changes.
28

Alderson Reporting Company

1

It's just who has to prove it, one side or the other.

2

But I --

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

And our position with

4

respect to the standard is simply from language taken

5

from this Court's decision, going back to Mills, but

6

also repeated in Church of Scientology and Knox, is

7

there any effectual relief, whatever; is it possible to

8

grant relief?

be complete.

Relief can be partial, it doesn't need to
That's things that the Court has said.

You know, we don't interpret that to be a --

10
11

you know, literal impossibility standard.

12

understand that to be asking the question, is there

13

something the courts can do, even if it's not

14

complete --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We just

So do you think

16

it's -- I mean, I know you've got a laundry list of

17

things, but, as I understand it, you think it's enough

18

that, if the Court issues an opinion, the Scottish court

19

might do something as a result of that?

20

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, I think that the Court

21

issuing an opinion has effects in America, regardless of

22

what happens in Scotland, because you have a declaratory

23

judgment that sets out the rights of the parties.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought one of the

arguments, maybe it was the Petitioner's and not yours,
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was that one reason it wasn't moot is because the

2

Scottish courts might look at the case differently.

3

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, that's -- I think it's

4

a set of interrelated reasons.

I mean, they're really

5

all connected because -- can I finish the sentence? --

6

you have a judgment in the United States about the

7

rights of the parties.

It affects what might happen with custody.

all part and parcel of the same dispute.

of the case?

7

there is one remedy, and one remedy only, in this

10

The question is, isn't she seized -- doesn't the court

11

have jurisdiction over her until the case ends?

case doesn't end until there has been an appeal and a

13

judgment and the judgment affirmed or reversed.

hasn't happened.

because that's where the constitutional doctrine comes

19

into central --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You are suggesting that

21

the Convention deprives a party, after the remedy's been

22

ordered and effected, of the right to appeal; not

23

because of mootness, but because the Convention takes

24

away a fundamental right to appeal?

25

MR. CULLEN:

No, the Convention says you
31


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

must exercise the most expeditious remedies available

2

because --

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're not going to

4

suggest all those countries that permit appeals

5

explicitly and stop removals until appeals are finished,

6

that those -- that those those treaty -- contracting

7

treaty parties are breaching the Convention, are you?

8
9

MR. CULLEN:

No, they're not.

There are 88

countries, and this is a very, very good convention.

It

10

works.

It works for the countries, Justice Sotomayor,

11

that do immediate enforcement, and it works for the

12

countries that don't do immediate enforcement, pending

13

an appeal.

14

But the -- the question presented here is

15

what a court could do in this country once the sheriff

16

court in the Hamlet of Airdrie is seized with

17

jurisdiction because what this treaty has done is -- has

18

taken jurisdiction from the United States and said,

19

Scotland, you now have jurisdiction.

20

thing the Court can do is give him back $94,000.

22
23
24
25

One thing -- one

MR. CULLEN:

No, it cannot.

It cannot.

I

was very -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He has no -- his

ability to challenge the propriety of the order that he
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

pay $94,000 is gone?

2

MR. CULLEN:

It's gone in this case,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, because, in the Joint Appendix, pages

4

16 and 17, you'll see -- I believe it's docket entry 52,

5

on page 16, an appeal was taken off those fees.

6

If you go on -- I believe it's page 17 of

7

the Joint Appendix, docket entry 57, you'll see that the

8

Petitioner voluntarily dismissed his appeal of the fees.

9

So having taken an appeal of the fees and having

10

dismissed, there is nothing left for any appeal court

11

now to do with respect to fees.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, except he might have

13

assumed that the issue of fees would still be alive if

14

the Eleventh Circuit ruled on the merits.

15

MR. CULLEN:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

Right.

So --

And he -- he was just

trying to have a single appeal.

18

MR. CULLEN:

Right.

But the test that the

19

Court would apply in -- in that hypothetical fees

20

determination is totally different from the test the

21

appeal court would apply in looking at habitual

22

residence.

23

All it would look at is, is it -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, appellate courts all

24

the time have issues where they apply different

25

standards to multiple issues in the case.
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CULLEN:

Right.

So if we assume that

2

the fees survives -- they can pursue the fees issue.

3

The problem, Justice Kennedy, is that there -- there is

4

no habitual residence to be determined back in time.

5

What this treaty does is it exercises a one-way return.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that, of course --

7

on your premise, that's right.

8

wrong, that -- the issue of custody is still alive under

9

their perspective.

10

On their premise, it's

That's what we are arguing about, so

you're just assuming your own premise.

11

MR. CULLEN:

Well, the premise, though, is

12

based in the purpose of this treaty because, back in the

13

'70s, before this treaty, Justice Kennedy, there was

14

chaos.

15

should go back to possibly competing custody orders

16

between Scotland and Alabama, but --

17

And, in fact, the government is suggesting we

you've won a judgment in lower court that says that the

19

habitual residence of the child is Scotland.

21

habitual residence was the United States, but the child

22

is in Scotland.

23

So if they

You understand Scottish law better than I,

24

but they are also bound by this treaty.

25

imagine a Scottish court, just as we would do, when they

So I would

are trying to decide what's the habitual presumptive

then, and now, what's the habitual residence, they would

look at what the United States courts decided.

They are not absolutely bound by it.

But

5

just as we, in the last case we had, were very

6

interested in what the Chilean courts said.

7

it was relevant to us what the Chilean courts had held

8

was the proper law of Chile in respect to that child.

9

Wouldn't the Scottish courts do the same?

Of course,

10

Wouldn't it matter to a Scottish court, after all,

11

that an American court had decided that the residence

12

was not bound?

13

give it consideration?

14

I'd certainly give it ­ won't they

And my question is

Of course, he will read it, and I would

7

think that that judge would take it into account in his

8

decision.

foreign orders of other foreign courts, and I think we

should do that, and I think the Scottish courts should

That's what we do with the foreign -- similar

Now, you tell me where I'm wrong in that.
MR. CULLEN:

Justice Breyer, the sheriff in

16

Scotland, and we -- we don't look back in time with

respect to that.

In custody disputes,

The child spent 5 years in

To say that it's only now, prospective only,

situations, district judges will think this child

belongs in England; this child belongs in France; this

3

child belongs in China, wherever they belong.

the back of their mind will be the possibility that they

5

are wrong, and they know there is a right to appeal.

But in

And so instead of being able in these

border cases -- borderline cases, instead of being able

to send the child back home, they will think, I've got

to keep the child here, so that the other party has the

that -- that one could argue that returning back to the

It could say

MR. CULLEN:

Those would be limited

As you know, Justice Sotomayor, those

limited types of undertakings came about because of the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Cullen -- Mr. Cullen,

5

it's often true, in international litigation, that

6

enforcement is very difficult.

commercial litigation case where somebody is going after

8

assets and the assets are not in the United States, and

9

somebody looks and says, well -- you know, a court can

I mean, take a

10

do whatever it wants, but nothing is going to happen

11

afterwards.

12

So why is this case any different from --

13

you know, a very frequent problem in international

14

litigation, which is, sometimes, judgments are difficult

15

to enforce?

16

may -- may never be enforced, but we don't put courts to

17

the job of saying, oh, well, let's check out the various

18

enforcement options and make predictions about who's

19

going to do what.

20

And if you look at it practically, it

MR. CULLEN:

Justice Kagan, not to state the

21

obvious, but this is different because it's a child.

22

It's a child in question, and that has to be a

23

consideration in this treaty.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it's different -- that

might be -- it's certainly different in terms of the
41

1

interests at stake, and that might be a very good reason

2

for Congress to step in and try to fix this system, so

3

that you don't have children shuttling back and forth.

4

But -- you know, at the risk of sounding hard-hearted,

5

in terms of the law, what is different?

6

MR. CULLEN:

Well, what is different is --

7

and I need to answer the question -- two Justices have

8

asked me about these stays, and I need to answer that,

9

so I can answer your question.

10

The -- the district court was presented with

11

a single request for a stay in this case.

12

was we may or may not file an appeal.

13

a notice of appeal, so give us a stay, so we can decide

14

what we want to do.

15

The request

We haven't filed

What should have happened and what usually

16

happens is you say, give us a stay, but if you're not

17

going to give us a stay, give us a temporary stay.

18

us 48 hours, to see if we can get a stay from the

19

appellate court.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Give

Well, that's not

21

quite fair to say we -- we haven't decided whether we're

22

going to appeal.

23

made immediately upon the determination of the merits by

24

the district court, and the district court said no.

25

I mean, didn't they do everything they could have done

I mean, the -- the stay motion was

42

Alderson Reporting Company

So,

Official

1

to -- to get a stay?

MR. CULLEN:

No.

It was a peculiar

3

halfhearted request for a stay.

5

The stay was we don't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's out of

6

respect to the district judge, who's just issued a

7

ruling on the merits.

9

we're taking you up right away.

I mean, saying -- you know, we

MR. CULLEN:

10

Right.

And this was a

11

Wednesday.

And what should have happened is, at a

12

minimum, a 24-hour or 48-hour request for a temporary

13

stay.

14

in Hague cases.

15

if a stay is not going to be granted, ask for a

16

temporary stay.

And, Mr. Chief Justice, this happens all the time
Hague practitioners ask for stays and,

17

The notion presented to -- to this Court

18

that there was some rush to justice here is not what

19

happened on the ground in Alabama.

20

happened.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is not what

It seems to me --

22

and I may be taking the opposite position from one of my

23

colleagues, but the -- the best thing is to hold things

24

up briefly, so that the child doesn't go overseas and

25

then have to be brought back, particularly if you have
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

situations where there can be an expeditious appeal.

2

And I think most appellate courts would appreciate

3

the -- the benefit of that.

4

It seems to me, if you -- if you're correct

5

that the decision is moot, it's not going to be a --

6

there is going to be a rush to judgment by the

7

individual that wants to take the child away.

8
9

MR. CULLEN:

No, we don't agree with that,

Mr. Chief Justice, because that doesn't take account of

10

the four factors any district court judge is supposed to

11

exercise in her discretion, in determining whether a

12

stay should be granted or not.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, again, you're just

14

assuming that the district judge is right, but that's

15

the whole issue.

16

under your position, we give a premium to the very sort

17

of precipitant action that the Hague Convention is

18

designed to avoid.

19

And as the Chief Justice indicates,

MR. CULLEN:

Justice Kennedy, no, what we're

20

doing is we are following the letter and the text of the

21

convention and the implementing legislation in this

22

country.

23

Time and again, this peculiar word

24

"forthwith" is used.

It means right now.

25

again, the treaty tells us you must act expeditiously
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Time and

1

because the idea, Justice Kennedy, is we avoid competing

2

litigation in countries.

3

is deciding this.

4

We must have one country that

And it's --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So are you arguing that the

5

effect of the statute implementing the treaty, which

6

uses "forthwith" and all of this, is to, in effect,

7

require that, unless there is a motion for a stay

8

pending, the decision of the trial court be carried out?

9

MR. CULLEN:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

You -- you think the -- the

11

mere word "forthwith" in the statute is enough to alter

12

our normal process of appeal?

13

MR. CULLEN:

It's the -- as a treaty, it's

14

the supreme law of the land.

15

issue a return, the child is to be returned forthwith.

16

And the plain meaning of those words is you must act

17

immediately.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says, if you decide to

But I can't -- I don't

19

understand why you want a treaty where the best

20

interest of the child is what's at issue, and you

21

interpret it in a way that the court of one nation with

22

the child, where you have parents from both nations,

23

pays no attention at all to what courts in other nations

24

are saying.

25

I mean, my experience out of that is Chile,
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where, of course, we wanted to know what the law of

2

Chile was and how the Chilean domestic relations judge

3

understood the relations between the parents.

4

important.

5

That was

And similarly, I think the Scottish judge

6

should want to know the same thing about the courts

7

deciding in the United States.

8

true of the United States judge wanting to know about

9

Scotland and so forth.

And the same thing is

I don't see how we're going to get harmony,

10
11

in other words, unless you let appellate processes go

12

forward, too.

13

drafters would have had in mind if they wanted some

14

other regime.

And -- and I don't know what the treaty

MR. CULLEN:

15

Justice Breyer, it's not that

16

we enter into these communications and agreements with

17

any country.

18

By ratifying this particular treaty and by

19

the United States saying, we are going to ratify it with

20

the United Kingdom or Scotland or Brazil, we are saying

21

much more than there's no comity here.

22

trust this other country to do the right thing.

23

We are saying we

And that's, Justice Breyer, why we lodged

24

the Scottish papers because the Scottish papers should

25

satisfy you that Scotland was very satisfied there was a
46

Alderson Reporting Company

valid return.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

I trust Scotland to do the

3

right thing.

4

thing, it would be nice for Scotland to know what

5

American judges have decided.

6

reverse is equally true.

7

And I think, to help Scotland do the right

MR. CULLEN:

That's all.

And the

But the -- but it doesn't

8

matter, Justice Breyer, because there's been a vacatur.

9

There is no underlying decision.

10

The child is back in

Scotland, and now, one court can proceed.

11

And in fact, by continuing -- Justice

12

Breyer, by continuing the litigation, the effect of that

13

is to undermine the treaty because the idea behind the

14

treaty, particularly for military families, was to

15

enable mobility.

16

And by having ongoing litigation in the

17

United States, the only thing we can guarantee this

18

Court is this child is not coming to America until the

19

litigation is over.

20

four years.

So now, we're talking two, three,

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Excuse me, can I just --

Mr. Cullen, may I ask -- I'm

23

trying to figure out what exactly your argument is.

24

let me give you two options, and you tell me what your

25

argument is, all right?
47

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

One -- you can tell me it's neither, I

2

suppose.

3

no practical way to enforce any relief that's ordered by

4

the Eleventh Circuit, all right?

5

thinking your argument was.

6

But one is this case is moot because there's

That's what I came in

The second is -- is just no, it's just

7

improper for the Eleventh Circuit to enter any order

8

granting relief.

9

So which is it?

Is it that it's improper to

10

enter any order at this point?

11

you can enter an order, but it's just not going to be

12

enforced, and, therefore, this case is moot?

13
14

MR. CULLEN:

Or is it -- you know,

Justice Kagan, I'm going to

take your third non-offered offer.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. CULLEN:

And the answer is because the

17

Constitution tells us there is no case.

18

cannot -- and I see Justice Alito --

19
20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We cannot -- we

I don't understand the third

option.

21

MR. CULLEN:

Because -- because Article 3

22

says we have to be able to grant some effectual relief

23

in the judicial process.

24

1895, right up to the Knox case this year, this Court

25

has always said it's effectual relief in this judicial

26

process.

And since the Mills case in

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So I have to pose the question, Justice --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then you seem to be

3

saying that if the -- if the law does not permit the

4

issuance of a particular kind of order, and that's what

5

the -- THE plaintiff is seeking -- or that's what the

6

appellant is seeking, then the case is moot.

7

your argument?

8

mootness question.

9

Is that

I thought that's a merits question, not a

MR. CULLEN:

It is a mootness question

10

because it goes -- it's not -- it goes to the heart of

11

Constitutional mootness.

12

may be uncomfortable, and this may be inconvenient, but

13

once we've effected a remedy -- the only remedy, Justice

14

Alito, under this treaty -- and once it's been carried

15

out and once that child is home in Scotland, no matter

16

what another court does in this judicial process, it can

17

have no effect on the Scottish custody proceeding --

18

It goes to the issue of this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Cullen, are you

19

saying that the -- under the treaty, there can be no

20

rereturn order?

21

the -- whether the return order was wrong or right,

22

there can be no rereturn?

23

Is that what you're saying?

MR. CULLEN:

Whether

There can be no rereturn.

24

There was a lawful order returning the child to the

25

jurisdiction of Scotland.
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And there could be no

2

rereturn by the terms of the treaty.

3

argument that hangs on what the treaty's terms say; is

4

that correct?

5

MR. CULLEN:

So this is an

Well, it is -- it is very

6

textual, which is, of course, what surprised us so much

7

in the government's position in this case because, as

8

you know, Justice Kagan, the last time the government

9

presented this position, they said exactly the opposite

10

in Janakakis.

Now, they tried to deal with this,

11

Justice Kagan, in this footnote in their brief saying,

12

well, we touched briefly on this point before.

13

didn't touch briefly on it.

They

14

They said, in absolute terms, that nothing

15

in the Convention -- so this is our government talking

16

about the text, and we may give some compelling

17

deference to -- to the government on text, but we don't

18

give any deference to them we say or what the founding

19

fathers meant.

20

But with respect to this Janakakis case, the

21

government said nothing in the Convention requires

22

courts or other authorities -- and this was in Greece --

23

to give binding effect to any judgment --

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does equate, but now,

you've got me -- I think I'm on the same wavelength.
50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CULLEN:

Good.

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think it was back

4

just as well, let me see, because Justice Ginsburg -- I

5

see the point of her answer now.

6

It's really fact-specific to this case that

7

you're talking about.

So it just happens that the child

8

has now been in Britain or in Scotland for 18 months.

9

And so the question of current habitual residence where

10

they have been there for 18 months is a question of

11

what's been happening over these 18 months, and what

12

happened before the 18 months has absolutely nothing to

13

do with it.

14

And the most that the court of appeals could

15

say is that it was resident in America 18 months ago,

16

and that's no more relevant than saying that the cow

17

jumped over the moon or some other thing.

18

that the point?

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

Is that the point?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is has -- is

Is that the point?

I thought -- I thought

that's what you were saying.
JUSTICE BREYER:
that is the point.

Okay.

MR. CULLEN:

If that's the point -- yes,

If that's the point -I would say it is the point

because the Convention says it's the point.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the Convention

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

doesn't know whether it's 18 months or 6 months or what

2

counts as habitual residence, does it?

3

MR. CULLEN:

The Convention says you look to

4

the place where the child was located immediately prior

5

to the --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true, but you have

7

to decide whether that's the habitual residence.

8

seems to me that you're adding a factual thing, that

9

what happened in 18 months earlier has nothing to do

10

with whether the child is now a habitual resident of

11

Scotland.

12

And it

And what I want to know -- and I'm not going

13

to find this in the treaty, I don't think, because it's

14

not going to say whether it's 11 months or 12 -- but I

15

want to know what source I look to, to show that you're

16

right and that what happened 18 months previously has

17

nothing to do with the child's habitual residence as of

18

the place where he has lived for 18 months.

19
20

MR. CULLEN:

Well, habitual residence being

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Yours is fact.

I want to

know what I look to, to find out that fact.
MR. CULLEN:

You look to 1895, you look to

5

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So everything turns,

7

under your view, on whether or not the district court

8

gives the losing party the 48-hour stay or whether the

9

mother in this case decides to stay in the United States

10

until the U.S. proceedings are done.

11

The incentives if you prevail are for the

Get on the first plane out, and then you're
That seems, to me, to be a very unfortunate

MR. CULLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, we don't

19

agree, and here's why:

20

initially, the district court judge did not order the

21

instantaneous departure of this child.

22

that after considering the motion to stay.

23

not --

24
25

We don't agree because,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

She only did

No, no.

It was

I know, but

the point is that the other side says that the decision
53

Alderson Reporting Company

was wrong.

2

MR. CULLEN:

And it's --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- you know,

4

most -- not most, but many district judges don't like to

5

immediately say, after they have issued a decision,

6

well, there is a good likelihood that I'm wrong, and

7

therefore, I'll issue a stay.

8

(Laughter.)

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So there has to be

10

at least a period before somebody can go up to the court

11

of appeals and get a stay, and if you're right, what's

12

happening during that 48 hours or 24 hours is that the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if I understand your

answer to Justice Kagan, your argument is dependent on

21

the proposition that, under the Convention, that once

22

the child has left this country, a U.S. court no longer

23

has any power to order the child to come back; is that

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the -- if the Convention

4

said explicitly that a court in this country or whatever

other sending countries involved could order the child

back, this case would not be moot; is that correct?

MR. CULLEN:

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

the Convention, in effect, says exactly the opposite;

once the child leaves, there can't be an order requiring

their return.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

MR. MANELY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

18

With that, I'd like to touch on four points.

19

First of all, these courts have inherent authority to

20

order the child be brought back.

21

reversing the wrong decision of the district court.

22

When we are talking about the object of the Convention,

23

it is, in part, rapid return, but that is kind of

24

putting the cart before the horse.

25

It is a way of

The critical issue is where is the

appropriate habitual residence of the child, and that is

2

the place that then needs to make the custodial

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what he says is that,

after 18 months in Scotland, the Scottish court will

6

decide where is the habitual residence of the child.

7

8

9

the American courts decided prior to January of year 1

We

So even if

10

the correct habitual residence was Alabama, when the --

11

when the Scottish courts decide what is his habitual

12

residence as of 18 months later, they won't pay any

13

attention at all to that American decision because it is

14

not relevant.
That, I take it, to be his argument, which

depends on the long time, 18 months.

18

MR. MANELY:

So what is your

I think that may well be his

argument.

out earlier, courts are quite used to having children

I disagree with it entirely.

Do you -- are you aware of rereturn?

3

Your -- your thesis is that the -- that, now, the court

4

of appeals could tell the district judge, you were

5

wrong.

6

get a rereturn order from the Scottish court under the

7

Convention.

And then the father, armed with that, can go and

Have there been instances under the
Convention, was this question of rereturn -- is rereturn

MR. MANELY:

Your Honor --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the incidence of

15

rereturn under the Hague Convention?

16

MR. MANELY:

There are no cases because we

17

don't run into this problem, quite frankly.

18

rereturn is a catch phrase that was created here.

19

Bringing the child back would be a part of the court's

20

inherent authority -- part of the district court or the

21

court of appeals' inherent authority, and it's the basis

22

upon which Scotland has the child in the first place.

not pay attention to the habitual residence of a child

12

at the time of the removal.

MR. MANELY:

Correct.

I think they are

waiting to see what -- what we want to do.

So you've got Villamonte v. Marquez, where
