CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank.
Mr. Blanchard.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOHN BLANCHARD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. BLANCHARD:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The dual banking system of State and Federal

11

regulation in our nation which we've enjoyed for over

12

140 years is one of the finest examples of cooperative

13

federalism in our history.

14

not the OCC, have prudently exercised their authority

15

over non-bank State-chartered operating local

16

subsidiaries of national banks.

17

Wachovia Mortgage complied with Michigan law for 6 years

18

until in 2003 there was a corporate reshuffling and now

19

it claims it's exempt from the same Michigan laws it

20

complied with.

For 35 years, the States,

Indeed, respondent

21

The OCC through its Regulation 7.40006 has

22

disrupted the careful balance and seeks to deprive the

23

States of the regulatory authority that they have

24

historically exercised.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the national bank set

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

up its mortgage operations as a division or as a

2

department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?

3

MR. BLANCHARD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage made a choice.

5

They made a business judgment to create a

6

State-chartered operating subsidiary.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why did they do

8

that?

9

subsidiary rather than doing this directly?

10

What's the advantage to them having that

MR. BLANCHARD:

Your Honor, the advantage is

11

that Wachovia Bank insulates itself from liability,

12

because it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law

13

that the parent corporation is not liable for the acts

14

of the subsidiary corporation.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So mortgage

16

subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the

17

bank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they

18

have a certain number of assets that are subject to

19

liability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise

20

they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?

21

MR. BLANCHARD:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

22

From -- the conception behind operating subsidiaries was

23

to separate a certain part of the business and the

24

attendant risks of that business also to separate.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I assume that the
4

1

Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio

2

of loans to real estate value, things of that sort.

3

I assume that the States may have different rules with

4

regard to that; right?

5

might be different.

6

as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance

7

sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal

8

Government is.

9

is overseen by state authorities, you might have a

In other words, the oversight

The States may be more permissive

different result.

11

MR. BLANCHARD:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Possibly, but Well, if not I don't see

13

any advantage in this great Federal banking system

14

you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

15

MR. BLANCHARD:

Well, the States do not -

16

exclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest

17

with the OCC.

18

are separate and distinct.

19
20

But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

visit -- "visitorial," is that the word?

21

MR. BLANCHARD:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

You're not seeking

Correct.
You're not seeking

visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.

24

MR. BLANCHARD:

Absolutely not.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
5

Alderson Reporting Company

You're not arguing

Official - Subject to Final Review

that because you need to see more about the mortgage

2

subsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to?

3

MR. BLANCHARD:

No.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. BLANCHARD:

Okay.

No, we're not.

abusive and predatory lending complaints.

Suppose that it was a

Forget the subsidiary.

And your State

10

says:

Well, we want to have a law here that says we

11

want to send our own bank examiners in.

12

we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12

And moreover,

it in the law that says they don't have the authority to
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a

2

national bank is a national bank?

3

specifically that stops them from saying that?

4

MR. BLANCHARD:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. BLANCHARD:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there something

Yes.
What?
The Gold Foods case, the What is it?

What is it -

8

I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them

9

from saying it?

10

I don't know the Gold Foods case.

MR. BLANCHARD:

Well, the point is that the

11

corporate law recognizes the two as separate and

12

distinct corporate entities.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought your point was

14

that the statute defines national bank, but also defines

15

affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.

16

MR. BLANCHARD:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor.
And I thought your point

18

was that the effect of this regulation is to simply

19

eliminate that distinction?

20

MR. BLANCHARD:

You're right.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Their argument, they

22

haven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but

23

they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be

24

treated as a national bank.

25

they're entitled to say that the same preemption that

They're arguing that

7

applies to the national bank applies to the

2

subsidiaries.

5

MR. BLANCHARD:

Exactly.

That's what they

-CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Presumably, if they

6

said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the

7

benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came

8

to issues of liability.

9

a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate

10

existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be

11

obliterated.

12

If they said this subsidiary is

MR. BLANCHARD:

Well, but that's the -- they

13

are trying to contend that they are one and the same.

14

But they can't have their cake and eat it, too.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I guess we can ask

16

the respondents.

17

respondents take the position that the State has no

18

control at all over whether or not the shares have been

19

properly issued, whether or not certain accounting

20

requirements applicable to all corporations have been

21

complied with?

22
23
24
25

But is it your understanding that

MR. BLANCHARD:

Yes, that is my

understanding of their position.

They say that there's no

tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about

do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full

18

achievement of the purposes of the statute as

19

implemented by their regulation?

20

MR. BLANCHARD:

They do not.

21

First of all, if the OCC -- if Congress

22

intends to alter the balance that I spoke of earlier, it

23

must do so with clear and manifest language.

be unmistakably clear language that Congress intended to

Now on my assumption that

Your Honor, in the Barnett

case and in the Atherton case, in order to have the kind

of problem you're talking about, there must be a

an incapacitation of the business of banking.

that OCC is out of the picture because its dual

3

MR. BLANCHARD:

I am not saying that.

4

I am saying is the OCC does not have the exclusive

5

right.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What

Ah, you're saying, you

7

started to say they can't have their cake and eat it

8

too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all

9

possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two

10

equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the

11

requirements of both?

12

MR. BLANCHARD:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

subsidiary, right?

16

as a national bank and they're not going to be subject

17

to any visitation?

18

Yes.

I am saying that And if they don't

They can do this business directly

MR. BLANCHARD:

You are absolutely correct.

19

As I started to say earlier, they made that choice and

20

they came to Michigan, and they obtained a certificate

21

of authority from the Michigan Corporations Division as

22

a foreign for-profit corporation doing business in the

23

state.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And I would

have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the

2

state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal

regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is

4

that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the

5

state can't regulate at all.

6
7

MR. BLANCHARD:

They are claiming

exclusive preemptive authority.

8
9

Yes.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I didn't understand that

you made this -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just finish, please?

11

You argued, as I understand it, correctly, that the

12

state does, exercises certain regulatory controls that

13

will not be exercised -- will not be replaced by federal

14

controls; is that right?

15

they will be unregulated to a certain extent?

16

will be less regulation under the federal sovereign than

there is under the state; is that correct?

In other words, you -- that

10

difference as a matter of what they have to do in order

11

to comply with the law that they are now exempt from

12

Michigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead?

13

MR. BLANCHARD:

No.

Michigan just wants to

14

be able to -- and the other states -- to deal with fraud

15

and deceit and material misrepresentation in mortgage

16

transactions, and to have a say over the corporations

17

that come to their state and do business.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Blanchard, if I could

19

go back to what you were saying before this last line of

20

questioning, I didn't understand your position to be

21

that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal

22

bank up to the point where its -- well, can do it

23

apparently without limitation.

not that it only preempts in cases of conflict.

4

5

bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing

6

with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to

7

the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.

8

MR. BLANCHARD:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Correct.
So it's not a case

10

of conflict preemption.

They're trying to preempt state

law whether it conflicts or not, right?

12

MR. BLANCHARD:

That's correct, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You do have -- one thing

14

that seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I

15

get this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC

16

in its primary jurisdiction sense.

17

if you've got complaints about what this operating

18

subsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then

19

if we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given

you an adequate response to your complaint, we take

over.

correct.

Our regulatory framework in Michigan says that

7

the complaint is referred to the appropriate Federal

8

agency, and only if that complaint is not being

9

adequately pursued does the commissioner have that

10

window of investigative authority for her to pursue it.

11

It is a cooperative type of statute.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you know another

13

arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then

14

the state agency has authority to say Federal agency,

15

you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we

16

will take over?

17

where the state goes first, and then the Federal

18

authority, but do you know another one?

I know schemes that work the other way

19

MR. BLANCHARD:

Another one that -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where the primary

21

adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal

22

authority, but then the state can override that if it

23

thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate

24

job?

25

MR. BLANCHARD:

Well, in a sense, in our
19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute, the commissioner of the state agency is able to

2

investigate if the complaint referred to the comptroller

3

has not been adequately -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's not the question.

5

Justice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any

6

other situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do

7

an adequate job, the state agency comes in?

8
9

MR. BLANCHARD:

No situations come directly

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe civil rights actions

to mind.

10
11

where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial

12

powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the

13

citizen is free to bring litigation in state court?

14

guess that would be -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or environmental

16

regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't

17

take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't

18

mean that the state can't take action against the

19

polluter.

20

MR. BLANCHARD:

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Yes, Your Honor.
Isn't the action an

22

inadequate action?

Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal

23

authority can do with respect to this unit just what it

24

would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that

25

is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other, but if the -- it is the state judging the

2

adequacy of a particular Federal response.

3

MR. BLANCHARD:

Yes.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the Federal

5

U.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone

6

for manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an

7

adequate enough response and prosecute them for murder,

8

right?

9

MR. BLANCHARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could the OCC -

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did this go through your -

can I just ask -

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Sure.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This still goes to the same

15

thing.

Does Michigan do this by grace?

16

wanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and

17

say, you know, all these years we've been letting you

18

come in first, and we only step in when we think you

19

haven't done a good job, but we've had it.

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If Michigan

Especially after this

22

lawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state

23

banks?

24
25

MR. BLANCHARD:

No, Your Honor.

That would

be contrary to the express statutory scheme in Michigan.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know in Michigan.

I'm

saying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to

see what you think this Federal statute does.

Or would that be prevented by this

MR. BLANCHARD:

I'm trying to
Or what

The Federal rule provides

8

that the operating -- the State chartered operating subs

are to be treated just like the law pertaining to the

11

Congress given to the OCC that kind of rule.

12

only has the authority that Congress gives it, either

13

through a preemptive statute or through the dell

designation of preemptive authority; and Congress has

not given them that kind of power.

And there is no authority from

the regulatory question.

does not dispute that the operating -- well, strike

19

that.

20
21
22

You do not dispute Michigan

Michigan does not dispute that national
banks can go into business of real estate loans?
And Michigan does not dispute that Congress

23

has authorized national banks to operate through

24

subsidiaries for specific purposes like this.

25

My question is can you give me any plausible
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason to think that Congress would have contemplated

2

this system of potentially more restrictive State

3

legislation when its national bank in a given instance

4

decides to do -- to exercise its Federal banking power

5

through a subsidiary rather than directly?

6

Can you think of any reason that Congress

7

would have contemplated the scheme that you're, that

8

you're defending?

9

MR. BLANCHARD:

Well, first of all, Your

10

Honor, I'm not defending that Michigan has a more

11

restrictive scheme or that Michigan law in any way

12

incapacitates or significantly interferes with the

13

business of banking.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, if, if -- if the

15

banks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go

16

through two rounds of bank inspection every year instead

17

of one round, it is going to cost them something.

18

Regulation costs the regulated entity something.

19

a burden on them.

20

It is

And we also have to assume that there may be

21

instances -- you brought it up -- in, in which the, the

22

-- the State burden is heavier.

23

possibilities in mind, can you think of any reason why

24

Congress in authorizing the exercise of the Federal

25

banking power through a subsidiary would have

So with those

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contemplated Michigan or any State would have this

2

authority?

3

It seems counterintuitive to me.

They're

4

saying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise

5

the Federal banking power through a subsidiary.

6

would seem strange to me that Congress would silently

7

say, "and, of course, we acquiesce to a -- a dual system

8

of regulation that would not apply to the bank itself."

9
10

It

What reason would Congress have had for
assuming that might be the result?

11

MR. BLANCHARD:

A recognition that the

12

States have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate

13

interest in regulating those corporations that it

14

charters and that do business within its borders.

15

-- and that that balance should be respected.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

So it is state sovereign

17

immunity in effect, is the answer -- State sovereignty

18

is rather the answer?

19
20

MR. BLANCHARD:

and I would like to reserve whatever time I may have.

21
22
23

But the - but the key point,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You better hurry

then.
MR. BLANCHARD:

The key, the key point is

24

that Congress has distinguished clearly and

25

unequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it has not included affiliates in either Section 481 or

2

484 of the National Bank Act.

3

National banks are not synonymous or

equivalent to the State-chartered operating

5

subsidiaries.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG

9

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Blanchard.

MR. LONG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

12

I would like to start with the question that

13

Justice Souter asked because there are some important

14

principles that are really not disputed in this case,

15

and I think they help to focus the issue that is before

16

the Court.

17

There is no dispute, as we understand it,

18

that mortgage lending by national banks is supervised

19

exclusively by the Comptroller of the Currency.

20

there is also no dispute that national banks' incidental

21

powers under Section 247 include the power to make

22

mortgage loans through a operating subsidiary.

23

additional point is that both Federal statutes and

24

Federal regulations state that when national banks make

25

mortgage loans or exercise their banking powers through
25

you a question.

has branch banks all over the country.

7

generally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the

8

bank?

9

I just want to understand.

MR. LONG:

Wachovia

has a particular status under Section 36 of the National

I'm

asking a factual question.

I understand that.

It would not be separately

So -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They are actually

divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?

18

MR. LONG:

Well, I think they are generally

19

referred to as branches but I think its would be more a

20

division.

21

That would be JUSTICE STEVENS:

At least they are not

22

separate corporate subsidiaries.

23

MR. LONG:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

That -- that Why is that, that the Best

bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

business, rather than the more traditional banking

2

approach.

3

MR. LONG:

Well, of course, anything that a

4

bank does through an operating subsidiary it could do

5

through the bank.

6

But there are many reasons why a bank may choose an

7

operating subsidiary.

8

it's -- just sometimes works better as matter of

9

business management.

10
11

They can be managerial reasons;

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It protects from

liability, too.

12
13

It can always do it through the bank.

MR. LONG:

Well, that is one of the reasons.

Although -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MR. LONG:

-- in the district.

I will say, Justice Stevens, I

16

have not been able to find examples of national bank

17

operating subsidiaries that have become insolvent.

18

are regulated very heavily by the Comptroller and so

19

they don't.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They

But you have a

21

subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that

22

presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage

23

lending business that are not associated with national

24

banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the

25

regulation that their competitors are subject to.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that right?

2

MR. LONG:

Well, but again, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, the national banks compete.

4

--

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And its undisputed

And that's fine, and

6

they have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says

7

they're, they're exempt from regulation.

8

is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national

9

bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies

The question

10

is immune from the regulation that those other

11

companies -

12

MR. LONG:

But again, Mr. Chief Justice,

13

thrifts, S&Ls, State-Chartered banks in all 50 States

14

are permitted to have operating subsidiaries.

15

recognized not just for national banks, but really for

16

all types of banking institutions, that are operating

17

subsidiaries are a useful tool of banking.

18

a sort of special privilege that's given -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's

This is not

Justice Breyer's

20

questions were pointing out, to the extent your

21

regulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary

22

conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going

23

to prevail.

24

immune from State regulation across the board -

25

The question is whether or not you are

MR. LONG:

Well, and you asked that
28

question.

2

first about national banks and then about the operating

subsidiaries.

4

laws that apply to national banks.

5

I mean, I think it might be useful to think

It is not true that there are no State

is the clearest statement of the principle.

involved here?

examination by the regulator.

19

some that are not directly at issue in this case -

20

You have to

There are substantive laws; Michigan has

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of those laws

21

might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're

22

issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them

23

a disclosure about how much they're going to end up

24

paying over the life of the loan and all that.

25

require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in

And they

Michigan.

2

Could that law be applied to your subsidiary?
MR. LONG:

Well, the question, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, would be is it preempted as to the national

4

bank?

5

But the issue in this case is if it is preempted as to

6

the national bank, then it is also preempted when the

7

national bank chooses to exercise this power that it has

8

under Section 24 -

9

The Comptroller of the Currency would say yes.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't -- isn't your

10

friend correct then?

11

cake and eat it, too.

12

without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that.

13

But you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary

14

and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to

15

other people.

16

MR. LONG:

You are really trying to have your
You're saying if we did this

Well, but it, it with respect, it

17

is not really a case of having our cake and eating it,

18

too.

19

And the Court has recognized for a century that in that

20

area, when national banks have powers, including

21

incidental powers recognized by the Comptroller, they

22

generally preempt any State law that prevents or

23

significantly interferes -

24
25

We are in the area of powers of national banks.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the question I had.

I got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question,
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab,

2

that those things that are preempted are those things

3

that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words

4

limit, the Federal powers of a national bank.

5

MR. LONG:

That, that is correct.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I thought we were

7

basically dealing with conflict -

8

MR. LONG:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

10

MR. LONG:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- not fielding.

It's -- that's one level But -- but the last part of

12

the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to

13

a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply

14

to the parent bank.

15

preemption.

16

preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the

17

case of a national bank?

18

And I began to think it fields

Am I right in thinking that it is conflict

MR. LONG:

Well -- it's, it's a very

19

important point.

And our position is there are actually

20

several ways in which you could analyze this case and

21

arrive at the conclusion that the Comptroller's

22

regulations are valid.

23

statutory language and saying we would, we the Court

24

would reach this result as we did in the Franklin

25

National Bank case even without any regulation.

One is looking simply at

31
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

second of all is to say the regulations are a reasonable

2

interpretation of the statute.

3

the Comptroller has broad rulemaking authority.

4

this Court recognized in De La Cuesta and many other

5

cases, an agency exercising its rulemaking authority can

6

preempt State laws even though the statute itself would

7

not -

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A third is to say that
And as

I think, the question is

not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the

10

rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic

11

division of the statute into a national bank and

12

affiliates of the national bank.

13

clear distinction between the two.

14

what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to

15

eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't

16

matter.

17

MR. LONG:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The statute makes a
And the effect of

No. It -- I If you are an affiliate of

19

a national bank, you have the same immunity that the

20

national bank has.

21

That's not what the statute says.

MR. LONG:

I have a two-part answer to that

22

question, Justice Scalia.

One is that Section 484 of

23

the section you're referring to does limit the

24

visitorial authority as to national banks, but it is

25

silent as to operating subsidiaries or any other type of
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

affiliate.

2

some affiliates of national banks.

3

Operating subsidiaries are a special type of affiliate;

4

484, which was enacted during the Civil War, a hundred

5

years before operating subsidiaries were authorized,

6

really doesn't address the question of visitorial

7

authority.

8
9

States do exercise visitorial authority over

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's established.

I mean, an operating

subsidiary is an affiliate, right?

What kind of

10

affiliates did they have before they had operating

11

subsidiaries?

Did they rent pool halls, or what?

12

MR. LONG:

It's a type of affiliate -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would have thought that

14

any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged

15

in essentially banking business.

16

MR. LONG:

But, but this really became

17

clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my

18

answer.

19

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this

20

question of affiliates of national banks.

21

on page 2A of our appendix.

22

new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial

23

subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature.

24

So they can actually engage in activities that the

25

parent national bank could not.

In 1999 when Congress enacted the

And this is

It refers to, it created a

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But if you look at the bottom of page 2A of

2

our appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it

3

said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in

4

activities that are permitted for national banks to

5

engage in directly, subject to the same terms and

6

conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by

7

a national bank.

8
9

And then at the bottom of 3A and going over
to 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries,

10

they do so by distinguishing them from the operating

11

subsidiaries which had existed for decades.

12

top of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again

13

engages only in activities that the national banks may

14

engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same

15

terms and conditions.

16

And at the

Then if you'll bear with me a moment longer,

17

on page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions

18

of GLBA -- actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act,

19

GLBA people call it -- said -- this is on 12A -- that

20

securities activities and insurance activities,

21

activities that have been traditionally subject to State

22

regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally

23

regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a

24

financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by

25

relevant State securities authorities or State insurance
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authorities.

2

So Congress was actually quite specific.

3

I mean, your question is about statutory language.

You

4

don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century

5

old, doesn't really get into this.

6

statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks.

7

Congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's

8

insurance, it can be regulated by States.

9

specific about that.

But in this 1999

They were

If it's a banking activity that

10

the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same

11

terms and conditions.

12

And so, going back to the Chief

13

Justice's question, you have this question of would it

14

be a preempted State preempted state law if it were

15

applied to the national bank when the national bank is

16

making a mortgage loan.

17

preempted because not every State law conflicts.

18

it does -

19

Not every State law is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if

What authority

20

do you have for the proposition that when then Federal

21

law says subject to the same terms and conditions that

22

they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the

23

same Federal regulation that applies to the national

24

banks?

25

MR. LONG:

Well, I mean, we have section
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

7.4006, which is the 0CC's regulation interpreting that

2

language in the statute and in its own OPSUB

3

regulations, section 5.34.

4

the ordinary meaning of "terms and conditions."

5

means prerequisites, limitations.

6
7

And we also relied simply on

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. LONG:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

Was 7.4006 issued

pursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA?

8

10

It

GLBA?
Yes.

Or did it

predate that?
MR. LONG:

7.4006 was issued pursuant to

12

24-7, which is this incidental powers provision, and

13

24(a), which I've just been walking you through, which

14

is a provision of GLBA.

15

GLBA, and it is an interpretation of the same terms and

16

conditions language.

17

So it is based partly upon

JUSTICE BREYER:

Conflict preemption

18

basically strikes down a State law that stands as an

19

obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.

20

MR. LONG:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, with that

22

in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or

23

34.4(a)(B). Neither existed.

24

the agency said as a Court and they explained how the

25

regulation worked.

But we listened to what

Would you expect to come to
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

precisely the same result?

2

MR. LONG:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. LONG:

5

makes the case easier, of course.

6
7
8
9

Well, I mean, of course Would you or not?

We do have them and we think that

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know, but would you -

would you expect to come to the same result or not?
MR. LONG:

Yes.

We would say that if you

start with 24-7 and the incidental powers of national

10

banks and the undisputed point that one of those

11

incidental powers is for the national bank -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How does it conflict

13

with Federal banking authority for the State to audit

14

the books of the mortgage subsidiary?

since the beginning of the national banking system

17

that -- and this goes back to the history of the first

I'm trying to get a handle on

As I understood the case that came, I don't think

MR. LONG:

That an agency and not the -

16

certainly the Delaquesta line of cases stand for the

17

proposition that if an agency has preempted State law by

18

regulation, the questions are simply whether the agency

19

has acted within the scope of its delegated authority

and whether it is a reasonable accommodation of the

21

conflicting principles and whether there's any reason to

think that Congress would have disagreed with it.

SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS

2
3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

4

Let me begin by addressing this question of

5

whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or

6

field preemption.

7

those terms.

8

preemption, not field preemption, in the following

9

sense.

Now, it depends on how one defines

But as we understand it it's conflict

Our position is not that State laws have no

10

application to operating subsidiaries or to national

11

banks for that matter.

12

the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would

13

to national banks.

14

the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State

15

laws do apply to national banks and operating

16

subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State

17

contract law would be an example.

18

subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with

19

corporate governance questions, for example the process

20

of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and

21

things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal

22

law doesn't control those sorts of aspects.

It's that State laws apply to

2

field preemption with respect to regulation, correct?

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But you're claiming

Well, I guess it depends on

4

the degree to which the regulations apply to the

5

national banks.

6

laws apply to the same extent to the operating

7

subsidiary as to the national bank.

8
9
10

That's my only point, is that State

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

State laws generally

-- State agencies generally don't regulate national
banks at all, right?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

State agencies don't

12

generally do that because there's a specific statutory

13

prohibition on that.

14

your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12

15

U.S.C. 484(a) and 481.

16

say by their terms that visitorial authority resides

17

exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with

18

respect to national banks, and there's another provision

19

that deals with affiliates.

20

And Justice Scalia, this goes to

It's true that those provisions

And so that's the point with visitorial

21

authority.

But visitorial authority by its very nature

22

is asserted in service of and enforcement of some

23

underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying

24

substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement

25

that operating subsidiaries register with the State.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And so there's a question of conflict preemption that

2

applies both to the national bank and the operating

3

subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive

4

registration requirement could be applied to the

5

national bank or could be applied to the operating

6

subsidiary.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but it is true, is it

8

not, that as long as this mortgage company was a

9

subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank

10

itself, the State would have done the visiting, the

11

visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal

12

Government assumed that responsibility?

13

MR. SRINIVASAN:

14

Well, I don't know what you

mean by "holding company," Justice Stevens.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, as your co-counsel

16

pointed out, previously this very company was a

17

subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the

18

bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by

19

Michigan.

20

MR. SRINIVASAN:

That's right, because it

21

wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered

22

national bank.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And the change in the

24

corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now

25

it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?
44

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It is, but it's changing

way.

5

That's that it's no owned and controlled by a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But this results in field

6

preemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial

7

power is a regulatory function?

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:
how one defines those terms.

Well, again it depends on
And I don't take issue

10

with the fact that as a consequence of the fact that

11

this became a subsidiary -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it is now only the

13

Federal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used

14

to be only the State agency?

15

MR. SRINIVASAN:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's right.
And the question that led

17

me to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ

18

when it took over this area for 48 States?

19
20
21
22
23

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I don't have an

empirical answer to that question.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it was certainly quite

a few people, I assume.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

But Justice Stevens, in the

24

regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of

25

these rules OCC specifically addressed the question
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether it had sufficient resources to exercise

2

oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of

3

national banks.

4

OCC previously had no authority over operating

5

subsidiaries.

6

exclusive authority over operating subsidiaries.

7

the OCC determined in the regulatory materials that it

8

had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority

9

over operating subsidiaries -

10

And let's be clear.

It's not that the

The question is whether the OCC has

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

But the authority under

11

the old regime was just to make sure that the operation

12

did not affect the financial stability of the parent

13

bank.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

But that's because it

15

wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered

16

national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental

17

way for the following reason:

18

Bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of

19

preemption that applies in the context of national

20

banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or

21

incidental powers of national banks -- and one

22

incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be

23

the power to conduct affairs through an operating

24

subsidiary -- that the grants of those powers are

25

normally preemptive of rather than preempted by State

And so once the operating -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That was an effort

of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging

4

in the activity, correct?

5
6
7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, that was.

But the

Court CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's an obvious

8

case of conflict preemption.

9

whether or not the State can regular the operating

10
11

Here we have a question of

subsidiary to any extent.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

But the Court's decisions

12

aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort.

13

two points in that regard.

14

this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary

15

can't engage in federally authorized activities unless

16

and until it gets the State's permission.

17

there is a prohibition at the outset.

18

importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to

19

situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your

20

Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case

21

that was a situation in which the national bank had the

22

power to accept savings deposits and the State law that

23

was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the

24

national bank from accepting savings deposits.

25

I'd make

First of all, in one sense

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So at least

But more

What comes next?

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Can the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't

2

really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a

3

subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so

4

we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to

5

this subsidiary?

6

Can it do that?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, not if you're talking

7

about corporate powers, because those are governed by

8

State law.

9

subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking,

What it could do, though, is regulate the

10

because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one

11

purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out

12

functions that the national bank itself could perform.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What troubles me, and maybe

14

you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is

15

that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is

16

the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very

17

clear that there is visitation power to national banks

18

and makes it very clear that there is not for

19

subsidiaries.

20

And here is a regulation which under the

21

guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the

22

national bank simply eliminates that distinction.

23

it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency

24

regulation is allowed to do.

25

MR. SRINIVASAN:

With respect,

within its field of vision the notion that a national

16
17
18

But another point is that at the time these

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why should we assume

that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Because what Congress was

19

trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive

20

visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of

21

national bank function.

22

these statutes were enacted, the only play that national

23

bank functions were being conducted was by a national

bank itself.

25

states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to

Now later on, when the laws of all 50

49
Alderson Reporting Company

2

authority to conduct national -- to conduct bank

3

functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue

4

arises about who exercises visitorial authority with

5

respect to the conduct of those functions for a

6

subsidiary.

7

baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of

8

national bank functions through a national bank itself,

9

the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a

And it stands to reason that if the

10

national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to

conduct those very same functions through an operating

12

subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise,

13

would be exclusive.

14

reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller,

15

and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that

speaks directly to that issue and that in any way

precludes the comptroller from reaching that

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I

don't know about this particular case but there

absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they

And the reason that

a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of

structure rather than folding the enterprise into the

5

efficiency purposes because you can have focused

management, especially when you're dealing with the sort

7

of specialized things that operating subsidiaries

typically do.

9

And in part it's for

But there's also other reasons.

For

10

sense that the best specialized functions such as

11

12

purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may

13

be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much

14

more straightforward to do that if those functions are

15

maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is there any aspect

17

of state law, including liability limitation, that they

18

want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary

19

chartered under state law, Michigan or another state,

20

and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state

21

regulations?

22

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, with respect to

23

liability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I

24

should clarify that veil piercing principles and things

25

of that sort would be governed by state law with respect
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the operating subsidiary.

So if the question is

2

whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would

3

dictate an answer to that question.

4

But, may I just finish one thought?

5

States won't have an incentive to liberally

6

construe veil piercing principles with respect to

7

national banks precisely because state member banks in

8

all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through

9

which they charter banks to conduct banking functions.
