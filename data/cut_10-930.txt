General Horne.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. HORNE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. HORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to start picking up on a question

10
11

asked by Justice Ginsburg on the Rees case.

12

The Rees case is pre-AEDPA.

13

Congress had in mind when it passed AEDPA, the

14

Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, it is

15

that the death penalty process needs to be speeded up,

16

and habeas should not result in undue delays to give

17

effect --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If there is one thing that

You -- you don't think that

19

AEDPA would alter the outcome of Rees?

20

Rees would come out the other way after AEDPA?

21

MR. HORNE:

Do you think

Well, I think that Rees didn't

22

really deal with our issue, which is competence to -- to

23

aid counsel.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. HORNE:

That's a different point.

Yes, I agree, Your Honor, but I

Alderson Reporting Company

1

thought it -- it would be relevant to point out that it

2

was pre-AEDPA.

3

And then, on that point, this Court has said

4

several times that habeas should not be used to grant

5

indefinite stays.

6

the Barefoot case, this Court said that habeas is not a

7

time to retry a case and even less is it a time to grant

8

indefinite stays.

9

In fact, there -- even pre-AEDPA, in

So the sentence with, "even less," followed

10

the sentence with, "not."

11

that it should grant permanent stays.

12

So it was even less than not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me how you define

13

indefinite stays, meaning are you okay with the six

14

months to a year stay, for a court to try to get someone

15

back to competence, assuming that there is a claim in

16

which the defendant's information is necessary?

17

MR. HORNE:

Yes, Your Honor.

We agree with

18

the Ohio position.

19

Psychiatric brief, I think it's page 10, note 20, they

20

said that up to 90 percent of the cases are solved in 6

21

to 9 months.

22

standard of no more than a year for the successive

23

stays, that would give some guidance to the courts.

24
25

In the -- in the American

And I think that, if this Court set a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do you deal with

Justice Kagan's earlier question of what difference does
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it make if the person's still necessary -- or the

2

information -- potential information is still necessary,

3

what makes it unnecessary after a year?

4

MR. HORNE:

Because I think the -- the

5

consequence of AEDPA is that a balance has to be drawn

6

between the fact that there has to be finality.

7

fact, the -- this Court has said the purposes of AEDPA

8

include finality, comity, federalism, and reduction of

9

delays in death sentence cases.

In

There needs to be a

10

balance between that and the -- the need to have a

11

competent defendant, if we can have one, in a case where

12

the testimony is necessary.

13

This Court has said several times -- I was

14

going to mention also the Heinze case, where this Court

15

thinks that -- very clearly, that stays cannot be

16

indefinite.

17

for this Court to give a guideline to the courts and say

18

the way to balance this is that, if they get the time in

19

which 90 percent of the cases are -- are --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -- so I think it would be very helpful

But those cases didn't

21

establish a limit on how long states needed to take to

22

adjudicate claims.

23

should put in conditions that move things along --

24
25

They just said a district court

MR. HORNE:

Yes.

That's correct,

Your Honor.
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that -- that require

2

defendants to press their claims within a reasonable

3

time that required periodic updates, that required

4

monitoring by the court, but it didn't set an artificial

5

end time.

6

stay and not give conditions to comply with.

7

this be treated differently?

8
9

It just said you can't just do an open-ended

MR. HORNE:

Why should

Your Honor, we think it would be

helpful -- and we agree with Ohio on this -- we think it

10

would be helpful if the Court gave some kind of a

11

standard, so that there would be some guidance and

12

uniformity, and so that -- so that courts did not get

13

around this Court's --

14
15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
define that standard?
MR. HORNE:

How -- how would you

What standard do you suggest?
The standard we would suggest

17

would be that -- that 6 to -- 6 to 9 months would be the

18

standard, and certainly no more than a year; that it

19

would be in months and not years, including not just the

20

first stay, but any successive stays.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. HORNE:

In all cases.

23

where a stay was appropriate.

24

case, no stay is appropriate.

25

In all cases?

JUSTICE BREYER:

In all cases

Now, in the record-based

What if the -- it might be

unusual, but you can't try a person who's not competent.

2

You can't try him.

3

MR. HORNE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what about -- and now,

5

he's been tried, and he's been convicted and been

6

appealed and gone through the procedures.

7

could arise where, in habeas, they made like a prima

8

facie showing or a -- convinced the judge that there

9

really is a very good chance here, or maybe even I think

But some case

10

it's probable that the basic trial was unfair, to the

11

point where it's like not having a trial.

12

What about in that situation, if it ever

13

arises?

14

that possibility?

15

I mean, should we leave the door open just for

MR. HORNE:

I think the answer to that is

16

no, Your Honor, because the assumption -- once -- once

17

the conviction has occurred, the presumptions shift.

19

the defendant.

I'm -- that's what's worrying me in the back of

MR. HORNE:

There have

6

and it becomes the burden of the petitioner to overturn

Sorry.
If there is a time limit --

if there is a time limit of 6 to 9 months --

14

MR. HORNE:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- at what point does it

16

begin to run?

17

petitioner moves for a stay, even if no effort was made

18

prior to that to restore the petitioner to competency?

19

Does it begin to run at the time when the

MR. HORNE:

I would believe the time would

20

begin to run with the treatment because the basis for

21

the 6 to 9 months was what was in the amicus brief

22

against us by the American Psychiatric Association

23

indicating that, in 6 to 9 months, almost 90 percent of

24

the cases are cured.

25

basis to suggest a standard to the Court.

So we -- we needed to have some

8

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, but my question is this:

2

Suppose that no effort has been made by counsel to

3

provide -- to obtain treatment for the petitioner to

4

restore the petitioner to competency prior to the point

5

when a motion is made to stay the proceeding.

6

to -- month period would still begin to run at the time

7

when the motion for the stay is made?

8

to run at some earlier point or some later point?

9

MR. HORNE:

The 6

Or would it begin

Your Honor, I would think, if

10

the motion is made and the other requirements are shown,

11

that it -- that the prisoner's testimony is essential,

12

then -- and that it's not a record-based case, then I

13

would think the 6 to 9 months would begin to run when

14

treatment begins because that's our basis for the

15

standard we are suggesting.

16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When treatment

begins after some sort of initial hearing, right?

18

MR. HORNE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

19

When the court -- if the court grants the

20

motion for the temporary stay, and presumably treatment

21

would begin right away, or perhaps treatment has been

22

ongoing, but from that point on, we suggest a 6 to 9

23

months standard.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In which cases would you

say the defendant's ability to assist counsel is
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

necessary?

On what issues?

You say that -- that if --

2

the assistance has to be necessary to a fair

3

adjudication.

4

MR. HORNE:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

Yes, Your Honor.
In what cases would that

be so?

7

MR. HORNE:

We have difficulty coming up

8

with cases at that stage of the proceeding, Your Honor,

9

because presumably the information the prisoner would

10

have would be known to others, especially if it's newly

11

discovered evidence, that would typically be from

12

outside, such as a -- somebody admitting -- somebody

13

else admitting to the crime, DNA evidence, something of

14

that sort.

15

It -- it appears to us highly unlikely that

16

the prisoner has information that he didn't disclose

17

earlier when he was competent in the state proceedings

18

and in the post-conviction proceedings at the state

19

level, so we think it would be very, be a very rare

20

case, Your Honor.

21

But we are prepared to admit that, if a

22

showing were made that his testimony is necessary, that

23

a 6 to 9 month temporary stay be granted, as long as --

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why is it -- I don't

mean to be nit-picking, but why is it 6 to 9 months?
10

Alderson Reporting Company

8

months -- I mean, why isn't it 6 months?

2

I don't understand why there's --

3
4

MR. HORNE:

We had to find something to

suggest to the Court, and so we took it out of the --

5
6

Or 9 months?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
months?

So 6 months?

Or 9

7

What does it mean to be 6 to 9 months?
MR. HORNE:

Oh, I agree, Your Honor.

Then

8

it should be 9 months because that's the point at which

9

the American Psychiatric Association says almost

10

90 percent of the cases are solved.

11
12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
after 9 months, then what?

13

MR. HORNE:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

And if it isn't solved

Then the case proceeds -If competency cannot be

restored?

16

MR. HORNE:

Correct, Your Honor, then the --

17

then the case proceeds, which was the --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. HORNE:

Based on the record.

Based on the record -- well, if

20

it's record based, there should be no continuance at

21

all.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't really

23

understand why the American Psychiatric Association said

24

6 to 9 months, too.

No, we don't, Your Honor.

We --

6

we're just suggesting there should be a guideline, and

7

we had to find some basis for the guideline.

Because they are not

They are psychiatrists.

10

MR. HORNE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what happens if, after

13

9 months, mental health experts come in and they say

14

there's a 90 percent chance of restoring the petitioner

15

to competency in another 9 months or another 3 months or

16

another month.

17

MR. HORNE:

Your Honor, we're suggesting

18

that the Court should draw a line to guide the other

19

courts, so that -- so that -- because once you allow one

20

additional period, there can be successive additional

21

periods, and then it becomes an indefinite stay.

22
23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

I mean -- sorry.

I

didn't mean to say it in that particular tone.

stays, but AEDPA circumscribe -- circumscribes that

discretion, and so I think this Court needs to give

guidance to the courts as to the -JUSTICE BREYER:

10

You mean it shouldn't be

indefinite. The object of this is you're trying to give

12

the moment, you're trying to produce a hearing that will

14

reach a result with this witness.

15

after a reasonable period of time, that witness will

recover and be available, fine.

And if you think,

suggestion is -- is that the Court give a guideline.

understand Your Honor's position.

22

I

I do want to save some time for rebuttal.

23

just wanted to make one quick point about this -- that

24

the -- that the witness has to be essential to the case

25

being made.

It was suggested in the Ohio case that -13

Alderson Reporting Company

I

1

that if there were a possibility that he could be

2

helpful, that that would be sufficient.

3

But the -- the American Psychiatric

4

Association and the ABA both agree that there has to be

5

a particularized and substantial case made that the

6

witness is necessary or -- or they also use the word

7

"essential or necessary," and we think that that -- that

8

standard should prevail.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

The United States agrees with Ohio and

Arizona on the general framework for when no stay is

allowed and for when a limited stay is allowed in

22

Federal post-conviction proceedings.

23

provide the Court with a practical example of how a

24

limited stay might work, since that seems to have been

25

of some concern.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

I'd like to

Official

1

An analogous Federal statute is 18 U.S.C.,

2

Section 4241, the Federal competency hearing statute

3

that the Court cited or provided a CF citation to in

4

Rees.

5

court determines competency for a prisoner to stand

6

trial and could provide a framework for how a district

7

court should proceed with competency hearing in a case

8

where it would be appropriate.

That provides the framework for how a district

9

Under Section 4241, the criminal defendant,

10

if he is found incompetent, the district court may give

11

an initial period of up to 4 months for him to be

12

treated to determine whether he can come back to

13

competency.

14

If he cannot regain his competency at the

15

end of that 4-month period, then the court can grant an

16

additional reasonable extension of that time if the

17

doctors say that there is a reasonable probability that

18

this prisoner can be restored to competence.

19

That could provide a framework, if that's

20

what this Court is looking to do, for showing district

21

courts how they could enter a limited stay.

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, what's a reasonable

extension?

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Another 4 months?

months?
MS. O'CONNELL:

I think we agree on the

outer end that -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I was with you.

It seemed

5

to me you had something really, really clear and solid,

6

until you said, "reasonable extension."

7

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, but this is what

8

district courts do.

They do it whenever a competency

9

motion is filed in a Federal criminal trial, and we

10

agree with the -- the outside limit of about a year.

11

depends on the -- the interests at stake -- the

12

interests at stake in the state in proceeding with its

13

judgment and the interests in finality and whether the

14

doctors think that there's actually a chance that this

15

prisoner could be restored to competence if they work a

16

little harder.

17

It

If the -- if the evidence is crucial or

18

necessary or there's some indication that we want to --

19

to work hard to get this information from the prisoner,

20

we would go for a little bit longer.

21

that attempt to restore the prisoner to competency has

22

to end and the -- and the proceedings should move

23

forward based on the best evidence that's available.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But at some point,

But, Ms. O'Connell, where

does that outer limit come from?

You suggested looking

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to that statute as an analogy, but there would be no

2

outer limit in application of that statute, would there?

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

There's not.

But -- but at

4

some point, we do give up, and the district courts have

5

discretion to determine how long that would be, and --

6

and, again, we -- we propose an outer limit of about a

7

year, but it's up to the district court in that

8

particular circumstance, to see how hard they want to

9

work to try to get that evidence into the proceeding.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

Is that any different from

what the defendants are arguing here?

12

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They're saying, you know,

14

give a -- give a temporary stay and extend it as long

15

as -- as you need to.

16

MS. O'CONNELL:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19

Well, the -So you're taking their

position.
MS. O'CONNELL:

No.

The difference between

20

our position and that position is that if, after a

21

reasonable period of time, the prisoner cannot be

22

restored to competence, the claim should move forward

23

without him, using the best evidence that's available.

24

That's because, when we arrive at

25

post-conviction proceedings, we have a conviction and a
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sentence that have been affirmed on direct appeal and


2

are presumed to be valid, and although it's a valid


3

consideration for the district court to take into


4

account whether the prisoner is competent and could


5

assist his counsel has a role in these proceedings,

6

there's no right for the prisoner to be competent during

7

the post-conviction proceedings.

outer limit should be presumptively about a year.

not to say that the United --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's

17

very narrow range of cases because I take it your

opportunity to present an ineffective assistance of

11

something that -- if the lawyer has something that he

12

wants the prisoner's assistance with or may need

13

testimony from -- from the prisoner, we think the

14

district court has discretion to allow a stay -- a

15

limited stay to allow the prisoner to regain his

16

competence.

17
18
19

And in those circumstances, if he has

But -JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's not limited to cases

where the review is restricted to the record?
MS. O'CONNELL:

Right.

In those cases, we

20

think that no stay is appropriate, that it would be an

21

abuse of discretion to enter a stay.

22

tolerate delay without a justification, and if it's a

23

record-based claim, like a state prisoner, where he's

24

barred by Section 2254(d) in Pinholster from bringing in

25

new evidence and that the review is strictly limited to
19

Alderson Reporting Company

AEDPA doesn't

Official

1

the state court record, then there is no role for the

2

prisoner to play.

3

And it would be an abuse of discretion for

4

the district court to stay the proceedings in an effort

5

to bring him back.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What is the standard

proceedings?

We've heard a number of them, plausible
Which --

10

which -- what is the government's position on the

11

appropriate standard?

12

MS. O'CONNELL:

We -- we think that the

district court has discretion to grant a stay when the

14

prisoner's participation could be -- he could provide a

15

useful source of evidence or guidance in the

proceedings.

examples, and -- you know, I'm not doing very well,

2

quite honestly.

3

So what's your best one?

MS. MARQUEZ:

Well, in our particular case,

4

we -- we raise several claims in habeas -- in habeas

5

proceedings.

6

sentencing claims.

7

clients that, at their direction, they choose not to --

8

not to pursue or do not want to pursue sentencing claims

9

and want to only pursue guilt claims.

We raise guilt claims, and we also raise
And it is often the case with our

record.

all-encompassing decision that a client needs to make as

15

to the ultimate outcome of his or her case.

So that is a huge,

Well, that is that

you're -- that seems like almost a due process argument,

that in every single case, you have to grant a stay.

You're -- you're parting from the Respondent in Carter,

20

and you are making a broader argument.

21

MS. MARQUEZ:

Well, no, Your Honor, where it

22

does -- just an example of where, if there is a client

23

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No incompetent client,

me, are you saying that, in every single case, the

2

client is entitled to a stay?

3
4

MS. MARQUEZ:

No, Your Honor, we're not

saying in every single case.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why does that

6

situation give you an entitlement, if it's not in every

7

single case?

8
9

MS. MARQUEZ:

The -- that situation goes

with the ABA guidelines and what an attorney's duties

10

are to maintain communication with the client.

And

11

that's just but one reason why we need a -- a competent

12

client.

But to answer your question --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

If the client

14

is incompetent, you -- you bring both claims, right?

15

You -- you both -- you both challenge the guilt, and you

16

challenge the sentence.

MS. MARQUEZ:

incompetent.

19

to do so, we would.

That -- that is if a client is

I suppose, if that's -- if we were forced

it -- it is unfair to prevent -- to stop everything, so

22

that the client can tell you not to bring one of those

23

things?

I don't know why that's unfair.

Treatment stopped because

Because he had back pain.

And

Well, so how -- what

General, could I ask you,

you have been arguing on two different axes.

18

tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all,

and the other is what limits there should be on how long

20

a stay can be if a stay is warranted.

21

One is how

And I'm just curious, if I forced you to

22

prioritize, in terms of the state's interests in

But I
