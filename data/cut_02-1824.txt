CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument first


4

this morning in No. 02-1824, Doug Dretke v. Michael Wayne


5

Haley.


6

Mr. Cruz.


7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ


8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


9
10

MR. CRUZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:


11

This case concerns the continuing vitality of the


12

procedural default rule, an important bulwark to federalism,


13

comity, and finality of judgments.

14

consistently maintained that cause and prejudice can address


15

problems with procedural default, and that the actual


16

innocence exception should be applicable only in exceedingly


17

rare cases.


18

This Court has


QUESTION: Can -- can you tell me -- I don't want


19

to derail the argument -- you've conceded that this sentence


20

is unlawful?


21

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Kennedy.


22

QUESTION: Well, then why are you here?

Don't -­


23

is there some rule that you can't confess error in your


24

state or?


25

MR. CRUZ: No, Justice Kennedy, but the state is


3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

here, because the state is concerned about the impact on the


2

procedural default rule, in particular the Fifth Circuit's


3

decision.


4

QUESTION: Well, so a man does 15 years so you can


5

vindicate your legal point in some other case?

6

don't understand why you don't dismiss this case and move to


7

lower the sentence.


I -- I just


8

MR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default -­


9

QUESTION: And I'd say the same for the Government


10

of the United States.


11

MR. CRUZ: Implicit in the procedural default rule


12

is the premise that petitioner has a valid claim.

13

some ways this case, as the Fifth Circuit remarked, as the


14

judges dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc, in some


15

ways this case presents an usually pristine form, I mean,


16

it's almost a law school hypothetical, because the error is


17

so clean.

In -- in


There's a 3-day disparity -­


18

QUESTION: At -- at the prisoner's expense.


19

MR. CRUZ: But that is inherent in any claim with


20
21

procedural default.

QUESTION: No, but it's not a -- it's not a -- as


22

if there's some new trial and -- and it's in doubt.

23

very clear he should not be in jail for, like what, 12, 14,


24

15 more years.


25

It's


MR. CRUZ: It is very clear that there was an


4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

error, and that if Mr. Haley had raised the error at trial,


2

that the trail judge would have and should have sustained -­


3

QUESTION: But is it -­


4

QUESTION: Well -­


5

QUESTION: -- not also very clear that he's going


6

to spend over 10 year in jail when he shouldn't spend 10


7

years in jail?


8
9
10

MR. CRUZ: It is clear that he will spend 10 years

in jail when he had an objection he could have raised that

he did not.


11

QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but -- but if


12

the law were followed and everything went perfectly, he


13

would spend less than 2 or -- what is it, 2 or 3 years?


14

MR. CRUZ: Two years would be the max.


15

QUESTION: And he's going to spend 16 years in


16

jail, is that right?


17

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Stevens.


18

QUESTION: Now, is that just, do you think?


19

MR. CRUZ: Maintaining the procedural default rule


20
21
22
23

is --

QUESTION: I understand that you want to preserve

the procedures, but do you think justice is being done?

MR. CRUZ: I think justice is being done because he


24

had a full and fair trial and an opportunity to raise his


25

errors, and there's no greater -­


5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: Well, let me ask you this.

Why -- why


2

isn't there still an inadequate assistance of counsel claim


3

out there, and why shouldn't the court address that before


4

it gets into the question that it dealt with?


5

MR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think there is a


6

very strong argument that there was inadequate assistance of


7

counsel.


8
9

QUESTION: Well, why don't we vacate and remand and

let them deal with that?


10

MR. CRUZ: Justice O'Connor, I think that is


11

something that is open to the Court to do and I think that


12

is one of the fundamental problems with what the district


13

court did.


14

QUESTION: You don't think that that claim was


15

waived here?

16

you?


17
18
19
20
21

You don't urge us to make that finding, do


MR. CRUZ: There is an argument that it was waived,

but I think the Fifth Circuit -­

QUESTION: Well, except the court below didn't

decide that question.

MR. CRUZ: And I think the Fifth Circuit could


22

certainly deem the petitioner's pleading sufficient to


23

preserve that claim.


24

QUESTION: Yeah, I would think so too.

25

QUESTION: Are you saying you won't -- you won't


6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

I can't -­


1

argue a waiver if it's sent back?


2
3

MR. CRUZ: If it's sent back, we would be prepared

to address the ineffective assistance claim on its merits.


4
5

QUESTION: And not raise any procedural impediment

to -­


6

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct.


7

QUESTION: The -- the -- another feature of this


8

case, what makes it so disturbing, is that the initial error


9

was the prosecutors, in -- when the prosecutor indicted him,


10

that indictment was incorrect, and then the rest followed,


11

relying on that original mistake of the prosecutor.

12

seems a -- really an ideal case for the prosecution to say,


13

we missed it, and then as a result of we -- what we, the


14

prosecutor missed, the court missed it, defense counsel


15

missed it, but it was our error and we should correct it.


16

So it


MR. CRUZ: And, Justice Ginsburg, this case may


17

well, if the Court finds ineffective assistance, that would


18

suffice to correct this, because ineffective assistance


19

counts as cause, and in many ways this case illustrates why


20

cause and prejudice is ample to address error in sentencing


21

in non-capital sentencing and why there's not a need to open


22

the door to a new category of exceptions to procedural


23

default.


24
25

QUESTION: Well, this defendant certainly raised -­

he raised the point in his pro se petition in the state


7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

court and he raised it in the Federal court, the ineffective


2

assistance, but nobody paid any attention to him.


3

MR. CRUZ: The -- the claim was denied in state


4

habeas and the Federal habeas court did not address it


5

because it had already granted relief based upon his claim


6

that he was actually innocent of the sentence.


7

QUESTION: Did the prosecutor suggest that maybe


8

the court should have dealt with it, because neither court


9

gave any reason for rejecting that claim?


10

MR. CRUZ: I -- the -- the district court jumped


11

ahead in the process.

12

prejudice, the district court said that it didn't need to


13

address cause and prejudice because it found actual


14

innocence, and that's one of the -- the significant


15

problems, much like statutory interpretation, where a court


16

should -­


17

Rather than address cause and


QUESTION: Mr. Cruz, let me -- let me make -- get


18

clear what -- what -- what your position is.

19

you'd be totally content if we don't resolve this question


20

that's before us about whether whenever there's a procedural


21

default that has clearly resulted and -- and with no


22

ineffective assistance of counsel, that has clearly resulted


23

in an injustice, you know, we -- we throw away all the


24

procedural rules.

25

and just send it back and say, well, before you get to that


You're --


You -- you don't want us to address that


8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

question, you have to resolve the cause and prejudice and


2

then leave -- leave dangling in the air the question, the


3

significant question, it seems to me, on which we granted


4

cert?


5

MR. CRUZ: Justice Scalia, the first preference of


6

the State of Texas is for the Court to address the circuit


7

split and to clarify that there is no actual innocence


8

exception to non-capital sentencing.

9

inclined to do so, the State of Texas, our second preferred


10

outcome is to vacate the decision of the Fifth Circuit so we


11

don't operate under that precedent.


12

If the Court is not


QUESTION: Why should we -- why should we not be


13

inclined to do so?

14

shouldn't reach?

15

jurisprudential striptease and decide this one case, leaving


16

open this question?

17

decide it.


18

Is it a constitutional question that we


I mean, do we have to do a sort of


I don't understand why we wouldn't


MR. CRUZ: And Texas is not urging the Court not to


19

decide it.

20

Court decide to decide -- to rule on this case in a more


21

narrow ground, that is an avenue that would provide some


22

relief to Texas because it would vacate the Fifth Circuit


23

decision and it would allow ultimately for some relief for


24

Mr. Haley as well.


25

It is simply saying that is an avenue should the


QUESTION: So you come back and fight another day?


9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

MR. CRUZ: Well, or perhaps someone else would

fight in a different circuit.


3

QUESTION: But if the court views this as a


4

preliminary question, a question that the Fifth Circuit and


5

any other Federal court should have reached logically before


6

it reached the question on which it decided the case -­


7

MR. CRUZ: Yes, Justice -­


8

QUESTION: -- then we should put the court back in


9
10

the position that it should have been in if it handled the

case correctly.


11

MR. CRUZ: Justice Ginsburg, we certainly agree


12

that as a matter of thinking through procedural default,


13

that courts should begin with cause and prejudice, that the


14

actual innocence exception as a potential trump card should


15

not be jumped to first.


16

QUESTION: Well, that just means it made two


17

mistakes.

18

did exist, it shouldn't have reached it first, okay?

19

should have reached it second.

20

two, according to you, is this theory doesn't exist anyway.


Number one, if this theory that you're opposing


Mistake one.

It


And number


21

MR. CRUZ: And -­


22

QUESTION: I don't see why it's more intelligent


23

for us to reach the first question than the second if -- if


24

there isn't any such thing as number one and number two.

25

the only one that exists is number one, it seems to me we


10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

If


1

should say so.


2

MR. CRUZ: And, Justice Scalia, I agree entirely


3

with your characterization of the errors made by the court


4

below.


5

QUESTION: May I ask this question?

I always


6

thought there was a manifest injustice exception to the


7

procedural default rule, and as I understand it, the


8

Government concedes there was injustice at the end of their


9

brief.

They say it's less significant, it's a less -­


10

qualitatively less significance than if you put an innocent


11

man to death.

12

injustice in this case?


13
14

MR. CRUZ: Justice Stevens, I -- I do not believe

it is.

It -- it is manifest that there was error -­


15
16

But is it not manifest that there was


QUESTION: Well, can you give me an example of when

manifest injustice would exist other than a death case?


17

MR. CRUZ: There are a host of instances in which


18

this Court has held that actual constitutional errors should


19

nonetheless not be addressed because the defendant has


20

procedurally defaulted that.


21

QUESTION: Well, I understand that, but is there


22

any -- any content to the manifest injustice exception in


23

your view?


24
25

MR. CRUZ: Absolutely there is.
case -­


11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

The paradigmatic


1

QUESTION: Well, give me an example.


2

MR. CRUZ: -- is an individual was is innocent of


3
4
5
6

the crime.

QUESTION: Well, he's innocent of the crime he's in

-- in prison for.

MR. CRUZ: He is innocent only in the most


7

technical of legal sense.

8

word, he committed the theft, he committed the predicate


9

felonies -­


10
11

In the ordinary sense of the


QUESTION: No, but if the law were followed, he

would have been released a long time ago, would he not?


12

MR. CRUZ: If he had raised his objection.


13

QUESTION: What -- what actually -- what was he


14

charged with, Mr. Cruz?

15

and what were the recidivist offenses?


16

What was the substantive offense


MR. CRUZ: He was charged with theft, and that was


17

enhanced to a state jail felony because he had committed two


18

prior thefts.

19

aggravated because he was a habitual offender and had two


20

prior felony convictions.

21

they were sequential and it turned out that allegation was


22

incorrect.


And then upon sentencing, his sentence was


Now, the indictment alleged that


23

QUESTION: Well -­


24

QUESTION: They -- they were sequential.

25

one followed another.

I mean,


Isn't what it comes down to is that


12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

he should have been -- he should have been given this longer


2

sentence for the second theft instead of for the third


3

theft?


4
5
6

MR. CRUZ: No, actually, Justice Scalia, the way

the statute reads -­

QUESTION: As I understand it, the -- the -- the


7

theft that -- that was used for recidivism occurred 3 days


8

after, right, the --


9
10

MR. CRUZ: It's a 3 -- it's a 3-day disparity.

The


first crime was delivery of amphetamines.


11

QUESTION: Yeah.


12

MR. CRUZ: And he committed that in 1988, but that


13

conviction did not become final until October 18th, 1991. 


14

Three days before October 18th, 1991, he committed attempted


15

robbery, and the way the Texas statute reads, he has to


16

commit the second felony after the first felony conviction


17

becomes final.


18
19
20

QUESTION: But why did the first felony take so

long to become final?

It took -- you say it took 3 years?


MR. CRUZ: It -- it did.

I don't know the extent


21

to which that was discovery in the trial, but that -- that's


22

ultimately what the record reveal in terms of when that


23

conviction -­


24
25

QUESTION: At -- at trial, do you think the

prosecutor would have, if he had noted this error, have the


13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

duty to call the attention of the trial judge before the


2

trial judge imposed sentence?


3

MR. CRUZ: Absolutely, absolutely.

4

QUESTION: But the trial obligation -- the trial


And -- and -­


5

lawyer's obligation to do justice is -- is somehow missing


6

in your office?


7

MR. CRUZ: The state has an obligation to be candid


8

with the court, so at any point in which the state became


9

aware of this error, the state would be obliged to inform


10

the court, but that's a very different thing to say that


11

when there is a procedural default, when the defendant has


12

not preserved his error, that the state should not act to


13

vindicate that procedural default.

14

value in protecting the procedural rules in the State of


15

Texas, and that value is not served.

16

this Court has said that the very narrow exception of actual


17

innocence should apply in very narrow circumstances.

18

this Court has ultimately engaged in a balancing, a


19

balancing that derives from prior language in the -- in the


20

Federal habeas -­


21

There is an important


I mean, ultimately,


So


QUESTION: Well, narrow circumstances, when the


22

record makes it perfectly clear that an error has been


23

committed and an innocent person is in jail, that's -- what


24

more do you need?


25

MR. CRUZ: The difficult -­


14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: There aren't many cases like this.


2

MR. CRUZ: It is true that there are not many cases


3

where the state concedes error, but the difficulty with


4

pivoting the test on that is the basic operating premise of


5

every habeas petition.

6

is that the petitioner has valid claim and this Court has


7

not hesitated to allow far more significant claims not to be


8

addressed because of procedural default.


Where procedural default is raised


9

QUESTION: Yes, but usually the valid claim is some


10

procedural error in the trial, something of that character. 


11

It's not that he's totally innocent and everybody agrees


12

he's totally innocent.


13

MR. CRUZ: This -- this Court has addressed


14

procedural default in the context of forced confessions, in


15

the context of statements without Miranda rights, in the


16

context of psychiatry -­


17

QUESTION: But that -- but -- but -- no, what you


18

need to satisfy Justice Stevens is -- is a case where the


19

mistake unquestionably caused the outcome of the -­


20

unquestionably caused the outcome of the trial to be wrong. 


21

All of the ones you just mentioned, it may have caused it to


22

be wrong, may not have, you don't -- the jury might have


23

convicted him without the confession, et cetera, et cetera. 


24

Do you have any cases where -- where, as here, there is no


25

doubt that the procedural default produced a different


15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

outcome in the trial?


2

MR. CRUZ: We do not have any cases like that, but


3

that aspect simply goes to prejudice, and this Court has


4

repeatedly cautioned that the actual innocence exception


5

should not be used to transform cause and prejudice just to


6

prejudice.

There's no doubt that this error caused


7

prejudice.

The only question is if there was cause for not


8

raising it, and in terms of asking -- I mean, Justice


9

Stevens asked me about, is this a manifest injustice.

There


10

seems nothing on the face of it that is plain to me that


11

allowing an individual to be convicted and to remain


12

convicted and serve in jail or even be executed based on a


13

forced confession is somehow a lesser injustice than


14

allowing Mr. Haley to serve a sentence -­


15
16

QUESTION: I think it's a lesser injustice if he's

really guilty of the crime.


17
18

MR. CRUZ: But in this case, Mr. Haley is guilty of

the theft, he's guilty of the predicate offense -­


19
20

QUESTION: He is not guilty of what he's in prison

for.


21

MR. CRUZ: Only in the sense -­


22

QUESTION: And I don't think the 3 days is an


23

argument that has any merit.

24

if it was 10 years.

25

You'd make the same argument


You'd make the same argument.


MR. CRUZ: It is -- it is true that 3 days or 5


16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

days or whatever does not matter.

2

are urging, is that Mr. Haley had multiple avenues to


3

challenge this.

4

could have challenged this on direct appeal.


5

What matters, and what we


He could have challenged this at trial.

He


QUESTION: If he could deliberately refuse to do it


6

in order to trap the state into some kind of mistake, is


7

this a case of, you know, in our original case that we talk


8

about gamesmanship and so on, do you think this is


9

gamesmanship on his part?


10

MR. CRUZ: You know, we don't have reason to


11

suggest that Mr. Haley in this instance was engaged in


12

gamesmanship with respect to this error, but the record is


13

susceptible to an interpretation that his counsel was


14

engaged in gamesmanship with respect to whether or not Mr.


15

Haley pleaded to the enhancements.

16

trial is Mr. Haley's attorney urged the trial court, my


17

client doesn't want to plead, please go ahead, he's not


18

going to plead.

19

and he immediately, on direct appeal that was his principal


20

challenge, and that is one possible interpretation of the


21

record is the counsel was attempting to sandbag.

22

a line of state court cases saying it was mandatory error


23

not to plead.


24
25

Because what happened at


The trial court did what the counsel asked


There was


QUESTION: Well, if the counsel sandbagged for the

purpose of getting a 16-year sentence instead of a 3-year


17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

sentence, doesn't that demonstrate that he was incompetent?


2

(Laughter.)


3

MR. CRUZ: It may well, and I certainly wouldn't


4

urge that counsel engaged in good strategic decisions, but


5

it may have been a strategic decision with respect to urging


6

the court to commit an error under state law that caused the


7

counsel not to notice the disparities in the enhancements. 


8

QUESTION: In one of the proceedings, Texas did


9

take the position that there -- this was not ineffective


10

assistance of counsel.

11

clear that you're not disputing that the -- that the


12

ineffective assistance of counsel claim is alive and well. 


13

But there was a time you took a different view.


14

The reply brief I think makes it


MR. CRUZ: That -- that is correct, and we agree at


15

this point there is a very significant argument of


16

ineffective assistance of counsel, and I would note that the


17

court of criminal appeals in Texas has found ineffective


18

assistance of counsel in almost precisely the same


19

circumstance where a counsel failed to notice the non­


20

sequential nature of felonies used to enhance a habitual


21

offender in the decision of Ex parte Scott, which is found


22

at 581 S.W.2d 181.


23
24
25

If there are no further questions, I'd like to

reserve the balance of my time.

QUESTION: Very well, Mr. Cruz.

Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.


2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS 


3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE


4

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER


5
6

MR. ROBERTS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:


7

The actual innocence exception applies in the


8

extraordinary case where a prisoner has been convicted of a


9

crime that he did not commit.

The Court shouldn't extend


10

that narrow exception to the very different situation where


11

the prisoner is guilty of the crime of which he was


12

convicted.


13

QUESTION: Well, what should we do in this case


14

with someone who -- who is serving an unjust sentence under


15

the law?


16

MR. ROBERTS: Well -- well, Your Honor, even if


17

this Court holds that the actual innocence exception doesn't


18

apply to non-capital sentencing, respondent may well be


19

entitled to relief here.


20

QUESTION: On the inadequate assistance claim?


21

MR. ROBERTS: On the ineffective assistance claim,


22
23
24
25

and I -­

QUESTION: Do you urge that that's waived, or can

the court below address it?

MR. ROBERTS: We don't believe that it's waived,


19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

Your Honor.


2

QUESTION: Thank you.


3

QUESTION: Why not go to that first and tell them


4

to do that, because this is just very difficult, that that


5

would be the reason?

6

because actual innocence is simply a way at getting at


7

manifest injustice, I think, and a reason that this fits in


8

the manifest injustice is we feel differently about


9

substantive laws that govern how long a person is going to


The reason it would be difficult is


10

be in prison than we do about procedural laws, and


11

sentencing is an aspect of that. 


12

But if you take that and say, look, this is an


13

absolute obvious case where there was just wrong sentencing,


14

it's not actual innocence, it's wrong sentencing, but it's


15

so obvious, it's so clear that this is just unjust.

16

we're down that path, I mean, how do we draw a line between


17

that and every sentencing error?

Once


Now, I'm just -­


18

MR. ROBERTS: That -- that's -­


19

QUESTION: -- I'm getting you to -­


20

MR. ROBERTS: -- but that's right, Your Honor -­


21

QUESTION: -- I know that's just what you were


22
23
24
25

going to say -­

MR. ROBERTS: -- and that's our primary -- that's

our primary concern here.

QUESTION: All right.

But is the answer then not


20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

to deal with it when it's clear?


2

MR. ROBERTS: Well, the -- the Court certainly


3

could do that.

5

there's cause and prejudice and so you don't need to address


6

it, and in a case where the error is -- is clear when what

the real concern is when it's not that clear about whether

There is a danger I think in -- in


QUESTION: So you're saying it would be wise to

send it back, is that right?


11

MR. ROBERTS: It -- it -- yes, except that, you


12

know, certainly our -- our primary interest in the question


13

here is in the question that's divided the circuits and in


14

making clear that there isn't a broad actual innocence


15

exception as applied to -- to non-capital sentencing.


16

QUESTION: Perhaps when it's clear it will always


17

be the case that there's been ineffective assistance of

counsel.

ineffective assistance of counsel not -- not have


20

intervened?


21

How -- how could it be, you know, clear as day and


MR. ROBERTS: That -- that's -- that's right, Your


22

Honor.

23

wouldn't need the actual innocence exception for that -- for


24

that circumstance.

that applies to the exception where the prisoner is guilty


It may well frequently be the case, which is why you

that would open up final judgments where a criminal

innocent of the sentence.

11

MR. ROBERTS: We -- we well might not have appealed

QUESTION: Well, they do, don't they?

MR. ROBERTS: Well, we certainly would -- would


21

take into account the entire situation in -- in making a


22

determination on that, Your Honor.

MR. ROBERTS: I -- I -­

MR. ROBERTS: I'm not -- I'm -- I'm not taking the

position of that, Your Honor.

make a prediction about some future case where I don't know

all the facts.

17

like this where a prisoner was clearly entitled to -- had -­

would call that to the attention of the -- of the district

But I noticed that you were very careful in

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

MR. ROBERTS: Right.


2

QUESTION: -- argument.


3

MR. ROBERTS: We -- I -- I -- we think that it's a


4

question to be decided by the -- the court of appeals on -­


5

on remand, Your Honor, and the state had made arguments


6

about whether it was preserved or not.

7

asked me my opinion as to whether the -- whether the claim


8

was preserved, and in -- in our view it was, but that would


9

be a question for the lower court to -- to decide, and


Justice O'Connor


10

apparently the state is no longer arguing that -- that it


11

wasn't preserved.


12

As I said, our -- our -- the -- the issue that


13

we're primarily concerned about here is a broad extension of


14

the actual innocence exception to an erroneous prison term,


15

and that would involve substantial societal costs, because


16

the challenges to the findings -­


17

QUESTION: Would it involve all those costs if we


18

can find the exception to cases in which the state


19

acknowledges the error?


20
21

MR. ROBERTS: Well, that would certainly be a far

less problematic exception.


22
23
24
25

QUESTION: Would it be problematic if we limit it

that way?

MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor, except to the extent

that it -- it extended -- extends actual innocence beyond an


24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

offense which has a special constitutional status.


2

QUESTION: Are we free to write this code of

criminal procedure?

4

arguments being made to, you know, to Congress or -- or to


5

the state legislatures for writing a code of criminal


6

procedure, but what is -- what is the -­


I mean, I can understand all these

MR. ROBERTS: Well, well, the -­


8

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS: -- these rules are -­


10

-- justification for this -­


QUESTION: -- something which has never been done


11

in -- in a couple of hundred years is -- is -- is part of


12

due process?


13

MR. ROBERTS: No, Your Honor.

My understanding is


14

that the actual innocence exception and the procedural


15

default rules are court-made limitations on the jurisdiction


16

-- on the exercise of discretion by the Federal habeas


17

court, and so the court's exercising its -- its supervisory


18

authority over the courts.


19

QUESTION: No, but the Federal habeas court has to


20

be relying upon some law to -- to undo the state conviction,


21

right?


22
23

MR. ROBERTS: Yes, Your Honor.

There has to be an


underlying claim.


24

QUESTION: Yeah.


25

MR. ROBERTS: But we're talking here about the


25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

actual innocence exception, which is a gateway to


2

consideration of that underlying claim.

3

still has to be an underlying constitutional claim, and -­


4

and that -­


There -- there


5

QUESTION: Mr. Roberts, why is it -­


6

MR. ROBERTS: -- that's an issue that's not before


7

the Court whether there is -- is such a claim.


8
9

QUESTION: Why is this qualitatively different from

the rule in Jackson against Virginia that if there's no


10

evidence to support the conviction, we set it aside, then


11

you presume the guy's innocent?


12

MR. ROBERTS: Well -- well -- Jack -- Jackson, Your


13

Honor, is based on Winship, which is based on the


14

requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the


15

elements of the crime.

16

--

17
18
19
20

When you're talking about sentencing


QUESTION: Well, when the record is perfectly clear

that -­

MR. ROBERTS:

-- there is no such constitutional


requirement.


21

QUESTION: When the record is perfectly clear that


22

one of the elements hasn't been proved, why he had a -- why


23

isn't it the same here?

24

the elements necessary for this conviction has not been


25

proven, the order of the -- the two crimes.


The record establishes that one of

2

with that, Your Honor.

4

What's disputed is -- is a factor leading to enhancement in


5

the sentence.

6

agree with you that the actual innocence exception applies

here.

That -- the elements of the crime

They're not -- they're not disputed. 


If this was an element of the crime, we would


QUESTION: If Apprendi had come out the other way,

or if we extended Apprendi to recidivism?


10

MR. ROBERTS: If you overruled Almendarez-Torres,


11

we would agree that the actual innocence exception applies


12

in this particular case.


13

QUESTION: Doesn't scare me.


14

MR. ROBERTS: But again, our concern is with broad


15

application of the actual innocence exception to sentencing


16

and to the many findings that are involved there, and the


17

fact is that the Court hasn't overruled Almendarez-Torres. 


18

We're talking about even in this case just an erroneous


19

sentence.

offense with the special constitutional status that that


21

entails and the special stigma that's attached to innocent,

to an offense.

We're not talking about an innocence of an

somebody for the wrong crime, but it is injust, isn't it?

unfairness involved, but the -- the manifest injustice

exception is not directed at -- at every -­


5

QUESTION: The manifest injustice -­

MR. ROBERTS: -- at every unfairness, and -­


7

QUESTION: No, but it's a -- it's a -- it's


8

directed at injustice that is manifest, not the


9

disqualitatively more than severe than it, and here it's


10
11

manifest.

MR. ROBERTS: I -- it -- what the Court has done in


12

-- in determining the application of exception is to weigh


13

the -- the degree of injustice that would be involved in


14

denying review against the substantial costs involved in -­


15

in reviewing claims when there's -- the prisoners


16

inexcusably failed to raise them in the proper forum and the


17

proper time, and -­


18

QUESTION: And you have difficulty weighing 15


19

years of an unlawful sentence and saying that that's not a


20

manifest injustice?

21

That's a difficult exercise?


MR. ROBERTS: I -- Your Honor, the -- the -- it --


22

it's certainly an unfairness, but there are substantial


23

costs to -- to extending it to these many -- there are many


24

factors that are involved in sentencing, and the fact is the

prisoner's still guilty of the offense of conviction here,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC M. ALBRITTON


5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


6
7

MR. ALBRITTON: Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:


8

This Court has repeatedly recognized that the -­


9

the systemic concerns that underpin the procedural default


10

doctrine must yield to the imperative of correcting a


11

fundamentally unjust incarceration, an incarceration that is


12

beyond the statutory maximum sentence, whether it be a


13

capital sentence or a non-capital sentence, is fundamentally


14

unjust.

15

capital sentence context and it should not do so today.


16
17
18
19
20

The Court has never limited this exception to a


QUESTION: Well, it has never extended it beyond

the capital sentence context either, has it?

MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor. 

However -­

QUESTION: And there is some suggestion in our


21

cases that other claims ought to be addressed before


22

resorting to that, such as inadequate assistance of counsel.


23

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I agree that this


24

Court's precedents suggest that ineffective assistance of


25

counsel, cause and prejudice, should be addressed first. 


29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

However, this Court has never expressly held that.

Your


2

Honor, in relation to the question that I've been asked


3

about, should this Court just remand for consideration of


4

the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, I would


5

respectfully suggest that that is not appropriate. 


6

In this case, Your Honor, the petitioner -­


7

QUESTION: Why not?

8
9

You think that counsel's


performance was adequate here?

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I think it was grossly


10

inadequate.

11

petitioner in this case, Your Honor, is only whether the


12

actual innocence exception to the procedural default rule


13

concerning Federal habeas corpus claims should apply to non-


14

capital sentence here.


15

However, the question presented by the


QUESTION: Yes, but if it's our view that the court


16

below addressed that out of order too soon when it had an


17

alternative, certainly we could vacate and remand.


18

MR. ALBRITTON: You could, Your Honor.


19

QUESTION: Yes.


20

MR. ALBRITTON: Again, I would respectfully suggest


21

that's inappropriate.

22

and presented the court with that particular question, that


23

is, whether or not the court should have reached cause and


24

prejudice first.

25

the court to consider that claim.


The State of Texas could have argued


However, the State of Texas did not ask


30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: But we -- we haven't in -- in at least


2

two or three cases when we have a question of certiorari,


3

we've said that there's a logically preceding question that


4

has to be decided before we can get to that.

5

me this might be that kind of a case.

precedent, and I understand that the Court could -­

QUESTION: Well, I guess you'd like your client out

of jail?


10
11

So it seems to


MR. ALBRITTON: That's absolutely correct, Your

Honor, and the state didn't -­


12

QUESTION: Doesn't sound like it.


13

(Laughter.)


14

QUESTION: Well, you -- you'd rather do it sooner


15

rather than later, right?

16

free rather than send it back down and try it all over


17

again?


You'd rather have us say let him


18

MR. ALBRITTON: Absolutely, Your Honor.


19

QUESTION: That seems reasonable.


20

MR. ALBRITTON: If it's remanded, he's going to be


21

incarcerated while it goes back through the court of appeals


22

and through the district court, and if this Court decides


23

that, this issue, that it cannot reach the issue presented,


24

the Court can certainly dismiss this case as improvidently


25

granted and Mr. Haley will no longer have to suffer under


31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

the danger of this clearly -­

QUESTION: Mr. Albritton, let me -- let me ask you


3

this. In this case there is a statute that would not have


4

allowed the additional sentence to be imposed unless these


5

things were sequential.

6

Suppose what you are -- we're dealing with was a real


7

sentencing factor of the sort that a judge can take into


8

account under a law which says the judge may sentence from


9

10 to 30 years, all right?


Suppose that wasn't the situation. 


10

MR. ALBRITTON: Yes, Your Honor.


11

QUESTION: It's up to the judge.

And in sentencing


12

him to the maximum, the judge makes a mistake of fact.

13

is later found that when the judge said I'm giving him 30


14

years because, you know, he's been a really bad person in


15

light of this background, and it turns out that background


16

didn't exist, all right?

17

argument here?


18
19
20

It


Would you be making the same


MR. ALBRITTON: I absolutely would not, Your Honor. 

As we've argued in our brief -­

QUESTION: That does make it sound like what this


21

is is Almendarez-Torres, that -- that -- the -- the


22

difference between the hypothetical I just posed to you and


23

this case is simply that the law would not allow the


24

additional time to be imposed unless the fact was found,


25

whereas in the discretionary case, the law would have


32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

allowed it.


2

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, we do not believe that


3

the Court need reach Almendarez-Torres.

4

we propose is certainly consistent with this Court's Sixth


5

Amendment rule in Apprendi.

6

However, the rule


It's also consistent with -­


QUESTION: Well, how -- how do you limit it to that


7

kind of a situation then?

8

give me the answer that you've just given me, that even


9

though you -- you -- you show that the judge who imposed a


How -- how do you -- how do you


10

discretionary sentence was absolutely wrong for the basis on


11

which he imposed that discretionary sense, you wouldn't


12

allow that to be reviewed.

13

that?


14

Why -- what's the basis for


MR. ALBRITTON: Several reasons, Your Honor.

First


15

of all, this Court's decision in Sawyer v. Whitley


16

specifically adopted an eligibility test, and that


17

eligibility test draws the line at where that person is


18

statutorily eligible.

19

notion that it should consider discretionary factors in the


20

capital context mitigating evidence. 


21

This Court specifically rejected the


Thus, Your Honor, our rule about statutory


22

eligibility is tethered specifically to the Court's ruling


23

in Sawyer.

24

propose is well-rooted in this Court's habeas doctrine


25

dating back to Townsend v. Burke, Your Honor.

Additionally, Your Honor, that rule that we


33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

This Court


1

has recognized that a sentence that falls -- the severity of


2

a sentence that falls within a statutory range is not


3

amenable to habeas review.

4

Your Honor, of Harris v. the United States, where the issue


5

was whether Apprendi applied to mandatory minimums.

6

Court held -- actually, part of the opinion is a plurality


7

opinion, but the holding is that the -- it does not matter


8

if the sentence is more based on some false fact.

9

is, is it within range of punishment authorized by the


10
11

Additionally, the recent case,


This


The issue


legislature, Your Honor.

QUESTION: I understand that.

I just don't


12

understand why it makes any sense if you've shown and can


13

know for sure that the only reason the judge imposed the 30


14

years was that he believed a certain fact was true which in


15

fact was not true, and that is demonstrated, and he said,


16

I'm opposing 30 years because of this, otherwise, you know,


17

this would be a 10-year sentence.

18

much injustice there, it seems to me.


And I -- there's just as


19

MR. ALBRITTON: Well, Your Honor, the difference is


20

in an error in what constitutes a fundamental miscarriage of


21

justice, and we would respectfully suggest that when a


22

sentence is imposed outside of any range authorized by the


23

legislature, that is fundamentally unjust.


24
25

QUESTION: But the other could be, couldn't it? 
I
mean, that's -- what I don't understand about this area, and


34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

you've read the cases and so you may able to be clearer than


2

I am and can correct me, I've thought that the real key


3

concept is not actual innocence.

4

that to a sentence.

5

innocent of the sentence.

6

rather manifest injustice, and the key word is manifest. 


7

It's very hard to apply


You're guilty of the crime, you're not

That doesn't make sense, but


And so one could have manifest injustice in


8

millions of possible situations.

9

clarity as to it applies to in between the guideline but not


You don't need absolute


10

beyond the guideline, but the key word is manifest, and it


11

has to be unjust and injustice first and foremost has to do


12

with being behind bars when the law says you shouldn't be,


13

directly and simply, not through some procedural device.


14

So thinking about it in that way, I would like you


15

to tell me what cases of this Court stand as obstacles to


16

the way I'm thinking about it?


17

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I believe that Sawyer, 


18

we believe that Sawyer v. Whitley stands as an obstacle to


19

that approach, because in Sawyer, Your Honor, the Court


20

specifically rejected the notion that factors that affect


21

the sentence within the discretion of the sentencing body


22

are not to be considered in the determination of whether or


23

not somebody -- or a petitioner is actually innocent of that


24

sentence.


25

QUESTION: You see what I -- what I'm basically


35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

interested in is, is the -- the concept actual innocence


2

simply a subdivision of the broader concept manifest


3

injustice?

4

itself, where manifest, is a basis for doing whatever


5

happens in habeas law.

6

subdivision, I then would have a better handle on the case.


7

And so that actual innocence of the crime


And if I know whether that's a


MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, I -- it is our position


8

that innocence has been adopted as a touchstone for the


9

determination of whether or not there is a manifest


10

injustice.

11

takes into consideration, that focus on innocence takes into


12

proper consideration the systemic interest in federalism,


13

comity, and finality. 


14

The Court has determined that that properly


Your Honor, although the -- the concept of


15

innocence of punishment is awkward and recognized, Mr. Haley


16

is actually innocent of the fact alleged that caused for the


17

sentence that is more than eight times the statutory -­


18

QUESTION: Everybody's going to say they're


19

actually innocent.

20

but, you know, a very high percentage of prisoners in prison


21

say, I was actually innocent, and the prosecution says, no,


22

you're not actually innocent.

23

excuse, actual innocence, and if in fact that's really an


24

excuse in respect to a sentence, then why wouldn't every


25

case be open to the Federal habeas judge relitigating the


All -- I mean, you know, not everybody,


So if that's really an


36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

lawfulness of the conviction in terms of the evidence and


2

relitigating the sentence in terms of what was reasonable?


3

MR. ALBRITTON: Those concerns, Your Honor,


4

underpin the reason for the high standard of proof in the


5

first instance, that is, clear and convincing evidence. 


6

Those concerns also, Your Honor, inform the reason for the


7

rule we proposed, and that is there is only a fundamental


8

miscarriage of justice when a sentence is imposed that under


9

the true facts no sentencing body, judge or jury, could have


10
11

ever done.

QUESTION: All right.

In your view, under the true


12

facts, a prisoner says the true facts are X, the state says


13

the true facts are not X, and what's supposed to happen?


14

MR. ALBRITTON: The court has to decide if the


15

petitioner has shown by clear and convincing evidence that


16

he or she, but for a constitutional violation, would not


17

have been eligible for that sentence.


18

QUESTION: So -- so in your -- in your view, every


19

crime in a state court and every sentence in a state court,


20

at least a big subset, are open to relitigation in the


21

Federal court on the standard of whether there is clear and


22

convincing evidence that adds the factual matters, it was


23

that the -- the state court was wrong?


24
25

MR. ALBRITTON: No, Your Honor, not a large subset,

only the subset of cases where the petitioner receives a


37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

sentence for which he or she is statutorily ineligible.

QUESTION: In -- in your -- in your view, Mr.


3

Albritton, there's no requirement that this evidence be


4

newly discovered, I take it?


5

MR. ALBRITTON: That is correct, Your Honor.


6

QUESTION: Mr. Albritton, it's a small subset of


7

the state court cases, but it's a -- it's a -- it's a total


8

-- it's not a subset at all of the Federal cases, right? 


9

Because we have a guideline system where, by statute, you


10

are not allowed to impose any more than what the guidelines


11

permit, right?


12
13
14

MR. ALBRITTON: That's not actually entirely

accurate, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Well, unless you -- sure, you -- you can


15

make a finding that -- where that finding hasn't been made


16

that this is somehow extraordinary, you cannot, by law,


17

impose more than a certain amount of sentence.


18

MR. ALBRITTON: In the -- in the Federal context,


19

Your Honor, there are two things that are operating.

20

are the guidelines, but the second is the statutory range of


21

punishment.

22

application of the guidelines, that a sentence, up until and


23

including the statutory maximum under some circumstances is


24

appropriate.


25

arguably unless, okay?


Now, there are many situations where it isn't even


5

MR. ALBRITTON: Yes, sir.


6

QUESTION: So that means there is a statutory


7

requirement that the judge impose the guideline sentence,

four extra units or points if you had a gun, say.

prisoner says, I didn't have a gun.

The


The state says, I did

have a gun.

12

hurt or only gravely hurt, whether there was a threat or a


13

brandishment or an actual use of the gun, all of which add


14

points, and what you're saying is all of those things would


15

be relitigated in a habeas court, as long as the prisoner


16

colorably can say, I have evidence that will show clearly


17

and convincingly the judge was wrong.


18

And now you want to relitigate whether he had a


MR. ALBRITTON: That is not correct, Your Honor. 


19

Under the rule we propose, the Federal court would only have


20

to engage in this exercise if the petitioner could establish

above the statutory maximum.

inaccuracies -­

While it may be error in the


QUESTION: No, you were saying that, but judge -- I

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

knew you were saying that, but I think Justice Scalia's


2

question was that he can't find, nor can I find, a logical


3

basis for making that distinction.

4

QUESTION:

That's the problem. 


The sentence is unlawful if it goes


5

above the guidelines, which is why it can be set aside by


6

the appellate court.

It is unlawful.


7

MR. ALBRITTON: Your -- Your Honor, the difference


8

between unlawful and a fundamentally unjust is an important


9

distinction.

As this Court has historically held from the


10

early notions of habeas when, even when habeas review in the


11

first right, regardless of default, was much more


12

circumspect, the Court could always reach and always issue


13

the writ where a petitioner received a sentence that is


14

outside the statutory range.

15

a situation where there may be an error and there may be


16

some injustice, and a situation where the -- the injustice


17

is fundamental, Your Honor. That's the distinction.


18

So it's a difference in the -­

And in the -- in the death cases, there isn't that -- this

is not overlap, this is total coincidence.


5

MR. ALBRITTON: Your Honor, in this Court's opinion


6

last week in Banks v. Dretke, the Court recognized, as it


7

had previously in Stickler v. Greene -- Strickler v. Greene,


8

that it is not unusual for the same facts to be used and an


9

overlap between those facts for the inquiry as to whether or


10

not the merits of the claim can be reached and the merits of


11

the claim.

12

Honor, the -- the same evidence was used to establish both


13

cause and prejudice, as well as the underlying merits of the

15

As the Court held in Banks last week, Your


It's not surprising that the same evidence would


16

be involved in this situation, Your Honor, because, after


17

all, the inquiry is extremely similar, and that is the


18

innocence of the petitioner and whether or not the state


19

proved as a due process matter the allegations that it was

required to.
