We’ll hear

United States.

Ms. Freeland.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA B. FREELAND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. FREELAND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Believing its hands were tied by a policy

12

statement created to prevent application of this Court's

13

decision in Booker to section 3582(c) proceedings, the

14

district court imposed a mandatory guideline sentence

15

that exceeded the maximum authorized by the jury's

16

verdict by more than six years.

17

policy cannot override this Court's clear and

18

unambiguous directive to courts to treat the guidelines

19

as advisory in all cases moving forward, and any

20

interpretation of section 3582(c) that permits the

21

Commission to mandate sentences must be rejected, not

22

only as a matter of statutory stare decisis, but because

23

it would violate the Sixth Amendment.

24
25

Sentencing Commission

In an effort to avoid this result, the
government elevates form over substance, arguing that

section 3582(c) proceedings are not sentencings at

2

the -- and that the sentence imposed is not a new

The government is wrong.

must apply.

MS. FREELAND:

That wouldn't

Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

14

15

16

17

precisely what it did here, which is setting a lower

MS. FREELAND:

I disagree, Your Honor,

6

statute, 3582(c), that invokes the discretionary

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, why is that?

It's

22

the same hypothetical of the Chief Justice.

interrupting your -- your discussion with him.

What --

4

MS. FREELAND:

And, Justice Kennedy --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

MS. FREELAND:

Is there a problem with that?

Justice Kennedy, I think there

7

would be.

And, again, I don't mean to be dodging the question.

8

The problem is section 3582(c).

9

that it wanted these types of reductions to be treated

Congress clearly indicated

10

differently than those under 3624(b), which are

11

delegated to the Bureau of Prisons.

12

reductions --

And those types of

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

hypothetical is Congress doesn't do this.

15

hypothetical is that Congress just tells the BOP:

16

out who's in on crack cocaine and release them --

17

whatever, 20 months early.

Your Honor -What’s wrong with that?

Your Honor, if

21

Congress chose to draft a statute similar to 3624(b) to

22

empower the Bureau of Prisons to act whenever the

23

Commission lowered a guideline or -- or changed a

24

guideline under 994(o), I agree with Your Honor.

25

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

Then the Chief

2

Justice's hypothetical, at least for me, meant:

3

why should there be a difference?

4

MS. FREELAND:

What --

The difference, again -- and

5

I don't mean to be dodging your questions.

The

6

difference is that Congress acted in two very different

7

ways here.

8

in sentence that are -- that are prompted by revisions

9

to the guidelines, and it enacted 3624(b) to deal with

It enacted 3582(c) to deal with reductions

10

revisions that are prompted by good behavior.

11

it --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

What is the

13

constitutional difference that would inure a Sixth

14

Amendment right in the resentencing by the court that

15

doesn't when it's a resentencing or a modification of a

16

sentence by the Bureau of Prisons?

17

MS. FREELAND:

Justice Sotomayor, I think

18

the difference would be that when it is delegated to the

19

courts under a statute like 3582(c), the court is then

20

dealing with a mandatory guideline range, and the Sixth

21

Amendment problem arises when the court sentences --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But is this truly a new

23

sentence, meaning a person serving a sentence?

This is

24

an act of clemency.

25

3

MS. FREELAND:

Justice Sotomayor, I disagree

4

with the premise of your question that this is an act of

5

clemency similar to the reductions for good time

6

behavior.

7

The -- the term "clemency," "leniency,"

8

"grace," connotes the idea that you deserve to be

9

punished for this, but we’re going to -- we’re going

10

to exercise leniency --

now going to overcome the finality bar, but all of the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

others who are identically situated with respect to all

2

other factors, they don't get their sentences revised?

3

MS. FREELAND:

Justice Ginsburg, I have a

4

couple of responses to your question.

5

I think that a decision by a district court judge to

6

correct a sentence under 3582(c) should be analogous to

7

a decision of a district court judge to correct a

8

sentence under 2255.

The first is that

9

Once the decision is made that the sentence

10

should be corrected, finality is extinguished, and when

11

the court goes about imposing the new sentence, it must

12

comport with the law of the land at the time.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why should, bearing

14

in mind that entire prison population similarly

15

situated, the courts say it’s -- the finality bar is lifted

16

only to the extent that the crack cocaine guideline disparity

17

has been reduced?

18

MS. FREELAND:

And, Your Honor, once the

19

finality bar is lifted, the concerns about retroactivity

20

should slip away.

21

think is at the heart of your question, the fact that

22

this partial remedy for an urgent and compelling

23

problem, that is, the crack guideline, was afforded to

24

some should not prevent the court from seeing justice

25

for those like Mr. Dillon, even though there are some in

But with respect to fairness, which I

9

prison that are serving unconstitutional sentences that

2

3

Mr. Dillon is properly compared to other

4

defendants who were sentenced under the amended crack

5

guideline, not the original crack guideline.

6

sentence is an amended crack guideline sentence, and for

7

purposes of avoiding unwarranted disparities, Mr. Dillon

8

is most comparable to those other defendants that are

9

sentenced after the crack guideline.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

His

If you -- if you are

11

right that this benefit goes to -- only to the class

12

that can get in the door, wouldn't that be a powerful

13

motive to the Sentencing Commission not to make its

14

guidelines reductions retroactive?

15

MS. FREELAND:

Your Honor, I would certainly

16

hope not.

17

will undertake a constant review and revision of the

18

guidelines to make sure that they serve the purposes of

19

punishment.

20

21

retroactive application.

The Commission has constantly undertaken this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it’s certainly a

factor that if I were -- if I were on the Commission, I

10

would certainly take that factor into account.

11

time I make it retroactive, it’s going to reopen --

12

going to reopen the whole sentencing and -- and allow

13

a Booker application where -- where it didn't apply

14

before.

How can I close my eyes to that if --

retroactivity determination?

Your Honor, if I could, I’m

not suggesting that the Commission close its eyes to

anything.

22

decisions would be reopened.

23

when a court imposes a new sentence, that new sentence

challenge gets to raise that.

15

there’s no bar to an upward sentence by the -- by the

judge, because if it's a brand new hearing subject to

18

point.

The -- the problem is with the statute.

12

The fact that a sentence cannot be increased

3582(c)

does not divest the proceeding at which it’s imposed -JUSTICE BREYER:

the words in the statute is that it may reduce the term.

17

sentence, except that you can reduce the term if such

reduction is consistent with applicable policy

statements.

3582(c) is not unconstitutional.
JUSTICE BREYER:

particular respect.

argument is that it is unconstitutional.

this case properly exercised its authority under the

statute to reduce Petitioner's sentence by a little bit

4

reduction that was consistent with the Sentencing

Commission's specification under section 994(u) about

6

whether and to what extent its crack cocaine amendments

7

warranted reductions in already imposed sentences.

8
9

The district court had neither a further
obligation nor indeed the authority to set Petitioner's

10

sentence aside altogether and resentence Petitioner

11

under the advisory guidelines regime announced in

12

Booker.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that extend to --

14

which was part of this case -- the court notices that

15

there was a technical error; it was a calculation error

16

the first time, and the judge says, well, I’ll fix

That was an arithmetic error.

MS. KRUGER:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the same

rule applies to the calculation error that Petitioner is

20

raising.

21

Section 3582(c)(2) wasn’t designed by

22

Congress to serve as effectively a less restrictive

substitute for raising such challenges on direct appeal

or where otherwise available under section 2255.

4

Justice Sotomayor, you had asked earlier

5

whether this provision was designed as an act of

6

clemency or was instead designed as a kind of adjunct to

7

the court's judicial review power, a kind of 2255-type

8

power.

9

designed as a mechanism for the exercise of a type of

We think the answer is clearly that it was

10

clemency power.

11

you look at the parallel provisions in section

12

3582(c)(1), which are reprinted at pages 3a and 4a of the

13

appendix to the government's brief.

14

I think that’s particularly clear if

Those provisions also provide for similar

15

types of sentence reductions in cases where the director

16

of the Bureau of Prisons makes a motion for sentence

17

reduction based either on extraordinary and compelling

18

reasons or because the defendant is over the age of 70

19

and has served more than 30 years in prison.

20

In all of these cases, the district court

21

exercises a discretionary power to reduce the sentence

22

in the exercise of leniency, not because of legal error

23

but for equitable reasons.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that gets tied up,

doesn't it, to your argument that this is not a part of
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the criminal prosecution, that this is a -- not a Sixth

2

Amendment proceeding, but -- not a Sixth Amendment

3

proceeding, so it doesn't require constitutional

4

protection?

5

MS. KRUGER:

That's correct, Justice

6

Sotomayor.

We think that what Congress has called for

7

in all of the sentence reduction provisions of section

8

3582(c) is a kind of discretionary mechanism for

9

reducing sentences that are already final and

10

nonappealable and can't be modified in any other respect.

11

It hasn't called for a de novo plenary resentencing so

12

to allow defendants in the position that Petitioner is

13

in to come into court and reopen every aspect of their

14

sentence, requiring reconsideration of guidelines

15

determinations made in this case more than a decade ago

16

or requiring application of intervening changes in the

17

law.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Am I correct in

understanding that 3582(c) was enacted prior to our

Yes, it -- it was.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And is it clear that it

23

should be construed as though the system was mandatory

24

before the decision in Booker, rather than construed in

25

the light of the remedial decision in Booker?
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. KRUGER:

Well, I think there are two

2

questions that are raised here about how this statutory

3

scheme comports with Booker.

4

question, whether this is a statutory provision that

5

calls for a resentencing, at which Booker and its

6

decision about the Sixth Amendment would apply.

7

One is the Sixth Amendment

And then the second question is even if you

8

think there is no constitutional problem with reading

9

the statute in accordance with its plain terms, whether

10

Booker's remedial analysis requires treating the

11

reference to the policy statements in section 3582(c)(2)

12

as purely advisory.

13

We think with respect to that question, not

14

even Petitioner is quite willing to embrace the full

15

consequences of that argument.

16

and excising the portion of 3582(c)(2) that requires

17

consistency with the applicable policy statements.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It would mean severing

Right.

Is that any more

19

a dramatic change than was made in the Booker remedial

20

opinion itself?

21

MS. KRUGER:

I'm not sure whether or not

22

it's a more dramatic change in terms of the number of

23

cases that would be affected, but it’s --

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

But the remedial opinion

basically rewrote the whole statute on -- except first
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it didn't have to reach 3582(c), but it certainly

2

changed the -- the nature of the mandatory provisions

3

that were previously in the statute.

4

MS. KRUGER:

That's true, and it did so in

5

order to solve the constitutional difficulties that were

6

created by a mandatory guidelines system with respect to

7

the imposition of sentence.

8
9

Without that same kind of Sixth Amendment
violation in the context of discretionary sentence

10

reduction proceedings, we think there is no basis in

11

Booker's analysis for severing and excising any portion

12

of 3582(c)(2), but I would note that the consequence of

13

severing and excising the requirement of consistency with

14

the applicable policy statements would be to free

15

district courts not only from the Sentencing

16

Commission's specifications about how much to reduce

17

sentences, but also which of its amendments to the

18

guidelines would justify retroactive application,

19

because it is after all in a policy statement, section

20

1B1.10, that the Sentencing Commission has specified

21

which of its amendments, among many, justify sentence

22

reductions under 3582(c)(2).

23

time the Sentencing Commission revises its guidelines

24

and reduces applicable sentencing ranges, any number of

25

defendants would be free to come to the district courts

downward direction.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that would certainly

Have there been other

guidelines ranges that have been reduced, and, if so,

9

were those also retroactive?

10

MS. KRUGER:

There have -- there have been

11

many guidelines ranges that have been reduced over the

12

course of the existence of the sentencing guidelines.

13

believe that right now, the current number of -- of

14

guidelines amendments the Sentencing Commission has made

15

retroactive stands at 27.

16

I

This was the -- one of the first decisions

17

that the Sentencing Commission made about retroactivity

18

in the wake of Booker, and it did so with full

19

consciousness of the potential for broadly reopening

20

sentences.

21

Sentencing Commission's deliberations that the

22

traditional understanding, existing long before Booker

23

was ever decided, was that 3582(c)(2) proceedings do not

constitute plenary resentencings that incorporate all

intervening changes to the law.

on a very long history of rejections and precisely

11

that parameter.

in applying Booker, because this Court has said that Booker

I think that's right, Justice Kennedy.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I’m troubled by

your response to Justice Kennedy's previous question,

4

that the judge can take into account conduct in prison

5

and all these other things.

to other factors than the crack cocaine disparity, and

7

once you’re looking at other factors, why not look at

8

everything?

9

MS. KRUGER:

It does seem to open it up

Well, I think the answer to

10

that question is resolved by looking at the plain text

11

of 3582(c)(2), Mr. Chief Justice, which directs that

12

district courts have a discretion to reduce sentences in

13

a manner that’s consistent with applicable policy

14

statements, but after considering these statutory

15

sentencing factors under section 3553(a), which

16

include, of course, the need to protect the public from

17

future crimes committed by the defendant, as well as the

18

history and characteristics of the prisoner.

19

The reference to 3553(a) guides district

20

courts' discretion in deciding whether or not to grant a

21

reduction that's authorized by the Sentencing Commission

22

in the course of its statutory duty under 994(u) to

23

specify whether and to what extent its amendments

24

justify retroactive application.

that the government very much takes those considerations

9

into account when making recommendations about available

11

I can tell you

sentence reductions under section 3582(c)(2).
And, indeed, in this case, the government

12

agreed that the Petitioner should receive the full

13

measure of the benefit that the Sentencing Commission

14

had made available when it decided to make the crack

15

cocaine amendments retroactive, based in large part on

16

Petitioner's conduct in prison and his other

17

characteristics.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question?

19

Accepting the point that there’s no constitutional

20

compulsion that they had to open up for a full new

21

sentencing, and I understand one reason for not doing it

22

is that you don't impose too much work on the district

23

courts for doing it, but could you explain to me why

24

as -- just as a matter of policy and good judgment, the

25

Commission would say, well, you can take a look at all
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the negative factors that would argue against reduction,

2

but you cannot look at any of the factors that would show

3

why you should have had the same sentence that if -- why

4

you should get the kind of sentence you would have

5

gotten if you had been sentenced in the first place

6

today?

7

Because I guess this particular man is

8

going to be -- spend 22 more years in jail than if he

9

-- if he had been sentenced today.

10

MS. KRUGER:

The reason why the Commission

11

doesn't do that is because it wouldn't comply with its

12

statutory mandate under 28 U.S.C. 994(u) to specify both

13

which guidelines amendments justify retroactive

14

application and the amount by which sentences may be

15

reduced.

16

The Sentencing Commission would have no

17

power to simply say in its policy statement:

18

courts, you are free to reduce sentences by however

19

much amount you believe is appropriate.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You think the statute

21

would have prohibited a more generous policy statement,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I -- I still don't

2

understand how you fit into that your answer to the

3

Chief Justice earlier that, in fact, the court can

4

consider other factors in -- in 3553 when it's making

5

the reduction.

6

MS. KRUGER:

Justice Scalia, I think the

7

answer is simply that the 3553(a) factors and their

8

consideration under 3582(c)(2) is designed for a

9

different purpose than for the consideration that goes

10

into the initial imposition of the sentence.

11

The point of considering the 3553(a)

12

factors, to the extent they are applicable, to use the

13

words of 3582(c)(2) --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MS. KRUGER:

Yes.

-- is just to determine whether

16

or not the district court will grant a reduction that is

17

authorized, to the extent it is authorized, by applicable

18

policy statements.

resulting sentence, as an original matter, is greater

factors.

that isn't a factor that would cause you to disallow

the reduction.

4

But that isn't --

It's a factor that --

MS. KRUGER:

It's a factor that would cause

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it -- it's also

a factor that would -- might guide the district court to

13

a decision not to reduce the sentence.

15

MS. KRUGER:

That's correct.

It can point

in either direction in any given case.

16

But the critical point is that Congress has

discretion in these proceedings.
