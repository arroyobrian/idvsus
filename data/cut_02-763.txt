CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument


now in No. 02-763, Jo Anne Barnhart v. Pauline Thomas.

Mr. Lamken.


6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9

MR. LAMKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


10

As the Commissioner of Social Security has long


11

construed the disability insurance program, there can be


12

no finding of disability unless at least two conditions


13

are met.

14

severity that she cannot -- she is unable to do her

15

previous work.

16

severity that the claimant cannot, considering her age,


17

education, and experience, engage in any other kind of


18

substantial, gainful work which exists in the national


19

economy.


First, the claimant's impairment must be of such


Second, the impairments must be of such


20

Construing and applying those provisions for


21

more than 3 decades, the commissioner has consistently


22

concluded that if a claimant continues to function at a


23

level sufficient to meet the demands of past work, then


24

the claimant is not disabled without the necessity of


25

inquiring into whether that particular past job exists in

significant numbers.

2

the statutory text.


3

QUESTION:

That's the most natural reading of


Mr. Lamken, this case, I think,


4

involves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the


5

act, and there are regulations under each.


6

MR. LAMKEN:

7

QUESTION:

That is correct.

It is --


Now, are there any relevant


8

differences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on


9

this issue?


10

MR. LAMKEN:

No, Your Honor.

We don't believe


11

that there are any relevant differences, that the


12

commissioner's regulations and the statutes themselves are


13

all phrased in parallel if not identical language


14

throughout.


15

There is one difference in that for a disability


16

insurance, these title II provisions, you have to be


17

someone who has paid into the program in order to be


18

eligible for benefits on the way out; whereas, title XVI


19

is more of a welfare program where whether you've paid in


20

in the past doesn't matter.

21

one who has paid into the title II program would get


22

considerably more benefits than one who has not.


23

QUESTION:

24

MR. LAMKEN:

25

But that simply means that


But on the test.

On the test, it is an identical


test.

QUESTION:

There's no difference. 


2

MR. LAMKEN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LAMKEN:

There is no test, Justice O'Connor.


Thank you. 

That construction preserves the


5

distinction long recognized in the commissioner's


6

regulations, in fact, recognizing the commissioner's


7

regulations from the earliest days of administering this


8

statute.

9

and insurance against other causes of unemployment, such


Between disability insurance, on the one hand,


10

as technological and economic change, on the other, an


11

individual who's doing a job who remains fully capable of


12

doing that job, but then loses the job because of economic


13

change or perhaps the job never existed in significant


14

numbers and the individual chooses to leave, is not unable

15

to engage in that activity by reason of an impairment,


16

which is the test under the statute for being entitled to


17

benefits. 


18

And it made sense for Congress to draw that line


19

because if someone continues to function at a level


20

sufficient to meet the demands of their previous work,


21

it's virtually certain that they're capable of doing some


22

work whether or not that particular past job exists in


23

significant numbers in the national economy.

24

isn't that the person is expected to return to that


25

particular past job.

The point


Rather, it is their continued


5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

functioning at a level sufficient to meet the demands of


2

that job provides a highly accurate and administrable test


3

of the fact that they continue to function at a level


4

sufficient to meet the demands of work generally. 


5

In a program that must resolve more than 2


6

million claims a year, the need for that type of a highly


7

administrable test, that type of highly accurate test is


8

particularly acute.

9

test one would have expected Congress to provide.


10

And this is precisely the type of


A potentially large number of Americans today do


11

not work in jobs that exist in significant numbers in the


12

national economy.

13

whether they quit, are fired for misconduct, or leave for


14

other reasons which are good and sufficient, the court of

15

appeals would preclude the commissioner from denying them


16

benefits based on their continued capacity to do that past


17

job even if that job is still available to them, even if


18

the employer is on the phone begging them to return to the


19

job.

20

not compelling that result.


21
22
23

When those workers leave their jobs,


The commissioner reasonably construed the statute as


If there are no questions, I will reserve the

remainder of my time for rebuttal. 

QUESTION:

I have a -- a question about the


24

consistency of the argument you're now making with the --


25

with the commissioner's regulation concerning you don't go

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

back more than 15 years.

2

that even if a person can do the job that he or she did 15


3

years ago, yet there's a likelihood that maybe that kind


4

of work isn't in abundant supply anymore.


5
6

MR. LAMKEN:

That seems to be a recognition


Justice O'Connor, the concern of


that 15-year --


7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LAMKEN:

9

The concern of that regulation isn't whether or


I'm Justice Ginsburg. 

Oh, Justice Ginsburg. 


10

not that particular past job exists in significant


11

numbers.

12

prophylactic test to make sure that the demands of that


13

job are demands that are ones that are likely to be


14

relevant in the national economy. 
 It's unlikely that a

15

set of demands of a job would completely disappear from


16

the economy entirely during any one person's lifetime.


17

It provides an administrable and in fact


But to make assurance doubly sure, to make


18

absolutely certain, the commissioner has set forth an


19

administrable bright line, 15-year rule that says if the


20

job is more than -- if you did the job more than 15 years


21

ago, we won't consider it out of that concern.

22

not a consideration of whether the particular past job


23

exists.

24

continued ability to the demands of that job is an


25

appropriate and accurate measure of your ability -- your

is consistent with work generally.

the facts of this case, Mr. Lamken?

was now -- she was able to go out and find a job as a -- a

That's correct.

From -- if I


10

remember correctly, from 1988 to 1995, she worked as an


11

elevator operator.


12

QUESTION:

If the absence of elevator jobs had


13

occurred earlier and she hadn't been able to find this


14

job, she would clearly be disabled, wouldn't she?

that she would be found disabled.

MR. LAMKEN:

The commissioner would


She would have made the fifth step.

If you were not to consider the --


21

the previous work of an elevator operator and you only


22

applied the fifth step, which is the other work step, in


23

isolation, that's correct, that she would have been found


24

not able to do other work in the national economy.

25

the fifth step is designed to work in conjunction with all

1

the other previous steps and, standing alone, does not


2

necessarily represent an accurate determination.


3

Congress provided two conditions that must be


4

met, previous work and other work, precisely because the


5

somewhat abstract inquiry into other work that plaintiff


6

has -- the claimant has never done may not be a fully


7

accurate or necessarily an easily administered mechanism


8

for determining the level of work that the claimant can


9

do.


10

QUESTION:

See, the thought that was running


11

through my mind, just to put it on the table, is that in a


12

sense perhaps the Government's position creates a


13

disincentive to look for other marginal jobs when you're


14

in this position. 
 You might be better off just not to

15

look.


16

MR. LAMKEN:

Justice Stevens, the commissioner's


17

rules actually take into account incentives to look for


18

work through the unsuccessful work attempt regulations. 


19

And so that is something that has been dealt with.

20

the same -- the same problem existed in the Walton case,


21

for example.

22

engaging in socially desirable conduct, going out and


23

working, will actually provide the evidence that shows


24

that they're capable of working, but that is just a


25

necessary consequence of a program that --


And


It is unfortunate that sometimes people, by

Suppose in Justice Stevens'


13

hypothetical the employer said, you know, you can operate

the elevator but it's just going to be going for 6 months.

If this is something --


Everybody knows it's a -- it's a job

She can -- she can perform

didn't take that job.

Would she then still be barred?


14

MR. LAMKEN: 
 If the -- if she did take the job,

15

Justice Kennedy, and the job represented functioning at a


16

level that's consistent with work generally that is


17

substantial, gainful work, she would be barred.

perhaps might be better off not taking the -- taking a job

like that under the commissioner's regulations. 


20

And she


However, the mere fact that somebody taking a


21

job provides evidence that they function at a level that

their demonstrated capacity to engage in their -- in their

Very well, Mr. --

it wouldn't be just a question that the burden would be

In -- in this case if she made it to step five,


Isn't that the case?
MR. LAMKEN:

Because of her age?


That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. 


10

The -- the way the commissioner's grids are set up, they


11

make various assumptions regarding the effects of age, the


12

exertion levels demanded by particular jobs, and other


13

matters.

inquiry to look into the many jobs somebody hasn't done in

15

the past, the step five inquiry sometimes will render --

will deem somebody not -- will deem somebody disabled even


17

though they actually can work.


18

And because it is a somewhat hypothetical


It is precisely because of that reason that


19

Congress provided two measures of capacity to work:

20

highly empirical one, can the person do the jobs they


21

actually have previously done in the past; and second,


22

whether or not the person can engage in the other jobs


23

that they haven't actually done in the past.

the two steps work more accurately together, that's why we

those two steps. 


2

In addition, it also preserves the line between


3

people who become unemployed because of their impairment,

and ones who happen to be fully capable of doing their

past jobs but lose those jobs for whatever reason, such as

either technological obsolescence or they simply choose to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ABRAHAM S. ALTER


12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT


13
14
15
16
17

MR. ALTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please


the Court:

Today the commissioner argues against its own

theme of providing a remedy when someone is disabled.

Congress did, indeed, intend to make a


18

difference, to separate step four, previous work, from


19

step five, or other work, but Congress told us what that


20

separation is.


21

At the fourth step, previous work, age is not a


22

factor, education is not a factor, and prior work


23

experience is not a factor.

24

person wasn't too old to do his job or her job in 1995, we


25

assume they weren't too old to do it in 1996.

This is simply because if a


If a person


13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

had the requisite education and skill level to perform the


2

past job in 1995, then they have the same skill level and


3

education level in 1996.

4

experience is irrelevant at step four because we're


5

talking about the actual job that she did.


6

And of course, prior work


What Congress didn't intend was to pretend that


7

a job that doesn't exist can still be used to deny


8

benefits.

9

concedes that.

It has to be gainful.

10

concedes that.

And it has to exist.


11

Work has to be substantial.

QUESTION:

But your -- no.

The commissioner

The commissioner


It has to exist in


12

substantial numbers in the national economy.

13

-- you're arguing that a job that does exist and that this


14

particular supposedly disabled person used to perform and

15

which is offered to that supposedly disabled person but


16

which that person turns down can, nonetheless, not count


17

against the person's disability.


What you're


18

MR. ALTER:

That is correct, Justice Scalia. 


19

QUESTION:

So it seems to me it's your position


20

that -- that presents a really extraordinary situation. 


21

Let's say I'm a juggler, and I become disabled.

22

and the circus I was a juggler at comes and says, you


23

know, we -- we want you back.

25

that many juggler jobs in the national economy.

We can't find another


There aren't that many because there are not

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And I turn them down.

I say, I'm tired of juggling.

And


2

you say that I'm handicapped even though my -- my prior


3

job is -- is right there waiting for me.

4

an extraordinary result.


That seems to me


5

MR. ALTER:

That is exactly what I'm saying,


6

Judge Scalia -- Justice Scalia.

7

reason I say that is because a person is not disabled or


8

not disabled at any one step of the sequential evaluation. 


9

Your Honor's question focuses on the immediate reason for


I'm sorry.

And the


10

the disengagement of the person from the workforce. 


11

That's not the commissioner's position.

12

the commissioner's position.

13

not disabled because of Ringling Brothers calls them on


14

the phone and says, please, come back. 
 They are disabled

15

by operation of the sequential evaluation.


16

That hasn't been


A person is not disabled or


And the commissioner is the one who promulgated


17

the sequential evaluation.

18

is a recipe with alternating steps regarding medical and


19

vocational factors.

20

QUESTION:

And the sequential evaluation


And --

The commissioner has explained that


21

it's -- using this test, can you perform your most recent


22

job, as a proxy for instead of testing people to see the


23

range of light work that exists in the economy.

24

we're just using this as a shorthand because it's


25

administratively convenient.

They say,


And it's not using it to

say, this person can do this job that's obsolescing,


2

therefore she is not disabled.

3

proxy for other jobs that require the same skill level.


4
5

This particular job is a


Now, what's wrong with taking that position

instead of subjecting people to a whole battery of tests?


6

MR. ALTER:

Justice Ginsburg, your rendition of


7

the commissioner's argument is exactly correct.

8

permitted to ask a question, I would ask myself a proxy


9

for what.

10

12

It is a -- the job doesn't exist.

If I were

18

position where -- and that's our position that happened in


19

this case.

20

would be an unintended consequence of the statute.


21

That's the extreme


And that's a very extreme position.

And it


But Your Honor is absolutely correct that that


22

is their position, that past work, even if it doesn't


23

exist in substantial numbers, is a proxy for her ability


24

to do other work.

25

What other work?


At the fifth step, she's disabled because she


16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

would not be able to make an adjustment to other work

which exists in substantial numbers in the national


3

economy, according to the commissioner's statistics.

5

QUESTION:
commissioner.

6

Well, it's not according to the


It's according to the statute.


Can -- can we focus on the -- on the words of

the statute?

8

physical or mental impairments are of such severity that


9

he is not only unable to do -- not only unable to do his

previous work, but cannot, considering his age, education,


11

and work experience, engage in any other kind of


12

substantial, gainful work which exists in the national


13

economy. 


14

Now, you want to take that last phrase, which

15

exists in the national economy, and attribute it to the


16

earlier phrase, previous work.

17

Congress meant, why wouldn't they just have said that he


18

is unable, considering his age, education, and work


19

experience, to engage in any substantial, gainful work


20

which exists in the national economy?


21

They may just as well have dropped


We don't read statutes to contain words that are

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

superfluous.


2

MR. ALTER:

On the contrary, Your Honor.

The


3

words, any other kind, would be superfluous.

4

indeed, intended to make a difference between previous


5

work and any other kind of work, and that difference is,


6

besides age, education, and prior work experience, which


7

are irrelevant at step five -- they wanted to have the


8

burden on the claimant for disability to show at the first


9

four steps that she is disabled.


10

Congress,


At the fifth step, it is the commissioner who


11

must show that she isn't disabled.

12

words, which exist in the national economy, are in there


13

to begin with because what they wanted to preclude was the


14

commissioner saying, well, you can't do your prior job,

15

but you can be a juggler.


16

QUESTION:

And that's why the


Well, you see -- can we go back for a

Does this -- I


But they're saying their reading makes


Now, this is my understanding of it.

A person


22

has a bad back.

23

but it's not a good thing to have.

So she has a bad back,


24

and we want to know how bad it is.

And they're saying if


25

it's very bad, she automatically is going to get the money


Now, there are bad backs and bad backs,


18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

because at step three they'll look and see and say, look,

this is a pretty bad back.

the end of it.


4

It meets our criteria.

That's


But if it's medium bad, then what they're going


5

to say is, well, first question is can she still do her

last job as an elevator operator.

7

that question is yes, that's the end of it.

And if the answer to


And, therefore, if the answer, however, is no,

then we've to go and gear up our vocational experts.

It seems to me, Your

 So you're not saying it is to that

end because it's the unemployment office that's concerned


16

about people who are out of work because you don't have

concerned about people who are physically hurt or mentally

Mr. Alter, if --if we think the

the years?

MR. ALTER:

There are three answers to that

question, Your Honor.

First of all, I'm -- I'm

crestfallen that -- that the Court would find that there's

ambiguity.

If we think there is. 


And if we're not crestfallen.


Pick up your crest and go on, Mr.


Alter. 


11

(Laughter.) 


12

MR. ALTER:

If the statute is ambiguous, the


13

commissioner's construction must still be reasonable. 


14

Here, I would say it is not reasonable.

Because it -- it begs reality.

The reality is this job

Or at least, we


Mr. Alter, how do you deal with the


19

fact that a number of circuits and, indeed, three judges


20

on this en banc court thought exactly that, that this was


21

an ambiguous regulation, that it had been applied


22

consistently by the Secretary, and that it was entirely


23

reasonable, the -- the notion that your current work is a


24

proxy for can you do light work, that that's a -- not a


25

necessary or inevitable one, but a reasonable one?

it's a proxy to do light work.

Proxy to do light


She wins at light work at step five.

QUESTION:

No.

So again,


Step five in her case we've


6

established is an automatic.

It's not that she's shown


7

that she can't do light work.

The commissioner says,


8

look, when you get to be 55 years old, we're not going to


9

mess with that.

10
11

If you can't do your prior job, that's


it.

But it's the reason why, Your Honor,

because she can't make an adjustment to any jobs.

But to answer your question about the other


20

circuits, the other circuits -- circuits focused on the


21

regulation, focused on the ruling, 82-61.

22

well, it doesn't make a difference whether the job exists. 


23

It's whether you can do that job.

On your argument, I take it -- you're going now

back to the statute -- that new regulation is an

impermissible construction of the statute.

The first one has been precluded by Your Honor's question,

that Chevron deference will only apply to an agency's

assert that if Chevron means that if we find some sort of

QUESTION:

If the agency

regulatory approach is kind of an administrative shortcut

for finding out whether this employee is basically able to

7

MR. ALTER:

And from former


I would argue, Your Honor, that it


8

is not reasonable in any -- by any stretch of the word


9

because may I remind, Your Honor, that we're talking about


10

a job which may not exist at all, and a finding that a


11

person is not disabled because they're capable of doing a


12

job that doesn't exist can't be reasonable.

13

I -- I say that --


14

QUESTION:

Why is that?

If we take --


What does -- what does

16

a -- is a physical condition, and they say if you can do

the job you used to do, you're not disabled.

The word is disabled, not unemployed.

could adjust to is a job which may not exist.


12

Once she has a severe impairment, Your Honor can

bring up unemployment for the rest of the session, but
