ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PERRY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Affirming the judgment below would authorize

11
12

private securities fraud class actions against every

13

service provider that participates in the drafting of a

14

public company's prospectus.

15

less than a frontal assault on this Court's decisions in

16

Central Bank and Stoneridge.

It is, therefore, nothing

In those cases, Your Honors, this Court held

17
18

that service providers may not be sued primarily in

19

private class actions and left that matter for Congress

20

to resolve.

21

twice, but three times, to those decisions.

22

And Congress did respond, not once, not

First, in the PSLRA, the Congress authorized

23

a Federal action, a government action, only against

24

aiders and abettors, leaving the question of private

25

class actions for this Court's resolution.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, is -- who's the

violator alleged here?

briefs?

4

itself did not make the false statement, that the two

5

appellants did, that they are the actual speakers

6

because they were talking about their activities, and

7

they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market.

8

That's, I think, what they're alleging.

As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus

MR. PERRY:

9

Not in the complaint, but in the

Justice Sotomayor, the

10

challenged statements appear in the prospectuses for the

11

Janus Funds, separate legal entities not parties to this

12

lawsuit.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do we sustain the

14

intermediary cases when the company, through market

15

analysts, divulges misleading statements?

16

about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the

17

company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't

18

have scienter.

19

MR. PERRY:

We don't talk

Your Honor, the company -

20

excuse me -- the conduit or analyst cases fall under two

21

categories, neither of which is met here.

22

First, they are a scheme between the

23

company -- orchestrated by the company to distribute its

24

information through the analysts to the market, and they

25

are brought under 10b-5(a) as scheme cases.
4
Alderson Reporting Company

That is

Official

1

most of the analyst cases.

2

in this case.

There is no 10b-5(a) claim

This is only a 10b-5(b) "making" claim.

Second, those few cases, the analyst cases,

3
4

that are brought under (b) involve an omission; that is,

5

the company has failed to correct a statement made by an

6

analyst where there is a duty to do so.

7

omission claim in this case because there is no duty -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8
9

There is no

But what's the

difference between an omission or a commission if a

10

company purposely divulges a falsehood to an analyst,

11

knowing it's going to be distributed in toto?

12

making the false statement, the analyst or the company?
MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, the company makes

the statement to the market.

21

issue.

22

That's a different

I accept that.
But under their theory, why isn't the

23

appellants the primary violator, not even a secondary?

24

Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to

25

find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that

1

it didn't make the false statements, that all of this

2

was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the

3

only violator.
MR. PERRY:

4

Your Honor, the analyst cases,

5

the issuer speaks to the market directly.

6

is an intervening legal entity, the Janus Funds.

7

Scienter or no scienter, that is a separate

8

corporation -
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Here, there

Do you mean to say to me

10

that puppets become a legal defense for someone who

11

intentionally manipulates the market information?
MR. PERRY:

12

Justice Sotomayor, the Congress

13

has drafted two statutes that deal with puppets.

14

Section 20(b), which these plaintiffs have not invoked,

15

makes it unlawful for one party to do indirectly what it

16

would not be permitted to do directly.

17

puppet statute, the ventriloquist dummy statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18
19

That's the

That's the control

person statute?
MR. PERRY:

20

No.

There's also 20(a), which

21

is the control person statute, also not invoked by these

22

plaintiffs.
Those are forms of secondary liability, Your

23
24

Honor.

In fact, the Court's questions go to the

25

distinction between primary and secondary liability.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I -- but if Janus

2

had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know

3

that the statements were false, they had no way of

4

knowing, because as I understand the complaint -- and

5

this is alleged -- the deal was secret.

6

could not be a primary violator.
MR. PERRY:

7

So Janus itself

Who is?

Justice Sotomayor, our position

8

is nobody had scienter, and every adjudicator to look at

9

these facts -- Judge Motz in the district court, the ALJ

10

of the SEC -- has found that there was no scienter

11

anywhere up and down the line.

12

somebody didn't have scienter doesn't answer the problem

13

here.

The question -
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

So the fact that

Well, somebody deviated

15

from what was the announced policy, that there was to be

16

no market timers investing in this -- in these Janus

17

funds.

18

funds would be allowed to engage in that activity.

19

was that somebody?

20

Somebody made the decision that certain hedge

MR. PERRY:

Who

The adviser personnel made the

21

determination, Justice Ginsburg, that the policy was

22

discretionary, that when it said we may refuse trades,

discretion -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the statement

The SEC -
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

But can -- can we discuss

15

the case, and -- and perhaps you don't think so.

16

we discuss this case, must we not discuss this case, on

17

the theory that JCM's scienter, JCM's knowledge of a

18

false statement, is a given in the case?
Now, maybe you'll be able to prove

19
20

otherwise.

23
24
25

You say that they're not liable anyway.
MR. PERRY:

That is the theory pleaded in the complaint.

MR. PERRY:

2

Your Honor, for different

3

reasons.

They can sue JCM for -- for an omission,

4

because there's a duty that runs from JCM to the funds.

5

That was the theory advanced in that separate lawsuit

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought they were

in-house lawyers?
MR. PERRY:

3

They are in-house lawyers at

4

JCM, but they also represent the funds, and the SEC has

5

specifically recognized in the context of investment

6

companies that where an adviser counsel is representing

7

the funds, his client or her client, for those purposes,

8

is the funds.

purposes.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let's say that JCM's

12

principal officers and managers wrote the statement.

13

You still say there's no liability?

14

MR. PERRY:

Absolutely, Justice Kennedy,

15

becomes the issuer's statement.

Is there an alternate

theory that JCM is really the day-to-day managers in

same for purposes of making the statement?

that's different from, say, an outside law firm or an

4

auditor?
MR. PERRY:

5

Your Honor, the word "control"

6

appears more than a hundred times in the briefs on the

7

plaintiff's side of this case in this Court, and the

8

Congress has dealt with control.

9

a separate cause of action against those who control

10

Section 20(a) provides

another entity.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

Except that I, as I read

12

your brief -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- you

13

were arguing that because there was an independent board

14

of directors, presumably because there are two

15

corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different

16

corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person

17

liability under 20(a).

18

reading your brief, that's what you were alleging.

You seem -- that -- I thought,

19

So you can't have your cake and eat it, too.

20

Either the independence of the board makes no difference

21

or it does.

22

So which is your position?
MR. PERRY:

Our position, Your Honor, is

23

that the Congress has dealt with the situation where you

24

have two separate companies, and to make a claim against

25

the second company, you have to prove control.

had control over the everyday affairs of the company,

lawyers who helped draft it, wouldn't be a control

9

person?

10

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, the investment

11

company, the mutual funds, are separately owned,

12

separately governed.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you -

14

you're -- if they can't be control persons because

15

they're separate companies, then how do they escape

16

being primary violators?

service provider like every other service provider.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand this

-- and I want to know.

21

That's an obvious, naive question, and I'd like an

22

answer that anyone could understand.

23

MR. PERRY:

The answer is, Your Honor:

24

These funds are managed -- "governed," excuse me, is a

25

better word -- by the trustees.

That is disclosed in

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these documents.

In fact, the documents say -- it's at

2

page 258a of the Joint Appendix -- the trustees are

3

responsible for all the policies.
They have outsourced, if you will, certain

4
5

functions, operational functions:

6

which stock to sell, which transfer agent to hire.

7

Those are functions that could be kept in house or could

8

be outsourced.
JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Which stock to buy,

I get it.

In other words,

10

you're saying, on the papers here, it's -- it's the

11

trustees that manage everything.

12

MR. PERRY:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

That govern everything.
That govern everything, and

these are like helpers?

15

MR. PERRY:

Well, they're -- they're -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

They do a lot as helpers.

17

Now, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible

18

distinction, what about this distinction:

19

managers of a fund, even though they are outsourced

20

people brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders

21

or abettors, if -- following criminal law here -- if -

22

they are principals if they get the false statement to

23

the public through a conduit, the conduit being an

24

entity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the

25

statement.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

That the

Official

1
2

That's LaFave on criminal law.

What is -

what about that?
MR. PERRY:

3

Three answers.

First, that's

4

dealt with in section 20(b), which is the ventriloquist

5

dummy statute that these plaintiffs didn't invoke.
Second, the Congress looked at this very

6
7

question in 1938 and 1939, when there were proposals to

8

merge the management, the adviser function, with the

9

funds, to make them one unitary entity.

And in the

10

Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment

11

Advisers Act of 1940, the Congress elected not do that.
As this Court has recognized, it chose not

12
13

to require compulsory internalization of the management

14

function.

15

therefore, when you have separate companies, under State

16

law -- again, my client is a Delaware limited liability

17

corporation.

18

trusts.

19

ownership, no joint governance -

It allowed this separate entity.

The funds are Massachusetts business

You're -
Could you -

You're not suggesting,

are you, that they did this for purposes of protecting

24

your client from a lawsuit?

25

MR. PERRY:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.
23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When it -- no, they did

2

it for a business reason, that having separate entities

3

was economically more useful for the market, correct?
MR. PERRY:

4

And every fund, or virtually

5

every fund in -- in the United States, is set up this

6

way.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. PERRY:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

And, again -

MR. PERRY:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

So -- but that doesn't

answer Justice Breyer's question, now.

11

13

All right.

My third -
Assuming that they

didn't do it for that reason, what does it mean?
MR. PERRY:

My -- my third answer is that

15

extensive regulatory involvement in the two Acts enacted

16

in 1940 specifically to regulate this industry, the

17

Congress never made the decision to hold the adviser

18

liable for the fund's conduct.

19

In fact, no statute says that, and the SEC

20

has never taken that position.

21

in any of the briefs -- they have 234 pages, 138 cases.

22

Not one holds an investment adviser liable for

23

statements of the fund's prospectuses.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

When the -

hypothetical you gave where the president gives an

2

innocent board of directors false information and the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

So what you're saying is

12

that the -- the agency relation that the president of

13

the company holds is different that than the agency

14

relation that JCM holds?
MR. PERRY:

15
16

Absolutely right, Your Honor,

and that's a distinction -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

MR. PERRY:

Why is that?

It's grounded in State law, and

it differs between one company and two companies.

Okay.

It's attached as an appendix to

our brief -- which sets forth the things that JCM is an

10

agent for investment operations, not an agent

12

sales, complying with the Federal securities laws,

13

preparing and issuing the prospectus.

the definition of "make" under the SEC's interpretation,

18

which is entitled to deference, as being to create or to

compose or to accept as one's own.

20

it depends on the context of "make."

about making heaven and earth, yes, that means to

create, but if you're talking about making a

validity of that statement, whether that's deceptive in

1

different question.

I understood your theory of the

2

case to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they

3

put it in the prospectus.
MR. FREDERICK:

4

And what they did was to

5

falsely represent what they would do with that

6

statement.

I would direct the Court to paragraph 5.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

Well, that's the

8

question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg

9

the question -- is that they falsely represented.

The

10

issue is whether or not something happened between their

11

drafting and its appearance in the prospectus that makes

12

it appropriate to say that that's a statement of the

13

trust rather than a statement of JCM.
MR. FREDERICK:

14

It is a statement of both,

15

in the sense that the fund is attracting investors, but

16

the fund is managed and controlled by the investment

17

manager; here, JCM.

If -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

But if JCM falsely

19

represented what it would do, it made that false

20

representation to the fund, and the fund, as has been

21

acknowledged, would have a cause of action against JCM.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

example.

What is it that -- I'm

That's why I use the oil company

Plain, ordinary -- the top executives in the

They give it to

2

a board that doesn't know it's false, and the board puts

3

it out in its name.
Now, it seems to me it ought to be clear at

this point in securities law whether those -- the

Then their

16

response to that is:

17

the oil company, and the reason that it's not is

18

something to do with the nature of the -- the obligation

that runs between the managers and the fund, which is

point, we get into a problem, and the problem is how do

12

we distinguish an aider or abettor from a principal?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

An -
At that point, I am

15

uncertain indeed, and that's why I put out this for

16

comment, this suggestion that you follow criminal law

17

here and say at least they're a principal if they have a

18

high position, they participate in it, they do all these

19

things you say, and the entity that they're fooling in

the first instance is simply a conduit, and, therefore,

you cannot say it's a scheme, because this other part of

the scheme wasn't part of it.

But the distinction you're

8

drawing is between making the statement and assisting in

making the statement.

10

Isn't that -- isn't that what you

just said?
MR. FREDERICK:

11

Well, no, in the sense that

we believe, and we assert in the complaint and the

13

complaint is adequately pleaded, is that JCM made the

statements.

Now, to be -

is assisting in making these statements as if -- as in

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what is the difference,

20

something more, that it was just a creature of JCM.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In that connection, Mr.

MR. GANNON:

It's not simple, Justice

Scalia, in light of the PSLRA, which requires it to be

alleged with particularity.

sufficient to give rise to a strong inference that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There need to be facts

And -- and there are

You think attribution to

19

the actor is not necessary for the actor's liability for

20

a statement?

21

MR. GANNON:

That's correct.

We think that

22

-- and any other rule would immunize falsely attributed

23

or anonymous statements.

24

fraud was to convince somebody that this statement came

25

from Warren Buffett, so that I could turn a quick buck

And if the whole purpose of a

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

before the market realized that it wasn't actually from

2

Warren Buffett, the fact that it was not attributed to

3

me would not change the fact that I had made the

4

statement and that the market had relied upon it.
The truth is that reasonable investors -

5
6

and that's the test for purposes of reliance -- can rely

7

on anonymous and falsely attributed statements.

8

instance, there's no reason to doubt that an investor

9

would have relied on statements in the prospectus about

In this

10

the fund's purported anti-market timing and excessive

11

trading policies.

12

general, there doesn't need to be an attribution

13

requirement, but in this instance, it's quite clear that

14

a reasonable investor could have relied on

15

these statements in the prospectus.

And so, we think that there -- in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Counsel, could you have

17

-- you just admitted if there -- if the company was

18

duped, you couldn't have aiding and abetting liability.

19

Could you impose a 20(a) or 20(b) control person

20

liability?
MR. GANNON:

21

The control person liability

22

also needs to have a primary violator under the terms of

23

20(a).

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Gannon, suppose that we

1

recite on page 13 is really pretty broad and that it

2

might apply to a range of factual situations that are

3

not before us.

4

just to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how

5

would you do that?

Is there a way to confine our holding

MR. GANNON:

6

Well, I think the easiest way

7

would be to analogize it to the cases involving

8

corporate employees.

9

are cases where a corporate employee drafts a statement

As Petitioners acknowledge, there

10

that's issued in the company's name.

In this instance,

11

the investment adviser is management for the company,

12

and the fact that they happen to be management by virtue

13

of contract rather than just the internal arrangements

14

of the corporation shouldn't change that arrangement.
It -- it's also the case that if the Court

15
16

were -- were looking for a way to narrow its holding, it

17

could do so by talking about the elements of the 10b-5

18

cause of action, which -- which would apply only to

19

private suits and -- and not to enforcement actions

20

brought by the Commission or by the Department of

21

Justice.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your point is that -
Well, it should change

24

that, because Congress has made it very clear that

25

investment advisers are not to be treated like
59
Alderson Reporting Company

employees.

You -- you want us to undo a clear

2

distinction that Congress has made.

3

MR. GANNON:

Well, the -- the statute says

4

that if somebody -- any person makes the false statement

5

directly or indirectly -- and in this instance, the SEC

6

sought -- got a cease-and-desist order that's reprinted

7

at -- on page 407 in the joint appendix that was

8

predicated on a provision of the Investment Company Act,
