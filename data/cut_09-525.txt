ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. PERRY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PERRY:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Affirming the judgment below would authorize

11
12

private securities fraud class actions against every

13

service provider that participates in the drafting of a

14

public company's prospectus.

15

less than a frontal assault on this Court's decisions in

16

Central Bank and Stoneridge.

It is, therefore, nothing

In those cases, Your Honors, this Court held

17
18

that service providers may not be sued primarily in

19

private class actions and left that matter for Congress

20

to resolve.

21

twice, but three times, to those decisions.

22

And Congress did respond, not once, not

First, in the PSLRA, the Congress authorized

23

class actions for this Court's resolution.

4

itself did not make the false statement, that the two

5

appellants did, that they are the actual speakers

6

because they were talking about their activities, and

7

they used Janus as a conduit to deceive the market.

8

That's, I think, what they're alleging.

As I read the briefs, they claim that Janus

Justice Sotomayor, the

challenged statements appear in the prospectuses for the

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how do we sustain the

14

intermediary cases when the company, through market

15

analysts, divulges misleading statements?

16

about the market analysts' falsity; we talk about the

17

company's falsity, because the market analysts didn't

18

have scienter.

19

MR. PERRY:

We don't talk

Your Honor, the company -­

20

excuse me -- the conduit or analyst cases fall under two

21

categories, neither of which is met here.

22

First, they are a scheme between the

23

company -- orchestrated by the company to distribute its

24

information through the analysts to the market, and they

25

are brought under 10b-5(a) as scheme cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

most of the analyst cases.

2

in this case.

There is no 10b-5(a) claim

This is only a 10b-5(b) "making" claim.

Second, those few cases, the analyst cases,

3
4

that are brought under (b) involve an omission; that is,

5

the company has failed to correct a statement made by an

6

analyst where there is a duty to do so.

But what's the

difference between an omission or a commission if a

22

That's a different

I accept that.
But under their theory, why isn't the

23

Because they -- they claim, I think -- and I'm going to

25

find out from them -- that Janus had no scienter, that

it didn't make the false statements, that all of this

2

was done in secret by the appellants, so they were the

3

only violator.
MR. PERRY:

4

Your Honor, the analyst cases,

5

the issuer speaks to the market directly.

6

is an intervening legal entity, the Janus Funds.

7

Scienter or no scienter, that is a separate

8

corporation -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Here, there

Do you mean to say to me

10

that puppets become a legal defense for someone who

11

intentionally manipulates the market information?
MR. PERRY:

12

Justice Sotomayor, the Congress

13

has drafted two statutes that deal with puppets.

14

Section 20(b), which these plaintiffs have not invoked,

15

makes it unlawful for one party to do indirectly what it

16

would not be permitted to do directly.

17

puppet statute, the ventriloquist dummy statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18
19

That's the

That's the control

person statute?
MR. PERRY:

20

No.

There's also 20(a), which

21

is the control person statute, also not invoked by these

22

plaintiffs.
Those are forms of secondary liability, Your

23
24

Honor.

In fact, the Court's questions go to the

25

distinction between primary and secondary liability.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I -- but if Janus

2

had no scienter, if its board of directors did not know

3

that the statements were false, they had no way of

4

knowing, because as I understand the complaint -- and

5

this is alleged -- the deal was secret.

6

could not be a primary violator.
MR. PERRY:

7

So Janus itself

Who is?

Justice Sotomayor, our position

8

is nobody had scienter, and every adjudicator to look at

9

these facts -- Judge Motz in the district court, the ALJ

10

of the SEC -- has found that there was no scienter

11

anywhere up and down the line.

12

somebody didn't have scienter doesn't answer the problem

13

here.

The question -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

So the fact that

Well, somebody deviated

15

from what was the announced policy, that there was to be

16

false statement, is a given in the case?
Now, maybe you'll be able to prove

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

Except that I, as I read

12

your brief -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- you

13

were arguing that because there was an independent board

14

of directors, presumably because there are two

15

corporate -- different corporate funds -- two different

16

corporate forms, that there couldn't be control person

17

liability under 20(a).

reading your brief, that's what you were alleging.

Either the independence of the board makes no difference

or it does.

that the Congress has dealt with the situation where you

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand this

-- and I want to know.

21

That's an obvious, naive question, and I'd like an

22

answer that anyone could understand.

23

MR. PERRY:

The answer is, Your Honor:

24

These funds are managed -- "governed," excuse me, is a

25

better word -- by the trustees.

That is disclosed in

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these documents.

In fact, the documents say -- it's at

2

page 258a of the Joint Appendix -- the trustees are

3

responsible for all the policies.
They have outsourced, if you will, certain

4
5

functions, operational functions:

6

which stock to sell, which transfer agent to hire.

7

Those are functions that could be kept in house or could

8

be outsourced.
JUSTICE BREYER:

9

Which stock to buy,

I get it.

In other words,

10

you're saying, on the papers here, it's -- it's the

11

trustees that manage everything.

12

MR. PERRY:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

That govern everything.
That govern everything, and

these are like helpers?

15

MR. PERRY:

Well, they're -- they're -­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

They do a lot as helpers.

17

Now, let me suggest to you, if that's one possible

18

distinction, what about this distinction:

19

managers of a fund, even though they are outsourced

20

people brought in, are liable as principals, not aiders

21

or abettors, if -- following criminal law here -- if -­

22

they are principals if they get the false statement to

23

the public through a conduit, the conduit being an

24

entity or person that is unaware of the falsity of the

25

statement.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

That the

Official

1
2

That's LaFave on criminal law.

What is -­

what about that?
MR. PERRY:

3

Three answers.

First, that's

4

dealt with in section 20(b), which is the ventriloquist

5

dummy statute that these plaintiffs didn't invoke.
Second, the Congress looked at this very

6
7

question in 1938 and 1939, when there were proposals to

8

merge the management, the adviser function, with the

9

funds, to make them one unitary entity.

And in the

10

Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment

11

Advisers Act of 1940, the Congress elected not do that.
As this Court has recognized, it chose not

12
13

to require compulsory internalization of the management

14

function.

15

therefore, when you have separate companies, under State

16

law -- again, my client is a Delaware limited liability

17

corporation.

18

trusts.

19

ownership, no joint governance -­

It allowed this separate entity.

The funds are Massachusetts business

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When it -- no, they did

2

it for a business reason, that having separate entities

3

was economically more useful for the market, correct?
MR. PERRY:

5

every fund in -- in the United States, is set up this

6

way.

MR. PERRY:

So -- but that doesn't

answer Justice Breyer's question, now.

11

13

All right.

My third -­
Assuming that they

didn't do it for that reason, what does it mean?
MR. PERRY:

My -- my third answer is that

15

extensive regulatory involvement in the two Acts enacted

16

in 1940 specifically to regulate this industry, the

17

Congress never made the decision to hold the adviser

18

liable for the fund's conduct.

19

In fact, no statute says that, and the SEC

20

has never taken that position.

21

in any of the briefs -- they have 234 pages, 138 cases.

22

Not one holds an investment adviser liable for

23

statements of the fund's prospectuses.

different question.

I understood your theory of the

case to be that JCM is liable, basically, because they

put it in the prospectus.

5

falsely represent what they would do with that

statement.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

Well, that's the

8

question, I guess, that -- your response seems to beg

9

the question -- is that they falsely represented.

The

10

issue is whether or not something happened between their

11

drafting and its appearance in the prospectus that makes

12

it appropriate to say that that's a statement of the

13

trust rather than a statement of JCM.
MR. FREDERICK:

14

It is a statement of both,

15

in the sense that the fund is attracting investors, but

16

the fund is managed and controlled by the investment

17

manager; here, JCM.

If -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

But if JCM falsely

19

represented what it would do, it made that false

20

representation to the fund, and the fund, as has been

You think attribution to

21

MR. GANNON:

That's correct.

We think that

22

-- and any other rule would immunize falsely attributed

23

or anonymous statements.

24

fraud was to convince somebody that this statement came

25

from Warren Buffett, so that I could turn a quick buck

And if the whole purpose of a

1

before the market realized that it wasn't actually from

2

Warren Buffett, the fact that it was not attributed to

3

me would not change the fact that I had made the

4

statement and that the market had relied upon it.
The truth is that reasonable investors -­

5
6

and that's the test for purposes of reliance -- can rely

7

on anonymous and falsely attributed statements.

8

instance, there's no reason to doubt that an investor

9

would have relied on statements in the prospectus about

12

general, there doesn't need to be an attribution

requirement, but in this instance, it's quite clear that

14

a reasonable investor could have relied on

15

these statements in the prospectus.

And so, we think that there -- in

Could you impose a 20(a) or 20(b) control person

MR. GANNON:

21

The control person liability

22

also needs to have a primary violator under the terms of

20(a).

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Gannon, suppose that we

recite on page 13 is really pretty broad and that it

2

might apply to a range of factual situations that are

3

not before us.

4

just to the mutual fund situation, and if there is, how

5

would you do that?

Is there a way to confine our holding

MR. GANNON:

6

Well, I think the easiest way

7

would be to analogize it to the cases involving

8

corporate employees.

9

are cases where a corporate employee drafts a statement

As Petitioners acknowledge, there

10

that's issued in the company's name.

In this instance,

11

the investment adviser is management for the company,

12

and the fact that they happen to be management by virtue

13

of contract rather than just the internal arrangements

14

of the corporation shouldn't change that arrangement.
It -- it's also the case that if the Court

15
16

were -- were looking for a way to narrow its holding, it

17

could do so by talking about the elements of the 10b-5

18

cause of action, which -- which would apply only to

19

private suits and -- and not to enforcement actions

20

brought by the Commission or by the Department of

21

Justice.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your point is that -­
Well, it should change

24

that, because Congress has made it very clear that

25

investment advisers are not to be treated like

employees.

You -- you want us to undo a clear

2

distinction that Congress has made.

3

MR. GANNON:

Well, the -- the statute says

4

that if somebody -- any person makes the false statement

5

directly or indirectly -- and in this instance, the SEC

6

sought -- got a cease-and-desist order that's reprinted

7

at -- on page 407 in the joint appendix that was

8

predicated on a provision of the Investment Company Act,

section 34(b), that -- that tracks 10(b) and makes it
