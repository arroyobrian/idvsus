ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BIBAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

As the Government concedes, INA subsection

and those who don't.

Under Landgraf, applying that

20

would lose an ability they had under pre-IIRIRA law

21

based on pre-IIRIRA offenses.

The settled expectations at issue here are

These are people who have structured their

lives here.

They have homes, spouses, children, and

careers here and, yet, have a settled expectation that

they will be able to maintain ties to visit aged and

Our amici,

As far as going forward

10

is concerned, that's -- that's just the way it is,

11

right?

12

MR. BIBAS:

Yes, because Congress has

13

expressly changed the law post-IIRIRA.

14

for those before IIRIRA, whether those settled

15

expectations are being disrupted.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is,

Could they -- could

17

they -- the person who -- who is here and then the new

18

law is passed -- could that person have petitioned for

19

discretionary relief before traveling?
MR. BIBAS:

20

Yes, Your Honor, that is a

21

possibility.

That is not the same as the automatic

22

ability to travel, and, in fact, in this case the

23

discretionary relief was denied.

ability to travel.

out whether to go ahead and rob the bank is going to

6

I won't be able to take temporary trips abroad; so, I'm

7

not going to rob the bank.

MR. BIBAS:

First of all,

you phrased it specifically as a reliance argument,

10

which is an alternative.

11

it's not a prerequisite.

12

No, Your Honor.

Even the Government concedes

Second, the right time to look at

13

expectations is the moment before the law is enacted:

14

Does one have an expectation at that point that one will

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you're

17

concerned under Landgraf, I think, with whether or not

18

it disrupts settled expectations.

21

of the crime, not the pleading guilty, takes place.

13

14

things, he wouldn't -- he wouldn't have this consequence

from his conduct.

MR. BIBAS:

The person who commits the

Congress, of course, has the

17

power to change things, but the expectation until an Act

is passed is that the consequences are fixed in time.

19

And if Congress decides that the potential unfairness is

outweighed by the benefits of making the Act

21

retroactive --

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the person who -- who

commits the crime just after the Act is passed had the

I concurred separately in Landgraf because I

16

thought that the test that the Court was using,

17

upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper

18

test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post

19

facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from,

20

Justice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire

21

constitutional case.

22

But I said in my concurrence that the proper

23

test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity,

24

namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean

25

to be applied only in the future or in the past?
7

And

1

for that, I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said

2

in Altmann:

3

"Our approach" -- which postdates Landgraf.

"Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus

5

parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the

6

concurrence in Landgraf."

8

the rule affects 'vested rights,' or governs substance

9

or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity

"'The critical issue ... is not whether

Absent clear statement

11

otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs

Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct, and

14

hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct

MR. BIBAS:

pointing out is there is a future --

Why do you say that's the

majority's approach?

14

MR. BIBAS:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What we have

Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it

5

different then from a felon in possession statute, where

6

you look at the past offense --

7

MR. BIBAS:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

-- and then you say, well,

this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun
in the future?

11
12

Right.

How is it different at all?

MR. BIBAS:
pertinent distinctions.

13

Your Honor, there are five
Permit me to unpack.

The first and most important is that the

14

Landgraf test should have a broader scope than the ex

15

post facto context in these criminal cases because

16

Congress can override it expressly.

17

Since the ex post facto clauses disable both

18

State and Federal legislatures from acting at all, the

19

deprivation of power must be narrow and careful so State

20

and Federal legislatures can continue to regulate felon

21

in possession or racketeering or the other crimes the

22

Government advances.

23

But Landgraf just tells Congress how to

24

legislate.

It's a background rule.

25

to have a presumption against retroactivity sweep more
10

Alderson Reporting Company

So, it's legitimate

Official

1

broadly, as Congress is free to override it and, as I

2

will explain, does override it regularly.

3

Secondly, felon in possession is inherently

4

dangerous conduct.

5

just a punitive or deterrent law.

6

This is a protective law.

It's not

The third and related point is that felon in

7

possession laws are tailored.

8

danger, a threat to people suffering firearm -- it's

9

narrowly tailored.

Fourth --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

There's a nexus to a

Well, why isn't the -- the

11

government, Congress, making the exact same judgment

12

here?

13

Congress is making a judgment that we do not want

14

dangerous people to enter, and we're using the

15

conviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who is

16

dangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in

17

the felon in possession statute.

18

If the activity to be regulated is entry, and

MR. BIBAS:

Your Honor, I believe the two

19

are quite different.

Felon in possession is limited to

20

firearms in the hands of proven dangerous people.

21

we have a law that says you can stay in the country

22

indefinitely; we're going to discourage you from going

23

abroad and leaving the country because we'll make it

24

harder for you to come back.

25

to protecting the people inside the United States.

Here

That's not tailored at all

11

Alderson Reporting Company

I'd also point out that the felon in

possession statute, as this Court noted in Heller, is

part of a long tradition of forbidding such activity as

a crime.

And the final one is Congress can do that

So, it's hard to say there are settled

simply by being explicit, and it has done so repeatedly

in laws such as IIRIRA.

than a dozen other times in IIRIRA, as this Court noted

13

in St. Cyr.

14

this --

It knew how to do it; it did it more

It didn't spell it out here.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

The point of

How about the career

16

criminal enhancements, instead of the felon in

17

possession?

18

can Congress put on anyone with respect to future

19

conduct if it's going to be a burden?

20

it stops people from traveling.

21

statutes put on the distinct disadvantage of a longer

22

sentence.

23

And assuming your arguments, what limits

MR. BIBAS:

Under your view,

Career criminal

Yes, Your Honor, and as we

24

noted, in the criminal context, this Court in Witte and

25

Gryger notes it's a heavier punishment on the new crime
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

because it's aggravated, because it's repeated.

2

because Congress has more leeway in the ex post facto

3

context and because recidivism enhancements have a long

4

tradition, it's entirely legitimate.

5

say that that's punishing the past offense because the

6

future offense -- it --- it's permissible to increase it

7

under the Ex Post Facto Clause.

8

And

There's no need to

And that's an inquiry that's different from

9

the Landgraf test here because all Congress has to do is

10

spell out expressly we want to apply this to convictions

11

entered before, on, or after the statute's effective

12

date, which it did in 321(b), which it didn't do here.

13

So, if we were looking at the function of --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does that argument that

15

you've just made go more to whether or not the BIA's

16

conclusion that Congress intended to rescind the Fleuti

17

decision -- but you assume that's what its intent was?

18
19
20

MR. BIBAS:

We've assumed arguendo because

that's the premise of the question presented.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

So, if we assume that,

21

if we assume that was Congress's intent, doesn't that

22

start -- give you the conclusion?

to undo it, doesn't that prove that they intended to

Congress can

intend to rescind -- to -- to abrogate a statute such

that it will have no effect going forward, but as this

rule that the public and Congress expect is that new

laws will apply prospectively.

It

If you think it's beneficial to make this

But it


So, to go back to our primary point, with

the practical impact or effect being a new travel


10

disability, the Government's argument seems to boil down

11

to that, because there is one event that must happen

12

after the statute's effective date, therefore there can

13

be no retroactive effect.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that event is the

15

event that the government cares about, which is the

16

entry into the country.

17

know, the government says -- just picks an event at

18

random and -- and makes it the trigger mechanism.

19

government has picked the event that it wants to

20

regulate, which is entry.

21

MR. BIBAS:

It's not as though the -- you

The

Yes, Your Honor, but this is an

22

effect test, and under Martin v. Hadix and Landgraf, we

have to take a commonsense functional view of what the

24

effects are, the new legal consequences.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

your answer to my colleague would be:

in order to encourage the individual to leave.

5

Why would -- why would the Government
care -- it's a question for them, I'm sure.

Why would

10

they care whether somebody that they don't want to be

11

here stays here?

12

So, I would have thought your argument -- your answer

13

would be, no, what they're trying to regulate is not the

14

coming and going, but simply the staying.

15

It seems to me the exact opposite.

MR. BIBAS:

Yes, Your Honor, you're right

16

that, particularly given the strange way in which it's

17

written, it's hard to understand it as something other

18

than a penalty and possibly a deterrent, but certainly a

19

penalty based on past crimes, to make life

20

uncomfortable.

21

forward-looking exclusive function, if that's the test.

And that does not speak of a protective,

There are often adverse effects upon

Now, the final point here, I believe there

was some reference earlier to reliance in the offense.

prerequisite.

The operative issue

We don't claim that there's a

decision to plead guilty, as a practical matter, the

defendants weigh a number of consequences.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, you draw the line --

7

your position is that only those who have entered a

guilty plea are entitled to the presumption against

9

non-retroactivity, but not those who've been found

10

guilty?

11

MR. BIBAS:

Your Honor, our primary position

12

is that because reliance isn't necessary, all of them

benefit from it because they all have settled

expectations.

was still retroactivity because the settled expectations

4

were disrupted because there were new consequences

5

attached to pre-enactment conduct.

6

But Landgraf and

So, regardless of whether there is reliance,

there are settled expectations that are upset by a law

My client --

We're trying to figure out

11

what Congress intended, right?

And your argument is the reasonable expectation of

Congress when they passed this was that it would only

apply to -- to people who, what, committed the crime or

17

were convicted after the statute passed --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC D. MILLER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

5

As the discussion so far this morning

6

reveals, the Court's retroactivity analysis takes

7

account of a number of different factors, but the one

8

that is most significant and, indeed in this case,

9

virtually dispositive is that the application of section

10

1101(a)(13) to Petitioner was triggered only because he

11

engaged in voluntary conduct that postdated the

12

enactment of the statute.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What do you take the trigger

14

to be?

15

the trigger being the trip.

history shows that it's the crossing the border that has

15

always been regarded as a legally significant event.

most important point about the consequence of the plea

is that, as an immediate result of the plea under

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

consequence for me?

11

will I still be able to visit my mother in Greece?

12

should the lawyer -- what should the lawyer at that time

13

have answered?

said, by pleading guilty, you are making yourself

inadmissible to the United States.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then you wake up the next morning, and

8

Congress has passed a statute, and now you're not able

to take short trips to visit your mother.

11

So, something

very real has happened to the life of this person.
MR. MILLER:

That's -- that's right, I mean,

12

and there is no question but that there is a serious

13

consequence as a result of the change in the law.

14

the Court has made clear in Landgraf and in a number of

15

other cases that even uncontroversially prospective

16

statutes can impose burdens.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But

That's true, but in -- in

18

St. Cyr, as I read it, on pages 322 and 23, the Court

19

focused directly, not on the crime point of time, but

20

the time of the guilty plea.

21

there is that a person who is thinking of pleading

guilty might well have taken into account the fact that

he could ask the Attorney General later when he's about

key question?

mean, I suppose you could prove that the only thing that

mattered to -- to LPRs who plead guilty, the only thing

that mattered, was visiting their parents and

grandparents, a matter I doubt; but, you can say, even

is through showing a conviction, does your distinction

stand up at all?

7

MR. MILLER:

I mean, there is still, I

8

think, a significant formal distinction, and then

9

there's also another important distinction from St. Cyr,

10

which is that that was a case where, as a result of the

faced immediate deportability with no prospect of

And I think that the significance of this

4

post-enactment conduct, the significance of the trip, is

5

illustrated by this Court's decision in

6

Fernandez-Vargas, which made clear that when you have --

7

when the application of the statute is within the

8

control of the person to whom it's being applied,

9

because he has to do something after it comes into

10

effect -- there, it was choosing to remain in the United

11

States and becoming subject to the reinstatement of a

12

prior order of removal -- here, it's taking the travel.

13

But that goes a long way towards establishing that it

14

doesn't have a retroactive effect, that it's regulating

15

future conduct.

nothing in your control to change that act once the

2

MR. MILLER:

In Fernandez-Vargas, the

3

conduct that subjected the alien to the application of

4

this -- this procedural -- this disadvantageous removal

5

procedure was remaining in the United States.

6

And it's true that that conduct was

7

unlawful, but for purposes of the retroactivity

8

analysis, the Court didn't focus on whether it was

9

lawful or unlawful.

What matters is that it was conduct

10

that was in the future, that was after the statute was

11

enacted.

12

And so, here, although the -- the trip is

13

not unlawful in that sense, it is future conduct.

14

here, as in Fernandez-Vargas, there is ample warning --

15

which was another point that the Court emphasized in

16

that case -- ample warning that the statute would be

17

applied to people who engaged in that conduct.

18

I do want to address your --

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It -- it can't be right that

20

it's any future conduct.

23

turpitude in the past, but not until you go to the

MR. MILLER:

I think that's right, Your

2

Honor, and I think the reason it wouldn't is reflected

3

in some of this Court's -- in the ex post facto

4

analysis.

5

If you have a statute that, for example,

6

makes it a crime to have engaged in certain conduct in

7

the past and then, you know, something -- some

8

commonplace, utterly trivial activity in the future, I

9

think a court looking at that would say this is not --

10

although it is nominally prospective, this is really a

11

statute aimed at punishing the prior conduct.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I -- I don't know.

13

I think it would be prospective and unconstitutional

14

because it's irrational.

15

unconstitutional is unconstitutional -- not everything

16

that is unconstitutional is not prospective, it seems to

17

-- or do you think that's so?

18

I mean, not everything that's

If it's -- if it is unconstitutional in

19

violation of the ex post facto law, the statute has to

20

be -- has to be prospective.

21

assumed not to cover that prior conduct.

22

MR. MILLER:

I'm sorry.

Has to be
Is that right?

I mean, I think -- the

23

hypothetical statute I was describing I think would

25

analysis that this Court used in Smith v. Doe, in a
39

holding that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MILLER:

automatically has to be interpreted not to cover that?

6

Okay.

MR. MILLER:

Oh, you mean -- if you mean a

parallel statute in the civil context.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. MILLER:

10

Yes, yes.

I -- I think that's the best

11

reading of Landgraf, and I think under -- under the

12

analysis suggested in your concurring opinion in

13

Landgraf --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. MILLER:

Yes.

Yes.

-- I think one would look at

16

that statute and say this is really a statute that's

17

aimed at regulating the past conduct, and that -- that

18

has a retroactive effect.

19

So, I mean, to finish that thought, I think

20

I would just say that there is a narrow category of

21

cases where you have what is in form a prospective

22

regulation that's really aimed at -- aimed at burdening

23

or punishing a past act.

24
25

But this is not that.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And how do we separate those

How do we decide that this is not that, and that

Alderson Reporting Company

1

it's instead something else, that it's a regulation of

2

future conduct?

3

MR. MILLER:

I -- in the criminal context,

4

the Court has used the analysis of Kennedy v.

5

Mendoza-Martinez to figure out whether a statute is --

6

is imposing additional punishment for past conduct.

7

that looks at a number of factors, and the most

8

important factor under that test, the Court has said, is

9

whether the statute appears to be related to a

10
11

And

legitimate prospective regulatory purpose.
And so, that's why, for example, statutes

12

like 922(g), the felon in possession statute, which was,

13

I would point out, amended just back in 1996 to add

14

misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, which had not

15

previously been something that would subject one to a

16

firearms disability -- that was added.

17

Every court of appeals that has considered

18

the question has held that it doesn't violate the Ex

19

Post Facto Clause and, I think, implicitly has held that

20

it does in fact reach that conduct.

21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even -- even if you had

pleaded guilty to spousal abuse?

Alderson Reporting Company

1

question, but -- but, yes, because there you have a

2

statute that is regulating future conduct.

3

applies to somebody who engages in the future conduct.

4

The sex offender registration laws are another example

5

that this Court has upheld.

6

imposes a very significant burden on people on the basis

7

of prior conduct, but the fact that there is some burden

8

by itself does not mean that the statute is retroactive.

9

It only

That kind of law obviously

Nor does it mean that it's appropriately

10

viewed as imposing a disability.

11

the Court in Landgraf quoted Justice Story's formulation

12

of a disability as referring to statutes that impose a

13

disability in respect to transactions that are already

14

passed.

15

something that you could do, and now, in the future,

16

you're not going to be able to do that.

17

disability in the relevant sense, and if it were, I

18

think the Court would have a very difficult line-drawing

19

problem to figure out why it is that statutes like

20

922(g) are okay, or sex offender registration laws, or

21

any number of --

22

So, it is not enough that there used to be

problem, on the one hand; and, on the other hand, you

have the policy that with a -- fill in the blank --

uses a new definition of admission or admissibility.

That's -- do you want to say something about that?
MR. MILLER:

I think, if you're -- if you're

the Chief Justice's question and also the ambiguity of

that St. Cyr said there is a big difference between

immediate deportability and the potential --

appropriate to take into account, that however --

13

however significant the application of Fleuti might be

from --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Miller, the

17

Solicitor General actually represented to us -- in the

18

Judulang argument, used that as an example, the Fleuti

19

case, as something that people doing pleas did think

20

about and did rely upon.

21

MR. MILLER:

Well, I think -- I mean, we

22

don't question that that's something that people might

23

have -- have been aware of and have been thinking about,

25

plea agreement because it's not something that's

MR. BIBAS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I'd like

to make five points.

19

The first one is the statute is poorly

20

tailored to any protective or forward-looking effect.

21

As the Court has noted, its perverse effect is to

22

discourage people from leaving the country, to keep them

23

in.

24

just doesn't square with the way the statute is written.

So, any idea that the purpose is to get them out

46

post-IIRIRA innocent travel may be the trigger here, the

2

obvious target is the pre-IIRIRA offense.

is tied to misconduct.

misconduct not just a piece of evidence but a

5

prerequisite is that it is the misconduct that is being

6

penalized.

The statute

17

amici, the NACDL brief, points out very movingly how

18

important these kinds of considerations are in

immigrants' decisions to plead guilty.

20

example, my client received a 4-month discount off his

21

sentencing range.

22

that immigrants in his situation might value the ability

23

to stay in the same country with their 4-year-old and

24

2-year-old child as much as 4 months in jail.

25

Reliance is something that

It is something that exacerbates
And our

Here, for

It's entirely plausible to believe

But our broader theory is that the violation
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of settled expectations is sufficient, whether or not

2

there's reliance.

3

of planning one's life in this country and yet having

4

relatives abroad one will tend to or care for their

5

business, et cetera -- that is sufficient.

6

Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft, there were no legally

7

cognizable reliance interests in discriminating or in

8

submitting false claims, but changing the penalties is

9

enough.

10

The settled expectation that one has

Just as in

Fourth, this Court's decision in St. Cyr, I

11

believe, strongly helps our case.

12

that it imposed a disability, a disability on filing in

13

the future for discretionary relief, but as a practical

14

matter, it's burdening past conduct.

15

The first reason is

Secondly, St. Cyr didn't purport to change

16

the holdings in Landgraf and Hughes Aircraft that those

17

are other ways of showing impermissible retroactivity.

18

The logic in St. Cyr is ineluctable that because you are

19

burdening a decision, a decision that, as the -- the

20

Court and the amici in St. Cyr noted, matters greatly

21

and factors into things like the plea bargaining

22

calculus, that the retroactivity is especially obvious

23

and -- and severe.

24
25

And let me note that St. Cyr was decided under
this same statute, a privilege, not a right, a privilege

3

right/privilege distinction is dead in this area of law.

returning.
