ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. MILLS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. MILLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Denial of summary judgment is not reviewable

11

on appeal after trial, especially where the decision

12

depends on whether the evidence on the merits of the

13

claim is sufficient to cross the legal line for

14

liability.

15

In this case -
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry to

16

interrupt so quickly, but that especially, I take it -

17

I take it, is a concession that there's a difference

18

between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence

19

and claims that are based on law.

20

MR. MILLS:

Well, there's a difference

21

between defenses that depend on the evidence at trial.

22

What I would say about qualified immunity is that, to

23

the extent any court of appeals is going to enter

24

judgment based on qualified immunity, it needs to

25

understand the conduct of the officials in the case.
3

Alderson Reporting Company

And so you're always talking about the evidence of that

2

conduct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course there's

There are often

MR. MILLS:

law, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And doesn't that fall

12

within the "except" clause that the Chief Justice was

13

talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to

14

fill out, I understand.

15

But -- well, if you're going to say -- and

16

it's really not whether the summary judgment is -- is

17

appealed.

18

the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are

19

appealable.

20

your response, what the Chief Justice did, that maybe

21

sometimes the summary judgment motion, say, on an issue

22

of law is sufficient to preserve the issue.

23

That's a little bit -- it's whether or not

I read into your response, or implied from

MR. MILLS:

Well -- and that gets to what I

24

think is the heart of the split in the circuits and the

25

confusion, is that every circuit recognizes a very
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

general rule that where the evidence at trial moots that

2

at summary judgment, we're not going to review the

3

summary judgment decision.

4

Now, a number of courts said:

Well, wait a

5

second; there are summary judgment issues that don't

6

depend on the evidence, and we're -- those are typically

7

called questions of law.

8

number of good examples in their brief of defenses such

9

as statute of limitations, pre-emption, and the like,

And Respondents point to a

10

that indeed very often don't depend at all on the

11

evidence at trial.

12

immunity is that qualified immunity requires the court

13

to look at the evidence of the claim itself.

14

The difference with qualified

Now, statute of limitations, for example, is

15

actually quite different, because in statute of

16

limitations -- let's suppose Michelle Ortiz filed her

17

suit 20 years late.

18

evidence she adduced of the Respondents' misconduct.

19

would be barred by statute of limitations.

20

It would not matter at all how much

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

So Mr. Mills, what then

21

is the difference?

You point out, quite rightly,

22

summary judgment looks to what evidence there was, and

23

the question for the court is:

24

prove?

25

has the plaintiff proved?

What could the plaintiff

same body of evidence, right?

7

Because if there -- if there was

MR. MILLS:

It would be the

Well, I think that's largely -

8

largely right, Justice Ginsburg, and here's an example

9

of what did change in this case.

10

At the summary judgment stage, what we had

11

were affidavits of the Respondents discussing their role

12

in relation to this case, with no comment whatsoever

13

about what the consequences would have been had

14

Ms. Jordan immediately reported the first sexual

15

assault.

16

Respondents' perspective on that -- on that point.

17

The record was bare at summary judgment from

At trial, under cross-examination,

18

Ms. Bright testified that Respondent Jordan indeed

19

violated prison policy by not reporting it and then,

20

very crucially, also agreed that the second, more

21

violent assault would have actually been precluded had

22

that report taken place.

23

Now, that's -

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

troubles me about this case.

Well, this gets to what
Although the Sixth Circuit

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to

2

me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at

3

trial and determined that the defendants were entitled

4

to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at

5

trial.

6

So I don't know why this case actually

7

presents the question on which cert was granted.

It

8

seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely

9

factual question in the end, whether there was -

10

whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate.

11

And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law.

12

You never raised in the court of appeals, as

13

I understand it, the argument that the defendants'

14

ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter

15

of law was waived because they never filed a Rule 50(b)

16

motion.

17
18

Isn't that right?
MR. MILLS:

Well -- well, there's a couple

points in there that I need to address.

19

First, I think that you are exactly right.

20

What the Sixth Circuit did here is it -- it reviewed a

21

summary judgment decision, but it did peek ahead to the

22

trial evidence, and it said it was doing that.

23

that highlights the fundamental problem of reviewing

24

summary judgment after the trial.

25

implicitly recognizing it would be illogical to look at
7

Alderson Reporting Company

I think

The Sixth Circuit is

that summary judgment record, those affidavits, and then

2

ignore this cross-examined testimony of what -

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose we were to

4

hold that they -- that they couldn't review the denial

5

of summary judgment.

6

they say:

7

8

really were saying that the defendants were entitled to

9

judgment as a matter of law, and, although there wasn't

a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't

11

raised on appeal.

12

So we are -- we come back to exactly where

13

we are now.

14

the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps

15

motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is

16

jurisdictional.

17

distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and

18

claims processing questions.

19

All we've done is to correct a slip of

MR. MILLS:

And I agree with that last

point.

21

23

whatsoever and it was, as Respondents say, essentially a

24

Rule 50(a) review, that conflicts with an entire line of

25

this Court's decisions leading into Unitherm, which

point on which we granted certiorari.

11

MR. MILLS:

That's right, and I think -- I

think what I just said about the 50(b) point is that I

13

think it highlights that this really was a summary

14

judgment review by the Sixth Circuit of -

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, Mr. Mills, if I could

16

just understand your answer to Justice Alito.

17

concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the

18

record built on the whole trial and that that's a

19

different record from the record that existed at summary

20

judgment; is that correct?

21

MR. MILLS:

You

I do concede it, except to the

22

extent that I concede they did an adequate review of the

23

record.

24

MR. MILLS:

Then they go through an entire

11

extent to which they are incorporating trial facts

12

versus summary judgment facts.

13

this point where Ms. Bright conceded on cross that Ms.

14

Ortiz indeed would have been separated and the assault,

15

second assault, precluded, it's one of two things:

16

Either the Sixth Circuit's reviewing summary judgment

17

and picking a couple of trial facts it thinks helps to

18

review and missing the facts, or it's doing -- it's

19

looking ahead at these trial facts and because -

20

particularly because the district court never weighed in

21

on that, on a Rule 50(b), it's botching the record.

22

it goes to the heart of this Court's cases from Cone

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it -- I mean,

12

power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a

13

case.

14

cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a),

15

50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule

16

because in the background is the Seventh Amendment

17

Re-examination Clause.

18

there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser

19

must repeat the 50(a) motion, after -- after the

20

verdict.

But we are in an area where there are many, many

21

That's the whole reason why

So I'm surprised that you're using the word

22

"power." You're not referring to any of that history

23

which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh

24

Amendment.

25

MR. MILLS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, you're
12


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

absolutely correct, and I think that footnote 4 of

2

Unitherm goes right to your point.

3

Unitherm, the Court explains that the very reason a

4

court of appeals lacks the power, lacks the power to

5

review that question, is because it is essentially, as

6

in Unitherm, going to be as a court of appeals reviewing

7

the conduct -- the sufficiency of the evidence, without

8

a district court ruling on the question.

9

said in Unitherm that that raises serious Seventh

10

Amendment concerns.

11

example -

12

In footnote 4 of

And this Court

This case is actually a very good

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Mills, I got you

13

started on this, but this -- none of this is the

14

question on which we granted review, is it?

15

MR. MILLS:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -
We didn't grant review to

17

decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment

18

of a -- judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a

19

50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that

20

issue was waived by failing to make the motion.

21

didn't grant review on that.

22

MR. MILLS:

We

And, Justice Alito, that

23

highlights another important point about this exchange,

24

and that is that Respondents in the Sixth Circuit did

25

not suggest that the Sixth Circuit did have the
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

authority to take the summary judgment question and then

2

look ahead to trial facts.

3

has taken the summary judgment decision and then acted

4

without authority to look ahead at the trial facts.

5

so if the argument is that we have forfeited a

6

pre-emptive argument to the Sixth Circuit that it

7

couldn't do this frankly very unorthodox approach, I

8

don't think that that's a proper invocation of

9

forfeiture even regardless of the point about power.

10

And so, the Sixth Circuit

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

What -- are you saying

11

then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the

12

Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the

13

trial record, so it's different from the summary

14

judgment stage, if we told them that, then maybe they

15

would look at the evidence differently, even though they

16

purported to look at the trial evidence?

17

MR. MILLS:

Well, I think if that order were

18

given, they would indeed do that.

19

come back to the point that there is absolutely no basis

20

on which they would have the authority to do that.

21

the point is, in the Unitherm line of cases, that if you

22

don't have a district court ruling on the very question,

23

the question here of whether their conduct, as they say,

24

crossed a constitutional line, you're circumventing the

25

district court's role in the entire process.
14

Alderson Reporting Company

But I would still

And

Official

1

As this Court has explained repeatedly, a

2

requisite of a court of appeals reviewing that evidence

3

that went to the jury is that the district court first,

4

who has the feel of the case, who saw the witnesses, who

5

saw Respondent Bright on cross-examination, first have

6

the opportunity in the judge's discretion to grant a new

7

trial -

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, if you're right, then

there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with

10

instructions to send the case back to the district court

11

to ask the district court what -- whether it thought the

12

evidence was sufficient?

13

MR. MILLS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

14

think that the best way to see this case is it's indeed

15

a review of the summary judgment decision.

16

only decision by the district court that had to do with

17

qualified immunity.

18

That's the

The Sixth Circuit expressly invoked an

19

exception to say:

21

Eighth Circuit said that's okay and we say that's okay;

we're looking ahead at trial facts.

changed -

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

And your argument is that

3

where a --the district court denies summary judgment on

4

a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on

5

an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's

6

renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that

7

purely legal question is renewed in a Rule 50(b) motion.

8

That's your -- that's your argument?

9

MR. MILLS:

That is my argument, with a

10

couple key pieces -- first of all, they could, of

11

course, take a collateral order appeal, but if they

12

proceed to trial -- and here's -- here's sort of the

13

fundamental point about qualified immunity.

14

are purely legal questions in the qualified immunity

transcript -

Because if Ms. Jordan had reported the incident that she

was required to, they would have put Ms. Ortiz in

2

segregation automatically; is that it?

3

MR. MILLS:

Not that they would have put her

4

in segregation, but that they would have taken steps to

5

separate her from the officer, whether that meant

6

removing the officer from the location or putting her in

7

another cell.

8

did it change from summary judgment to trial; the Sixth

Circuit got it entirely wrong.

The important piece of that is not only

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but -- but you

You may have three different factual

MR. MILLS:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I just

10

can't see how Ms. Ortiz would have an obligation to put

11

in some fact that's outside of her knowledge and,

12

frankly, something that came out when a Respondent caved

13

in a bit on cross-examination.

JUSTICE BREYER:

How would you put the rule

judgment involves either a question of fact or a mixed

19

it doesn't have to be renewed.

I think it has

11

really by every circuit when they recognize the very

12

basic principle that the real evidence of a case is the

13

evidence at the trial, and what that means is that, if

14

the evidence at trial goes to the question at summary

15

judgment, whatever that legal issue may be, it's

16

illogical to ignore exactly what happened at trial and

go back to summary judgment.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. MIZER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
25


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

please the Court:
As I think the discussion has already

3

demonstrated, Ms. Ortiz's question presented hinges on a

4

false assumption.

5

Circuit was reviewing the summary judgment order as the

6

final appealable order in this case.

7

That assumption is that the Sixth

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Except that it begins,

8

2(a), "Although courts normally do not review the denial

9

of a summary judgment motion after trial on the merits,

10

the denial of summary judgment based on qualified

11

immunity is an exception to this rule."

12

MR. MIZER:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

And that's -

And -
That's the opening.

That

sets the stage for what follows.

15

MR. MIZER:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -
Now, it may be that

17

everybody, including the Sixth Circuit, misapprehended

18

the rule because there are some cases that depend on an

19

assessment of the record and some cases that don't, but

20

that's not what the Sixth Circuit said.

21

MR. MIZER:

I think that the Sixth Circuit's

22

word choice in the sentence that you just read was not

23

perfectly clear, but -

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Mizer, you asked

for an appeal of the summary judgment motion, so they
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

might have chosen their words based on your request.

2

MR. MIZER:

Actually, Your Honor, the

3

summary judgment motion was only one of several orders

4

listed in the notice of appeal.

5

brief was very clearly couched as an appeal from the

6

verdict, which at the bottom of the prior page of the -

7

of the petition appendix, from where Justice Kennedy

8

just read, the bottom of page 7a, the Sixth Circuit

9

calls it an "appeal from the jury verdict."

10

And the Sixth Circuit

And then the Sixth Circuit, at petition

11

appendix 2a and throughout its opinion, refers to "trial

12

evidence."

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Mizer, then you

14

must concede that this opening sentence that

15

Justice Kennedy just quoted is wrong.

16

don't review the denial of summary judgment motion after

17

trial on the merits, but when the summary judgment

18

denial is based on qualified immunity, there's an

19

exception.

20

MR. MIZER:

Courts normally

I think that what the Sixth

21

Circuit meant there was that the issue of qualified

22

immunity raised at summary judgment was preserved.

23

don't think its word choice was perfectly clear, but I

24

think other -- other phrases in the Sixth Circuit's

25

opinion make clearer that what it was doing was viewing
27

Alderson Reporting Company

I

1

the full trial record and viewing -

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that we should -- I

3

think what that means to me is that you really ignore

4

whether it was raised at summary judgment.

5

going to look at the evidence at trial, what do we look

6

at, at trial, to see that the claim of qualified

7

immunity was preserved?

8

MR. MIZER:

If you're

It would -

judgment record when you're not.

Sixth Circuit was saying it was reviewing the summary

judgment record, and that would have been not

appropriate.

record.

17

post-trial in order for it to have been adequately -

18

What it was doing was looking at the whole

And a legal issue doesn't have to be raised

JUSTICE BREYER:

But surely it has to be

19

raised post-trial if your legal argument is:

20

the facts; the facts of this case as proved do not

21

support liability.

22

Look at

I mean, I would have thought that was a

23

classic instance where you do have to make the motion.

24

That's the whole point of having to renew it.

25

MR. MIZER:

To the extent -
28


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. MIZER:

Am I wrong?

Partly, yes, Your Honor.

To the

3

extent the -- the argument is that there needed to be a

4

50(b) motion -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. MIZER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not?

-- and it was -
I mean, do you normally -

8

forget this case.

What the lawyer says is:

Judge, they

9

are never going to be able to prove that my client

10

crossed the intersection.

11

12

now, and it doesn't show my client crossed the

13

intersection, so not liable.

Okay?

We go to trial.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. MIZER:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

In your hypothetical?
Yes.

Yes.
Okay.

Fine.

But that's been -
Now, how is yours one bit

21

different?

22

evidence, when you look at it, will show the facts are

23

such that there must have been qualified immunity under

24

the law.

25

Because what you're saying is that the

MR. MIZER:

The difference, Your Honor, is
29


Alderson Reporting Company

1

that this Court's case law concerning -- the Mitchell

2

line of cases concerning collateral order appeals in the

3

qualified immunity context divides qualified immunity

4

claims into two halves.

5
6

There are evidentiary sufficiency-based
qualified immunity claims, and there are legal claims.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, that -- that is

8

right, and I find it, in the context where that already

9

matters, whether they're appealable as a collateral

10

issue already very difficult and complicated to sort

11

out.

Now, what you want us to do is take that

Wouldn't it be easier if we just said:

23

difference.

I think it's a good argument, because some

24

don't depend on the facts.

25

creates an awful lot of difficulty that we don't need to

But going forward, it just

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

buy into.

2

MR. MIZER:

Well, first of all, I think

3

that, because it is a difficult question, it should have

4

been raised by Ms. Ortiz properly, and she hasn't raised

5

the 50(b) argument properly.

6

to reach it, I think the clearer rule is to map the

7

Johnson line onto the sufficiency of the evidence line,

8

otherwise -- for 50(b) motions.

9

But even if the Court were

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Otherwise, then -

The Johnson line isn't much

10

of a map, is what the Chief Justice is suggesting.

11

a mess.

12

-- why should we double the difficulty by -- by bringing

13

it in at the -- at the Rule 50 stage as well?

14

It's very hard to sort those things out.

MR. MIZER:

Why

Because the converse rule, Your

15

Honor, would create even more difficulties.

16

Ms. Ortiz's -

17

It's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

On

All you have to do -

18

any lawyer going in knows he has to make the motion at

19

the close of the evidence.

20

What -- what's the big deal?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And, in fact, you did.

21

You did move under 50(a).

This whole case is here

22

because apparently -- well, what reason was it that you

23

didn't make the 50(b) motion?

24

50(a), after all the evidence was in but before the case

25

went to the jury, that the jury would not have a legally

2

That was -- that was your motion.

3

5

basis.

6

that the judgment -- the question is whether there is a

7

sufficient evidentiary basis.

8
9

Evidentiary

That was the motion that you made, recognizing

MR. MIZER:

And that argument is a different

species of argument than the argument on which -- than

10

the -- than the reasoning on which the Sixth Circuit

11

resolved the case, which is, even assuming all the facts

12

as given by Ms. Ortiz and taking -- treating those facts

13

as uncontroverted, still there was not a violation of

14

clearly established law.

15

And under Johnson v. Jones and Mitchell,

16

that is a different question than from the question of

17

whether or not particular conduct has been proven.

18

As -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then what you're

20

saying is you didn't even -- you didn't need to make the

21

50(a) motion, that that was just an unnecessary touching

22

base with Rule 50(a)?

23

MR. MIZER:

Is that what you're saying?
That is our position, yes, Your

24

Honor, because a legal issue is adequately preserved

25

once it's pressed and passed on in the district court.
32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And to move for summary judgment on the issue is enough

2

to preserve a legal claim, the legal claim being not

3

that particular -- that sufficient evidence exists to

4

prove that particular conduct occurred, but rather that

5

the -- given all of that, that claim as assumed, still,

6

the Harlow line of objective legal reasonableness has

7

not been crossed.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But didn't they -
I suppose there are some

10

cases in which the failure of the court to give a

11

requested instruction preserves the issue, and perhaps

12

50(b) is not required there.

13

Were there any instructions proffered and

14

denied in this case that would have preserved the issue

15

for appeal?

16

MR. MIZER:

There was a requested

17

instruction regarding qualified immunity, yes, and it

18

was not given.

19
20

We're not arguing that that -

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What was that

instruction?

21

MR. MIZER:

The -- the instruction was about

22

the objective legal reasonableness standard under

23

Harlow.

24

proper -

25

I actually don't think that that request was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you have a cite to

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

the record?

2

MR. MIZER:

I don't have a cite to the

3

record at the moment.

4

that actually, that that instruction wasn't proper,

5

because the jury doesn't resolve the Harlow objective

6

legal reasonableness question.

7

resolves the disputed facts, and then the court takes

8

those facts as a given for purposes of the Harlow

9

question.

10

But -- but the -- the point is

Instead, the jury

And -- and, in this case, I think there's an

11

example of this distinction.

Ms. Jordan the name of the guard who had assaulted her.

And that fact was disputed at trial.

move for 50(b) over that factual dispute, and so we

16

couldn't appeal on that question.

17

There was very much

Then explain to me what

23

up with a 50(b) motion?
34

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. MIZER:

I'm not aware of a reason, Your

2

Honor.

But at pages 4 to 5 of the joint appendix, I

3

think it's clear that there were two different types of

4

arguments being made at the 50(a) stage.

5

was a dispute over facts.

6

if we don't dispute those facts, still Ms. Ortiz's

7

arguments haven't shown a constitutional violation.

One argument

The other argument was, even

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How could you -
It's -- it's very clear

10

from Rule 50 that 50(a) and 50(b) go together, and the

11

explanation, as I indicated when Petitioner's counsel

12

was speaking, is the Re-examination Clause of the

13

Seventh Amendment.

14

Procedure student learns 50(a), 50(b) go together, and

15

there's a historic reason why you must back up a 50(a)

16

motion with a 50(b) motion.

17

they all ask the same question.

18

50, 50(b), they all ask:

19

to warrant a jury finding, whatever.

20

but they ask -- ask it on the basis of a different

21

record:

22

and the jury verdict.

23

So I think every first year

They're not -- they all -
The Rule 56, the Rule

Is there sufficient evidence
They all ask that,

the summary judgment record, the trial record,

MR. MIZER:

But still, Your Honor, I think

24

the question of whether particular conduct has been

25

proven is a sufficiency question, and that differs in
35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nature from the question of whether, taking that proven

2

conduct as a given, assuming it to be true, without -

3

without questioning the correctness of the plaintiff's

4

version of the facts, that the -- then the Harlow

5

question is a separate question.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you know of any case

7

holding that you don't have to couple a 50(a) motion

8

with a 50(b) motion depending upon what's in your 50(a)

9

motion?

10

MR. MIZER:

I am not aware of any case, no,

11

although I am aware of cases, including the K & T

12

Enterprises case from the Seventh -- or sorry -- from

13

the Sixth Circuit, that we cite in our brief, which says

14

that legal claims, purely legal claims, may be raised in

15

judgment as a matter of law motions under either 50(a)

16

or 50(b), but that 50(b) is not required with respect to

17

those motions.

18

And so -- so the 50(a) motion here was a

19

belt-and-suspenders -- belt-and-suspenders effort, but

20

it wasn't legally required because of the -- the -

thought in reading your submissions to the district

court you were saying that, if she retaliated in putting

11

her in segregated confinement, it doesn't matter whether

12

there is a Sandin violation or not; she couldn't do the

13

retaliatory act; is that correct?

14

MR. MIZER:

The -- the Sixth Circuit held in

15

this case that the retaliation claim is a different

16

claim from the due process claim, that it would be based

Yes.

What is your -- what is your position on this

question?

2

MR. MIZER:

Our position is that the Sixth

3

Circuit got it right, and Ms. Ortiz hasn't appealed to

4

this Court on that holding, that as a -- as a matter of

5

law under Sandin, placing an individual in segregated

6

confinement does not amount to a due process violation

7

vis-à-vis the -- the ordinary conditions of prison

8

confinement.

9

I also have an answer, Justice Sotomayor, to

18

judgment because Ms. Bright did not participate and did

19

not have any knowledge of -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, is -- on the

21

question of whether this treatment was punitive rather

22

than just protective custody.

23

MR. MIZER:

And, again, on the question of

24

punitiveness, the Sixth Circuit held that that was not

25

preserved -- that claim was not preserved by Ms. Ortiz.
38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And she has not petitioned to this Court for review of

2

that holding by the Sixth Circuit, and so the only

3

question is the square Sandin question of whether

4

segregated confinement is an atypical and significant

5

hardship vis-à-vis the routine conditions of -- of her

6

confinement.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, wouldn't it be

8

this, the segregated confinement in this case, not at

9

large?

10

MR. MIZER:

The -- again, the Sixth

11

Circuit's holding was that Sandin answered that -- that

12

question as a matter of clearly established law.

13

since Ms. Ortiz hasn't petitioned for review of the

14

merits of that question, I'm not sure how it's presented

15

to this Court.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

Mr. Mizer, is it your

17

understanding that -- that Unitherm was based on Seventh

18

Amendment considerations, or was it based on prior

19

decisions that in turn were grounded on considerations

20

of fairness to the verdict-winner, namely the

21

opportunity, when a -- a motion for judgment as a matter

22

of law is made after the verdict, to move for dismissal

23

without prejudice or move for a new trial?

which is that there are -- there two types of qualified

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. MIZER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's a pure issue of

law.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How is that -

Well, is it this case, Mr.

17

Mizer?

18

question is whether the conduct amounted to deliberate

19

indifference.

20

whether a particular kind of conduct amounted to

21

negligence, which in a previous case this Court said you

22

had did have to make 50(b), a 50(b) motion in order to

23

preserve?

24
25

Take the deliberate indifference claim.

The

Why is that any different from asking

That was in the Johnson v. New York case.
MR. MIZER:

It's different, Your Honor,

because the -- the prong of the analysis in the
41

Alderson Reporting Company

deliberate indifference conduct that the Sixth Circuit

2

was looking at was the objective prong of whether or not

3

the response was reasonable.

4

worst of -- of Ms. Jordan's intent, as proven by the

5

trial record, and assuming the worst of what she did or

6

didn't do, still her response was as a legal matter

7

objectively reasonable, and that was the Sixth Circuit's

8

holding.

9

So assuming all of the

And so, therefore, because that's a legal

10

inquiry, there was no 50(b) requirement even if Ms.

11

Ortiz had preserved the 50(b) argument.

12

The -- the -- Ms. Ortiz has also posited

13

that a collateral order appeal is a requirement in order

14

to preserve a qualified immunity claim.

15

is clearly foreclosed not only by the broad agreement

16

among the circuits but also by this Court's decisions in

17

United States v. Clark.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

That argument

When you go back -

19

you're the one who has read these cases pretty

20

thoroughly, and as I looked at it, I -- with the

21

incomplete knowledge, I would have thought that

22

Justice Ginsburg's statement of it is basically right.

23

What Rule 50 is about is sufficiency of the evidence.

24

And 50(a) involves we're saying it won't be sufficient.

25

And 50(b) involves it wasn't sufficient.
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Then you could

Official

1

have the Chief Justice's rule.

2

It would work perfectly.

But apparently there's a Second Circuit

3

case, and some things in the treatises, that says

4

sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other

5

purpose.

6

if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be

7

outside 50(a); you ought to be doing some other thing.

You know, a question like:

So, what are these cases and that exception

in the treatise about?

kinds of instances do they think come under 50(a) that

15

aren't sufficiency of the evidence?

MR. MIZER:

What are they thinking of?

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Very often those will

Suppose we could say

22

this:

That when a lawyer uses 50(a) to make the kind of

23

motion that does not involve sufficiency of the evidence

24

but rather, in fact, could be made without 50(a), under

25

those circumstances, he doesn't have to say 50(b).

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the purpose of

MR. MIZER:

But if a claim is not in a case,

2

Your Honor, then there's no discretion as to whether or

4

qualified immunity question doesn't -- doesn't belong

5

with the jury, so, too, a claim that hasn't been

adequately pressed doesn't go to the jury.

7

And so, just as the

And so we're not talking about questions

8

Your case, anyway, is a

2

What's wrong with that?
MR. MIZER:

I would disagree with the

characterization of the Sixth Circuit's opinion as

resolving factual questions, because on the contrary, I

5

think -

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean they went

on the jury's resolution of the facts.

8
9

No, no.

MR. MIZER:

That's correct.

And so it's

the -- the -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

For that reason, they can't

take the facts as they were in your motion for summary

12

judgment.

13

they can't just go back and review them on the -- yes.

14

They have to take them on the basis of -

MR. MIZER:

And that goes to show, Your

Honor, that the Sixth Circuit wasn't -- wasn't doing

is that they were reviewing the summary judgment record

respect and that they thought they were reviewing the

22

summary judgment order, and not the final judgment.

Suppose they committed an error in that

appeal because the 30 days had run?
49

Alderson Reporting Company

3

MR. MIZER:

Yes.

Then it would be like a

late collateral order appeal that -
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So your position is -

4

rests, is dependent, on our finding that the Sixth

5

Circuit was reviewing a final judgment order, which was

6

not what the Sixth Circuit in fact said it was doing.

7

MR. MIZER:

Again, I would disagree that

8

that's what the Sixth Circuit said because of the

9

language at the bottom of page 7a of the petition

10

appendix, where they clearly say that it's an appeal

11

from the verdict.

12

And so because it's demonstrably not true

13

that they were treating the summary judgment order as

14

the final appealable order here, the question presented

15

by Ms. Ortiz is not actually presented by this case.

16

And the further arguments that a 50(b) motion was

17

required here under Unitherm were never made in the

18

Sixth Circuit and not made in her opening cert petition.

19

And so that argument also is not presented by this case.

20

And so I think the clear resolution is to

21

dismiss the case as improvidently granted, but if the

22

Court were inclined to the view that the merits should

23

be reached, then the clear rule that we posit resolves

24

the case, which is that orders made by the district

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you're saying that if

there's anything in the record of the trial that

12

indicates that the judge ruled on the issue, there need

13

not be a 50(b) motion?

14

MR. MIZER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

15

the lower courts, I think, are well-equipped to assess

16

whether or not an issue has adequately been pressed and

17

passed on in the district court.

18

That has been the settled rule of appellate

19

reviewability, and I don't think that it should be

20

changed by imposing a Rule 50(b) requirement for

21

anything other than a sufficiency of the evidence

motion.

10

MR. MILLS:

11

The -- one thing that's important about the

Thank you.

12

Sixth Circuit's language when it said it was reviewing

13

summary judgment, the single decision it cited was the

14

Eighth Circuit's decision in Goff v. Bise.

15

-- in that decision, the Eighth Circuit said, yes, we

16

can review this after trial even though it was summary

17

judgment, because it's qualified immunity, but the

18

Eighth Circuit actually ignored the trial evidence.

19

actually did this seemingly illogical step of just

20

looking at the summary judgment evidence as-is.

21

Now, in that

Circuit was definitely reviewing summary judgment, but

summary judgment, and said:

3

We've got to look at what
And so they looked ahead.

Now, the reason the question is adequately

4

presented is because I think the Sixth Circuit's

5

decision shows this entire debate about Unitherm and

6

whether this was a quasi-50(a) review is the -- one of

7

the precise reasons the Sixth Circuit hinged its

8

decision on summary judgment.

9

I think it was quite aware that an appellate

10

court, since at least 1947, in Cone, cannot review the

11

sufficiency of the evidence at trial and overturn the

jury's verdict.
