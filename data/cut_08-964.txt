CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Bilski v. Kappos.

Mr. Jakes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. MICHAEL JAKES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. JAKES:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Federal Circuit's rigid and narrow

11
12

machine-or-transformation test for all patent-eligible

13

methods should be reversed.

14

and all methods must be either tied to a particular

15

machine or transform specific subject matter doesn't

16

find any basis in either the language of section 101 or

17

anywhere in the patent statute.

The requirement that any

It's not required by this Court's

18
19

precedence, and it's contrary to the established

20

principle that section 101 should be read broadly to

21

accommodate unforeseen advances in the useful arts.

22

There are recognized exclusions from section 101, from

23

that broad language, such as laws of nature, natural

24

phenomenon, and abstract ideas.

25

patented.

Those may not be

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But these exceptions, which are drawn from

2

the Court's precedent, including this Court's Diehr

3

case, also find support in the statutory language,

4

which says that any process must be new and useful.

5

So the prohibition against patenting laws of

6

nature or abstract principles -- it applies equally to

7

all four categories of subject matter under 101, but,

8

here, the Federal circuit has created a new test just

9

for processes that are not found in the statute or

10
11

required by this Court's decisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the government

12

says that the -- that the term on which it hangs its hat

13

is the term “useful arts” and that that meant,

14

originally, and still means manufacturing arts, arts

15

dealing with workmen, with -- you know, inventors, like

16

Lorenzo Jones, not -- not somebody who writes a book on

17

how to win friends and influence people.

18

What’s wrong with that analysis, that

19

that's what "useful arts" meant, that it always --

20

always was thought to deal with machines and inventions?

21

MR. JAKES:

Certainly, "useful arts"

22

encompasses industrial processes, manufacturing

23

processes, but it has never been limited just to those

24

types of processes.

25

Industrial Revolution most of the inventions concerned

I'll admit that during the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

machines and manufacturing processes.

2

counter-examples that show that business was also within

3

the useful arts.

4
5

But we have cited

It's also up to Congress to decide how to
implement the patent system and the statutory scheme --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if you leave

7

something out, Congress can put it back in, tailoring

8

the protection to what they feel is necessary.

9

it covers everything under the sun, I've never seen a

10

But if

case where Congress would take something out.
Now, if we are relying on Congress, I guess

11
12

the circuit would say, let's go narrow, and we

13

won’t have -- you know -- since you referred to

14

Congress, I thought I would bring that up and see what

15

you think.

16

MR. JAKES:

Congress has acted in certain

17

circumstances.

18

provide prior user rights for business methods.

19

20

exempted from remedies under the statute.

21
22
23

One of them is in section 273, to
Another

There has been a bill introduced to exempt
tax avoidance methods, but that has not yet been passed.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But just so you would say

24

tax avoidance methods are covered, just as the process

25

here is covered.

So an estate plan, tax avoidance, how

5

1

to resist a corporate takeover, how to choose a jury,

2

all of those are patentable?
MR. JAKES:

3

They are eligible for patenting

4

as processes, assuming they meet the other statutory

5

requirements.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that would mean that

7

every -- every businessman -- perhaps not every, but

8

every successful businessman typically has something.

9

His firm wouldn't be successful if he didn't have

10

anything that others didn't have.

13

He thinks of something.

That's how he made

And your view would be -- and it's new, too,

14
15

and it's useful, made him a fortune -- anything that

16

helps any businessman succeed is patentable because we

17

reduce it to a number of steps, explain it in general

18

terms, file our application, granted?

19
20
21

MR. JAKES:

It is potentially patentable,

yes.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Well then, if that

22

were so, we go back to the original purpose of the

23

Constitution.

24

wanted to require anyone successful in this great, vast,

25

new continent because he thinks of something new to have

Do you think that the Framers would have

2

competitor to do a search and then stop the wheels of

3

progress unless they get permission?

4
5

Is that a plausible view of the patent
clause?

6
7

MR. JAKES:

I wouldn't

characterize it that way, but I do believe that --

8
9

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
something that’s reasonable?

So how do we limit it to
Meaning, if we don't

10

limit it to inventions or to technology, as some amici

11

have, or to some tie or tether, borrowing the Solicitor

12

General's phraseology, to the sciences, to the useful

13

arts, then why not patent the method of speed dating?
MR. JAKES:

14

Well, first of all, I think,

15

looking at what are useful arts, it does exclude some

16

things.

17

literature, poems -- I think we all agree that those are

18

not included, and there are other things as well.

19

example, a corporation, a human being -- these are

20

things that are not covered by the statutory categories.

21

It does exclude the fine arts.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

For

So why are human

22

activities covered by useful arts?

23

MR. JAKES:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Speaking,

Human activities are covered.
Well, you are saying

they are covered, but why should they be?

7
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. JAKES:

I believe the statute provides

2

for them to be covered by defining them as a process.

3

can give you a -- one good example, which would be a

4

surgical method performed by a doctor.

Those are

5

patentable.

In section

6

287(c), Congress has carved out and said, you can't go

7

after the doctor for infringement, but that is an

8

entirely human activity, and it has long been

9

patentable.

10

They are patent eligible.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think that there

11

is some benefit to society from patenting a method to

12

cure someone that involves just human activity, as

13

opposed to some machine, substance, or other apparatus

14

to help that process?

Potentially.

MR. JAKES:

If that was a novel and

14

unobvious method, then it should be patentable, but it's

15

eligible as subject matter --

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but your claim

17

1 it seems to me is classic commodity hedging that has

18

been going on for centuries.

19

MR. JAKES:

Your Honor, if that were true,

20

then we should run afoul of the obviousness provision

21

under section 103.

22

allow some of our claims over the prior art.

23

Now, the Patent Office did initially

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you know that the

24

insurance industry -- the insurance business, as we know

25

it, really began in England in 1680, when they

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discovered differential calculus, and they had

2

expectancy and actuarial tables, actuarial for life,

3

expectancy for shipping, and this really created a whole

4

new industry.

5

In your view, I think, clearly those would

6

be patentable, the -- the explanation of how to compile

7

an actuarial table and -- and apply it to risk.

8

certainly would be patentable under your view, and

9

it's -- it's difficult for me to think that Congress

That

10

would want to -- would have wanted to give only one

11

person the capacity to issue insurance.

12

MR. JAKES:

I think that method would be

13

patent eligible.

14

reduced to a concrete set of steps, like our claim 1.

15

Now, claim 1 may be written in broad terms, and it may

16

some day run into the prior art, but it does require

17

people to do actual things.

18

But, as you said, it would have to be

I think even the Patent Office agreed that

19

3

call the grocer and say:

5

MR. JAKES:

I can set up a deal for both

It could be.

It could be done

6

that way because it does take a person acting to do

7

that.

It's not purely --

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so in the insurance

case, it takes a person to go over to the Bureau of

10

Statistics and compile statistics on -- on life -- on

11

life expectancy.
MR. JAKES:

12

That could be.

Now, a patent

13

on the data -- that's another category that's not

14

included in the subject matter of those four categories.

15

The data itself is not patentable, but if it is a series

16

of steps, it should be eligible as long as it meets the

17

other statutory requirements as a process.
There’s nothing in the useful arts -- now,

18
19

we have heard the word "technology."

20

difficult term, because “technology” in its broadest

21

sense means the application of knowledge as opposed to

22

general knowledge.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

That can be a

Isn't that the basis on

24

which the patent law rests in Europe, in other

25

countries?

It has to be tied to technology, to science or

2

the notion of technology-based, why not ours?

So if other systems are able to work with

I would agree, Your Honor.

Ours does not.

Ours speaks in very broad

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I was talking about

-- you said that technology-based, that wouldn't work

12

systems?

13

they include technology-based innovations.

14

I'm simply

Does it work in these other

That they -- they exclude business methods,

MR. JAKES:

That's right.

But they have

15

also defined "technology" in such a way as to exclude

16

business methods.

17

And I don't think we can do that.

The fields of operations research,

18

industrial engineering, even financial engineering --

19

there has been an explosion in these particular fields,

20

and to now call them non-technological because they

21

didn't exist over 100 years ago wouldn't make --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you suggesting they

computers have increased –MR. JAKES:

It's very much related to our

4

current economy and state of technology, with computers

6

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but a patent limits

the free flow of information.

It requires licensing
So you can't argue

10

that your definition is improving the free flow of

11

information.

12

MR. JAKES:

But

Your Honor, I would, because of

13

the disclosure requirement of the patent laws.

14

requires people to disclose their inventions rather than

15

keeping them secret, so there is a second benefit to the

16

patent system just other than encouraging people to

17

invent, and that is to have that information get to the

18

public generally.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In the Diehr case, the

5

Court said that in the end, the abstract idea must be in

patent laws were designed to protect, which brings you

was a method of curing rubber.

20

be wrong and contrary to the forward-looking aspect of

23

3

4

Circuit was trying to explain, which is that there has

to be something more substantive than the mere exchange

of information; that it has to involve -- it used the

word "transformation."

3

In the 19th century, they made it one

5

way in respect to machines.

Now you're telling us:

information, if I am honest, I have to tell you:

knowledge available to everyone, and "useful," meaning

with the transformation test is that it would exclude

these electronic signals can be used in a way just like

the alphabet can be used.

electronic signals and turning them into some other sort

of signal.

Claim 8 was the very broad claim

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's not skip over

11

that, because the rest of the claim in Bell related to

12

how to transmit over the wire, correct?

13

MR. JAKES:

His disclosure did, but his

actual claim was interpreted as being using undulating

15

current to transmit sound, however that was

accomplished.

It was very broad, and that's why --

disclosure because --

That one was approved, yes.

MR. JAKES:

It might have.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. JAKES:

I

It might have.

It clearly did.

Well, it's not that clear from

6

the Federal Circuit's transformation test whether that

7

would apply or not, because although the Federal Circuit

8

has said transformation of data might qualify, it said

9

it has to represent something physical, something -- a

10

real object.

that.

Sound can be generated artificially.

It's something else.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

Let me start by following up on the

20

discussion of the Morse and the telephone cases, because

21

it's certainly our view that those would come out the

22

same way under our test as -- as they actually did in

2

MR. STEWART:

And, you know, Justice Scalia,

3

you mentioned how to win friends and influence people.

4

I think at a certain level of generality you could

5

describe both Dale Carnegie and Alexander Graham Bell as

6

people who devised methods of communicating more

7

effectively.

8
9

The reason that Bell's method was patentable
was that it operated in the realm of the physical.

Bell

10

had devised a process implemented through machines by

11

which sound was transformed into electronic current.

12

Current was then transmitted over a distance and

13

transformed back into sound.
Innovations as to new techniques of public

19

physical.

20

They may be valuable.

They are not patent

So while the industrial processes that we

21

discussed at some length in our brief were at the time

22

of the framing the paradigmatic patent eligible

23

24

that can be patented.

25

In a --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Near -- near the end of your

27

Official

1

Brief, you argue that -- that the patent here is -- is

2

not -- is unpatentable on the independent ground that it

3

would pre-empt the abstract idea of hedging consumption

4

risk.

5

good case for us to get into these –- into

6

broad issue that Petitioner has raised?

If you -- if you are right about that, is this a

7

MR. STEWART:

the very

I -- I think we would

8

certainly prefer to win on our primary ground, and let

9

me say a couple of things about that.

First, we would

10

fairly vigorously resist the notion that the rule that

11

was announced by the Federal Circuit is rigid or

12

inflexible.

13

really said is that to have a patent-eligible process

14

you have to identify some link to a machine or a

15

transformation of matter.

16

said with respect to some processes the link to the

17

machine may be so attenuated, the machine part of the

18

process may be such a small segment of the process as a

19

whole, that this wouldn't be enough.

20

Circuit said:

21

questions that will arise when part of the process is

22

machine-implemented and another part is not.

23

That is, all that the Federal Circuit has

And the Federal Circuit has

But the Federal

We leave for another day the hard

And in order for the PTO and the Federal

24

Circuit to go about the business of devising more

25

precise rules as to when particular links to machines

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are sufficient to create patent eligibility, we first

2

need to establish the -- the basic principle that some

3

link to a machine or transformation is necessary.

4

think we -- we have made the alternative argument in our

5

brief, and I think it is a basis for affirmance.

6

So I

But if the Court decided the case on that

7

basis, we would lose at least the -- the limited clarity

8

that the Federal Circuit's opinion has provided; that

9

is, it would still be open to people in the future to

10

devise new contractual arrangements designed to allocate

11

risks, new methods of teaching antitrust, and --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about if we say

13

something as simple as patent law doesn't cover business

14

methods, instead of what the Federal Circuit has begun

15

to say, which is technology is tied to a machine or a

16

transformation of the substance?

17

what the limits of that ruling will impose in the

18

computer world or the biomedical world.

19

amici were talking about how it will destroy industries.

20

If we’re unsure about that, wouldn't the safer practice

21

be simply to say it doesn't involve business methods?

22

MR. STEWART:

But I have no idea

All of the

I think that would be

23

incorrect, and it would create problems of its own.

24

That is, the -- the innovation that was held to be

25

patent eligible in State Street Bank was not a process.

It went on to say the opposing party in that

case had not raised any objection under section 102 or

9

103, and, therefore, the Federal Circuit –-

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No ruling in this case

is going to change State Street --

12

MR. STEWART:

Well --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because it wasn't

14

looking at process or the meaning of "process."

15

looking at something else.

16

MR. STEWART:

It was

Well, again, I think that the

17

invention that was held to be patent eligible in State

18

Street is commonly described as a business method, even

19

though it was held to be patent eligible as a machine

20

rather than as a process.

21

So, to say that business methods are

22

categorically ineligible for patent protection would

23

eliminate new machines, including programmed computers,

24

that are useful because of their contributions to the

25

operation of businesses.

And similarly, the court --

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Federal Circuit in other cases has held that a claim

2

to new and innovative computer software may be held

3

patentable as a process, as a method of accomplishing

4

particular tasks through the use of a computer, and

5

those might be business-related tasks.

6

business methods were ruled out would itself be a fairly

7

sweeping holding.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, to say that

Also you could say business

methods apart from machines are not patentable.

How

about that?
MR. STEWART:

11

If the Court said that in the

12

limited area of business methods, if there is no machine

13

or transformation, there is no patent eligibility -JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Suppose you say this.

Start with Diehr.

MR. STEWART:

They've

We’re not sure.

Let me take those points -Yes.

-- in the order that you made

them.
JUSTICE BREYER:

14

Do you see what I'm trying

15

to do?

I'm trying to note the things that have been

16

raised in these 80 briefs insofar as possible, say

17

there’s a lot there for the future that we can't really

18

decide, but say as a pull back, okay.

19

MR. STEWART:

Let me address those points in

20

order.

The first thing is that in Diehr when you had

21

the “e.g.” cite, it was "e.g., transforming an article

22

into a different" state of -- state or thing.

23

think the obvious inference is "e.g." was used because

24

the other prong of the machine-or-transformation test is

25

use as a machine.

And I

That is, in the context of Mr.

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Morse's invention or Mr. Bell's invention, there is

2

transformation of a sort, but it wouldn't naturally be

3

characterized as transformation of matter.

4

Those things were held to be patent eligible

5

not because they transformed matter, but because they

6

involved the use of a machine.

7

in Diehr said transformation of a matter or an article

8

into a different state or thing is the clue to the

9

patentability of a process that doesn't involve a

10

And so, what the Court

particular machine.
And the -- the type of process it had in

11
12

mind was the process that was described in Corning v.

13

Burden or the process in Cochrane v. Deener, situations

14

in which an individual had devised a method of, in one

15

sense -- one case, it was manufacturing flour, and in

16

another case it was rolling puddle balls, of

17

manufacturing items.

18

series of steps that you have to go through, but it’s

19

not essential that you use any particular tool or

20

machine for each of these steps.

word --

22

And that person said, here is the

That was why the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Stewart, I

23

thought I understood your argument up until the very

24

simply the method isn't patentable because it doesn't

you use a computer to identify the parties that you are

3

setting a price between and if you used a microprocessor

4

to calculate the price.

typewriter to type out the -- the process, then it is

6

patentable.

7

that you spent 53 pages establishing.

9

But then you say but it might be if

That's like saying if you use a

I -- I -- that takes away everything

MR. STEWART:

Well, I guess there -- there

were two different places, I believe, at which we

10

identified ways in which this sort of hedging scheme

11

might be made patent eligible.

12

described a hypothetical interactive Website in which

13

people -- parties and counterparties could essentially

14

find each other by the computer and could agree to terms

15

on that basis.

16

computer would be at the heart of the innovation.

17

would be --

18

The first is we

And in that situation, the -- the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no.

It

That's just

19

saying instead of looking at the -- in the Yellow Pages,

20

you look on the computer.

21

difference to you?

22

MR. STEWART:

And that makes all the

I think an -- an interactive

23

computer technique, one in which you sign on and can

24

find people without tracking them down specifically, can

25

simply identify yourself on the Website as somebody

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

who is interested in engaging in a particular

2

transaction and a potential counterparty can find you,

3

is different from the Yellow Pages.

4

But I guess the fundamental point I would

5

make is -- and this is really responsive to the second

6

part of Justice Breyer's question -- I think it is both

7

a virtue and a vice of the test that the Federal Circuit

8

has announced and that we are advocating that it doesn't

9

solve all the hard questions.

That is, the Federal

10

Circuit has said since this particular patent applicant

11

didn't identify any machine or any transformation that

12

would be necessary to the accomplishment of its method,

13

that person is out of luck, and, therefore, it's

14

inappropriate for us to go on to decide kind of the

15

precise level of substantiality that a machine or

16

transformation must play --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if you look at

18

your footnote, that involves the most tangential and

19

insignificant use of a machine.

20

might be enough to take something from patentability to

21

not patentable?

22

MR. STEWART:

And yet you say that

And all we've said is that it

23

might be enough; that is, hard questions will arise down

24

the road as to where do you draw the line, to what

25

extent must the machine or the transformation be

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

central --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think it's a

3

hard question.

4

to the historical averages of oil consumption over a

5

certain period and divide it by 2, that process would

6

not be patentable.

7

then it -- then it is?

8
9

If you develop a process that says look

But if you say use a calculator,

MR. STEWART:

I think if it's simply using a

calculator for its pre-existing functionality to crunch

10

numbers, very likely that would not be enough.

11

we see in some analogous areas is that the computer will

12

be programmed with new software.

13

functionality it didn't have before in order to allow it

14

to perform a series of calculations, and that gets

15

closer to the line.

It will be given

And, again --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

What

But your

17

footnote -- I don't mean to dwell on it -- it says to

18

identify counterparties to the transactions.

19

what you're trying to get is the -- the baker who sells

20

bread, because you are going to hook him up with the

21

grocer who sells, you know, in the grocery store, if you

22

punched in, in your search station -- you know, give me

23

all the bakers in Washington -- that would make it

24

patentable?

25

MR. STEWART:

So that if

Again, we are -- we are not

36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying it would be patent eligible.

2

review those facts, and the PTO would have to review

3

those facts in the context of an actual application.

4

We would have to

I guess the point I'm trying to make is

5

simply that we don't want the court, for instance, in

6

the area of software innovations or medical diagnostic

7

techniques to be trying to use this case as the vehicle

8

for identifying the circumstances in which innovations

9

of that sort would and would not be patent eligible,

10

because the case really doesn't present any -- any

11

question regarding those technologies.

12

we --

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, therefore,

Now, if it veers the

14

other way, which is by saying that we exclusively rely

15

on the machine-or-transformation test, that we're

16

precluding applications of the patent law in those

17

fields, the things we can't imagine.

18

an exclusive test, you're shoe-horning technologies that

19

might be different.

20

MR. STEWART:

Once you announce

I guess I would say a couple

21

of different things.

The first is that it seems

22

unlikely, even with new and rapidly emerging

23

technologies, that somebody would come up with a system

24

that seems for patent purposes analogous to the

25

inventions that have been patent eligible in the past

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that didn't involve any machine and that didn't involve

2

any transformation.
Having said that, I would note that in both

3
4

Benson and in Flook, the Court held open the possibility

5

that some unforeseen event could take place that

6

would -- as to which the application would be patent

7

eligible, even though the machine-or-transformation

8

test --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So help us

10

with a test that doesn't go to the extreme the Federal

11

Circuit did, which is to preclude any other items,

12

something we held open explicitly in two other cases, so

13

we would have to backtrack and say now we are ruling

14

that we were wrong, and still get at something like

15

this?

16

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the Court could

17

say -- could do essentially what was done in Benson and

18

Flook, namely acknowledge that there had never been a

19

case up to this point in which a process had been held

that some new and as yet unforeseen technology could

25

this seems to be a very unlikely candidate for such an

exception, because the hedging method that Petitioners

2

have -- for which they have sought a patent is in no

3

sense different in kind from risk management techniques

4

that have been undertaken for centuries.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that –- that

6

goes back to, not 101, but 102 and 103.

7

to obviousness or the standard weeding mechanisms for

8

patents.

9

MR. STEWART:

That goes back

Well, this may or may not be a

10

novel or nonobvious method.

11

this is nonobvious for purposes of section 103, in that

12

it represents a sufficient advance over the prior art,

13

that people skilled in the art would not necessarily

14

have come up with it, it still is a different in kind

15

from risk management techniques that have taken place in

Tell me what your --

MR. STEWART:

It did.

It did advocate the

machine-or-transformation.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You did -- and if you

9

read Judge Mayer's opinion, it has a simplicity to it.

10

It says, if it's technology, then its within the realm

11

of patent, and if it's not technology, it isn't.

12

it’s based on science or technology -- and that seems to

13

be what is used in other places.
MR. STEWART:

14

If

I don't know that our test --

15

I think our test, in a sense, has a shorthand version of

16

that.

17

on whether technology is involved would make the inquiry

18

easier, and that is so for two reasons.

19

I don't know that focusing the inquiry directly

First, people could dispute whether

20

particular advances are properly regarded as

21

technological advances, and, second, we would still have

22

the difficult problems that the Chief Justice has

23

referred to, where you have a process that is described

24

as involving technology at some step along the way, and

25

courts will still have to make the determination, is

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that a sufficiently substantial step to make the

2

process, as a whole, a technological one.

3

So I don't think that, by adopting a

4

technological arts test, the Court would avoid the

5

difficulties that it has appropriately identified with

6

the machine-or-transformation test.

7

The other thing I would say about the

8

machine-or-transformation test is this is not a

9

government position of recent vintage; that is, the

10

government's brief to this Court in Gottschalk v. Benson

11

-- or its reply brief, which was filed around 1971 --

12

basically said, although this Court has never announced

13

machine or transformation of the test, that is the

14

principle that can be abstracted from the totality of

15

the Court's decisions.

It would --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You talk about the State

21

of the Federal statute that followed it.

22

just the facts of State Street before us, and forgetting

23

the Federal statute was enacted after it, how would you

decide this case?

3

And is it -- is it machine or transformation, in your

4

view?

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, it was machine -- that

6

is, in State Street Bank, the claim was not to a process

7

within the meaning of section 101.

8

a method of accomplishing things by means of a computer,

9

which would be, potentially, a process.

The claim was not to

It was to the

10

computer itself, the programmed computer, that the

11

innovation in State Street Bank was that the devising of

12

new computer programs that allowed the computer to

13

perform various tasks in association with the carrying

14

out of the hub-and-spokes investment -- investment

15

method.

16

And, certainly -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

what did that transform?

18

MR. STEWART:

So what did that --

It didn't transform anything,

19

but it would fit -- the transformation part would be

20

irrelevant because the machine-or-transformation test

21

is, in our view, the appropriate rubric to apply in

22

construing the statutory term process, that is, when the

23

person doesn't say, I have invented a new machine, but,

24

rather, says, I've identified a new process for

25

accomplishing things.

If a person claims to be -- to have invented

a new machine, then that -- it is either a machine or it

A computer is certainly a machine.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Really, the

I don't understand how

6

that can be a patent on a machine if the only thing

7

novel is the process that the machine is using.

8

Isn't -- isn't the question -- really, the question

9

there was whether the new process was patentable.

10

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think what -- the

11

argument that the other side, the person challenging the

12

patent in State Street could have made, but apparently

13

didn't, was the person could have said, of course, the

14

computer is a machine, but a computer programmed with

15

new software to perform different functions is not a new

16

machine.

17

that has always -- not always, but that has already

18

existed, and therefore, it doesn't satisfy section 1 or

19

section -- 102 or section 103, but that --

It's not a different machine from the one

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How would you come out in

5

the State Street case today, if all of the arguments

6

were made under your test?

7

MR. STEWART:

Well, under our test, we would

8

come out the same way because the computer would be a

9

machine.

The only question would be whether the

10

programming of the computer with new software caused it

11

to be a patentable different machine from the one that

12

existed previously.

13

Now -- now, we do think that software

14

innovations can have the effect of causing the computer

15

to be a different, special purpose computer, as the

16

phrase –-

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm sorry.

I must be

18

awfully stupid.

19

In the same way the court did or this way you argued?

20

You say it would come out the same way.

MR. STEWART:

I think the same -- the

21

Federal Circuit's decision in State Street would come

22

out the same way under our test.

saying that the correct argument for the people

different process for the use of the machine.

somebody claims to have invented a new machine, the

inquiry because a -- a better television or a better DVD

player can be patented as a machine, even though

it to perform -JUSTICE STEVENS:

require any change in the hardware, if I remember it

correctly.

21

MR. STEWART:

But I -- but I think the

22

argument that has been made with success -- and PTO

23

agrees with this -- is that programming a computer by

24

means of software to produce -- to perform new functions

25

can create a novel --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But then all we do is every

2

example that I just gave, that I thought were examples

3

that certainly wouldn’t be patented, you simply patent

4

them.

saying how to set a computer to do it.

6

that.

All you do is just have a set of instructions for

8

Now, that -- what I think we were looking

9

for was -- or at least I was -- was why that isn't so,

10

and how you are going to later, down the road, deal with

11

this situation of all you do is you get somebody who

12

knows computers, and you turn every business patent into

13

a setting of switches on a machine because there are

14

no businesses that don't use those machines.

15

MR. STEWART:

Well, first of all the only

16

ruling that we're -- I backtrack a bit, to say, we

17

opposed cert in this case because we recognized that

18

there are difficult problems out there in terms of

19

patentability of software innovations and medical

20

diagnostic --

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

thought we’d mess it up.

MR. STEWART:

MR. STEWART:

You thought we -- you

I didn't think you would --

We didn't think the Court

2

provide an unsuitable vehicle for resolving the hard

3

questions because the case doesn't involve computer

4

software or medical diagnostic techniques, and

5

therefore, we thought the Court would arrive at the

6

position that I think at least some members are feeling

7

that you have arrived at, that you will decide this

8

case, and most of the hard questions remain unresolved.

9

And, frankly, we think that's true.

We thought that this case would

It said it is for

We know that things that we haven't yet

MR. STEWART:

entirely content with a ruling like that.

And we would

23

say that the claimed hedging method here is not the sort

24

of Space Age innovation that might cause Justices to

25

say:

This is just different in kind from anything that

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the drafters of the patent statute could have imagined.

2

The other point I would make about the

3

programmed computer is, to follow up on my television

4

and DVD example, that when you claim a machine or a

5

manufacture, as the committee reports to the 1952 Act

6

said, those words are broad.

7

under the sun that is made by man.

8

is indisputably a machine, even though its function is

9

not to transform matter.

They encompass everything
And so a television

It's only when you get to the

10

term "process" that you are left with -- that the

11

machine-or-transformation test kicks in.
And really, the argument on the other side

12
13

is:

14

broad.

15

of steps, whether or not linked to technology, whether

16

or not linked to a machine or transformation.

17

other side argues you should construe it that way in the

18

patent statute.

19

The term "process" in ordinary speech is extremely
It can literally be read to encompass any series

And the

I guess the -- the three reasons we would

20

say that's not so are, first, under the canon of

21

noscitur a sociis, it’s appropriate to construe the

22

term "process" in conjunction with the other terms.

23

Those other terms are broad, but they all refer to

24

physical objects that don't exist in nature and are

25

created by man.

And a huge array of very productive,

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

innovative activity doesn't culminate in the creation of

2

any new physical substance, and the word "process"

3

surely was intended to add something, but it would be

4

quite strange to construe the word "process" to

5

encompass the whole range of human endeavor when the

6

other words are limited to the creation of new things in

7

the physical.

8
9

The second thing is that when this Court in
the past has explained the term "process," it's always

10

linked it to the operation of machines, as in the

11

telephone cases and in Morse, or to the transformation

12

of matter in ways that may not be dependent on a

13

particular machine.

14

And the third thing I would say is that in a

15

sense, there’s a strong “dog that didn't bark in the

16

night” quality to our argument; that is, even though the

17

Court has never said in so many words that a method of

18

allocating risk by contract is a patent-eligible

19

process, the economic history of this country really

20

would have been fundamentally different if it had been

21

believed from the outset that innovations of this

22

character could be patented and potential competitors

23

could be foreclosed from engaging in the same method.

If the Court has nothing further?
