ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. OSTRAGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1988, the Second Circuit decided in two

13

separate decisions that a bankruptcy court exercising

14

its core jurisdiction had properly confirmed the plan of

15

reorganization that resolved present and future claims

16

against Johns-Manville and the insurers who funded

17

Manville's reorganization plan.

18

decades-old rulings to the contrary, the Second Circuit

19

sustained a collateral attack on the confirmation order

20

and held that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter

21

jurisdiction back in 1986 to enjoin direct actions

22

against Travelers, quote, "based upon, arising out of,

23

or related to," close quote -

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Last year, despite its

Mr. Ostrager, you have

characterized the Second Circuit's decision in a way the
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Second Circuit did not.

The Second Circuit said:

The

2

confirmation of the 1986 order stands, but that order

3

did not encompass what was added in 2004; that is, that

4

order dealt with the debtor, with Manville and the

5

insurer's obligation to cover Manville's liability.

6

Second Circuit said:

7

concerns independent actions against insurers for their

8

own wrong, was never encompassed in the order that they

9

affirmed.

The

Now, this 2004 order, which

So I think it's quite unfair to say it's a

10

collateral attack on the 1986 order.

11

MR. OSTRAGER:

Justice Ginsburg, the

12

bankruptcy court judge, interpreting his own order,

13

explicitly held that the 1986 order was intended and was

14

always intended to enjoin direct actions against

15

Travelers based upon, arising out of, or relating to the

16

insurance policies Manville purchased from Travelers.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At the time of the 1986

18

order, had these independent actions started?

19

at the time of the 1986 order the concerns were suits

20

involving Manville's liability and the insurers'

21

derivative obligation to cover.

22

MR. OSTRAGER:

I thought

Justice Ginsburg, at the time

23

of the 1986 order there had been various forms of direct

24

action filed against Manville, and the bankruptcy court

25

concluded, and the Second Circuit recognized, that a
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

settlement with the insurers was essential for the

2

reorganization and rehabilitation of Manville -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The insurers, to the

4

extent of the insurance proceeds.

5

the pot that made the settlement fund.

6

trying to get at is this extra piece, because the only

7

information we have is that Manville -- there was the

8

conversation that's reported in the Chubb brief.

9

question came up, well, what about actions against the

10

insurers for their own wrongs?

11

those aren't covered.

12

MR. OSTRAGER:

That's what created
But what I'm

This

And the answer was, oh,

The plan of reorganization as

13

ultimately confirmed contained the language to which I

14

directed the Court.

15

included all aspects of the resolution of the Manville

16

estate.

17

fairness to all claimants.

18

the value of the estate, and it was all about

19

rehabilitating the debtor for the benefit of its

20

employees, suppliers, and local claimants.

21

It -- a plan of confirmation

The confirmation order was all about ensuring
It was all about expanding

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, Mr. Ostrager, is -

22

help me out, because this is an issue of fact, and I

23

don't have the record in front of me now.

24

25

actions alleging insurer misconduct to proceed, those

But didn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

that had already been filed?

2

MR. OSTRAGER:

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It did.

It did, yes.

I drew the implication from

4

that that the -- that the bankruptcy court thought its

5

order would be barring such actions if they had not

6

already been filed.

7

least on the record point?

8
9

Am I right on the -- on the -- at

MR. OSTRAGER:
point.

You are right on the record

However, Judge Lifland in the hearings that were

10

associated with his clarifying order was very explicit

11

that he use the words "based upon, arising out of, or

12

related to" for the express purpose of granting

13

Travelers the broadest relief that could be afforded to

14

Travelers post-confirmation.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And But he was saying that -

16

in effect, that was simply articulating rather more than

17

he had done the first time around and what he intended

18

the first time around.

19

MR. OSTRAGER:

Well, he certainly intended

20

to make the cornerstone of the Manville reorganization

21

work.

22

subsequent collateral attack, the O'Malley case -

23

reported at 100 F.3d 944, a 1996 case where there was a

24

challenge to the bankruptcy court's reaffirmation and

25

continuation of the '86 order, Second Circuit held in

And as the Second Circuit itself held, in a

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

1996 that such an injunction is essential to the success

2

of the settlement, and its continuation was well within

3

the discretion of the trial court.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Was the Second Circuit's

5

decision based on an interpretation of the confirmation

6

order or was it based on subject matter jurisdiction?

7

MR. OSTRAGER:

The Second Circuit order was

8

explicitly predicated on the theory that the bankruptcy

9

court lacked subject matter jurisdiction back in 1986 to

10
11

enjoin these direct actions.
Now, we submit that the Second Circuit

12

clearly erred, because it conflated the entirely

13

distinct concept of the court's subject matter

14

jurisdiction and the propriety of the court's exercise

15

of subject matter jurisdiction.

16

that this Court expressly recognized 75 years ago in the

17

Continental Illinois v. Rock Island Railroad.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This was a distinction

Well, there is a

19

distinction between jurisdiction and whether the action

20

taken by the bankruptcy court comes within the statute.

21

But at some point, at some point surely the two overlap.

22

I mean, suppose -- you know, you say simply because it

23

is a bankruptcy action it comes within the bankruptcy

24

clause and there is jurisdiction.

25

bankruptcy court in connection with the bankruptcy

But what if the

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decrees that a totally unrelated company has to pay a

2

certain amount of money and it's conceded that this

3

company has no relation to the bankruptcy, but the court

4

says, this is a national problem and this other company

5

ought to contribute.

6

MR. OSTRAGER:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

Justice Scalia Do you think that would be

within the bankruptcy power?

9

MR. OSTRAGER:

Justice Scalia, clearly the

10

Congress in fashioning over the years expansive

11

safeguards facilitating growth and change in the

12

bankruptcy law as our nation's commerce has grown has

13

done that.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They can do anything under

the bankruptcy law?

16

MR. OSTRAGER:

No.

Subject to appropriate

17

safeguards.

18

reorganization a -- a debtor must meet all 16

19

requirements of section 1129.

20

Now, in order to confirm a plan of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay, that's fine.

I'm not

21

arguing about that.

I'm arguing about the principle

22

that you are asking us to accept, to wit, that this

23

challenge cannot possibly be based upon jurisdiction.

24

Surely there are some things that simply do not fall

25

within the bankruptcy power.

Isn't that true?

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MR. OSTRAGER:

I would agree that that is

so.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. OSTRAGER:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

And that -

This is not our case.
Well, what you are saying

6

is this does fall within the bankruptcy power.

7

don't tell us that it is not a challenge based upon the

8

jurisdiction of the court and based exclusively upon the

9

statute.

10

But

It could be based upon both.
MR. OSTRAGER:

Justice Scalia, I would say

11

that the bankruptcy court in this case unquestionably

12

had jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization under

13

28 U.S.C. 1334(b) as the Manville reorganization was a

14

civil proceeding arising under Title 11 of the

15

Bankruptcy Code.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Second Circuit's view

17

was that the bankruptcy court has no authority, no

18

subject matter jurisdiction, when the debtor -- debtor's

19

liability is not in question.

20

thought, rightly or wrongly, that when the liability is

21

between two- the question is between two nondebtors,

22

Travelers on the one hand, the claimants on the other,

23

Manville is not in the picture.

24

Circuit said, it falls outside the domain of the

25

bankruptcy court, and that could be wrong or it could be

The Second Circuit

That's what the Second

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right.

But in the Second Circuit's view the bankruptcy

2

court lacked authority to deal with the nondebtors'

3

liability to the claimants.

4

MR. OSTRAGER:

There were, Justice Ginsburg,

5

60 pages of findings of fact indicating that the direct

6

action suits against Manville was an end run around the

7

--

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The direct actions

against Travelers.

10

MR. OSTRAGER:

Against Travelers, were an

11

end run around the discharge of Manville, and that all

12

of the claims against Travelers arose out of and flowed

13

to the insurance relationship.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Ostrager, may I ask

15

this question.

16

in the voluminous filings here.

17

plaintiffs' cases seek recovery from assets of the

18

estate that would reduce the payments to creditors of

19

Manville?

20
21

MR. OSTRAGER:

24
25

Do any of the

Well, the reason that this is

so critical is that -

22
23

I -- I was unable to find the complaints

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you answer my

question?
MR. OSTRAGER:

They do not seek assets of

the estate, although Travelers would potentially have
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

contribution claims against Manville because all of the

2

claims -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But why does the

4

bankruptcy court have jurisdiction to enjoin third party

5

actions against some creditor of the estate?

6

MR. OSTRAGER:

The Respondents actually

7

concede that bankruptcy courts have subject matter

8

jurisdiction to enjoin actions against non-debtors in

9

appropriate circumstances.

10
11

That's the Chubb brief at

pages 22 and 40.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if those actions won't

12

affect the estate at all, I just don't understand sort

13

of the basic theory, and I don't really understand the

14

theory of the plaintiffs' cases, either.

15

understand -- I can't figure out what anybody expects to

16

collect from Travelers for what they did.

17

they defended cases certainly was proper for them as an

18

insurance company.

19

I don't

The fact that

This is mysterious case to me.

MR. OSTRAGER:

Justice Stevens , you are

20

absolutely right that these direct action cases have

21

never been sustained because they all relate to the

22

discharge by Travelers of Travelers' obligations as

23

Manville's insurer, and that's one of the reasons why

24

the bankruptcy court judge issued the injunction.

25

Now, the Second 12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

These were cases in the

2

State courts and, as I understand it, so far none of

3

them have succeeded.

4

MR. OSTRAGER:

That is correct.

5

The Second Circuit also completely ignored

6

the enactment by Congress of sections 524(g) and (h) of

7

the Bankruptcy Code, which are modelled on the Manville

8

reorganization, and expressly grandfather the Manville

9

injunction as a final order that could not be revoked.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How could you say they

11

ignored it when they had several pages devoted to 524,

12

and they said it was -- it didn't cover these so-called

13

direct actions, which really aren't what we generally

14

call direct actions.

15

what Congress did to codify essentially the Manville

16

device.

17

But the Second Circuit did address

MR. OSTRAGER:

I would respectfully

18

disagree.

524(g) specifically says that asbestos -

19

asbestos channeling injunction "shall be valid and

20

enforceable and may not be revoked or modified by any

21

court except through direct appeal."

22

specifically says that the pre-1994 asbestos channeling

23

injunctions shall be considered to meet all of the

24

requirements of 524(g)(2), which is in our appendix at

25

page 471, which means that they automatically meet
13
Alderson Reporting Company

And 524(h)(i)

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

524(g)(3)(A)(i) and may not be revoked or modified

2

except through appeal.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How do -- how do these

4

pending actions have any impact on fulfilling the

5

objections -- objectives of the channeling instruction

6

or affect the disposition of the assets in the estate?

7

I just don't understand it.

8
9
10

MR. OSTRAGER:

The essential issue here,

Justice Stevens, is that there would have been no
Manville reorganization -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

one and it's been a success.

13

MR. OSTRAGER:

Yes, but there has been

It's been a remarkable

14

success.

15

asbestos claimants have received -

16
17

Asbestos claimants have received -- 660,000

JUSTICE STEVENS:

None of whom would be

affected -

18

MR. OSTRAGER:

-- more than $2.8 billion.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But none of whom would be

20

affected if these suits go forward, as I understand it.

21

I'm missing something very important, I think.

22

MR. OSTRAGER:

The point is that there

23

couldn't have been have a Manville reorganization

24

without the insurance settlements.

25

recognized that.

The Second Circuit

The Second Circuit further recognized
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that these direct actions violate the express terms of

2

the injunction that Judge Lifland, the bankruptcy judge,

3

granted in this case.

4
5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why isn't it harmless

error?

6

MR. OSTRAGER:

The 524(g)(4)(A)(2)(iii)

7

specifically authorizes asbestos channeling injunctions

8

that bar any claim against the third party to be

9

directly or indirectly liable for claims against the

10

debtor.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if part of the

12

settlement -- I mean, Travelers says, we need to get

13

more out of this before we're going to put in all the

14

policy funds; the bankruptcy judge says, well, you are

15

going to be immune from any traffic accident liability;

16

and there is a traffic accident and Travelers said:

17

Well, the bankruptcy court said I don't have to pay.

18

that all right?

19

read it because it involves Travelers it's related to

20

the funds they submitted into the trust account.

21

that -

22

Is

It's within the jurisdiction as you

MR. OSTRAGER:

Is

Mr. Chief justice, that would

23

not be covered and that is certainly not what the

24

bankruptcy court intended or said.

But my question is how far does your theory

This Court has recognized in

the Katz case that bankruptcy extends beyond the res.

8
9
10

MR. OSTRAGER:
posed.

So there would be

Not in the hypothetical you

On direct appeal that would clearly be excluded

because it wouldn't meet -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right, on direct

12

appeal.

13

Travelers would have protection under a collateral

14

attack?

15

Are you suggesting it would be barred -- that

MR. OSTRAGER:

I don't think we need to

16

reach that issue in this case.

17

that in connection with exercising its subject matter

18

jurisdiction over the Manville reorganization the

19

bankruptcy court had the power under section 105 of the

20

Bankruptcy Code to issue any order, process or judgment

21

necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of

22

Title 11.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There is no question

Well, but it seems to me

you JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you acknowledge that

I don't know why it would be outside the

MR. OSTRAGER:

It is clearly

Well, I -- I think we have an

21

act of Congress, 524(g) and (h), which -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I interrupt you

23

there?

Because you told me that the Second Circuit

24

ignored 524(g), and I'm looking at page 33a of the

25

petition for cert and the Second Circuit addresses
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

524(g), and its discussion continues for a couple pages.

2

I don't see how that's ignoring the issue.

3

MR. OSTRAGER:

With -- with respect, I

4

believe that there are express findings of fact that the

5

bankruptcy court made which were adopted by the district

6

court, which were embraced in full by the Second

7

Circuit, and we have a -- a pure issue of law here.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And may I -- may I have

an answer to my question about the Second Circuit

10

ignoring 524(g) when they devoted two and a half pages

11

to it?

12

MR. OSTRAGER:

I believe that they clearly

13

misinterpreted the intent of 524(g) and (h).

14

clearly misperceived the fact that Congress had

15

expressly grandfathered the Manville injunction in

16

524(g).

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Another mystery in this

18

most mysterious case:

19

original order, the 1986 order, insured Travelers that

20

it would have no liability for asbestos claims, period,

21

then why did it put up $400 million, much more than it

22

had put up originally, in order to settle with people

23

who were bringing precisely that kind of claim?

24
25

If it was so clear that the

MR. OSTRAGER:

During the course of the five

years of proceedings before the bankruptcy court, the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case was referred to mediation before the Honorable

2

Mario Cuomo.

3

there was a business decision made to secure releases

4

much broader than the injunction that was contained.

5

Travelers would in connection with the mediation process

6

participate in a settlement.

7

And in connection with that mediation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the difference

8

between the release that you say flowed from the 1986

9

order and the releases that were obtained with the

10
11

$400 million?
MR. OSTRAGER:

One was a general -- one was

12

a general release and the other was a release based

13

upon, arising out of, or related to the Manville

14

insurance policies that Travelers purchased -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, specifically what was

16

not included in the 1986 release that was included as a

17

result of the settlement negotiations?

18
19
20

MR. OSTRAGER:

It -- an absolute, broad

general release by 80,000 people.

Now, I want to -

But I would like to know

the difference.

liable for under the 1986 order as you read it, that

23

they got freedom from as a result of this settlement?

Potentially -- potentially

the traffic accident that Mr. Chief Justice referenced.

I want to reserve -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So then -- so that the

3

2000 clarification order did exonerate them from traffic

4

accidents?

5

MR. OSTRAGER:

It's a general release.

6

I -- I want to conclude and reserve the

7

balance of my time by noting that "Redefining the scope

8

of a long-final confirmation order unravels intricate

place."

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

CASCINO ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

3
4

MR. ISSACHAROFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

5

As the Court has indicated, this is a

6

question of jurisdiction, and the issue is whether a

7

bankruptcy court may enter an order that goes to a

8

nondebtor, offers a release against independent State

9

law claims.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, as to the 1986 order

11

it seemed to me that the counsel for the Petitioner

12

might have answered the question posed by the Chief

13

Justice with the traffic accident hypothetical:

14

an interesting question of subject matter jurisdiction,

15

and maybe there is subject matter jurisdiction, maybe

16

there isn't, but that issue as to the 1986 order is

17

final.

18

2004, 2006.

19

that's just a reiteration of the earlier order or a

20

further expansion of jurisdiction that could be reached.

21

Why couldn't the counsel for Petitioner have

22

That is

Now, that brings us to the -- the later order,
And then the question is whether or not

given that answer?

23

MR. ISSACHAROFF:

Well, the counsel for

24

Petitioner can't give that answer for two separate

25

reasons.

The first has to do with the subject matter

jurisdiction limitation of a bankruptcy court:

2

soon as the release is outside the debtor's estate and

3

4

relationship, that places it beyond the power of the

5

bankruptcy court.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That as

But, putting aside

7

questions of notice, if these parties had been

8

represented in the appeal of the 1986 order, maybe the

9

subject matter jurisdiction ruling was correct; maybe it

10
11

was incorrect; but it's done.
MR. ISSACHAROFF:

If -- if these parties had

12

been present, if they had been appealed, if this had

13

been in effect a settlement orchestrated through the

14

bankruptcy court, then there might be the -- the ability

15

to liquidate the class action.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then it's just a

17

question of personal jurisdiction and notice.

18

a question of subject matter jurisdiction, because

19

subject matter jurisdiction can be concluded in an

20

earlier order and there can be no collateral attack if

21

you've been a party.

MR. ISSACHAROFF:

notice?
MR. ISSACHAROFF:

No, I don't believe it is

about notice.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I didn't think so.

I

7

thought this was about the case of the meaning of the

8

words in the statute that they have authority in the

9

bankruptcy court to issue any order, process or judgment

10

that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the

11

provisions of the title.

12

is whether the outcome of the proceeding -- this is the

13

effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.

15

So, as I understood it, that's the test.

no special circumstance such that a bankruptcy judge can

ever do it, no matter what?

6

MR. ISSACHAROFF:

In -- in your example,

Justice Breyer, you rely upon this Court's decision in

Celotex, which adopted the Pacor test from the Third

9

And in each case that has applied that, the

10

question is whether there is a potential impact upon the

of release because that kind of release was not

available.

14

And I think JUSTICE SOUTER:

What do you -- what do you

15

make of the provision of the 1986 order to the effect

16

that, as I understand it and as I asked your brother a

17

moment ago, existing claims based upon misbehavior of

18

the -- of the insurance company were not cut off?

19

reasonable implication, I think, of that is that any

20

future claims based upon insurance company misconduct

21

would be cut off by the terms of the '86 order.

22
23
24
25

The

What -- what do you say about that
implication?
MR. ISSACHAROFF:
say two things.

Justice Souter, I would

First of all, that the record speaks to
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

specific negotiations between Travelers and Manville and

2

between all the insurers and Manville on prospective

3

liabilities of the -- of the insurance companies, so

4

that the bankruptcy court can be read to be just

5

cleaning up what had happened retrospectively up until

6

that point.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but it was prospective

8

liability based upon misconduct of the insurance

9

company, not merely derivative of -- of its insurance

10

contract in -- in the conventional sense.

11

MR. ISSACHAROFF:

I -- I understand that.

12

But it's also important -- I think that there was a

13

question raised by Justice Alito a minute ago about what

14

exactly had happened in 1986 and whether the Second

15

Circuit was making findings of fact or findings of law.

16

In 1988, in the MacArthur case, the Second

17

Circuit relied on section 1334(d) as the jurisdictional

18

basis for upholding the district -- the bankruptcy

19

order.

20

1334(e), has to do only with the disposition of the

21

assets of the estate, the property of the estate.

22

Section 1334(d), which is now recodified as

And so, the Second Circuit order in 19 -- in

23

1988, which is the controlling legal authority on what

24

the scope of the release was, went only to the property

25

of the estate.

And so, I don't think that there was any
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understanding at the time by anyone that there was a

2

release of claims that were independent of the property

3

of the estate or made -- or had no hold upon or

4

potential impact upon the property of the estate.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why does it say -- it

doesn't say that.

says:

9

a policy claim is any and all claims based upon, arising

10

What it says in the release is it

We are releasing or everybody is enjoined from

11

And then the bankruptcy judge, in thousands

12

of findings, I guess, said that your lawsuits do relate

13

to the relevant insurance policies.

are based upon the joint -- the obligation of Travelers

all that was being released was claims against insurance

If that is -- if

the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction and hence an order

might be interpreted to cover any cases which, if

contemplated, would have precluded the settlement that

that it was going to be liable for these cases of

6

MR. ISSACHAROFF:

The second one, I

7

think that this Court has to go back to the Syngenta

8

case, which I think is quite instructive on this point.

action.

11

that the monies were paid, everything was done pursuant

to that settlement.

15

There is no question that the parties settled,

The

MR. COHN:

So, getting back to the next

2

point I would like to make is, as Mr. Issacharoff has

3

stated, the Second Circuit was presented and the

4

bankruptcy court was presented in 1986 with a plan and

with an order that was stated to be premised upon the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARRY R. OSTRAGER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12
13

MR. OSTRAGER:

Thank you.

I have five quick

points I want to make.

14

First, the Second Circuit upheld the core

15

factual findings that, quote, "the instant claims

16

against Travelers arise out of its provision of

17

insurance coverage to Manville," close quote.

18

from the Second Circuit opinion.

19

at page 33.

20

That's

It's in the appendix

Second, there is no use of the word

21

"derivative" in either the confirmation order, the

22

settlement order, or 524(g). 524(g), about which we

23

haven't spoken enough, clearly and unmistakably reflects

24

Congress's intent to allow channeling injunctions that

25

bar claims against a debtor and those, like insurers,
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

who are directly or indirectly liable for claims against

2

the debtor.

3

524(g) expressly provides an asbestos channeling

4

injunction shall be valid and enforceable and may not be

5

revoked or modified by any court except for an appeal.

6

We cite in our reply brief the fact that a

That is 524(g)(4)(A)(ii) and Roman (iii).

7

Senate report accompanying an earlier version of the

8

bill clarified that 524(g) is -- quote, "is not meant to

9

give the bankruptcy courts authority which they do not

10

already possess and simply codifies the court's ability

11

to issue supplemental permanent injunctions which are

12

irrevocable except on appeal."

13

There is a final judgment in this case

14

confirming the plan of reorganization.

15

Circuit issued that -- confirmed that judgment twice,

16

once in the MacArthur case and once in the Cane case.

17

And then in the O'Malley case, which is a 1996 case, the

18

Second Circuit rejected a collateral attack on the

19

confirmation order on two grounds.

20

The Second

First, they found that the performance of

21

the futures representative that Judge Lifland had

22

appointed and which was incorporated in 524(g) and

23

modelled on the Manville reorganization proceeding -

24

the Second Circuit found that the legal representative,

25

quote, "took an active and aggressive role in protecting
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

future claimants in this litigation."
And, secondly, the Second Circuit rejected

3

the challenge to the continuation of the 1986 order

4

enjoining the suits against insurers as being without

5

merit because such an injunction was essential to the

6

success of the settlement, and its continuation was well

7

within the court's discretion.

8
9

As respects Chubb, Judge Koetle in affirming
Judge Liflin's 2004 order, specifically found that

10

Chubb, a multinational insurer that has paid more than a

11

billion dollars to resolve asbestos-related claims, was

12

clearly on notice of these proceedings.

13

reply brief on pages 10 and 11 several 524(g)

14

injunctions that have run to the benefit of Chubb which

15

contain the exact same "based upon, arising out of, or

16

related to" language that appears in the original

17

Manville order.

18

We cite in our

We didn't cite -- but it's a matter of

19

public record -- that Chubb paid $550 million to resolve

20

through a bankruptcy proceeding with Fibreboard

21

liabilities relating to Fibreboard receiving the same

22

"based upon, arising out of, or related to" protection.

23

The Manville plan carries out the core

24

values of bankruptcy.

The Manville trust has made

25

payments to 660,000 asbestos claimants -- that's at
