CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

4

first this morning in case 06-694, United States v.

5

Williams.

6

General Clement.

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

9

This Court has made clear that speech

10

proposing an unlawful transaction is not protected by

11

the First Amendment.

12
13

And speech that falsely proposes an unlawful
transaction is likewise unprotected.

14

The statute at issue here properly construed

15

does no more than prohibit efforts to offer or solicit

16

materials that are contraband and then prevents somebody

17

from turning around after soliciting or offering

18

contraband and suggesting that the materials either did

19

not exist or were not contraband after all.

20

does not prohibit truthful speech about lawful

21

materials.

22
23
24
25

The statute

Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in
striking the statute down on its face.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if I could start

with one of the more compelling hypotheticals on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

other side.

2

review saying this is an awful movie.

3

pornography.

4

that would cause others to believe that the movie

5

contains child pornography, and wouldn't that be covered

6

by the statute?

7

Let's say I'm a movie reviewer.

I write a

It portrays child

Aren't I presenting information in a way

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, we do

8

not think that would be covered by the statute.

We

9

don't think that that would involve -- in the first

10

point, we don't think it would involve presentation or

11

promotion of the movie in the meaning of this statute.

12

We think those terms are really limited to

13

efforts to make the product available to the market.

14

And I think if you read those terms in

15

conjunction with each other, they are all directed at

16

efforts to make the product available to the market.

17

Now, so if the person whose actually

18

distributing the film wants to try to market it as

19

actual child pornography, then I suppose that would come

20

within the ambit of the statute.

21

does not have anything to worry about in the first

22

instance because I don't think that would come within

23

the term -

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
attaches the movie review.

But a movie reviewer

Suppose the distributor
It's in amazon.com, and then

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it has the movie review.

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Again, Justice Kennedy, it

3

might be conceptually possible for somebody to market,

4

let's say a mainstream movie, on the basis of a -

5

either their own statement or an attached review, that

6

misrepresents the nature of the movie and makes a claim

7

for the movie, that it's actual child pornography.

8

suppose in that unusual circumstance, it would be

9

covered.

I

But I guess it would be equally possible for

10

somebody to take one of the countless mainstream movies

11

that portrays a murder on screen, and say this is

12

actually a snuff film.

13

snuff film.

14

who did that would be clearly misrepresenting the film.

15

I don't think they would turn around if somebody tried

16

to do something about that false or misleading speech

17

and be able to defend on that speech because it would be

18

clearly false and misleading speech.

There's actually -- this was a

This was an actual murder.

Now, somebody

19

And I think what is important here is if the

20

underlying movie is not child pornography, then truthful

21

efforts to promote that movie won't be captured.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Supposing the underlying

23

movie is a depiction of atrocities being committed in

24

some foreign country, in a war zone or something, by

25

soldiers who rape young kids.

And so it comes within

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the literal terms of the statute.

2

like to take a look at this movie, wouldn't that be

3

covered by the statute?

4
5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And if one said I'd

If the movie itself comes

within the -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

pictures of soldiers raping young kids.

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

9
10

The movie itself would be

And if it were done in a

sufficiently graphic way, that it was captured JUSTICE STEVENS:

If the news -- I'm

11

thinking of the news reel -- somebody makes as exhibit

12

at a war crimes trial, or something like that -- sees

13

this actually happening.

14

language of the statute, if the person who had that film

15

described it to someone he wanted to send it to, he

16

would violate the statute.

17

Now, as I understand the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens,

18

there's -- I guess there's an anterior problem, which is

19

if the depiction were sufficiently graphic -

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They are.

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

The person that would have

22

that film would be in possession of child pornography,

23

which itself would be a problem under the statute.

24

in the possession of it.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He's

Depiction of a war crime

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taking place?

2

crime?

3

He saw that on camera -- that would be a

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And that might be an

4

example where, starting with the basic prohibition on

5

the possession of child pornography, that might be a

6

situation where there was a valid as-applied challenge.

7

And that also might be a situation where there would be

8

a valid as-applied challenge to the pandering and

9

solicitation provision.

But I think the proper way to

10

analyze that is to ask first whether or not something is

11

covered by the basic prohibition.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You do agree I guess that

13

there are some -- there would be some valid as-applied

14

challenges to this statute.

15

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I agree, and I think in

16

theory, at least, there may be valid as-applied

17

challenges to the underlying prohibition.

18

Court of course in Ferber recognized that possibility in

19

upholding the basic prohibition on the promotion of

20

child pornography in that context.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And this

But Ferber confined the

22

meaning of child pornography to, I think, the greater

23

extent than this statute does.

24

value, but this -- there were several examples given in

25

the briefs.

It talks about artistic

One was this film depicts 12 year old child
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

having sexual relations with an old man.

2

statement could be perceived as this film shows child

3

pornography.

4
5

Just that statement.

Now that

But it's a truthful

statement about Lolita, is it not?

6

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It is, Justice Ginsburg

7

but I think in context that would not be something that

8

comes within the ambit of the statute.

9

you start with the proposition that -

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why not?

And again, if

If you say -

11

if you say, 12 year old child -- this film shows a 12

12

year old child, and it doesn't tell you that the person

13

who's playing a 12 year old is a young adult?

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I understand that, Justice

15

Ginsburg.

What I would say is this statute in order to

16

apply, at least the way we interpret it, requires both

17

an objective and a subjective component.

18

would have to have a situation where that promotion of

19

the movie objectively would lead somebody to believe

20

that you're marketing in a manner that portrays it as

21

actual child pornography.

22

said right there would probably fail at the objective

23

test because I think particularly when you start talking

24

about it being a motion picture and the like, the

25

natural assumption -- let's say it's a mainstream motion

And so you

Now I think what you've just

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

picture, is going to be oh, that's just actors, it's

2

probably adult actors, or a body double or something.

3

don't think that comes within the statute.

I

4

The other thing that's required, of course,

5

is a subjective component -- specific intent is the way

6

that we would read the statute.

7

who's marketing Lolita itself and wants people to go see

8

it in a mainstream box office does not have the intent

9

to convey to people that this is actual, forbidden child

10

And clearly the person

pornography.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well what if an individual

12

received actual child pornography in the mail that had

13

not been solicited.

14

town and says I just opened my mail, and this envelope

15

is full of child porn.

16

are no body doubles.

17

And he calls the chief of police in

And he's right.

I mean, there

This is the real thing in here.

He has presented child pornography to that

18

chief of police and he's violated the statute, hasn't

19

he?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Souter, I would

21

say that the better answer is no, that he has not.

22

--

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now

You say no, but you say no

24

because we won't enforce it that way.

25

the objective component and the subjective component in
9

Alderson Reporting Company

But the -- but

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

my example are both satisfied.

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Souter, I would

3

say no for a more fundamental reason, which is I think

4

you have to read two provisions of the statute here in

5

pari materia.

6

relevant is the affirmative defense that's in subsection

7

(d) of the statute, which is at 6a of the appendix to

8

our opening gray brief.

9

affirmative defense in the situation where somebody is

10

And the other provision I think that is

And that provides an

in possession of child pornography.

11

Now, the first problem the person who gets

12

child pornography in the mail has is that the statute -

13

the bans of possession would apply.

14

affirmative defense.

15

specific to possession, but one of the things that's a

16

prerequisite to qualify for the affirmative defense,

17

which is in (d)(2)(B) is that you have to afford that

18

material -- you have to afford the agency, the law

19

enforcement agency, access to the material.

20

Now, there's an

The affirmative defense is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now -

That's -- that's fine, but

21

before you get to that point, you have -- there's still

22

an indictable offense.

23

present affirmative defenses until you're already

24

indicted.

25

You don't prevent -- you don't

GENERAL CLEMENT:

You're right, Justice

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Souter, but that is a problem both for the prohibition

2

on possession and it is not a unique problem for the

3

pandering solicitation provision.

4

fact that you might have to if -- in that situation, you

5

might have to actually present your affirmative defense

6

in some case is a reason to strike a ban on possession

7

as overbroad.

8
9

And I don't think the

But the -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the ban on possession

is not the real problem because, under a normal

10

possession statute, you would indeed have a problem not

11

merely in terms of -- that could be raised not merely by

12

affirmative defense but as an element of the statute.

13

If the possession is merely a matter of happenstance,

14

there's an intent problem and presumably there's no -

15

there's no offense.

16

acquiring material for the possession.

17

There's no knowing offense in

But in the pandering statute, what we've got

18

here is there is -- as you put it earlier, there is an

19

understanding which happens to be correct, objectively

20

correct, that there is child porn, and there is a very

21

clear intent to convey that message by way of presenting

22

this material to a third party, in this case the police.

23

So I think this is not merely comparable to the problem

24

of haphazard possession.

25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, let

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

me try two responses.

One is I do think you have a

2

problem even in possession because once you get it in

3

the mail, your possession of it is knowing.

4

precisely why Congress included this affirmative defense

5

in the statute.

6

again, we have to read these statutes in pari materia,

7

and if one of the ways you qualify for the affirmative

8

defense is you afford access to law enforcement agency

9

of the material, I don't think that which is a

And that is

The second thing I would say though is

10

prerequisite for qualifying for the affirmative defense

11

can be independently prohibited -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

GENERAL CLEMENT:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if -- by the statute.
What if you call up your

15

neighbor and say God, I got this disgusting child porn

16

in the mail?

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well -- and, again, I

18

think if you did no more than that, I don't know that

19

you would necessarily be covered by the statute, but if

20

you said I got this disgusting child pornography in the

21

mail, it's clearly unlawful, here take a look, I mean I

22

suppose that is covered by the statute.

23

doesn't seem like a natural reaction.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that

Indeed, it is covered by

the statute because I read your brief as saying that the
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute applies only in instances where either you're

2

trying to sell it or trade it.

3

trying -- now it seems to me a different matter if it's

4

covering only -- covering as well instances where

5

somebody's simply showing it to someone else to show him

6

what he got in the mail.

7

on that.

8
9

That is what you're

Well, I'd appreciate clarity

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Justice Breyer, I think

that we would take the position that even if you are

10

presenting the material, making it available, but you're

11

not charging for it, you're not exchanging it, you're

12

just offering it for free, here's a quick free look,

13

it's still covered by the statute.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's covered by the

15

statute, what you're going to do then is suddenly

16

criminalize what could be an awful lot of activity that

17

goes on in schools all over the place and somebody

18

has -- they think it's funny, and maybe it isn't funny,

19

but they think it is and it's kind of school-boy

20

behavior, and they're showing this stuff around, not

21

totally certain what it is.

22

Federal crime.

23

thought you'd written your way out of that problem, and

24

now I think you haven't.

25

Suddenly that can become a

Seems like quite an extension.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And I

Well, Justice Breyer, I

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mean, you know, I think you could certainly interpret

2

the statute to write around that problem if you wanted

3

to, but I do think the most natural reading of the terms

4

"promotes, distributes, presents, and advertises" is to

5

capture not just somebody who is making that available

6

to the market for sale or for barter, but also somebody

7

who says look, I have child pornography, I want to get

8

you interested in this, this is the real stuff, here

9

take a look.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's a very

11

different thing.

12

Breyer did and particularly footnote 4 of the reply

13

brief, which I understood to be giving "presents," for

14

example in this statute, a promotional meaning in light

15

of the other words around it, "advertises, promotes" and

16

simply telling your -- you know, your neighbor, I got

17

this, what should I do about it, isn't promotional.

18

may be in a technical term "presents," but it's not

19

promotional.

20

I read your brief the same way Justice

It

And, again, I understood your brief to

21

suggest that you have to interpret all of those words in

22

an advertising, soliciting sense.

23

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

here -- I mean I think my first cut at drawing the line

25

would to be say it's not a problem to say, can you
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

believe what I got in the mail, and talk to your

2

neighbor about it, describe it.

3

On the other hand, I do think you're

4

presenting the materials if you say, I got this in the

5

mail, look at this, isn't this disgusting, this is

6

clearly child pornography.

7
8

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Then take it as

that.

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you think though Take it as that.

I would

11

say looking and presenting to schoolmates dirty pictures

12

is a fairly common adolescent and post-adolescent

13

activity.

14

percentage of that class of people don't examine too

15

carefully what the age of the individuals depicted is,

16

and many might misrepresent what that age is.

17

sounds like a statute that has enormous reach, whereas

18

previously I thought it hadn't.

19

And I would suspect a very high-level

GENERAL CLEMENT:

So this

Well, Justice Breyer, if

20

you think that's the difference between expanding this

21

statute in some enormous way and not, then I would

22

invite you to have a more restrictive view of

23

"presents."

24

statute in a way that renders it not overbroad.

25

course, this Court has made clear on a number of

And we certainly want you to interpret the

15
Alderson Reporting Company

And, of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

occasions that, before you get to the overbreadth

2

analysis, you are applying the early constructions to

3

make sure that the statute if possible -

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

GENERAL CLEMENT:

6

constitutional.

7

But -- is construed to be

But if I could just -- I'm sorry.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I just wanted to clarify

8

the footnote to which the Chief referred, that footnote

9

4 in your reply brief.

It says, to the contrary, the

10

government's brief expressly acknowledges that the

11

statute's proscription encompasses noncommercial speech.

12

So I think Justice Breyer's suggestion that

13

you said in your brief, that the statute is limited to

14

commercial speech, is something that you -- say, no,

15

that's not so; we say it encompasses noncommercial

16

speech.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

18

think there may be a distinction to be drawn.

19

certainly don't think that it's limited to commercial

20

speech if by "commercial speech" you mean only efforts

21

to buy or sell or even only efforts to barter.

22

we think that somebody who sort of systematically is

23

operating a web site where they are giving away child

24

pornography and advertising it as such would be clearly

25

covered by the statute.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Because

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So, to the extent that the distinction

2

between commercial and noncommercial is at the line

3

where you would say you're giving it away gratis, we

4

think that's still covered.

5

Justice Breyer had a different conception in mind, that

6

you really have the -

Now, I gather that maybe

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My understanding was

8

not that it was limited to commercial speech.

9

clear from the footnote that I cited.

That was

But that

10

"presents" was limited to promotional activity.

11

one thing to present and say either whether to law

12

enforcement or your neighbor; it's another thing to

13

promote the child pornography.

14

was adopting a limited construction of words like

15

"presents" that would cover only promotional activity.

16

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It's

And I thought your brief

Well, in fairness,

17

Mr. Chief Justice, I think we had a slightly broader

18

conception of "presents."

19

"presents" means is really when you are not just sort

20

of -- you know -- in some abstract way talking about

21

presenting the material, but you're actually furnishing

22

the material to somebody else.

23
24
25

What we were thinking that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, General Clement, is

there GENERAL CLEMENT:

And -

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there anything to suggest

2

that some of these hypotheticals, where people get child

3

pornography unsolicited in the mail or that kids at

4

school are showing each other not just dirty pictures

5

but actual child pornography, are situations that occur

6

with any frequency in the real world?

7

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Not at all, Justice Alito,

8

and I think that's an important point with respect to

9

Justice Breyer's hypothetical.

I mean you have to

10

remember that the materials that we're talking about

11

here are in the main materials that are unlawful even to

12

possess.

13

Ferber, a pretty good job was done of getting these

14

materials out of the real world.

lost -- in your answer, I lost a negative or something.

18

Are you saying that this type of activity frequently

19

occurs or infrequently occurs?

20

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Infrequently occurs -

21

especially in the real world, which is to say when

22

pictures or magazines are being handed around from

23

adolescent to adolescent, there is really no reason in

24

the world to suspect that what's being handed from

25

adolescent to adolescent is child pornography as opposed
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

to adult pornography -- Playboy and that sort of thing.
Because the truth of the matter is in the

3

wake of Ferber, a pretty good job has been done in

4

stamping out child pornography in the real world.

5

has moved, unfortunately, on to the Internet.

child pornography or soliciting it as actual child

The universe of child

pornography includes activities of 17-year olds.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

13

what's important here is there may be some definitional,

15

are applications of the statute that would be

16

unconstitutional.

17

It does, Justice Stevens,
And I think

Or you may have a view that there

But what's important, I think, is that this

18

pandering and solicitation provision doesn't add some

19

child pornography, and it says that if you're taking

actual child pornography, if you are soliciting actual

child pornography, then the government can go after the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though -- even

3

though what you are, in fact, showing or presenting does

4

not fit the definition?

5

you say, have I got some hot child porn and here it is,

6

and the "it" is -- is -- an adult pretending to be a

7

child, or a virtual image.

8
9

Even if what you're showing -

So the -- the problem is not an accurate
representation that this is hardcore porn, and it is,

10

but saying, have I got the real stuff, but what you

11

present is not at all the real stuff.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That's right, Justice

13

Ginsburg.

14

and I'm consciously trying to get you to believe that

15

even though I have something that for some technical

16

reason is not the real thing, what I'm offering you is

17

the real thing, the statute does target that.

18

seems to me to not be a First Amendment problem.

19

If the scienter requirements are satisfied

But that

It seems to be a natural consequence of

20

Congress taking the Court's advice in Free Speech

Coalition and moving from a prohibition on materials

22

that had been pandered to the actual acts of pandering

23

and solicitation themselves.

And is that your answer to

the -- all of the hypotheticals that are put forth in

2

advertisement in amazon.com or Netflix, then?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, we

4

think that all those hypotheticals are taken out with

5

more than one reason.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's -- pardon me.

8

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Sure.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let's assume for the

10

moment that there are minors, so that the content aspect

11

of it is film.

12

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Oh -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That there are real minors

14

16

in some of these things.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

But are there real minors

engaging in forbidden activity?

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

20

Well, if the underlying

21

material is actually child pornography, then you may be

22

in a different situation.

23

that brief were with materials -- the underlying

24

materials were not child pornography.

25

All of the hypotheticals in

And I think that's an important distinction,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

because if you're taking a movie like "Traffic" or

2

"American Beauty," which is not child pornography -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

4

GENERAL CLEMENT:

-- and you're simply

5

truthfully promoting it, you have nothing to worry about

6

with this statute.

7

Now, if you took something -- I also think

8

that the Catholic Bishop situation isn't covered,

9

because that is not promoting, presenting and

10
11
12
13

distributing JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If one had a hand held

video at a school or something like that?
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, I mean, again -- I

14

mean, if you had a hand held video and the video itself

15

was child pornography, and then you got that on the

16

Internet or otherwise and decided you wanted to promote

17

that, I mean would be covered by the statute.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There are two things that

19

you -- that all of us have to work with here.

20

21

vague, and so forth?

22

But -

One is

Is that overly broad,

The other is the content.

And my concern is the same as that indicated

23

by Justice Stevens at the outset.

There are some

24

terrible practices in the child-trafficking area where

25

children are held in brothels for the most debased of
22
Alderson Reporting Company

acts.

There are abuses in prisons, abuses in schools.
If there are videotapes showing those

3

things, it seems to me that the statute is -- that

4

they're clearly covered by the statute, and maybe even a

5

killing of a little girl in public might be sadistic.

6

Assume that that's covered by the statute.

7

Is there anything in the "presents" and the

8

"promotes" language in the scienter component of the

9

statute that gives some protection to these materials?

10
11

Is it just as-applied?

Is that what we have to do?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Here is how I would try to

12

analyze it, Justice Kennedy, which is I would say that

13

there would be an as- applied challenge there because

14

the basic prohibition on child pornography that would

15

apply to the underlying materials, there would be an

16

as-applied exception to that.

17

pandering and the solicitation of that would be equally

18

outside the constitutional -

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And therefore, the

So we want the public to

20

see this to show them how bad it is, and that is

21

permitted under the statute, because it is not

22

"presenting"?

23
24
25

GENERAL CLEMENT:

I mean there would be

another way to try to get at that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I agree with you that we

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have different motives.

2

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Right.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I'm not sure that the

4
5

statute covers that.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, there might be a way

6

in which the statute could cover it, and it would be, as

7

follows, which basically is if I'm going to portray that

8

as material that is -- and I'm going to portray it only

9

in a way that makes it clear that I have a valid

10

as-applied challenge, then I'm not sure I would be

11

satisfying the objective and the subjective scienter

12

requirements for that statute.

13

clear that, although I was presenting it as visual

14

depictions of children who had that happen to them, I

15

was presenting it exclusively for its scientific,

16

artistic, literary value.

17

was building my as-applied challenge into the way I was

18

marketing it.

19

Because it would be

And, therefore, in a sense, I

problem not just with the presenting, not just with the

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Scalia,

2

that's exactly right.

3

logical way to proceed would be you would find an

4

as-applied exception to the basic prohibition.

5

then, naturally, that would apply to the pandering

6

provision.

7

And that's why I would think the

And

I was only sort of suggesting, if pressed,

8

that in some ways it might actually be easier to find a

9

way to get that outside the statute with respect to the

10

pandering and solicitation provision than for the

11

possession for this.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But how would you do it in

13

the case -- you mentioned that if there is not actual

14

child porn shown, and there is a truthful or honest

15

statement about it, that there is nothing to worry

16

about.

17

But what about the movie reviewer who is

18

reviewing the latest re-release or something of the

19

"Lolita" film and says this depicts sexual activity with

20

a minor?

21

That statement is true.

It would be taken

22

by some naive people as saying boy, this is what it

23

shows, the real thing.

24

And yet, it would still fall within the prohibition of

25

the statute.

That is a truthful statement.

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

As I understand your position, the only way

2

that statement would be truthful in a way that would

3

excuse would be if the reviewer said this depicts sexual

4

activity with a minor, but of course the actor wasn't

5

really a minor.

6

Isn't that correct?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

No, that is not correct,

7

Justice Souter.

8

is outside the ambit of the statute for two reasons.

9

And I would say that that hypothetical

First of all, I don't think that the movie

10

reviewer is promoting or presenting the underlying

11

materials.

12

They would be out for that reason.
I also think they would be out because, when

13

you started applying the objective and the subjective

14

requirements of the statute, you would not find either

15

of them satisfied with respect to that.

16

If I know you're talking about a mainstream

17

movie, and you say it depicts sex with a minor, I'm not

18

going to naturally think that comes within the ambit of

19

the statute, that it is actual child pornography within

20

the meaning of the statute.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if you are 17 years

22

old and you haven't gone to law school and you haven't

23

read these cases?

24
25

You may very well assume that.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

With respect, Justice

Souter, that's why I think it is important to have both
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

an objective and a subjective requirement.

And I think

2

the objective requirement alone would take that out.

3

If I could reserve the remainder of -

for the objective requirement?

We would use a I think we would use a

Wouldn't we use -- wouldn't

15

we use a reasonable personal of the sort who goes to

16

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That would be fine,

Justice Souter, and if JUSTICE SOUTER:

I would suppose my 17 year

20

old, non- law-school graduate would be within the ambit

21

of the reasonable class.

22

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And I would submit that

23

even a 17 year old, non-law student would know that

24

movies depict things that don't actually happen.

25

they see a murder on screen, that's not actually a
27

murder.

And so I think they would understand that

2

that's a movie.

It's not child pornography.

If I may reserve the remainder of my time.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You could -- just one

question.

7

17 year old playing that part.

But you said that wouldn't be -- that
wouldn't fit.

"Traffic" is not child

pornography.

12

the time of the film, but we don't think that comes

13

within the ambit of the basic prohibition on child

14

pornography, because we think that simulated sexual

15

activity has to be interpreted with enough subtlety that

16

it doesn't capture that.

17
18
19

I understand that the actress was 17 at

And that's the position -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the statute says

GENERAL CLEMENT:

It does.

But so does the

20

statute in Ferber.

And we don't think that introduced

21

any overbreadth or vagueness that was fatal.

doesn't add to it.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

The pandering provision of the PROTECT Act

8

carries a 5-year mandatory minimum prison term and a

9

possible 20-year prison term, has no affirmative defense

10

provision.

overbroad, because on its face it captures protected

speech about materials.

13

materials that may not even in fact exist.

14

It is unconstitutionally vague and

And it captures speech about

The language "in a manner that reflects the

15

belief, or that is intended to cause another to

16

believe," does not sufficiently define prohibited

17

conduct giving law enforcement unfettered discretion to

18

subjectively enforce the statute.

19

In essence, as the Eleventh Circuit held,

20

the determination does not rest on what materials

21

contain, but rather on how someone conveys his or her

22

impression about what the materials convey.

words, this statute, in short, punishes thought,

24

beliefs, expressions, and opinions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

would be any person, not necessarily amazon.com or

other movies and harbor a belief that it is obscene,

which is one of the two types of materials that's

proscribed.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose we did this?

What

would you think about an opinion, and why, which says

10

the following?

11

all the ones listed here and put them in appendix A, and

12

the opinion says this is the Solicitor General's

13

interpretation of the statute, as amended, say with the

14

word presentment, which comes out of promotion infer,

15

and we think under that interpretation of the statute,

16

none of these things, nor anything like them, could be

17

prosecuted.

18

We take every one of those examples and

And if so understood, we can find no

19

example, at least none not present in Ferber itself,

20

where this would be overbroad.

21

constitutional.

22

saying simply I want to know your opinion about what

23

would be wrong with such an opinion.

24
25

Therefore, it is

I'm not saying that is my view.

MR. DIAZ:
that could be done.

I am

My opinion, Justice Breyer, is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

or three dozen, an exponential number of examples, that

2

would be excluded.

3

affirmative defense into the statute or an absolute

4

defense that would prohibit even the prosecution.

5

concern that that raises for me, in answer to Your

6

Honor's question, is you're still going to have a

7

chilling on free speech.

people out there who are not covered by one of these

examples who we haven't thought of, and that person is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I suppose if we were

12

going to do that it would be simpler and maybe prudent

13

for us to reexamine our overbreadth rule.

Your client

14

here falls within none of these examples.

He was

15

convicted of having what everyone recognizes as not only

16

child pornography but involving a very small child.

17

he knew what it was.

18

belief.

19

And he -- and he conveyed that

Given the fact that it would appear that

20

child pornography is a growing problem, a serious

21

problem on the Internet, maybe we should examine the

22

overbreadth rule and just say that your client cannot

23

make this challenge.

24
25

And

MR. DIAZ:
Justice Kennedy.

The Court can certainly do that,

Essentially, though, I think what the
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court would be doing would be taking the four areas of

2

speech that have been taken out of the First Amendment

3

protection, which is defamation, the fighting words

4

under Brandenburg, Miller, which is obscenity, and the

5

additional extension of Ferber.

6

doing is carving yet another area of speech out of the

7

First Amendment, and we're just going to continue

8

chipping it away and chipping it away.

9

Now what we would be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

I don't think

10

that is responsive to Justice Kennedy's point.

11

wouldn't be carving it out of the First Amendment.

12

would be saying we're going to treat this area like

13

other areas, which would say that whoever is challenging

14

it has to show that they're a problematic case.

15

You
You

In other words, your client is relying -- he

16

didn't produce Lolita.

17

other people, and that is what our overbreadth doctrine

18

allows, if there's a substantial amount of speech that's

19

protected.

20

suggest is that we would wait basically for as-applied

21

challenges when Lolita is being prosecuted and we would

22

hear from them, but not in your case.

23

You're relying on the effect on

And what I understood the question to

MR. DIAZ:

That certainly could be done,

24

Mr. Chief Justice.

Again, and as I suggested earlier,

25

the problem with that is that we're not talking about
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anything less than a criminal statute, a criminal

2

statute that implicates the First Amendment, freedom and

3

thought which this Court since its very existence has

4

said we have to honor and respect, even if people are

5

thinking about nasty or dirty things.

6

That's what this country is based upon, and

7

the grave concern if we're going to do it on an

8

as-applied challenge, is people who might be afraid to

9

express their views about whether this is or is not

10

obscene.

11

see a movie and wants to tell everybody about it and

12

say, look -

13

It's is the parent of a neighborhood group who

JUSTICE ALITO:

Here we have -- we have one

14

statute that covers advertising, promoting, presenting,

15

distributing, and soliciting.

16

activities were not lumped together in one statute, and

17

there was a separate provision for each, and suppose

18

that the Court were to conclude that there is a problem

19

with one of them.

20

Suppose that all of those

Let's say promotes or presents.

Would all of the others fall as well, under

21

the overbreadth doctrine, if they were set out in

22

separate statutory provisions?

23

MR. DIAZ:

I believe that that would more

24

narrowly tailor the statute, but I don't believe,

25

Justice Alito, that it would solve the problem of
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

chilling speech.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but isn't the problem

3

the problem of your answer to Justice Breyer's

4

hypothetical.

5

appendix and we list -- I forget what he said, three

6

dozen examples that the Solicitor General says wouldn't

7

be covered and that sounds fine to us.

8

well, there would still be some examples not covered.

9

He said, you know, what if we have this

Your answer was

But isn't -- isn't the answer to that that

10

there would be some conceivable overbreadth, I suppose,

11

no matter what the appendix said?

12

there would be an example not covered that would be the

13

basis for an as-applied challenge, but there wouldn't be

14

substantial overbreadth.

15

if Justice Breyer's hypo were in fact the decision of

16

this case, there wouldn't be a fair argument that there

17

is any substantial overbreadth left to the statute,

18

isn't that so?

19

MR. DIAZ:

Somewhere out there

And isn't that the case?

That

That -- it could be, and that

20

would depend.

21

that we have this world or this universe of overbroad

22

speech, and the appendix would shrink it and make it

23

narrower.

24
25

I agree with Your Honor, Justice Souter,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And rewrite -- and

essentially rewriting the law, and that's my question
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about this technique that Justice Breyer has proposed.

2

This Court is not generally in the business of writing

3

appendices that say well, the statute couldn't apply in

4

this situation, and it couldn't apply and as long as we

5

put those contours around it.

6

write an opinion that would inform Congress why this

7

particular statute as written is overbroad, and explain

8

what kind of statute wouldn't be overbroad.

Certainly the Court could

9

But for the Court itself, I think that

10

that -- I don't know any instance in which we have

11

provided that kind of appendix that said things that are

12

like Traffic, they're okay, and things that are like

13

something else are not okay.

14

MR. DIAZ:

I don't know.

With respect, my initial response

15

to Justice Breyer's suggestion, if you will, was the

16

same as Your Honor, Justice Ginsburg.

17

creating an appendix of examples is going to cure the

18

problem.

19

We would -- we would -

20

I don't know that

I do concede that it would lessen the problem.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would it lessen?

I

21

assume whatever you put in an appendix, saying all these

22

other situations that are not before us are not covered.

23

Isn't that the most blatant dictum?

24

of course, we're not bound in later cases by our dicta.

25

But come to think of it, I guess the whole doctrine of
43
Alderson Reporting Company

But -- but -- and,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

overbreadth rests upon dictum, doesn't it?

2

rests upon our determination in this case, which

3

involves somebody who undoubtedly was selling child

4

porn, and a horrible kind of child porn -- we say in

5

this case, oh, we can -- we can contemplate other cases,

6

where we would not hold the person guilty.

7

dictum, too, isn't it?

8
9
10

It -- it

That is all

So I guess the whole doctrine is -- is based
on dictum.

So we may as well put it in all an appendix.

Let's put our dictum in an appendix.

11

MR. DIAZ:

12

question or comment -

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. DIAZ:

I agree.

In answer to Your Honor's

-- the -- I agree that the issue

15

of overbreadth is something where we're looking at

16

boundaries.

17

does in a situation of overbreadth analysis.

18

at the boundaries.

19

outside of the boundaries of what is protected.

20

And that's really what I think the Court
You look

How much -- how far we've gone

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it's the

21

boundary between what is -- what should be protected in

22

relation to what's unprotected.

23

So what's the ratio between legitimate films

24

like Lolita and illegitimate child pornography?

25

other words, is, in fact, the protected material
44
Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

substantial in relation to the law's legitimate sweep?

2

MR. DIAZ:

The problem is we don't have an

3

empirical answer, a mathematic answer to that question.

4

What we do know is that films like Lolita, American

5

Beauty, and whatnot, which if presented in a certain way

6

can bring people under the coverage of the statute, have

7

received acclaim around the world, I mean all sorts of

8

academy awards.

9

They're seen on Netflix.

They're seen time and time again.
They're seen on cable TV.

To

10

this day, some of these movies have been around for 30

11

years.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, the point of the

13

-- the point of the appendix, which unfortunately has

14

the failing of many charming metaphors, is that it has

15

acquired a life of its own.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

It distracts from the

18

question.

But it -- as I read the Solicitor General's

19

interpretation of the statute, and amended it, taking

20

the word "presentment" from its context in Ferber, where

21

it was part of the definition of promotion, I thought

22

that was the appendix.

23

question.

24

like appendices, you could focus on why isn't it the

25

appendix I'm talking about?

At least, that's my hypothetical

And so whether you like appendices or don't

He's filled it with qualifications using the

2

words "knowingly, reasonable," and a context that if it

3

is not purely commercial, as I understood, is at least

4

commercial plus a few things such as bartering.

5

That was really my question, and you've come

6

back to American Beauty and so forth, and if there's one

7

thing I think his definition keeps out of this

8

discussion, it is American Beauty and Traffic, because I

9

don't see under his interpretation how anyone could

10

conceivably be prosecuted even if he's talking to a

11

group who have never seen a movie.

12

reasonable group of people.

13

what he said?

14

MR. DIAZ:

That isn't a

So what is your response to

My response, Justice Breyer, is

that if you take the word "present" and you give it the

meaning that it was given in Ferber, you make the

MR. DIAZ:

Certainly, and I go back to the

question of Justice Breyer which is adolescents, 17 year

11

olds, 18 year olds, who like to look at these types of

12

materials and one of them could simply say to another

some hardcore child porn?

from another person, and that individual, that 17 year

old kid, who's fantasizing or experimenting with his own

sexuality, can go to jail for 5 to 20 years.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I asked you have there

3

been such cases?

A lot of states have pandering laws

4

now, and is the case that you posit a case that has

5

occurred in any of those states?

6

MR. DIAZ:

Your Honor, I cannot cite a

7

specific example, but I can certainly tell Your Honor

8

this -- prosecutions from 1997 to 2004 have increased

9

over 452 percent.

10
11

What else gives you a right to challenge the statute?

6

MR. DIAZ:

What else -
