ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

11

MR. McCONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This Court has consistently rejected the

12

argument that Federal statutes that both create a right

13

to sue and also bar waiver of rights under the statute

14

are sufficiently explicit to override the strong Federal

15

policy in favor of arbitrability expressed in the

16

Federal Arbitration Act.

17

and Pyett, the Court construed a statute the relevant

18

language of which is virtually indistinguishable from

19

that and the Credit Repair Organizations Act that we

20

have before us today.

21

In two of those cases, Gilmer

Those cases involve the ADEA.

Both the ADEA

22

and CROA, as I'll call it, create a cause of action for

23

aggrieved parties to bring actions for damages.

24

both statutes explicitly bar waiver of, quote, "any

25

right" under the statute.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that statute

And that's the sole

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, let's talk

Well, it could be a

meaningful one.

9

MR. McCONNELL:

So, the -- first of all, the

10

disclosure statute is a -- describes in layman's terms,

11

gives a quick description of an operative civil

12

liability section, which is set out in 1679g and which

13

tells us exactly what Congress had in mind in creating a

14

cause of action.

15

And when you look at the language of the

16

actual operative provision, 1679g, it's almost as if

17

Congress deliberately went out of its way to use

18

language that would not preclude arbitration.

19

language provides that a person who violates the statute

20

shall be liable to the persons --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That

Suppose it said something

22

different, Mr. McConnell.

Suppose the disclosure

23

provision didn't exist at all, but that instead of that

24

liability provision, you had a provision that simply

9

arbitration, because --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. McConnell, you

13

started with the notion that the disclosure provision in

14

the statute is meant to apply to ordinary people, and if

15

an ordinary person not schooled in the law read "you

16

have a right to sue," wouldn't they understand that to

17

mean I have a right to sue in court?

18

MR. McCONNELL:

Justice Ginsburg, in the

19

ADEA context, the government itself, the EEOC, sends

20

discriminated-against workers a right-to-sue letter that

21

tells them they have a right to sue.

22

twice said that that does not preclude arbitration.

23

that's because a right to sue is simply a cause of

24

action.

25

exclusively a right to be in court.

But this Court has

which may be vindicated, and there are various ways in

which they can be vindicated.

Arbitration Act provides that the -- that this Court or

that the courts must enforce private contractual

5

agreements that provide for the vindication even of

6

statutory rights through arbitration.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the Federal

Can you imagine any

8

statutory language that would eliminate the right, the

9

ability of the parties to enter into an arbitration

10

agreement other than language that expressly prohibits

11

the waiver of the right to sue in court in favor of

12

arbitration?

13

MR. McCONNELL:

Yes, Justice Alito, I can

14

imagine it.

15

Congress knows perfectly well how to bar arbitration.

16

They've done it in a number of statutes.

17

the very Congress that enacted CROA, there were three

18

different statutes that were proposed that would have

19

eliminated arbitration for particular statutory schemes.

20

None of them were adopted.

21

Now, Congress has to date not used it.

In fact, in

But Congress is perfectly aware of how to do

22

this.

23

"no arbitration," but -- but they certainly have to do

24

something considerably more direct than this.

25

I don't think they have to use the magic words

Here they've created a statute that provides
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there must be liability and creates a cause of

2

action, and then they tell people in a separate

3

disclosure provision -- by the way, added very late in

4

the drafting process, right -- simply to tell people

5

that they have what is colloquially known for laymen as

6

a right to sue.

7

Now, we lawyers call things causes of

8

action.

We call them things like the right to bring a

9

civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

10

That's lawyers' language.

11

about this, they think that's a right to sue.

12

cause of action and a right to sue are exactly the same

13

thing.

14

But when ordinary people talk

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But a

Mr. McConnell, the cases

15

that you cite in support of your position rest on a

16

distinction between procedural rights and substantive

17

rights, which you invoke here.

18

19

atextual in nature, that distinction, which does appear

20

in the cases.

21

should we think of rights as limited to substantive

22

rights rather than also procedural rights?

23

But where does that
Because it seems very

But when Congress talks about rights, why

MR. McCONNELL:

First of all, only our

24

waiver argument depends upon those particular cases; we

25

have a second argument.

But, nonetheless, I think this
7


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

comes from the very long tradition, at least back to the

2

1980s in Mitsubishi, of understanding that arbitration

3

is a choice of a forum, but it must vindicate the

4

substantive rights of the particular statute.

5

So, this is the way courts have talked about

6

the relationship between arbitration and the substantive

7

statute.

8

are the prohibitions, what are the substantive rights

9

and so forth, and the arbitrators enforce all of those,

So, you look at the statute, and you see what

10

but that the term rights does not include -- it does not

11

mean that there's an exclusively judicial forum, just

12

that whoever is the decisionmaker is going to enforce

13

exactly the same set of substantive rights which are in

14

the statute.
But, Justice Kagan, even if that were not

15
16

persuasive, Congress is perfectly aware that that's the

17

way that this Court had been interpreting the words,

18

because Gilmer, which interprets the very words "any

19

rights" in an anti-waiver provision as not including

20

arbitration, happened just a few years, 5 years, before

21

enactment of this statute.

22

aware of Gilmer, because in -- the very same Congress

23

that passed CROA also considered a bill, considered and

24

rejected, a bill that would have reversed the decision

25

in Gilmer.

And we know Congress was

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So, Gilmer and the very question of -- of

2

arbitration was before this Congress, and they knew that

3

the word "any rights" was interpreted by this Court the

4

way that it was in Gilmer, and they used precisely the

5

language that was interpreted that way in Gilmer.

6

And so, at this point, there's a vocabulary.

7

It's like there's a glossary.

8

even if it may not be, you know, fully textual, as you

9

say, that's -- that's the way Congress now addresses the

10
11

Congress is using it, and

matter.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- the Act in

12

Gilmer did not designate court action or right to sue as

13

a right within the non-waivable provision.

14

MR. McCONNELL:

That's true, Justice

15

Ginsburg, and the question is, does it matter?

16

say anyone looking at the ADEA's language, which says

17

that an aggrieved person may bring a civil action in

18

court, anyone would say that that is a right to sue.

19

is surely a right.

20

I would

It

And, indeed, when this Court interpreted

21

that statute in Pyett, this Court called it a right, a

22

right, to a judicial forum.

23

the Court refers to that as a "right."

24

that our statute here refers to a right to sue, rather

25

than a right to bring a civil action, seems -- certainly

Three times in the opinion,

9

Alderson Reporting Company

And the fact

Official

1

against the backdrop -- recall, please, that the

2

question here is whether Congress has explicitly

3

abrogated the -- specifically disavowed, specifically

4

barred the use -- the arbitrability of the -- of the

5

contracts, and that all doubts are supposed to be

6

resolved in favor of arbitrability, and the -- the

7

statutes must be interpreted with a healthy regard for

8

the policy in favor of arbitrability.

9

Considering this, and considering the paltry

10

basis in the text for -- for that conclusion, I don't

11

see how the Ninth Circuit's decision can be withstood --

12

could be upheld.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

5

And I think the -- the underlying logic of

6

this is that the existence of a cause of action or of a

right to sue, which I submit is a synonym for a cause of

MR. McCONNELL:

We have -- there is no

3

reason to think that when Congress appended a disclosure

provision toward the end of the drafting of this statute

5

and simply used a colloquial version of cause of action

6

so that ordinary people would understand it, that they

The operative provision tells us, I think

this sense, it's not that the cause of action goes away.

It's not the -- the cause of action is not being waived.

It's simply being vindicated in a different way, in a

13

way which Congress in the Arbitration Act has told us is

14

perfectly appropriate, just as appropriate as a -- as

15

vindication in Court and that we should leave it to --

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

Congress -- that's a policy question, and Congress has

given us an answer.

7

indicated a slightly different answer which will affect

8

cases like this in the future.

9

Dodd-Frank regulatory reform bill, Congress required the

Recently, by the way, Congress has

As part of the

10

new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conduct a

serious study of the use of arbitration procedures in

12

consumer financial matters to find out whether things

13

like what you referred to, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the

14

types of contracts and so forth are fair to consumers.
So, we'll get an authoritative answer to

15
16

this.

And Congress then vested this new bureau with

17

authority either to outlaw arbitration awards or to

18

require conditions or to reform them.

19

meantime, the policy that Congress has set is the policy

20

in the Federal Arbitration Act, which is one of a strong

policy in favor of enforcing arbitration contracts.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I guess that the problem

2

here is that there is this language in this disclosure

3

provision which is meant, you know, truly to inform

4

consumers about -- about their rights and about where

5

they're going to end up resolving their disputes, and it

6

says "you have a right to sue."

7

essentially to read that language as:

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

20

The Credit Repair Organizations Act provides

21

consumers with what it explicitly denominates a right to

22

sue, and then it says that any right of the consumer

23

under the statute is non-waivable.

24

said --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As this Court has

Does that mean that

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there's a violation of the statute the minute one of

2

these organizations asks someone to sign an arbitration

3

clause?

4

MR. NELSON:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6
7

There's -A $1,000 penalty for the

mere asking?
MR. NELSON:

There's a -- there's a

8

technical violation in asking, because in 1679f not only

9

are waivers made unenforceable, but it is -- it is

10

prohibited to ask someone to waive their rights.

11

However, that does not mean that you

12

actually have a cause of action to go in and sue

13

somebody for that, because, remember, under 1679g, what

14

you can sue for is your money back.

15

you for a waiver -- you didn't sign the contract, you

16

didn't pay them any money.

17

somebody asked you for a waiver and you never signed up

18

with them, you don't have any damages.

19

punitive damages in addition, which -- you know, the

20

general rule about punitive damages is you get them on

21

top of actual damages if you have actual damages.

If somebody's asked

Or your damages -- if

And then

22

So, it's -- yes, it's a technical violation.

23

If a company engaged in a pattern or practice of it, the

24

FTC could quite rightly go in and get an injunction

25

against that.

But it's not a case where there would be
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some onerous penalty imposed on a company merely for

2

asking for a waiver.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, doesn't that

4

reading, however, make suspect your claim that Congress

5

would have intended -- without any discussion in the

6

legislative history -- and our case law has said you

7

have to read the intent to bar arbitration both from the

8

language of the statute, its context, and its history.

9

I just don't see any history here that supports your

10
11

reading.
MR. NELSON:

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I want

12

to take that in two parts, because the first was -- was

13

tied to the -- the attempt to procure a waiver and

14

whether that calls into question whether Congress really

15

could have meant this.

16

provision to say not only can you not waive rights, but

17

it's a violation even to ask somebody to waive them.

18

It's sort of an unusual

But that's no more unusual with respect to

19

the right to sue than with respect to any other right

20

under this statute.

21

after 3 days.

22

that's a non-waivable right under the clear language of

23

this statute.

24

provision to say that if somebody just suggested that

25

you waive that right to cancel and you never actually

For example, the right to cancel

Everybody would concede, I think, that

It's an unusual and perhaps onerous

19

Alderson Reporting Company

1

waived it, they still violated the statute.

2

But, you know, that's what Congress wrote

3

here, because in this statute, it was concerned with an

4

industry that it saw as overreaching pervasively in

5

relation to the people that it was -- it was trying to

6

sign up for its services.

7

wanted a very strong prohibition of waiver of rights

8

that even attempted -- that even extended to attempts.

9

And that's why Congress

Now, as to the -JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Well, Mr. Nelson, but your

11

friend Mr. McConnell says quite rightly that the rules

12

in this area have been fairly clear, that Congress knew

13

it had to make especially clear that it wanted to void

14

arbitration agreements.

15

didn't Congress do what it has done in a thousand other

16

statutes -- or maybe that's an overstatement -- but a

17

number of other statutes, which is to say so?

18

MR. NELSON:

So, if that's the case, why

First of all, the -- the rules

19

are not that Congress has to be especially clear in this

20

context.

21

in the line of cases starting with Mitsubishi, McMahon,

22

way in the context here.

5

Court was dealing with was a statute that as amended in

an amendment that actually wasn't before the Court in

Gilmer said you can't waive any right under the statute.

8

But that then raises a question:

9

by rights under this statute?

Remember, in Gilmer, what the

Well, what do we mean

And the Court concluded

10

there and reinforced in Pyett that it interpreted that

11

to mean substantive rights; in the absence of a textual

12

indication, that when Congress used the term "rights" in

13

this statute, it was intending to protect the procedural

14

right to go to court.

15

Here we have something very different.

16

Congress creates a cause of action which, as my friend

17

says, colloquially someone could call that a right if

18

they wanted to.

19

you can obtain this liability; the court will determine

20

it; you obtain it through an action.

21

gives you an entitlement to go to court.

22

then goes further and it denominates that one of the

23

rights under this statute, one of only two rights under

24

this statute that are so-called.

25

But the cause of action says you can --

rights, and --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, and if the statute in

the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just

as we do, all of a sudden, simply because the statute

uses our normal language, those procedural rights are

6

elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be

7

waived.

That can't be right.

MR. NELSON:

I think if Congress makes clear

in the statute that what it means when it's talking

10

about rights is -- includes procedural rights, and then

11

it has a provision that says any right under this

statute is not subject to waiver, that creates a very

protections, and -- which is a phrase that isn't then

5

tied to anything defined in the statute.

6

that, for example, all of the prohibited practices

MR. NELSON:

There's a -- sort of a

pending disagreement, perhaps, over whether the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that's all those

Would your position of

5

right to a lawsuit -- would that extend to a

6

post-dispute genuinely bargained-for right to arbitrate?

7

MR. NELSON:

No, I think not, Justice

8

Ginsburg, and for this reason:

The -- the Court has

9

always differentiated between post-dispute settlements

10

of claims and pre-dispute waivers, and has not

11

considered agreements to settle, absent very special

12

either statutory language such as in the ADEA, which

13

does apply a waiver provision to some types of

14

settlements, and in the Fair Labor Standards Act, where

15

there's a very specific policy reason for prohibiting

16

certain kinds of settlements.

17

has not considered the settlement of a case to be a

18

waiver of the right to bring the case.

19

primarily came in the FELA cases that we cited in our

20

briefs.

21

But, generally, the Court

And that

But I think it was significant that in Wilko

22

v. Swan, where the Court said we're going to interpret

23

the Securities Act not to -- not to allow waivers of the

24

right to sue, the Court said:

25

apply to something that came post-dispute.

Of course, this wouldn't

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And in McMahon and Rodriguez de Quijas, what

2

the Court disagreed with Wilko v. Swan about was whether

3

the right to sue under that particular statute was

4

non-waivable.

5

that, of course, even if it were, it wouldn't bar a

6

post-dispute agreement to arbitrate a claim as a way of

7

settling an actually pending dispute.

8
9

But it favorably commented on the notion

And that's why I think when Congress enacted
this statute, it would have been acting against that

10

backdrop and would not have -- no one would have thought

11

that a settlement agreement is a waiver of the right to

12

sue.

13

right to sue.

14

A settlement agreement is a resolution of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Another argument that is

15

made, in opposition to your position, is that the

16

statute says any waiver of any protection or right may

17

not be enforced by any court or any other person.

18

the suggestion is "any other person" must contemplate an

19

alternate dispute method that doesn't involve court --

20

court or any other person.

21

MR. NELSON:

And

Well, I don't think that it

22

necessarily contemplates an alternative dispute

23

resolution mechanism, because I think, for example, that

24

would bar -- when someone goes to court to compel

25

arbitration, they are enforcing an arbitration agreement
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

by bringing an enforcement action.

2

them from doing that.

3

So, that would bar

So, "any other person" doesn't necessarily

4

mean arbitrators.

But even to the extent that it

5

comprehends arbitrators and maybe even one might have

6

thought was principally applicable to them, you've got

7

to realize that this statute -- what it prohibits is

8

only the waiver of the consumer's ability to arbitrate

9

her CROA claim.

It doesn't bar a credit repair

10

organization from requiring a consumer to arbitrate the

11

credit repair organization's breach of contract action.

12

And, in fact, most -- well over 99 percent of the

13

consumer arbitrations that were handled by the

14

arbitration forum that was designated in this contract

15

were collection actions brought by a company that says

16

this consumer owes me some money.

17

So, that's kind of the norm.

That's the

18

general run of arbitration cases.

And if a credit

19

repair organization were to initiate an arbitration

20

against a consumer, that wouldn't violate the non-waiver

21

provision; but if the consumer then defended and said,

22

wait a second, this contract is void because I never got

23

the right to cancel, the provision would quite clearly

24

prevent the arbitrator in that circumstance from saying

25

you waived the right to cancel.

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the

2

argument that the consumer retains the right to sue,

3

since they can go into court with their complaint, but

4

it's simply -- the rule that the court will apply is

5

that you have to proceed to arbitration?

6

MR. NELSON:

Well, I think it's -- it would

7

be a remarkably crabbed notion of having a right to sue

8

that meant you could file a complaint that was

9

mandatorily subject to decision elsewhere.

10

And, second,

and this goes to Justice --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's

12

frequently -- that's frequently the way these issues

13

come up.

I mean, people --

14

MR. NELSON:

Well, that's certainly --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- who think they

16

cannot be forced to arbitrate either under the agreement

17

or any other provision, they'll bring their complaint in

18

court, and then there will be a judicial resolution of

19

whether or not the proceeding should go to arbitration.
MR. NELSON:

20

But -- but all that has been

21

resolved in that -- that suit is not the plaintiff's

22

claim under CROA, which is what he has a right to sue

23

on.

24

a contractual obligation to arbitrate which he has

25

breached by going into court.

All that's resolved is the issue of whether he has

2

Under the FAA, you can compel arbitration when someone

to sue.

you have no right to -- to proceed on the merits with

exactly what the arbitration --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

damages in the arbitration for the cost of attorney's

fees to go to the court to say that you had to go to the

No, I don't think you would

law that is -- that is normally applicable in American

18

courts.

20

to any decision that would make it unenforceable, much

21

as I would regret that result.

However, if your -- if your arbitration

22

So, you know, I think in a -- in a real

23

sense, the consumer has no right to -- right to sue

24

merely because they can run into court and -- and then

25

be compelled to arbitrate.

And that's exactly why this
31


Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court, in every one of its decisions enforcing

2

arbitration agreements or not, has referred to the

3

arbitration agreement as a waiver of the right to

4

proceed judicially.

5

over again in McMahon, Rodriguez de Quijas, Mitsubishi,

6

and -- and Gilmer itself.

It has used that phrase over and

7

The -- the common recognition of all those

8

cases is that the arbitration agreement is a waiver of

9

the person's right to proceed in court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

You agree, I take

11

it, that you would lose if the statute said "you have a

12

cause of action"?

13

MR. NELSON:

Yes.

I -- you know, a cause of

14

action I don't think would -- would do it for us.

In

15

fact, that's exactly what the ADEA says, the section

16

that creates a judicial remedy is headed "Cause of

17

Action."

18

"right" is a word that -- that can be used in many

19

senses.

20

"jurisdiction."

21

when Congress says a right is non-waivable, it's

22

referring to something specific.

23

What is it referring to in a statute that uses the term

24

"right" and uses it to describe the -- the ability to go

25

to court?

And so, you know, the question again is

It's -- it's a word sort of like
It gets thrown around loosely.

But

And the question is:

32

Alderson Reporting Company

1

And -- and, again, that "right to sue"

2

language is important in two ways, because it not only

3

specifies that the 1679g remedies are a right for

4

purposes of this statute, but it says something about

5

the nature of the right.

It's a right to sue.

It's not

10

goes further than that, your argument does, it seems to

11

me.

12

rights provision would normally be read to mean

13

non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given

14

to the consumer here, which refers to the procedural

15

right to sue as a "right," eliminates that presumption.

Your argument is the waiver -- the non-waiver of

certainly a procedural right, as a right.

all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise

cannot be waived.

I mean, unless -- the right to

cancel within 3 days I suppose could be called a

8

procedure in one sense, although it's -- it's -- I think

9

it -- it probably would generally be categorized as a

10
11

substantive right.
But as far as procedural rights of the

12

consumer, they are set forth in 1679g, and they are the

13

right to bring an action either on an individual or

14

class basis for the damages and attorney fees specified

15

in that section.

17

Now, if there were something else in the

because I don't think it's there, but I would not jump

21

to the conclusion that it was a right if it was not
