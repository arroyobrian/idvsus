ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA


7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER


8
9

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it


please the Court:


10

The issue in these consolidated cases is whether


11

participants and beneficiaries of ERISA plans may seek


12

consequential and punitive damages in state court under state


13

tort law for the allegedly wrongful denial of ERISA health care


14

benefits.

15

reasoning that completely -- that the complete preemption under


16

the Federal statute applies to contract claims that essentially


17

duplicate what's available under Section 502 of the Federal


18

statute, but not to tort claims, which give supplemental remedy


19

for consequential and punitive damages.


20

The Fifth Circuit answered that question yes,


For two principal reasons, the judgment of the Fifth


21

Circuit should be reversed.

First, this Court has consistently


22

held that all challenges to the propriety of benefit


23

determination, whether couched in tort or in contract, are


24

completely preempted by Section 502 and therefore are removable


25

and governed solely by Federal law. 


4

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

Second, the fact that the welfare plans at issue in

2

these cases provide benefits for medical care, as opposed to

3

disability, death, or some other welfare benefit, does not alter

4

the analysis under the Federal statute or give the states any

5

more power to supplement the remedies that Congress included in

6

Section 502.

7

QUESTION:

Now just to be clear, Mr. Estrada, you take

8

the position that ERISA Section 502(a) completely preempts the

9

Texas scheme here?

10

MR. ESTRADA:

11

QUESTION:

12

preemption under Section 514?

13
14

And we don't have before us any conflict

MR. ESTRADA:
O'Connor.

That is - that is right, Justice

That is our position.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ESTRADA:

17

Yes.

Okay.
And turning to Section 502(a) and to the

--

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, can I just raise a question?

19

I'm sure you'll cover it in the argument and I want to get it on

20

the table.

21

that 502 is the exclusive remedy for actions to acquire benefits,

22

is there a distinction?

23

denials based on the terms of the plan, that this just doesn't

24

qualify for some reason, on the one hand, that you just should

25

get the answer out of the plan, and denials based on a

On your first point, that our prior cases have said

discretionary decision as to whether the medical treatment was


2

appropriate or not, which would require the exercise of some kind


3

of professional judgment.

4

an extra day in the hospital or something like that.

5

valid distinction or not?


6

MR. ESTRADA:

The nurse might think he doesn't need


No.

Is that a


And let me turn to that -- that was


7

my second point, but I'll turn to it now.

The use of medical


8

criteria, whether discretionary or not, is inherent in health


9

care coverage and usually is also inherent in - - in disability


10

coverage.

11

held that the -- that a claimant's treating doctor gets no


12

special deference in a claim for the benefits where the issue is


13

whether the medical factors warrant a disability finding.

14

the theory being advanced by Texas and the respondents in this


15

case, however, Black & Decker needn't, and maybe even couldn't,


16

be an ERISA case because a state of the union could regulate the


17

medical component of the disability finding under the guise of


18

regulating the practice of medicine and could give tort remedies


19

and consequential and punitive damages whenever the plan


20

disagreed with the -- with the claimant's doctor.


21

Yet, last Term, in the Black & Decker case, this Court


QUESTION:

Under


Yes, of course they could, but the fact that


22

if we held there was no preemption, it wouldn't necessarily mean


23

they would win on the merits.

24

formulary may be absolutely defensible, even though it could be


25

tested in a state court proceeding.


I mean, you are -- your drug

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I didn't understand the claim as to


2

the Aetna case necessarily to be a challenge to the promulgation


3

of the formulary, which is expressly authorized by the


4

prescription drug writer of the plan.

5

to be to a particular benefits decision that was made when Aetna,


6

as the insurer and plan administrator, concluded that the benefit


7

was not covered in the circumstances because of the step therapy


8

requirement.


9

QUESTION:

I understood the challenge


I don't want you to go too long on point two


10

without getting back to point one, but as long as we're here, it


11

does seem to me that the dichotomy, the duality you propose


12

between a decision about benefits and medical treatment might, at


13

the edges, blur into each other.

14

you're not authorized to seek this treatment and the person has


15

no other funds, basically, that is a treatment decision, in a


16

sense.


17

MR. ESTRADA:

If I say, as Aetna or CIGNA,


No, it is not, Justice Kennedy.

The


18

purpose of employee benefits plan -- benefit plans is to cover


19

some things for the employees.

20

that the benefit was $100 for each hospital stay or that you got


21

$20 for your drugs, whatever they may be, no one would deny that


22

that was a -- that that was a benefit determination.

23

earlier, with respect to medical care, it has always been the


24

case that in determining the scope of coverage, medical factors


25

have always been used and that factor is imbedded into the


If the plans in these cases said


As I said

1
2

background understandings of how this very statute works.

For example, Section 503 of the statute allows the


3

Department of Labor to promulgate regulations to deal with how


4

claims are made and the like.

5

the Department of Labor expressly contemplates that if a claimant


6

has a proposed treatment turned down, he may appeal to a named


7

fiduciary who is required, under the DOL regs, to consult with an


8

-- with an appropriate medical hair -- care professional and -


9

QUESTION:

One of those regulations by -- by


I guess my point was, at some time, and even


10

in these cases, there -- that there was a component of what we


11

might call medical judgment involved.


12

MR. ESTRADA:

That is undisputed, Justice Kennedy, and


13

I think that our position is that there is a fundamental


14

difference between a claimant who has a doctor patient


15

relationship with his doctor and a claimant who has an insuretal


16

coverage relation with his insurer.

17

of legal practice, if the person reading the plan documents and


18

denying a claim -- the claim, excuse me, uses medical training to


19

conclude that the plan documents did not cover a treatment, I


20

think few people would think that that entitled the claimant to


21

sue the person who turned it down for legal malpractice.


22

Just to put it into context


And the same is basically true here, too, because the


23

plan's -- the plan's role, as is very clearly expressed, for


24

example, in the -- in the text of the Monitronics plan, is to


25

deal with the question, shall we pay or shall we not pay.

And

1

that's actually precisely what Texas has targeted here.


2

If I could direct the Court's attention to the petition


3

appendix in the Aetna case, 02-1885, the relevant parts of the


4

Texas statute are set forth in page 59a and -

relevant here.

9

page 58a.


10

59a of what?

Of the Aetna petition appendix, 02-1885,


And as -- and there are three that are


Two of them are on page 59 and one of them is on


The first one that I want to point out is close to the


11

top of the page.

12

statute that the managed care entity did not deny or delay


13

payment.

14

did not deny or delay payment.

15

for - of what a -- of what the role of the administrator is.


16

It is an affirmative defense under the Texas


This is not about treatment.

It is a defense that it


And of course delay may be a bid


The second aspect of the statute is that the statute


17

makes very clear, once again on page 59a, that the managed -


18

that the liability -- oh.

MR. ESTRADA:

22

says the act creates no obligation on the part of the health


23

insurance carrier, moving down a little, to cover a -- to provide


24

a treatment which is not -- which is not covered by the health


25

care plan or entity.

Once again, this is targeting the coverage

1

aspect, not the treatment.

2

QUESTION:

Yes, but let me just focus on the case

3

involving the woman who may have needed a second day in the

4

hospital.

5

discretion to grant that second day if the nurse thought it was

6

really medically required?

7

Is it correct that they -- an agent of the HMO had

MR. ESTRADA:

I don't -- I don't know if there's

8

anything in the record about that.

What is clear from the record

9

and from Federal law, Justice Stevens, is that somebody in the

10

plan would have discretion to hear her appeal, even if the nurse

11

that -- that turned the request down -

12

QUESTION:

So the decision as to whether she would have

13

the second day in the hospital would depend on a medical judgment

14

made by an agent of the plan.

15

MR. ESTRADA:

Is that correct?

It would -- it would ultimately -- it

16

would ultimately turn on -- on a coverage decision that may

17

include medical criteria.

18

QUESTION:

But the coverage is if it's medically

19

needed, it would -- she would get the second day.

20

not it's covered then turns on a medical judgment, does it not?

21

MR. ESTRADA:

22

a coverage term.

23

--

24
25

But whether or

But the question of medical necessity is

It is not a medical term, Justice Stevens, and

QUESTION:

Yes, but is not correct, to make the

coverage decision, one has to make a medical decision?

10

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

MR. ESTRADA:

It -- one has to make -- one part of the


2

coverage decision is the medical decision.

3

for example, the plan sets forth a definition of medical


4

necessity which -- which sets forth, I do point out, is that you


5

have to need it -- to need the care -


6

QUESTION:

In the Aetna case,


Well, I was focusing on the CIGNA case,


7

because it seemed to me that it's a little clearer there that


8

there would be a medical judgment required.


9

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, once again, Justice Stevens, we do


10

not contend that health insurance does not involve the


11

consideration of medical factors.

12

inherent in the nature of the product that it would, just as I


13

never had car insurance before I actually owned a car.


14

QUESTION:

And, as I said, it is almost


But it's a little -- it's a little like -


15

if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the


16

plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of


17

medical care, in a way.


18

MR. ESTRADA:

That is not right, Justice O'Connor, for


19

the following reason.

The plan documents here, and the


20

background understanding of all of the parties, is that it is for


21

the treating doctor to chart the course of treatment for the


22

patient and, in fact, under the AMA's old code of ethics, which


23

we cite on page 6 of the Aetna reply brief, a physician is not


24

allowed to sway his judgment as to treatment by the existence or


25

non-existence of coverage.

In many cases, unfortunately, there


11

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

will be people who have no coverage or no insurance, or may be


2

under-insured.


3

But just to bring back the case to what the statute is


4

about, this statue is about encouraging employers to make hard


5

choices to give coverage to employees to the extent they can. 


6

There is no requirement in Federal law that requires employers to


7

give -- there are very few requirements in Federal law that


8

require employers to give particular benefits if they choose to


9

have a plan.

And, as this Court has said, most recently in the


10

Rush case, this is about a bargain with employers that seeks to


11

encourage the formation of these plans and the provision of


12

benefits to the extent possible by assuring employers of limited


13

liabilities under predictable standards.


14

QUESTION: If you are correct that Section 502(a)


15

preempts, is it possible that under ERISA 502(a)(3), that the


16

plaintiffs might recover some money, for example, for pain and


17

suffering or things like that?


18

MR. ESTRADA:

I would think not, Justice O'Connor.

Our


19

amicus, the Department of Labor, may take a slightly different


20

view of that.

21

case, which seemed very clearly, to us, at least, to stand for


22

the proposition that equitable is to be determined by reference


23

to a historical examination of all that is available in equity -


24
25

Our reading of the Mertens case and the Great West


QUESTION:

Yes, but if you make an analogy to a trustee


in equity, I think this is a different case than Mertens or Great


12

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

West, because here, the Aetna and CIGNA are fiduciaries, are they


2

not?


3
4

MR. ESTRADA:

Aetna is -- and CIGNA is for purposes of


claims processing.


5

QUESTION:

Yes.

And so, as a fiduciary they're -- they


6

are analogous to a trustee, at least, the government said, if I


7

read their footnote 13 right, that back in the old days when


8

there were -- was a division of the bench, that one of the


9

remedies available against a trustee would be in the nature of


10

make whole relief that would put the beneficiary in the position


11

he would have been in if the trustee had not committed the breach


12

of trust.


13

MR. ESTRADA:

That was the view to which I referred to


14

earlier, Justice Ginsberg, and it is possible that it may be


15

right.

16

would be a tough case to make, but it is not the issue in this


17

case.

18

It seems to me, based on Great West and Mertens, that it


Now -

QUESTION:

No, but the whole thing would work if we


19

could do that, wouldn't it?

I mean, if we could get Mertens


20

consistent with what Justice Ginsberg just read, then you would


21

provide people who are hurt, in the way these plaintiffs were


22

hurt, with a remedy.

It wouldn't be punitive damages, but they


23

would be made whole.

So, if you are right in that this is


24

basically a -- this is basically a claims decision and you


25

shouldn't give punitives and others for the incorrect making of a


13

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

claims decision.

2

gets nothing or virtually nothing and, if we could reconsider


3

that part, it would all work, wouldn't it?


4

But the hole in this is that then the woman


MR. ESTRADA:

Well, it might, but it also works in the


5

way it currently is for the following reason.

The interaction of


6

the structure of Section 502 and Section 503 is intended to set


7

forth a mechanism, under the DOL regs under Section 503, to


8

encourage the expedis -- the expeditious resolution of claims


9

disagreements.

And this is -- the statute contemplates


10

litigation but is not about litigation.

11

the benefit when it is needed and not about waiting until it no


12

longer helps you, having bypassed all avenues you had at the


13

time, external review, plan appeals, or maybe an action for an


14

injunction and then suing for relief, make whole or otherwise.


15
16

This is all about giving


If I could, Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve

the remainder of my time.

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

As Justice Gin -- as Justice

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

Ginsberg said, our position, I think, is in footnote 13 of our


2

brief, and it's a position the Department of Labor has taken in


3

cases and number -


4

QUESTION: Pretty big point to be in a footnote.


5

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, it's -- it really isn't the issue


6

in this case because our position in this case is that the claims


7

are preempted by 502(a)(1)(B).

8

fiduciary involved, in the days of the divided bench, when a


9

beneficiary sued a fiduciary, they weren't -- they could -- were


10

able to get make whole relief.

11

QUESTION:

But, in a case where there was a


And the -- by the same -


Lest we be too sanguine about the


12

application of that law in this context, I don't know any


13

equitable cases that would consider make whole relief to be


14

giving -- where what is at issue is merely the payment -- the


15

failure to pay money, refusal to pay money.

16

would give you what you would have done with that money if you


17

had gotten it.

18

Make whole relief


That's very strange.


MR. FELDMAN:

You get -- there were -- there are cases


19

that I -- I don't want to get too deeply into 502(a)(3)(B),


20

because I don't think it's what's at issue in this case.

21

there are cases in which, for example, a trustee doesn't buy an


22

insurance policy that they're supposed to buy and then the


23

beneficiary can get, as a relief, whatever the value of that


24

insurance policy would have been and -


25

QUESTION:

Sure.

But


But all that's going on here is that


15

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

the claimant was perfectly able to buy Vioxx with his own money,


2

but when it was said by the insurer that they wouldn't pay for


3

Vioxx, the claimant went and -- went with the drug that was


4

covered.

5

the fact that even if we deny relief here it'll all be okay


6

because under traditional equity law, in a situation like that,


7

you can -- you can get whatever you would have done had you been


8

given the money.

9

I have serious doubts whether we can take comfort in


I don't know that that principle washes.


MR. FELDMAN:

Well, 502(a)(3) -- I mean, ERISA does set


10

up a beneficiary trustee -- a beneficiary fiduciary type of


11

relationship that does have analogies in traditional equity.

12

in any event -


13

QUESTION:

But


And the government has taken position -


14

this is -- the footnote was not the easiest to read, but I take


15

it the Department of Labor has taken the position, in some ERISA


16

cases, that there would be just the kind of relief that Justice


17

Scalia mentioned.

18

Would this case fit that pattern?


MR. FELDMAN:

I -- it's not clear to me whether it


19

would, because it's not clear to me whether there was a fiduciary


20

involved in this case.

21

neither they -- the people who denied the benefits on behalf of


22

the plans may or may not have been fiduciaries.


23
24
25

QUESTION:

Neither of the claimants in this case,


But, as Mr. Estrada just told us that, for


these purposes, both Aetna and CIGNA would be fiduciaries.

MR. FELDMAN:

They -- well, whether the -- you know, I


16

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

frankly haven't thought about whether the plan itself would be a


2

fiduciary.

3

work is, if you have a denial of benefit, you have a right to

appeal to an appropriate named fiduciary, and at that stage,

departmental regulations give you kind of very substantial

Ordinarily, the way the ERISA scheme is supposed to


QUESTION:

I would like to hear your arguments on the


preemption issue.

MR. FELDMAN:

Thank you.

Our argument is that the


12

Texas law provides an additional remedy to that in Section


13

502(a)(1)(B), because respondents' right to recover compensatory


14

and punitive damages in this case depends on their showing that


15

they had a right to the benefits under the plan -- under the


16

terms of their plan.

17

prove that the plan's failure to exercise what the state law says


18

is due care, that their failure to exercise due care is the


19

proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.

20

that could be true is if the plan didn't pay benefits that it was


21

obligated to pay under the terms of the plan.

22

QUESTION:

The state law provides that plaintiffs must


The only way that

Yes, but in the situation in the hospital

How could they -- how

could they get relief from the denial of the extra day in the

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I -- in the first place, she was

told before -- I think the complaint says she was told before she

entered the hospital that she would have only one day in the

But in addition -

Unless it was medically necessary to stay an

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

And I would just say there's

about three backstops there.

And what -- was she going to file a complaint with the


MR. FELDMAN:

These claims can be made orally, again,


16

if the exigencies require, and she could -- she didn't try -- as


17

far as we know, no one made a phone call to the insurer and said


18

can I get the extra benefits; she needs it.

19

the results of that would have been.


20

QUESTION:

We don't know what


Well let's assume the case -- because your


21

preemption argument would cover even the most extreme case. 


22

Assume the case in which the patient and the doctor both called

the agency and appealed and they said we're too busy, we can't


24

handle it and it later determines they were -- did not exercise

due care.

MR. FELDMAN:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

But then -


Why are you preempting the state providing a


remedy for that situation?

MR. FELDMAN:

That would have been itself a denial of


5

their obligations under the Department's claim processing -


6

claims processing procedures.

7

QUESTION:

8
9

But let me say there's also -


It would have been a denial, but it wouldn't


have given her the extra day in the hospital?

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, but there are other backstops for


10

her getting the extra day in the hospital.

She is, at that


11

point, in the same position as anyone else who can't pay for


12

another day in the hospital but they need it.


13

QUESTION:

I understand.


14

MR. FELDMAN: It's up to her doctor, with whom she has a


15

doctor patient relationship that's a consensual relationship for


16

providing medical treatment.

17

when she should be discharged from the hospital and when she


18

shouldn't.


It's up to her doctor to decide


19

QUESTION:

But she can't -


20

QUESTION:

But the question we really are facing is


21

whether the State of Texas is denied the authority to provide a


22

remedy in that situation.


23

MR. FELDMAN:

Yeah, but the State of Texas has many


24

remedies to make sure the hospitals don't discharge people who


25

need an extra day in the hospital and medical ethics provides

12

rights to determine whether you're entitled to the benefit, but


13

limited your rights to sue for pun -- for compensatory and


14

especially punitive damages afterwards, because there's also, on


15

the other side of the balance, the need to encourage employers to

Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. YOUNG:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:

I want to focus on the narrow Federal jurisdictional

11

issue because this case -- these two cases come to the Court

12

based on the Federal removal doctrine that goes under the rubric

13

of complete preemption.

14

complete preemption, the plaintiff's cause of action, while not

15

citing to the Federal statute, almost exactly duplicated the

16

Federal remedy.

In each of this Court's cases on

Here we don't have that.

Here, what Texas has done is to fill a vacuum and say

we are going to set out a professional medical standard of care

20

position, they would be free to say we're going to use the

21

medical necessity standard of a witch doctor or whatever we

22

decide it is on today's basis without any reference to objective

23

medical standards.

doesn't say that, but under their argument today, they would be

25

free to do that.

Under the HMO's

MR. YOUNG:

circumstances would permit an appeal.

10

They -- yes, Justice.


An appeal is a great thing


Independent review is a great thing -


QUESTION:

No.

What I'm -- I'm just speaking to your

point of whether they're Scott free to do whatever they want. 


12

They surely aren't, you know.

13

afterwards, the claimant can get the money that's owed and the


14

relief provided by 502(a).


15

MR. YOUNG:

those were bad medical decisions, there is no remedy.

ERISA -


They don't do what the HMO -- all the HMO

22

you want to have Vioxx, buy it yourself, and I gather there was


23

some co-payment that would have been given, and if their doctor


24

thought that Vioxx was really essential, surely the doctor would


25

have abided, you know, pony up the money.

But to say that the plan condemned them to

additional money for the Vioxx.


6

All you're talking about


The claimant didn't want to lay out the


MR. YOUNG:

Well, the truth is, Your Honor, that


7

neither of these claimants would have needed health insurance if


8

they had the independent means to just whip out a gold card and


9

pay for the drug.


10

QUESTION:

See, that's why I'm thinking that Vioxx is


11

not that -- you know, on your argument you were just making, and


12

I'll only lead you into this red herring once.


13

MR. YOUNG:

14

QUESTION:

Okay.

But it would all work, you see, if I have a


15

trust, the trust is supposed to buy me an insurance policy, and


16

through total fault of the trust it doesn't, and the house burns


17

down, that equitable relief appropriate would be consequential


18

damages of the value of the house.

19

appropriate case, other equitable relief, this whole thing would


20

work and you wouldn't be having to fill a vacuum.


21

MR. YOUNG:

Now, if that were an


But under this Court's opinions previously


22

under 502, that remedy and those kinds of relief are not


23

available.


24
25

QUESTION: So you see then the logical point where I'm 

- I'd like to say modify those perhaps, but, well, the very fact


25

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005


1

that you're trying to fill this hole here proves the point,


2

because if there is a hole, it's because the court has


3

interpreted this statute perhaps wrongly as the Federal relief


4

being A, B, and C.

5

what the state's trying to do here, is add D.

6

they can't do, is add D to A, B, and C.


7

Maybe it should be A, B, C, and D, and so

And the one thing


MR. YOUNG: It's true, Your Honor, that there is this


8

hole, but that is not the reason that we should prevail on this


9

narrow jurisdictional issue, because it's the source of the duty.


10

The duty that arises here is not based on what is in the plan


11

document on medical necessity.

12

that is imposed by Texas statute to meet the professional medical


13

standard of care.


14

It comes from the external duty


QUESTION: Well, how different is the question of the


15

merits here, whether you should prevail and the question of


16

complete preemption which is raised in the removal issue?


17

MR. YOUNG: Mr. Chief Justice they are different. 


18

Because, in this narrow issue, the complete preemption issue,


19

especially when one looks at Pilot Life and Taylor.

20

decisions relied very heavily on section 301 cases, the Labor


21

Management Relations Act cases. But if you look at those cases


22

since Pilot Life and Taylor, every time the duty arose from


23

something separate than the collective bargaining agreement,


24

every time this Court has said that there is no complete


25

preemption.


Those two

QUESTION: So your view is you could prevail on the


2

propriety of removal, because there's not complete preemption,


3

and yet go back and lose on the issue of whether your claim is in


4

fact preempted?


5

MR. YOUNG: Yes Your Honor, that is the way complete


6

versus conflict preemption can work and the way that the fifth


7

circuit said it could work.

8

think that we lose on Section 515 preemption either.

9

every time this Court has gone through an ERISA analysis and

the Court also found very clearly that the insurance saving

construed to preempt.


And it's very important to look at the plain text of

And this Court has never faced


Because Section 514 (b) the insurance saving

situation.

point incorporate some issue of medical judgement in it's

7

carte blanche to any medical decision by a doctor without right

of review.

MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor, in fact, some HMO's in the


10

last two or three years have abolished this second guessing of

All AETNA cared about was whether it had to pay for

MR. YOUNG: Justice Scalia, if that were true then they

would make these decisions at the end.

Because by shifting -


QUESTION: It's important to the patient to know. 


12
13

Because the patient when -- when the patient finds out that if


14

you take Vioxx, you'll have to pay for it yourself, the patient


15

can then ask the doctor, look doc, is it really important that I


16

take Vioxx or is this other stuff in your judgment as the


17

treating physician, is this other stuff good or not -- good


18

enough.

19

It seems to me you want that decision to be made early. 


MR. YOUNG: Well, the truth is that making the decision here


20

shifts the risk.

21

shifted to the pharmacy, or the doctor, or the hospital.

22

it's made here, it puts the risk squarely on the patient. 


23

If it's made at the back end the risk is

When


QUESTION: Well except that you say when it's made here


24

it is the choice of the doctor, the pharmacy or the hospital to


25

seek that judgment early, isn't it.

In other words in the -- the

bill in.

so they would know where they stood.

The doctor could have kept the patient in the hospital

It gave an option of an early decision,


MR. YOUNG: According to the documentation the HMO has,

Your Honor, the two HMOs require that those decisions be sought

from them before or in the middle of treatment -

QUESTION: If you don't get it then, they automatically

deny it later?

MR. YOUNG: It's not just that they could deny it, they


12

-- there could be consequences to the provider. They could be


13

deselected from the network, they could be told you're not going


14

to get to see anymore of our patients.

QUESTION: So, they do force it.

MR. YOUNG: They do force it, Your Honor.

station in Pilot Life.

I guess you don't agree with Pilot Life.

25

And that's


the reality.


21

23

My premise was wrong.


Pilot Life works in the narrow

circumstance of benefits.

I was really afraid

you might.


2

QUESTION: Yes.


3

MR. YOUNG: Then could we talk about Taylor a little


4

more, because that's really the complete branch -


5

(Laughing)


6

MR. YOUNG: I guess I come back to the Chief Justice's


7

point which is we could have a situation where Pilot Life


8

preemption could occur, but the Taylor holding is the one we're


9

most concerned about, and here we are not trying to duplicate a


10

claim that would be made under ERISA, under an ERISA duty. 


11

And that leads me back to something else that's come


12

up.

The ERISA and it's regulations say nothing about setting a


13

medical standard of care, when these medical judgments are made. 


14

That's an indication that it was left to the states, and should


15

be left to the states.

16

well this may still be preempted, but it shouldn't be removed to


17

Federal court, under complete preemption doctrines. 


18

But this Court could certainly indicate,


QUESTION: Well how would that advance the general law


19

at all?

20

I don't think we took this case to decide some question of


21

removal jurisdiction, but I -- perhaps my colleagues don't agree


22

with me.


23

I mean, if the merits are decided against you, you know,


MR. YOUNG: Well, that is the very narrow issue that in fact


24

certiorari was granted on.

And it is an issue that this Court


25

last ruled on in the Anderson case last Term, and that case is

illustrative of why complete preemption shouldn't apply here. 


2

There the majority found that the claim, while not citing to


3

Federal usury law duplicated precisely and exactly Federal usury


4

law.

5

claim is not one for benefits.

6

for benefits to be made.

on a term -

10

And it was in essence, a Federal usury claim.

Here our


It couldn't be, there's no claim


But more importantly we are not relying


QUESTION: It's a claim that depends on a denial of

benefits, and isn't that the touchstone under Pilot?

MR. YOUNG: In fact Your Honor, you could have a situation


11

where the medical necessity decision is made prospectively or


12

concurrently and that's not a payment denial, in fact that's what


13

we have in most circumstances of these kinds of cases.


14
15
16

QUESTION: But it is the predicate for a payment denial,

or a payment granted.

MR. YOUNG: Really Your Honor, in truth these decisions are


17

never expressed by the utilization nurse at the hospital as a


18

payment issue.

19

She says you've got to go home now.


QUESTION: Well let's go back to my question -- I didn't


20

mean to go off on a tangent.

21

Life, turn on a determination which governs the payment or non


22

payment of benefits?


23
24
25

My question was, doesn't Pilot


MR. YOUNG: Yes, Your Honor.

Here -


QUESTION: Then this it seems to me is such a

determination.

MR. YOUNG: Well, but here Your Honor, you could have a


2

payment determination that complied completely with their


3

internal document -- documents.

5

violate the Texas standard for medical judgments and that's the


6

problem. 


Their definition of medical

7

QUESTION: It is indeed.

8

MR. YOUNG: Well -


9

QUESTION: You've described it very clearly. 


10
11
12

That's why it's preempted.


MR. YOUNG: Well -- Your Honor, except we're confusing

remedies, and duties.

The Texas duty is found no where in ERISA.


QUESTION: May I ask this question.

Could you ever


13

recover under the Texas statute without proving that you were


14

entitled to have the benefit paid?


15

MR. YOUNG: It would not -


16

QUESTION: It wouldn't be phrased in those terms. 


17

Wouldn't it be part of -- wouldn't it be a necessary element of


18

your claim, that part of what you're -- that you did have an


19

entitlement to have that benefit paid. 


20

MR. YOUNG: It would be an undisputed fact.

It would be


21

for example in these two cases.

It's undisputed that Ruby Calad


22

could get unlimited days in the hospital.

The only issue is the


23

medical judgment that she had to go home.

Same with Mr. Davila. 


24

The medical judgment was that he would not get the Vioxx; he


25

would get the cheaper generic drug.

me you have to be able to prove that they had a duty to pay for

QUESTION:

But the statute says this, it says that it

MR. YOUNG: But that doesn't -- that's -

QUESTION: So it is clearly a condition of recovery that

you show that they were in violation of the ERISA plan.

MR. YOUNG: It's an affirmative defense they may be able

to come in with.

It's not a prerequisite to my case.

MR. YOUNG: But that's very important especially Your

Honor when we're talking about a complete preemption issue.

a nurse, at CIGNA, or a physician or medical director at AETNA,

decisions.

MR. YOUNG: No I'm not saying that Your Honor, but the

gravamen of my case for purposes of looking at complete

preemption, the issue you were concerned about in Anderson, is

what are the elements of my claim.

clause.

They do not duplicate an

Which clearly the Texas -

QUESTION: Which -- This is one item I meant to ask. On


12

the other side they said that you never made any noises about the


13

savings clause in the Fifth Circuit, that it entered the case


14

just at this level, Is that so?


15

MR. YOUNG: No Your Honor, that's not correct.

While it


16

was not a feature argument with a heading in our briefing, we


17

clearly pointed out to the Fifth Circuit the Moran decision by


18

the Ninth Circuit, and that the Moran decision relied on the


19

insurance saving clause.

22

Then after oral argument -


QUESTION: That's in your brief before the Fifth

Circuit?

MR. YOUNG: Yes it's a footnote in our brief. And then


23

Your Honor, in -- after this Court decided Rush Prudential which


24

occurred after oral argument in the Fifth Circuit, both sides


25

submitted extensive letter briefs.

And those are documents, 18

transmitted to this Court, where both sides talked about what is

the impact of Rush Prudential in terms of the insurance savings

Mr. Mattax we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. MATTAX

FOR TEXAS, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE


9

MR. MATTAX: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the


10

Court.

11

on managed care entities that insert themselves into health care


12

treatment decisions by exercising medical judgment to decide


13

medical necessity.

14

this court recognized the managed care entity is not the ERISA


15

plan. 


16

The Texas legislature has imposed a duty of ordinary care


It is important to recognize at the outset as


Our statute does not impose liability on the ERISA


17

plan.

Our statute does not impose liability on an employer.

As


18

Mr. Estrada said in his argument, the whole point of the complete


19

preemption and the exclusive remedies provision Section 502(a),


20

is insuring employers that will have limited liabilities.

21

statute explicitly excludes employers from liability.

22

therefore the concerns of Section 502(a) are not at play in the


23

Texas statute.

24

because managed care entities, HMOs and other varieties and


25

forms, had decided to exercise medical judgment.
