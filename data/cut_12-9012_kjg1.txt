 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument

this morning in Case 129012, Robers v. United States.

5

 Mr. Green.

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

 MR. GREEN: 

9

please the Court:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

 With respect to property crimes, Section

11

3663A of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act requires

12

an offset against a restitution order when any part of

13

the property is returned to the victim.  This case

14

concerns secured loans for the purchase of real estate.

15

Pursuant to those loans, the lenders took a property

16

interest in the subject real estate, namely, the right

17

to foreclose and take title in the event of default.

18

When the lenders foreclosed and took title, that

19

represented a fully realized return of their preexisting

20

property right.

21

 Section 3663A further requires that that

22

property be valued as of the date of its return and not

23

at some later date when the lender sells to a third

24

party.

25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

When you said fully

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

returned, it wouldn't be fully returned if the debt was

2

greater than the value of the property.

3

 MR. GREEN: 

The property would be fully

4

returned and the property right that  that is the 

5

the right to foreclose is returned upon the default,

6

Your Honor.

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, let me just make it

8

clear.  If  if the loan is for $300,000, fraudulent

9

loan  fraudulently obtained loan, and the property is

10

foreclosed upon, and it's worth at the time $200,000, is

11

it your position that the property's been fully returned

12

and that there is no liability for the difference?

13

 MR. GREEN: 

14

not our position.

No.  No, Justice Kennedy, that's

15

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

16

 MR. GREEN: 

Okay.
Our position is only that the

17

property has to be valued at the time that the

18

foreclosure or sheriff's auction takes place because

19

that 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And one more  one more

question.
 Under Wisconsin law, when there's a

23

foreclosure, is there some automatic valuation ordered

24

by the court or is there an appraiser that automatically

25

is  is appointed or do we just decide value based on

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

the bids at the ultimate sheriff's sale?
 MR. GREEN: 

There is  there is not any

required appraisal, Your Honor.

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

5

 MR. GREEN: 

Okay.
But frequently, our

6

understanding is that lenders who credit bid for those

7

properties will, in fact, conduct an appraisal because

8

they want to know how much they should credit bid for

9

the property.  Whether it's 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

11
12

Counsel, I have two

related questions.
 The first is, what your client got was

13

money, and I don't know why it's impossible, impractical

14

or inadequate to measure the loss by the amount he got

15

and order him or her to pay it.  He can pay it on a

16

payment schedule, on any  in any way that the court

17

wants him to pay it.  So I don't know why we're in

18

(b)(1) or (b)(2) at all because I don't see where the

19

impracticality comes in.  Answer that.

20

 But then, secondly, it's not clear to me

21

that we're thinking about this right.  There seems to be

22

no dispute that a loss to the victim is the amount that

23

the victim is spending to sell the property and recoup

24

the money, and you don't seem to be taking issue with

25

that.

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GREEN: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No.
And 36  3663(2)

3

appears to be the return of the property at sentencing

4

or sometime thereafter.

5

 MR. GREEN: 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's right.
So it doesn't seem to be

7

controlling earlier return of property, and yet we're

8

sort of stuck in that model that somehow it has to be an

9

either/or.  The earlier date of return or on the date of

10

sentencing.  But shouldn't it be  and this follows up

11

on Justice Kennedy's question  shouldn't it be at the

12

time the investor can reasonably secure something from

13

the return of that property, the date of sale?

14

 If we're letting them recoup the expenses of

15

sale, why don't we just simply recognize the value on

16

that date?  And if an investor who takes property

17

inadequately decides to hold on to it or  or with no

18

reasonableness holds on to it or gives it away to their

19

mother or sells it to somebody for a nominal fee, then

20

it should be the date at which they got rid of it or the

21

day  or the value of the date  on the date of return

22

or something like that, or the date that they should

23

have done something with the property.

24
25

 Why are we stuck on these  isn't the whole
idea is to make the victim whole?  Don't you make the

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

victim whole on the day a reasonable investor would have

2

gotten rid of the property?

3

 MR. GREEN: 

The whole idea is to make the

4

victim whole.  And  and as reflected in my answer to

5

Justice Kennedy's question, that restitution order would

6

be for the difference between the amount of the loan and

7

the value of the property as of the date that the  the

8

property was returned.

9

 Your Honor first asked about

10

impracticability.  And, in fact, it is impracticable for

11

Mr. Robers to return the loan proceeds.  He can't do

12

that.  Those loans were wired to an account for the

13

benefit of the sellers.  So we submit 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

15

 MR. GREEN: 

But money is fungible.

Money is  money is fungible,

16

but so are property and money fungible, and in exactly

17

the way that  that my friend on the other side of the

18

podium suggests here.  That's because ultimately, the

19

property gets sold and the proceeds come back according

20

to their theory.  Their theory is one of strict identity

21

with respect to the application of B.  But as Your Honor

22

points out, B doesn't really apply here because all

23

we're talking about is money.  This is a situation 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Is that all we're talking

 you know, if I were arguing your side of the case, I

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would  I would not say that the bank got defrauded of

2

money.  Your client never got the money.  The money had

3

to be spent in order to buy the property.  What the

4

fraud here consisted of is that the bank got a  a

5

loan, a mortgage, an interest in property, assured by a

6

lessthansolvent debtor when it expected to get an

7

interest in property assured by a solvent debtor.

8

 And it's  why isn't the nature of the

9

fraud precisely the mortgage?  This is not as good a

10

mortgage as the bank anticipated it was getting.  And

11

therefore, you don't have to  it is indeed the very

12

same property.  They  they gave them back the  the

13

real estate, but it was not as much as  as they had

14

expected.

15

 MR. GREEN: 

That's  that's correct,

16

Justice Scalia.  When I said we're only talking about

17

money, I was attributing that to the argument of the

18

Solicitor General.  Our argument is exactly the one that

19

you've articulated.  The property, the res here, the

20

thing that was given back, was the property interest

21

that the lenders originally took in the secured loans.

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

What would happen if it

23

turned out that the property was worth more on the date

24

of sentencing than it was on the date of foreclosure?

25

 MR. GREEN: 

Then two things might happen.

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

One is the  the lender at foreclosure, Your Honor,

2

takes  takes full title, and they can do with the

3

property what they will.  If it turns out that the

4

property is worth more at the date of sentencing, then

5

that's because of the risks and  and maybe the

6

conservatism of the particular lender and  and that is

7

their benefit.  That's  that's our position.  Our

8

position is not a oneway ratchet, Your Honor.

9

 However, if it turns out to be worth a whole

10

lot more on the date of sentencing, then defense counsel

11

might be able to come in and say to  to the court,

12

look, the foreclosure amount was X.  Shortly thereafter,

13

the property got sold for twice X.  That indicates, Your

14

Honor, that the value as of the date of foreclosure

15

might actually have been higher, and Your Honor should

16

use, instead of the credit bid amount that the debtor

17

paid for the property, a higher amount.

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, how do you arrive

19

at the foreclosure amount?  I mean, the one virtue or a

20

virtue of the Government's approach is you get the

21

money, and you know exactly how much the house sold for.

22

How do you  at the time of foreclosure, there's been

23

no sale.  How do you determine the value?  You said in

24

Wisconsin, there are often appraisals, but there wasn't

25

any in this case, was there?

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GREEN: 

Not that  not that we know of,

2

but we don't know exactly what the lender did.  However,

3

I would point to Joint Appendix page 77.  And there, one

4

of the victims, which was the Mortgage Guaranty

5

Insurance Corporation, testified  Mr. Farmer testified

6

at the sentencing, that they  they use a computer

7

model.  They decided that they would pay the claim that

8

was made by the lender and take title to the property

9

because their model told them that the expenses of the

10

property and the  the value of the property would

11

ultimately be worth more than  than the particular

12

amount that they would pay in the claim.

13

 So that's a situation where the  in this

14

case, where  where the victim has gone ahead and 

15

and valued the property using their computer model,

16

and  and accepted the property with an intent.

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Can you answer this 

18

could you answer, it just happens, not this case, an

19

ordinary case.  Defendants  defendant goes to

20

Mrs. Smith:  Mrs. Smith, I have a bridge I'd like to

21

sell you.  Wonderful.  Let's go to the account, your

22

account, take out $100,000 and give it to me.

23

 She does. 

Now, it turns out he didn't own

24

the bridge.  So he owes her $100,000.  Judge:  Pay her

25

$100,000.  Your Honor, I don't have the money with me.

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

In fact, I don't have it at all.  But I also gave her my

2

valuable Babe Ruth bat.  And I don't have to give her

3

100,000.  After all, she has the bat.  Okay?  Now, what

4

happens?  I mean, variations on that theme come up every

5

day of the week, I imagine.  What happens?

6

 MR. GREEN: 

In  in that instance, Your

7

Honor, under our theory 

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

9

Not under your theory.  You

practice in this area.  I want to know what normally

10

happens.  This is a variation, I imagine, of a very

11

common theme.

12

 MR. GREEN: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14
15

If she accepted the bat 
Yes, she did.  The bat is

on her mantel.
 MR. GREEN: 

Okay.  If she accepted the bat,

16

then the value of the bat is set off against the

17

$100,000.

18
19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 
under A, not B?

20

 MR. GREEN: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

22

I would 
Wouldn't you say it comes

under A, because, after all 

23

 MR. GREEN: 

24

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

25

Perfect.  And it comes

But the 
 if  if he doesn't have

the 100,000, does he?  So if you're going to say that

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

means the fact that he doesn't have it, that he can't

2

return it, and we're under B, what B says to do is pay

3

$100,000.  So you'd end up not being able to read B.  It

4

would be incoherent, I think.  So it must come under A,

5

not B.  I mean, I would have thought so.

6

 MR. GREEN: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, you have to 
They'll read it while 

8

while I make these criticisms, and then they'll show me

9

on the Government's side, I haven't read it correctly.

10
11

All right.
 So but in any case, whatever it comes under,

12

we subtract the value of the bat.  So why don't we do

13

here just what they do there.

14

 MR. GREEN: 

But  but what B tells us to do

15

is when to value the bat, and that's why B actually

16

applies, because 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And is that  is that how

18

the courts have run this?  I mean, you know, it strikes

19

me as so common that they're supposed to return some

20

money.

21

 MR. GREEN: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right.
And, in fact, they will

23

return the money, but it has to be less the value of

24

something that's already been given to those

25

individuals.

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

 MR. GREEN: 

Right.  But when it  again,

when are we going to  when are we going to value?
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I guess it would be up to

the judge.

5

 MR. GREEN: 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Right.
The judge is not  there

7

for something, and the judge would, in fact, normally,

8

if she sold the bat, take the  take the value at the

9

time she sold it.  And there is 90 days he can ask her

10

to sell it.  Your Honor, I don't want to sell it.  I

11

don't want to sell it.  It's a Babe Ruth bat.  Very

12

well, madam.  I will value it for you.  We'll call in an

13

assessor.  That's at least one way I would expect it to

14

work, and I don't understand why it doesn't work that

15

very same way here.

16

 MR. GREEN: 

Well, it may work that very same

17

way in that  in that B tells us, value it at the

18

greater of the date of loss or at the date of

19

sentencing.  So B 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's my whole point.

21

That may not make the seller whole.  What makes the

22

seller whole is on the day that he or she sold the item

23

and received money.  That's the Government's point.

24

 MR. GREEN: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right.
But  well, that's not

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Government's point, because the Government wants to

2

value it as of the date of the sentencing.  But the 

3

but whatever the seller received on the day he or she

4

sold the bat, that's the value that it  that the

5

seller has put on that item.

6

 MR. GREEN: 

7

bat is our point.

8

But what if she doesn't sell the

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

9

the question.  That 

10

 MR. GREEN: 

11
12

Then that's  that's

And then we're in the exact

conundrum here that the Government creates because it 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, not really.  Not

13

in  not in this case.  Because in this case, the

14

property was sold.  It was sold late.  But it was not 

15

it was not  it was sold before the sentencing.

16
17

 MR. GREEN: 

One of the properties was sold

quite late, Your Honor.

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

 MR. GREEN: 

20
21

Yes.

33  33 months after the

foreclosure took place.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that was my

22

question earlier, which  was it reasonable for that

23

seller to hold on to the property that long?

24
25

 MR. GREEN: 

We would say potentially not,

Your Honor.  The point is we don't know, and the point

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is Mr. Robers can't foresee it.  But before we go there

2

to causation issues, I wanted to address Justice

3

Breyer's point about the bat, because the Government's

4

theory of the interpretation of 3663A doesn't allow for

5

that.  Their theory is it has to be strict identity.

6

Money is money is money.  That's what they  that's

7

what they keep repeating.  They do not allow for a

8

situation in which a defendant, prior to sentencing,

9

offers up some good or property 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, it doesn't, you just

11

say  look, "in the case of an offense resulting in the

12

loss of property."  My poor victim lost $100,000.  So

13

that's this case.  Return the property, i.e., return the

14

$100,000, okay?  That's simple.  That's A.  But  so

15

the judge says, defendant, return 100.

16

 Now, let's try  take B. 

If return of the

17

100 is impossible, say because he's broke, then what are

18

you supposed to do?  Then pay the greater of the value

19

of the property, which is 100,000 on the date of loss or

20

pay the 100,000 on the date of sentencing.  Now, wait.

21

I'm sorry.  That makes no sense.  If you can't pay the

22

100,000, then what you have to do is pay the 100,000 or

23

pay the 100,000.  I'm sorry.

24

 That's why I say that reading it that way to

25

me doesn't make much sense, and therefore, I think this

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is a case of A; it is a case where he's simply ordered

2

return the 100,000, and there is implicit in that you

3

don't have to return more than she  than you took, and

4

you already gave her the bat.  I mean, the bat counts as

5

some kind of a return.  We have to value the bat.  It

6

doesn't tell us what to do.  It's up to the judge.

7

 MR. GREEN: 

Well, the bat  the bat doesn't

8

count as a return on the Government's theory because

9

it's not a return of the same property.

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, yes, yes, yes.  It's 

11

you have to give her 100,000.  It doesn't say anything

12

about what form it has to take.  Our problem is some of

13

it takes the form that isn't cash.

14

 MR. GREEN: 

And then as Justice Sotomayor

15

points out, Section 3664 contemplates what the judge can

16

order turned over at sentencing.  So our theory allows

17

for a valuation of the bat.  Whether the  the  the

18

value of the bat is greater at the time it's turned over

19

or at the time the loss occurred or at the time of

20

sentencing, the judge gets to decide that under B.  But

21

what they 

22

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And who's  who has the

23

burden of proof?  If we  we know the proceeds when

24

it's sold.  It's not sold.  But you say it has to be

25

valued as of the time of foreclosure.  And I think you

16

Alderson Reporting Company

1

said someplace in your brief that it's the Government's

2

burden to show the value at the time of foreclosure.

3

 MR. GREEN: 

That's correct, Your Honor.

Actually, the statute says that at 3664E, Your Honor.
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Well, the Government's

interest, I think, would be to show a low value, right?
 MR. GREEN: 

That's correct.  It would be the

defendant's burden of production 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But you say the sentencing

10

judge has to call appraisers?  I mean, valuation of

11

property is the standard stuff of  of civil

12

proceedings in  in condemnation and many other cases.

13

You call  each side calls appraisers.  The appraisers

14

give their  their judgment and then either the jury or

15

the judge decide.  You want that to happen in every 

16

in every restitution case like this?

17

 MR. GREEN: 

Not in every restitution case,

18

Your Honor.  But as you say, courts are well equipped to

19

do it.  We're not arguing 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I'm not sure a

21

sentencing court is well equipped to do it.  A

22

sentencing court has to call appraisers?

23

 MR. GREEN: 

Yes, Your Honor, if  if

24

they're going to challenge what the foreclosure amount

25

would be.

17

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Mr. Green, here's one

2

way of looking at this case.  Maybe you'll tell me this

3

is the wrong way of looking at it.  But let's assume

4

that the bank sells the  the property within a

5

reasonable period of time or as quickly as one could

6

reasonably expect.  So one way of looking at this is

7

which party bears the risk that there is going to be a

8

significant deterioration in the real estate market

9

between the time of foreclosure and the time of sale?

10

 Now, your answer to that is that the  that

11

the victim should bear that risk?  Why should that be?

12

Why would Congress want that?

13

 MR. GREEN: 

Because the victim had complete

14

control and dominion over the property once the victim

15

foreclosed on the property.

16

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

But real estate isn't

17

completely liquid, and so it takes some time to sell it.

18

So between the time when the foreclosure occurs and the

19

time when the victim is able to sell the property and

20

get money, there  there is a deterioration in the real

21

estate market.  Why should the victim bear that risk?

22

 MR. GREEN: 

Because the victim has complete

23

dominion and control, Your Honor.  And  and we

24

wouldn't say, for example, even under the Government's

25

theory, if it were a baseball card collection and

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

somebody had returned part of the baseball card

2

collection, we wouldn't say that the  that the

3

defendant is responsible for what the  the owner of

4

the baseball card collection does with it after it gets

5

returned by the victim  or by the defendant.

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

That's a completely

7

formalistic answer.  Suppose that the  what the 

8

what the person who perpetrated the fraud returns is a

9

truckload of tomatoes.  Very valuable.  It's worth

10

exactly the value of the  of the original loan.  But

11

very perishable.  And by the time the  the tomatoes

12

can be sold, they're all rotten.  So they're worth

13

nothing.  And you would say, well, they had dominion and

14

control over the truckload of tomatoes.  What is the

15

difference?

16

 MR. GREEN: 

Well, if they accepted the

17

truckload of tomatoes and they decided not to do

18

anything with them, just like if the lender takes the

19

property back and lets it 

20
21
22

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That wasn't the

hypothetical.
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You're really confusing me.

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

 do not come under B.  I

2

thought that was your case.  Under B, you can deduct the

3

of any part of the property that is returned.

 MR. GREEN:

 MR. GREEN:

 JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.
Nor is the cartload of

rotten tomatoes.

11

 MR. GREEN: 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

13

The baseball bat is not a

And that's the 
So what are we talking

about here?

14

 (Laughter.)

15

 MR. GREEN: 

That's precisely the point I'm

16

trying to make.  It's  it's not a return because it's

17

not the same  it's not a part of the property.

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why didn't you say that?

19

You were quibbling about when it should be valued.  You

20

should have said it doesn't come under B at all.

21

 MR. GREEN: 

Well, in part, because the

22

question about  about who bears the risk is a  is a

23

legitimate question.  But because there is not 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Not if it doesn't come into

the statute at all.

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GREEN: 

Well, frequently, the  the

2

issue is, why should a fraudfeasor actually get the

3

benefit of  of a decline in the real estate market,

4

and the answer is because it's not  the fraudfeasor

5

doesn't proximately cause what third parties do with a

6

part of the property that the fraudfeasor returns once

7

the fraudfeasor has returned that property.

8
9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you agree that if the

real property is returned and that everybody agrees that

10

on the day the property is returned, the value is less

11

than the loan amount, that the victim is entitled to the

12

difference between that value and the loan amount?

13

 MR. GREEN: 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Yes, we do.
Then we are under B and

15

then we are talking about money and not the mortgaged

16

property.

17
18
19

 MR. GREEN: 

Well, we're still talking about

property, because as I said at the outset 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Money is property.  We're

20

still talking about the value of the loan valued in

21

terms of money and not of the real property, right?

22

Otherwise, your concession that the victim is entitled

23

to the difference can't work.

24
25

 MR. GREEN: 

Well, it would work, Your Honor,

because we do have to put a monetary value on the

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

property as of the date of foreclosure.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

The victim is entitled to

3

the difference in the value of the property and the

4

amount of money stolen based, on your view, on the value

5

of the property at the time that it's returned, correct?

6

 MR. GREEN: 

7

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

8
9
10

That's correct.
Then we are under B,

correct?
 MR. GREEN: 

That's correct.  We believe we

are, yes.

11

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

12

 MR. GREEN: 

13

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Thank you.
Yes.
You made a point about

14

under Wisconsin law, there would be  and the

15

foreclosure  suppose there were a foreclosure, there

16

could be no deficiency judgment.  Were you trying to

17

suggest from that that you get the property and  and

18

no restitution for the rest?

19

 MR. GREEN: 

No, Your Honor, we weren't

20

trying to suggest that.  We would  and we're not

21

standing on the deficiency judgment.  What we are 

22

what we are suggesting is that in determining what the

23

appropriate restitution is, in determining the value of

24

the  of the property that was returned at the time the

25

lenders took default, we're looking at the difference

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between the foreclosure date and  and the value of the

2

loans as they  as they were lent.  So we're not

3

standing on any 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What if I don't think that

5

the  that the mortgage has anything to do with

6

returning property, that a mortgage  the real estate

7

is not cash.  Okay?  What if I think it doesn't come

8

under B at all?  How would it be treated if it doesn't

9

come under B?

10

 MR. GREEN: 

It would be treated at  it's

11

still in a similar fashion.  And even if the

12

Government's theory were to prevail here, we think we

13

still win because a credit bid at foreclosure for a

14

piece of property is treated as cash.  That's a cash

15

transaction, Your Honor.  It's considered to be a cash

16

transaction.  And that means cash has been paid for

17

cash.  The lender has  and it stands to reason.

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Cash hasn't been returned.

19

I mean, you could say the same thing about the baseball

20

bat.  He gives him a baseball bat.  It had nothing to do

21

with the cash that he got, and  and you would say,

22

well, when he sells the baseball bat, he gets cash,

23

therefore cash has been returned.  That's surely not

24

right, is it?

25

 MR. GREEN: 

But this Court said in RadLAX

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that a credit bid is the same as cash, and that's what

2

lenders do when they foreclose on real estate.  They

3

credit bid, and that's the same thing.

4
5
6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It's the same with the

baseball bat, right?
 MR. GREEN: 

No, I don't  I don't think it

7

is, because that's a  that's a  that is a different

8

transaction.  Legally that credit bid is treated as

9

cash.

10
11

 I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time
for rebuttal.

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

13

 Ms. Harrington.

14
15

18

Thank you, Counsel.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
 I'd like to start with what I think at least

19

is some common ground between the Government and

20

Mr. Robers.  And that is that if a defendant

21

fraudulently deprives a victim of a car and then gives

22

the victim a crate of pineapples or tomatoes or an

23

elephant, he's not entitled to an offset, because what

24

the victim lost was a car and the car is not the same as

25

pineapples or an elephant.  We think that's exactly what

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

happened here.  What the victims lost in this case was

2

money.  What they got back was houses, which is not the

3

same.

4

 Now, Petitioner says it is the same.

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What happens if they

6

decide to give the house to  the banker, to his mother

7

or grandmother?

8
9
10
11

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, then that would 

that would bring in the principles of proximate cause
under the MVRA.  So if I can just say 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

No, no, it doesn't bring

12

into principles.  You  you have to give  they took a

13

property that had a value at some point 

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

They 
 perhaps through the

16

entire period.  What date does the judge use to

17

determine the value of that house?

18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, so, in that case,

19

Justice Sotomayor, no part of the property that was lost

20

by the lenders would have been returned to the lenders.

21

And so instead there would be some other property that

22

was returned, which is the houses, and then they would

23

have made an independent choice, which is not the choice

24

that the vast, vast majority of banks make, to do

25

something other  to do something with the house other

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

than to sell it.

2

 And so in that case, the district court

3

would have to use its discretion to value what had come

4

back to the lenders.  And  and probably the best way

5

to do it would be to value it at the time that they

6

disposed of it.

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you 
But that's not 
You're  you're  yes,

10

the judge would use his or her discretion and decide

11

what would have been a reasonable value at that  of

12

that house at a time when the lender should have sold

13

it.

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But 
Not when they received

16

it, not when the sentencing happened, not after the

17

sentencing.

18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right.
But on the day the court

20

decides whether a reasonable investor who's taken back

21

the property should have converted it to cash.

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But I think it's very

23

important to note that that situation would not fall

24

under 3663A(b)(1)(B)(ii).

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes, it's under 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

2

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

3
4

Exactly.
 3664, which is quite a

different thing.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.  That's a different

5

thing, because no part of the property that was lost in

6

that situation was returned.

7
8
9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's  that's my

point exactly.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.  But what we're

10

talking about here is that  is a situation in which

11

some part of the property that was lost was returned to

12

the victim.  And the question is:  Well, what was the

13

property that was returned to the victim?  We say it was

14

part of the money that they lost.  Mr. Robers says it

15

was the house.  But the victims didn't ever own the

16

houses.  They never intended to own the houses.  They 

17

they had  they had no interest in having the houses.

18

And so when they got the houses back, no part of the

19

property was returned to them.  No part of the property

20

was returned to 

21
22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

argument really rests on that statutory language.

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

25

Ms. Harrington, your whole

Yes.
And one of the questions

that came up in the last half hour is, is that the right

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

section of the statute.  Now, in your view, which is

2

that the only thing involved here is money, that's all

3

that's involved here, why aren't we under A, rather than

4

B?

5
6
7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Because Mr. Robers doesn't

have the money that he took from the victim, and so 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Right.  But usually when you

8

don't have money, I mean, say  let's just say I'm a

9

fraud victim, and I get an order of restitution for

10

$100,000, and the fraudster doesn't have the $100,000.

11

He only has $50,000.

12

 So the court says: 

Well, now you have to

13

pay the $50,000 and we're going to put you on a schedule

14

of payments, and you are going to pay the other 50 over

15

the next year or two years, whatever.

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

18
19

Yes.
Would you think that that's

under B?
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So our view is that 3663A

20

governs the calculation of the loss to the victims, and

21

3664 governs how the defendant pays back a restitution

22

award.  And so in your hypothetical, what would happen

23

is that the court would order the defendant to return

24

the part of the property he took that he still has, the

25

$50,000, and then under 3664A, he would put him on a

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

payment schedule to pay back the rest.

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So you think that my

3

hypothetical  let me  I'm just  I'm sorry for 

4

is under B, not under A?

5
6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I do think it's under B,

yes.  I don't mean to 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So any time I don't have

8

enough money to make the victim whole, it's under B, not

9

A?

10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.  And you would get an

11

offset for the amount of the money that you returned to

12

the lender.

13

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I don't  I guess 

14

gosh, I don't know.  But I would have just thought that

15

it was under A for pretty much the same reason that

16

Justice Breyer said.  It just doesn't make sense for it

17

to be under B.  I mean, essentially you are saying, you

18

know, if  if  if return of the cash is impossible,

19

pay the cash under B.  That  that just doesn't 

20

that's not a sensible statutory command.

21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

It  well, it does make

22

sense if you  if you remember that 3663A is about the

23

calculation of the loss at the time of sentencing.  And

24

so it's not about, you know, how  how much of a loss

25

you are going to have once the restitution order has

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

been paid off, because at that point, the victim will

2

have no loss.  They will have been paid.

3

 What you are trying to calculate is what was

4

the loss that we're  that we're going to order the

5

restitution for.  And so if victim  excuse me.  If the

6

defendant  defendant still has part of the property

7

that he took, then the court says:  Give it back and

8

then we calculate the net loss that the victim has,

9

$100,000 

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Does it make any

11

difference?  I mean, you know, it's odd to read B as

12

applying because it says if you can't pay back the

13

100,000, you're  now we're in B, and what B tells you

14

to do is pay 100,000.  Unless 

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But unless it's 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You know, I mean, that's

17

what it says.  And then  and then you have to subtract

18

the amount you already gave, which of course you would

19

have to do anyway.

20
21

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.  But  but B says

return the property.

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Return the 100,000.

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But if the property is a

24

bat, you return the bat.  If you don't have the bat, you

25

can't return the bat.  If the property is 100,000 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

No, no, forget the bats.


 JUSTICE BREYER: 
It's just $100,000.

3

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I know.  No, but 


4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You brought this in.


5

 JUSTICE BREYER. 

I brought in a certain 


6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

You brought it up.


7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 quality to this


8

discussion which may not have contributed as much as I


9

hoped.

10

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But it 


11

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But the  the  the point


12

is imagine it's all money.

13

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

No, I 


14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean, if it's all money,


15

A applies, that should be the end of it.  If you want to

16

apply B, do, but it's a wash.

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

What I'm saying is that the

18

property that was lost is the property that was lost.

19

If the property that was lost is a crate of tomatoes and

20

you don't have it, and you can't give it back, something

21

else has to happen.

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

No, but you see if the  it

23

would make a difference as to whether A or B applies

24

because your whole argument is premised on the language

25

of B.  So if we're not in B, if we're in A, your

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statutory argument goes away, and then we just try to

2

figure out what offset rules make sense.  I mean,

3

there's got to be an offset in A, too, right?  Suppose

4

we were under A.  It's got to be.  You don't think that

5

there is an offset under A?

6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I don't see an offset under

7

A.  A just says return the property.  If you have the

8

property, you return the property.

9
10
11
12
13
14
15

 If I could just give the second half of what
I was going to say to Justice Breyer 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, but suppose  suppose

another case.
 Just say the second half to Justice Breyer.
Sorry.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

What I'm saying is if

16

you  if you have the bat, you give the bat back.  If

17

you  if you took $100,000 and you don't have $100,000,

18

you can't return the property.  It doesn't matter

19

that  once under 3664, the district court structures

20

the way you pay a restitution order, that ultimately you

21

will be paying $100 a month for 182 years, which is what

22

this guy is going to be doing, which is to say that

23

money is never going to get back to the lenders.

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, what do you think

happens in an A case where let's  let's  in a

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

mortgage case, so there's a home, but this  this

2

person also has cash and repays the full amount in cash.

3

And now the bank has the full amount in cash, but also

4

has this home.  And then the bank sells the home.  Is 

5

is the defendant entitled to an offset?

6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

The defendant is entitled.

7

If the  if the defendant pays back the full amount of

8

the cash that it took and the lenders have taken title

9

to the house, then the lenders have no loss because the

10

full amount of the property has been returned to the

11

defendant.

12
13
14

 Under our view  and let me just say, this
situation really never arises.
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I know.  But if it did

15

arise, because I'm trying to figure out  it seems to

16

me that there has to be an implicit offset in A as well.

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So, no, I think the way

18

that would  I think it would come in under 3664.  And

19

under 3664, district courts have discretion to fashion a

20

restitution order that fits the circumstances of the

21

case.

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, Ms. Harrington, is it

23

correct this argument that it's all under A?  It has

24

been said that the  getting to B is based on this

25

idea.  A says if you can't return the property  if you

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can't return the money, B says return the money.  But is

2

that accurate?  What A says is if you don't  if it's

3

impossible to return the money, assuming that's the

4

thing at issue, B says return the value.

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, B 
And under 3664, it is

7

possible for the court to order not A, not restitution

8

of money, but restitution of inkind services.  So there

9

can be  value can be conveyed in a form other than

10

money, so it isn't circular, is it, in the way that's

11

been suggested?

12

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

No, I don't think it is.

13

And A actually does not govern situations in which

14

return of the property is not possible.  That's all

15

under B.  And we really think that that is this case.

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

All right.

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

He didn't have the money 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

If you want to read it that

19

way, it's the same problem.  It seemed redundant, not

20

circular.  But you don't think it's redundant, okay.

21

Fine.

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I don't  I don't 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

The same problem is there.

24

You go to 3664, and what happened was it says in 3664:

25

Enter a restitution order, judge.  And when you do that,

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provide for a lumpsum payment or partial payments or at

2

specified intervals, inkind payments, a combination of

3

payments.  It gives a judge a lot of discretion.

4

 So I imagine the judge, if he'd already

5

given her back 20,000, would say:  Now, defendant, pay

6

her $80,000 more.

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.

8

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Now, the problem here is,

9

instead of giving her the $20,000, he gave her an

10

inkind payment.  You see, he gave her a baseball bat or

11

in this case a house.

12

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And so now our question is

14

how do we value the house, and the statute doesn't tell

15

us.  Since that's so, I would have thought  you have a

16

very good point  if, as here, the victim has sold the

17

house already, well, what he got for it?  That's the end

18

of that.  Unless, of course, it was an unreasonable,

19

fraudulent, or hookedup sale, which the defendant can

20

point out, and the judge could  what happens if she

21

won't sell the house?  She says:  I love the bat, I love

22

the house, I'm not selling.

23

 Then you say you have 90 days to do it 

24

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 or you  or let it

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

befall on you what help befalls.  And then what you have

2

to do is value the house if she still won't sell it.

3

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes, he would 

4

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And you have to value the

5
6

bat if she still won't sell it.  Do I have that right?
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes, but you would value

7

the bat or the house as a replacement of property under

8

Subsection 3664(f)(4), not as a return of the property

9

that was lost.

10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It was not a return.


11

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right, because it's not the


12

property 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

14

they're try to get rid of.

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right, but 


16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I see.


17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But under Section 3664, you


It's inkind property


18

are allowed to make an inkind payment with return of

19

property or replacement of property.  Return of property

20

is return of the property that was lost; replacement is

21

giving some other kind of property different from what

22

was lost.  But under Section 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But it also goes back to

24

how do you measure and when do you measure this.  It's

25

easy if the property is returned on the date of

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sentencing or 90 days after, or not returned then.

2

Because then the judge could basically figure out what's

3

a reasonable time, the date of sentence or within the 90

4

days, the day they sold the property.

5
6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

the house because they've gotten back the money 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

8

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

9
10

It's easy when they sell

Right.
 which is part of the

property they lost.
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But  but the question

11

becomes what happens when the house is done before 

12

given over not as a part of sentencing, but

13

independently.

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So the next thing 
And that  and that's

16

why I don't think any of these provisions really answer

17

that question.

18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But 
And so why don't we go

20

back to the basics?  Why should the victim  I think

21

you agree with this  why should the victim suffer the

22

loss attendant to selling property that decreases in

23

value because during the time that they were teeing it

24

up for sale, the market dropped, and you say the victim

25

shouldn't.

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

2

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

3

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The victim should not.
All right.
The MVRA 
But let's assume that

5

the market dropped and they sold it.  What's the value

6

you give to the  to the victim?  It's the date that

7

the victim sold the property, no?

8
9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

It's  right, but that's

because that's when they got back part of the property

10

they lost, because the property they lost was money.

11

When they got the house, no part of the property that

12

they lost was returned to them until they got the money

13

back.

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Now, Justice Breyer

15

asked you what happens if on some day, they did

16

something unreasonable.  They just kept the property.

17

They gave it to a grandmother.  They sold it to someone

18

for a nominal amount.  A sham transaction.  What does a

19

judge do then?  They kept the property because they just

20

didn't want to sell it.  They just let it die because

21

they were lazy.

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24
25

So then 
Is that a case the

victim should be made whole for their loss?
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

No, because that's a case

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 I mean, yes, in the sense that they should be made

2

whole for the part of the loss that's attributable to

3

the actions of the defendant.  But that's a situation

4

where part of the victim's net losses would be

5

attributable to independent decisions that are

6

commercially unreasonable made by the victim; and so

7

that's where proximate cause come in.  That's not this

8

case.  In this case, there's no indication that the

9

lenders held on to the houses for longer than was

10
11

reasonable.
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Do you agree that the

12

victim, in this case the bank, may not hold on to the

13

property for an unreasonable period of time?

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.  But it  so, in this

15

case, one of the houses it took 33 months to sell, as

16

the Petitioner's counsel pointed out.  But that was a

17

house where at the sheriff's sale, there were a total of

18

zero bidders on the house, and so nobody wanted to buy

19

the house.  And so if you were going to value the house

20

at the point of foreclosure, maybe you would value it at

21

zero, which really wouldn't be good for anybody.  It

22

certainly wouldn't be good for the defendant.

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There wasn't  there

24

wasn't anything at all in the record to suggest that

25

there was undue  that that 33 months was an undue

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

delay.

2

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

3

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There certainly was not.
And there's a question

4

about this case that I would like you to answer before

5

you finish.  And this is a case of a young man, 19 years

6

old, he gets hooked into this scheme.  He gets $500 for

7

each parcel, $1,000; and then he's ordered to make

8

restitution of $219,000.  He was a bit player in the

9

scheme.  What happened to the people who dreamed up this

10

scheme, Lytle and Valadez?

11

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

They were ordered to pay a

12

much larger amount of restitution because they were

13

involved in the fraudulent acquisition of  of many,

14

many more houses than these two houses.

15

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So that  but did

16

they  were they ordered to pay restitution for these

17

two houses?

18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

They were.  And the

19

district court held Mr. Robers and his coconspirators

20

jointly and severally liable for the losses from these

21

two houses.  Now, the Section 3664(h) allows a district

22

court to apportion losses if it wants to.  It was 

23

Mr. Robers asked the court to do that; the court decided

24

not to do that; he hasn't appealed that part of the

25

decision to this Court, and so that's sort of dropped

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

out of the case.  But that is an option under the MVRA.
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I think I understand now

3

better than I did what his argument is.  I see now why

4

you want to go from A, because there are all kinds of

5

property that could be taken, not just money.

6

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And they say now A is out

8

of it because he wasn't able to return it, so we're in

9

B.  And I was saying well, B requires the same thing;

10

and you say that's right.  So what's the point?  Well,

11

you say but that's how it works for other property,

12

anyway.

13

 Now, when we get to B, we get that last

14

phrase, and they want to make like doubly sure that 

15

that if in fact some of the property had already been

16

gone back, it's going to count; and he's saying, well,

17

it did go back.  It was inkind, the baseball bat or the

18

house, and he's saying now, how do we value that?  And

19

you say, well, let's value it the same way as we would

20

value inkind property were there a list  is that

21

right  of 3664?  And  and you then go on to say, the

22

simplest thing to do is if they  they should sell it.

23

And then I say, okay, maybe they should, but they don't

24

want to.  And then what do we do?  And the answer is

25

call in experts like he wants.  Now, have I got that

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

right?

2

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

You've gotten that right.

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Thank you.

4

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

And I just want to add the

5

element that the reason that you do that is when the

6

house goes back to the victim, no part of the property

7

they lost has been returned to them.  And I think it's

8

important to recognize that in almost all of these

9

mortgage fraud cases, the bank forecloses on the

10
11
12

property long before sentencing.  In this case 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, I'm not sure you'd say

no part of the property they lost has been returned.

13

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

When they get 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What's been happening is

15
16
17

they've got some inkind return.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

They've gotten different

property.

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's true.

19

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

But under Section 3663, it

20

uses the phrase "the property" after it has declared

21

that the property is the property that was lost.  And so

22

when you get a house back and you've lost money, no part

23

of the property you've lost has been returned.

24
25

 And, again, if I can just say that in these
mortgage fraud cases, the banks have foreclosed and sold

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the houses generally long before sentencing; in this

2

case, even before the defendant was charged with any

3

crime.  And banks  so banks aren't thinking about

4

restitution when they're taking title to the houses and

5

selling them.  What they're thinking is, we want to turn

6

these houses into money, because that's what we lost,

7

and we want to maximize our return on the houses.

8
9

 And they're not thinking of restitution as
some sort of insurance against their needing to be

10

responsible in selling the houses, because as in this

11

case, most defendants don't have the resources to pay a

12

restitution award.

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And when they sell and they

14

get much more money than they otherwise thought from the

15

house, that extra amount also counts, then, in the

16

defendant's favor?

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Absolutely.  Under our

18

view, the defendant gets the benefit of that, and the

19

victim would not be overcompensated.  Under his view, he

20

wouldn't get any benefit of that and the victim would

21

get double recovery.

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, how does the defendant

23

get the benefit of that?  What would the defendants do

24

to go get the excess?

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, again, usually the

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

house has sold long before sentencing.  And so if the

2

value of the property has gone up between the time of

3

foreclosure and the time of the subsequent sale, then

4

the offset amount is, again, the amount that the bank

5

gets when they sell the house.  And so that's  that's

6

an amount larger than the value of the house at the

7

foreclosure and the defendant gets a larger offset.

8
9
10
11
12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You would agree

that 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Over the  the total amount

lost?
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

If it's over the total

13

amount lost, then the victim's loss is zero as a result

14

of the defendant's fraud, and so he doesn't have to pay

15

any restitution award.  Now, the victim would get to

16

keep the extra amount of the money in the same way that

17

happens in any foreclosure proceeding when there's no

18

fraud involved.  If a bank forecloses 

19

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

You would  you

20

would  you would agree that a different rule applies

21

if there is some unreasonable delay in disposing of the

22

property?

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.  And in our view,

24

that's a proximate cause question, because then the

25

victim's net losses wouldn't be caused by the

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

defendant's fraud.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

And what do you do

3

in the case of some dramatic development between the

4

return of the house as opposed to the  the property

5

and its  and its sale?

6
7
8
9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

It depends what sort of

dramatic development you mean.
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, you know,

something is discovered with respect to the property

10

that nobody knew about.  It's  suddenly, it's a

11

hazardous chemical zone and the property is  is

12

worthless.  While when it was returned  not returned;

13

I don't mean to prejudge the case.

14

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

15

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The bank got it.
When the bank got

16

it, it was worth $200,000, but all of a sudden it's, you

17

know, Love Canal or something, and it's worth nothing.

18

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, it's not our view 

19

you know, the house is only worth what someone is

20

willing to pay for it in an arm'slength transaction.

21

And so if there's something about the house that you

22

just didn't know when the bank got the house, then that

23

really wouldn't be the value of the house.  The value of

24

the house is what you can sell it for, and if there's

25

something that's 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, no.  But my

2

point is, is it the value you could sell it for before

3

this discovery of an extraordinary condition, or is it

4

the value afterward?

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I think in that case, it

6

would probably be whatever the money that the bank can

7

get for the house.  But if there's some other type of 

8

of event, like if  you know, if there's an earthquake

9

in the middle of the country that destroys the house,

10

then I think that would be  that would be sort of a

11

classic example of something that would break the chain

12

of proximate cause.

13

 And so what would happen in that case

14

usually is the bank would get paid by its insurance

15

company, compensated for the loss of the house, and you

16

would sort of value the house at the time that it was 

17

it was destroyed after the bank acquired it.  And then

18

the insurance company in that case wouldn't be entitled

19

to any restitution from the defendant, because it

20

wouldn't be the defendant's actions that caused the

21

destruction of the house.

22

 What he's saying is that just the fact that

23

the  that the housing market went down is an

24

intervening nonforeseeable event that breaks the chain

25

of causation.  Under our view, that's absolutely not

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

correct.  The very nature of the defendant's scheme

2

injected the health of the housing market into the

3

ultimate determination of the victim's net losses.  He

4

 his design was that he would take money from the

5

banks and promise to pay it back.  He had no intention

6

to pay it back, in fact never made a single payment.

7

That necessarily and foreseeably triggered the

8

foreclosure, which caused the banks to own the houses

9

and then caused them to put them on the market and sell.

10

 It's absolutely foreseeable that it takes

11

banks a certain amount of time to sell the houses,

12

absolutely foreseeable that the value of the houses will

13

fluctuate over time.  No one has to be able to predict

14

what the houses would have been worth on a particular

15

date in the future to be able to say that it was

16

foreseeable that the value would change.

17

 And the MVRA allocates any risk from a

18

change in property to a defendant, not to the victim.

19

And that's consistent with our view.

20

 If there are no further questions, I can

21

rest  I guess I would just like to end by reiterating

22

our main point, which is that the text of the statute is

23

very clear in this case, and what it focuses on is how

24

much of the property that was lost has been returned to

25

the victim before sentencing.

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 When the property that was lost was a car,

2

you don't get an offset for returning pineapples.  When

3

the property that was lost was money, you don't get an

4

offset for returning the house.  But in this case, as in

5

almost all mortgage fraud cases, the banks were able to

6

get back some of the property they lost when they sold

7

the houses, and so there's no valuation question here.

8

It's not a question of how much of the property that was

9

lost did the banks get back.

10

 The district court knew 100 percent for sure

11

because the houses were sold before Mr. Robers was even

12

charged with a crime.

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what if they

14

get  they get the house and as soon as they get it,

15

there are ten offers at $500,000 or more, and the amount

16

of the restitution is, you know, $300,000 or whatever.

17

But the bank says, you know, I think the market is going

18

to go even higher, so I'm not going to sell it right

19

away, I'm going to wait, not an unreasonable length of

20

time, but I'm going to wait.  And then the market

21

craters.  I mean, is the same rule then, that they only

22

get what they were able to sell it for?

23

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I mean, as long as what the

24

bank  what the bank did was commercially reasonable.

25

If the bank 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I know banks like to

2

get rid of property as soon as possible, but, you know,

3

they make decisions at some point, let's wait before we

4

sell this.  Is that commercially reasonable?

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I mean, it's hard to know.

6

You know, you wouldn't want to  we wouldn't want to

7

judge that with 100 percent perfect hindsight, right?

8

You'd want to say  if you were in the bank's shoes at

9

the time it made the decision, was that a commercially

10

reasonable decision, and you know, that's a decision

11

that would have to be made in those kind of cases.

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, why should the

13

defendant here subsidize the banks playing the market?

14

That's what you are saying.

15

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

No, what I'm saying is 

16

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

The bank is playing the

17

market.  It says, yeah, we could sell it for so much

18

now, but, yeah, it may go up.  And you're saying that,

19

you know, he's paying for the bank's roll of the dice.

20

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So if there really  if

21

there really is evidence that the bank is sort of really

22

rolling the dice, then that might be a harder question.

23

Generally, what the bank wants is to turn the house into

24

money because the bank is not in the business of owning

25

houses.  It's in the business of having money.

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And again, the banks don't have in their

2

mind that they're going to get a restitution payment

3

when they take the houses.  What they have in mind is

4

that they're going to take a loss.  If they've had to

5

foreclose on a house, it's a bad mortgage, generally

6

they are going to get back less for the house than what

7

they got for the mortgage, and if that happens they

8

consider it a loss, and I think any business person

9

would consider that a loss.

10

 And it's perfectly foreseeable that it's

11

going to take the bank a certain amount of time to turn

12

the house into cash.  But when that's happened before

13

sentencing, it's really an easy case to apply Section

14

3663A because you absolutely know for sure how much of

15

the lost property has been returned to the victim and

16

it's the amount of the money they got for the sale, or

17

for the property.

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But if I could just be clear

19

about what you're saying, you're saying it's not the

20

sale price when the sale is for a nominal amount; is

21

that right?

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.
And it's not the sale price

24

if the lender has done something commercially

25

unreasonable?

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

2

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

3

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

4

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes.
Is that right?
Yes.
And so if that's right and

5

both of those things sound right, but why doesn't that

6

kind of explode your statutory argument, because then

7

it's not any part of the property that's returned.

8
9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Because the other parts of

the statute require  have a proximate cause

10

requirement, and so you are only  the victim is only

11

entitled to get restitution for the amount of its losses

12

that are attributable to the defendant's criminal

13

conduct.  And so if part of the bank's losses, i.e., the

14

smaller amount of the return it gets for selling the

15

houses, is because of the bank's independent action,

16

then that part of the loss is not attributable to the

17

defendant.

18
19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I followed you up through

here, I think.  You're into B.

20

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

He is pointing to little

22

(ii) and you're saying that really is not relevant here

23

because it's cash.  None of the property was returned;

24

they gave him a house, not the cash.

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, we're saying it's

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

relevant when the bank sells the house because then part

2

of the property is returned.

3
4
5
6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, right.  What they

have is the house.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

They have the house until

they sell it and then they have cash.

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Oh, I see.

8

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

And so it's the cash they

9
10
11
12
13
14

get when they sell the house 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And that is if they've sold

it before the sentencing.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.  Which happens in

most every case.  Not every case, but 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Well, let's suppose it

15

doesn't and they still have it as of the time of

16

sentencing, then we're over into 3(a).  It's an  3664.

17

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's an inkind payment.

19

The judge has discretion as to how to value it.  He

20

could say, sell it within 90 days, and we will take

21

that.

22

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Right.

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Or he could say if you

24
25

don't want to do that, we call in the assessors.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

It wouldn't be considered

52

an offset under Section 3663A(b)(1)(B)(ii).
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

You're saying because

3

(3)(ii) applies, that when it's transformed into cash

4

prior to the sentencing, then they have received 

5

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Some part of the property.


6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 some part of the money


7

back 

8

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes.


9

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 and often that will work


10

in favor of the defendant.

11

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

It will because 


12

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Sometimes, as in this case,


13
14

it won't if the housing market collapses.
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Sometimes it goes down, but

15

other times it goes up.  And the trend over time is that

16

the housing market goes up, and so more often than not

17

in the larger picture, it will inure to the benefit of

18

the defendant.

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So where do you value

20

for the person who  the  the creditor, the secured

21

creditor who acts unreasonably?  Let's assume an

22

unreasonable act, and you said it might have been

23

commercially unreasonable to hold on to the property

24

after somebody offered them twice the amount of their

25

mortgage.

53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Well, I think in those

2

unusual circumstances, it would be as you suggested

3

earlier, which is that you would value it as of the date

4

it would have been reasonable to dispose of the property

5

in a fair market, arm'slength transaction.

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

7

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

8
9

So 
 and that's usually

not 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

 what do you think of

10

this test?  In calculating a creditor's loss resulting

11

from a secure transaction, the restitution order 

12

award should be offset by the amount that a reasonably

13

diligent creditor, under the same or similar

14

circumstances, could or would  or did  could, would

15

or did obtain for the collateral?

16

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I think generally that's

17

fine.  I think in the  really, in the mine run of

18

cases, the lion's share of cases, you are going to be

19

sort of overly complicating the district court's

20

inquiry, because in almost all of the cases, the houses

21

have been sold, and so you know you can look at the

22

dollar figure that the banks got, and that's the amount

23

you can use.  And it  and that fits into what you

24

described, but just sort of describes it in a more

25

complicated way, I think, in more 

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, it's not just more

2

complicated.  It's a question of, I guess, who has the

3

burden.  As I understood, what you are proposing is you

4

get the sale price, but it's  it's available to the

5

defendant to show that the sale price was unreasonably

6

low because of gamesmanship on the part of the bank or

7

some other reason, right?

8
9

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I think that would

be available to the defendant.

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes.

11

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

I think 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You would prefer that to

13
14

the other formulation, wouldn't you?
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

Yes, and I think there is a

15

presumption that banks are going to act in a

16

commercially reasonable way because they have no

17

expectation of getting any money back through the

18

restitution process.

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

If the sale  if at the

20

time of sentencing, the house has not yet been sold, but

21

there's no  there's good reason for the delay, because

22

for example, there are no bids at an earlier time, could

23

the judge defer the restitution order until the house is

24

sold?

25

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So as Justice Breyer

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suggested, under our view, the court  the district

2

court's first resort would be to say  to push off the

3

determination of the restitution amount for 90 days

4

under 3664(d)(5), and give the  give the bank a little

5

more time to sell the house, because in that case, a

6

determination  you wouldn't be able to ascertain the

7

net losses of the victim.

8

 If  if a bank still couldn't sell the

9

house, then I think under this Court's decision in

10

Dolan, what the court could do is say:  Yes, I'm going

11

to order restitution; the restitution will be for the

12

full amount of the mortgages, the money that was lost

13

minus whatever amount of money the banks get back when

14

they sell the houses.

15

 And if the bank has not been able to sell

16

the house at that point, it's really to everyone's

17

benefit to give them the chance to do it, because if no

18

one wants to buy the house and you force the district

19

court to value the house at that point, it's going to

20

give it a really low value and that doesn't help the

21

defendant, it doesn't really help the bank 

22
23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

What does the defendant

do if they act unreasonably after that order?

24

 MS. HARRINGTON: 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Then you 
If the bank does a

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

nominal sale and only gets $100?
 MS. HARRINGTON: 

So then I think the

3

district court would have retained jurisdiction to fill

4

in an amount related, blank, for the amount of money the

5

bank got back, and there could be proceedings about what

6

that amount should be.

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

8

 Mr. Green, you have 5 minutes remaining.

11

Thank you, Counsel.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY T. GREEN
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
 MR. GREEN: 

It's important, Justice

12

Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy, to understand that

13

defendants have no compulsory process in this

14

restitutionordering scheme.

15

 So that if there is a delay, Justice

16

Ginsburg, in the ultimate sale of the property or maybe

17

it's for a nominal amount or maybe it's for a discounted

18

amount, the defendant has no way to try and look behind

19

that transaction.  They can't issue a subpoena.  They

20

can't  they could call a witness, but it would only be

21

if it was a friendly witness.

22

 And here, Benjamin Robers sits with a

23

$219,000 restitution order for which he is jointly and

24

severally liable, as my colleague said 182 years it

25

takes to pay off, and there is no way for his attorney,

57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

us, to get behind the transactions at issue and

2

challenge them.

3

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why not?  Why not just say,

4

hey, I'll tell you what happened here.  They  we gave

5

him a house worth 100,000, and they sold it for a

6

dollar, and they only want to subtract a dollar, the

7

Government.  But I will tell you something.  I would

8

count that house as an inkind payment 

9
10

 MR. GREEN: 

It's 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

 an inkind payment, and

11

they were wrong to sell it.  And it was worth 100,000,

12

that was totally crooked, their selling it.  And

13

therefore, I want you to say, fine, perfectly right

14

subtract $1 under (ii)  (ii), but subtract 99,000 more

15

because of the inkind payment that was made.

16

 Would you say that?

17

 MR. GREEN: 

18

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

19

 MR. GREEN: 

No.  And a  and a 
Why?
Because, Your Honor, in an

20

obvious case like that, the defendant would have the

21

ability to  to point to the facts and circumstances

22

and say, you know, that  that, it doesn't appear, to

23

be an arm'slength transaction, Your Honor, and that

24

would be obvious evidence.

25

 But much more sophisticated things are going

58

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on here, Justice Breyer.  This is a situation where if

2

we take a look at the Inlet Shore Drive property, it

3

sells for $166,000, which appears to be quite a bit

4

lower than its value when the bank got ahold of that

5

property for nothing  for no reason that Mr. Robers

6

had control over.

7

 If that property had been burning down,

8

Justice Alito, he would not have been able to go in and

9

throw a bucket of water on it because that would have

10

been trespassing.  He had no dominion or control over

11

that property.

12

 So in a situation where 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but the only

14

reason he would have been trespassing is because, in

15

fact, he did not live in the house as he promised the

16

bank he would when the bank gave him the money.

17

 MR. GREEN: 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19
20

Right.
So why shouldn't he

bear the responsibility for that consequence?
 MR. GREEN: 

Because of the bank's dominion,

21

because of the situations we've been talking about here

22

where the bank holds on to the property unreasonably too

23

long, right into the teeth of a great recession 

24
25

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There was no  there was

no 

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. GREEN: 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

3
4

 that he's not 
 evidence of that in

this case, that the bank held on too long.
 MR. GREEN: 

Well, it was 33 months after

5

foreclosure.  The foreclosure on Inlet Shore Drive took

6

place on  in February 2006.  The sale 

7
8
9
10
11
12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The answer that

Ms. Harrington gave was that there were no bids.
 MR. GREEN: 

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I think she said there

were no bids.
 MR. GREEN: 

There were no bids at the  at

13

the foreclosure sale, but that frequently happens that

14

there's no bids at the foreclosure sale, Your Honor.

15

 We don't know  and this is another point

16

about the defendant's discovery.  We don't know what

17

happens after  after the  after the lender takes

18

control of the property.  We don't know whether it's

19

taking unreasonable risks or not unreasonable risks.

20

And, again, the defendant doesn't have the capacity.

21

 The other point 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Is there any reason why

23

the  why the sentencing judge, where there's an  an

24

allegation and maybe a  a suggestion that there was

25

unreasonable delay or something unreasonable was going

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on require the Government to provide some substantiation

2

for  for what happened?

3

 MR. GREEN: 

There  there could be, Your

4

Honor.  The  the judge  yeah, the defense could ask

5

the judge, Your Honor, please, could we get some

6

discovery here?  And it would be completely up to the

7

court whether the court would want to do that or not.

8
9

 But the point is that it's opaque to the
defendant.  And unless the defendant can come up with

10

something obvious, the defendant would have absolutely

11

no opportunity to produce evidence.

12

 The other point I want to make here is a

13

fundamental one.  And respectfully, I think we're 

14

we're  in talking about baseball bats and pineapples

15

and tomatoes, we're getting lost about what's actually

16

at issue here.

17

 This is a secured transaction. 

This is

18

something that the  that the victim lender agreed to

19

take back in the event of a default.  They took a

20

property interest.  That's a property interest.  This

21

Court said that in Pasquantino.  That's a property

22

interest that they took in that particular piece of

23

property.

24
25

 Benjamin Robers did not take $330,000 and
say, I'm going to go buy the best house I can with that.

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 The lender said, Benjamin Robers, here is


2


$330,000 in your name so that you can buy this


3


particular piece of property, subject to our interest.

4

 And so when the default took place, there


5


needed to be a  there needed to be a return of that

6

property interest, and it happened.
