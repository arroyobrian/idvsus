 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (11:06 a.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

next in Case 131333, Coleman v. Tollefson. 
 Mr. Shanmugam. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice, and may it please the Court: 
 Under the three strikes provision of the 

11

Prison Litigation Reform Act, a prisoner who has three 

12

prior dismissals on prior occasions must pay the full 

13

filing fee before bringing suit.  While the three 

14

strikes provision specifies what types of dismissal 

15

qualify as strikes, it does not expressly specify when a 

16

dismissal counts as a strike. 

17

 The better view is that a dismissal does not 

18

count until it becomes final on appeal.  That view is 

19

consistent both with the text of the three strikes 

20

provision and with the PLRA's underlying purposes. 

21
22
23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Does that include a 

petition for cert or is it only the first level appeal? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

The time for the filing of a 

24

petition for cert would count under our view, which is 

25

to say that a dismissal would not qualify as a strike

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

until that time is complete. 

2

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

So until there's a 

3

petition filed and it's denied or until the time expires 

4

to file the petition. 

5

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

That is correct.  And that 

6

is a quite familiar rule, Justice Ginsburg.  It is the 

7

rule that this Court has applied with regard to the 

8

running of limitations periods for habeas petitions, for 

9

example, in Clay v. United States. 

10

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Sure, it is.  But if  if 

11

that were the case, why  why would the statute have to 

12

refer separately to dismissals for frivolousness by the 

13

district court or by the court of appeals?  You could 

14

just  it could have just said, if he's had a petition 

15

dismissed for frivolousness period, and that would mean 

16

it would have to go all the way up. 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

19
20

Justice Scalia 
It separately says by the 

district court or by the court of appeals. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

It is certainly true that a 

21

qualifying dismissal by a court of appeals, like a 

22

qualifying dismissal by a district court, qualifies as a 

23

distinct strike.  And so, therefore, a prisoner could 

24

get two strikes in a single case.  But we would 

25

respectfully submit that that really tells us nothing

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about the separate question of when those dismissals 

2

count as strikes. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, I think on your 

theory, he wouldn't get two, he'd just get one. 

5

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No, that is 
The  the dismissal is 

7

simply not final until the court of appeals acts, and 

8

that's one dismissal. 

9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But there would still be two 

10

dismissals.  And let me explain how our interpretation 

11

works, because I think that this is an important 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

No.  I understand what 

13

you're saying, but it doesn't make any sense.  It 

14

doesn't make any sense for Congress to want a finality 

15

rule and yet to count it twice. 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I don't think that there is 

17

any inconsistency.  And let me explain why that is so. 

18

In our view, the critical phrase in the statute is the 

19

phrase "prior occasion."  And to be sure, an occasion is 

20

triggered at the point at which a dismissal is entered. 

21

But in our view, the occasion is not complete until the 

22

appellate process has run its course. 

23

 So in a case in which a district court 

24

enters a qualifying dismissal, that is to say, a 

25

dismissal on the ground that the action is frivolous or

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

malicious or fails to state a claim, the occasion is 

2

complete only when the appellate process runs its 

3

course.  And so, too, when the court of appeals, if it 

4

enters a qualifying dismissal on those similar grounds, 

5

a separate occasion is initiated by the dismissal and 

6

it, too, ends when further review is complete. Now what 

7

that means 

8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Why do you say that?  Where 

do you get that out of the word "occasion"?  I would 

10

I would think "occasion" means at any time prior, 

11

whether it's at the court  whether it's at the 

12

district court or the court of appeals.  You  you read 

13

it.  Why can "occasion" only mean what you suggest?  Or 

14

mean what you suggest, period? 

15

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

We don't believe that it 

16

could only mean what we suggest, which is to say that we 

17

don't think that the text precludes an interpretation 

18

under which the occasion is coterminous with the act of 

19

dismissal.  We simply don't think that is the only 

20

possible interpretation of the statutory language. 

21

 For one thing, we think that it is notable 

22

that the statute does not provide that a mere affirmance 

23

of a district court dismissal qualifies as a distinct 

24

strike. 

25

 So, in other words, in a case in which a 

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

district court dismisses on one of the specified grounds

2

and then the court of appeals simply affirms, I think 

3

everyone would agree that there is only one strike.  And 

4

in our  view 

5

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Shanmugam, would you 

6

explain that distinction from the court of appeals 

7

level?  So the district court dismisses for failure to 

8

state a claim.  It goes up to the court of appeals. 

9

When would the court of appeals simply affirm and when 

10
11

would it say "appeal dismissed"? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So, Justice Ginsburg, when a 

12

district court dismisses for failure to state a claim, I 

13

think that the ordinary course would be for a court of 

14

appeals to affirm.  While the statute refers to 

15

dismissals on the ground that the underlying action is 

16

frivolous or malicious or fails to state a claim, we 

17

think that the failure to state a claim ground really 

18

only properly applies on the district court level. 

19

 To come at it from another direction, the 

20

circumstances in which courts of appeals dismiss appeals 

21

rather than affirming are circumstances in which the 

22

appeal itself is frivolous or malicious.  So in a 

23

circumstance in which a court of appeals merely affirms, 

24

there is no discrete strike at the court of appeals 

25

level. 

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And in our view, to get back to Justice

2

Scalia's question, that fact, the fact that a mere 

3

affirmance does not count separately, in our view, 

4

strongly suggests that the dismissal and the ensuing 

5

appeal should be viewed as a single unit.  The only 

6

circumstance in which a court of appeals action counts 

7

as a distinct strike is when the appeal itself is 

8

frivolous or malicious 

9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Mr. Shanmugam, I find it as 

10

one of the appealing points in your argument that you 

11

have a dismissal for frivolousness at the District Court 

12

level.  It's counted as a third strike, and then that is 

13

reversed on appeal.  So that, you know, turns out it 

14

shouldn't have been the third strike.  And I don't know, 

15

what do you do in the last case?  In the next case he 

16

has only two strikes.  That is a messy situation.  How 

17

often does that situation arise?  How often is it that a 

18

District Court dismisses for frivolousness and is 

19

reversed by the Court of Appeals?  Do you have any idea? 

20

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So, more often than you 

21

might think, Justice Scalia, and it's for the simple 

22

reason 

23
24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I hope so, because I don't 

think it happens very often. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

It is certainly true that 

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there are not a lot of cases, as the Federal government

2

points out, in which a Court of Appeals outright 

3

reverses.  But I think it's important to emphasize, that 

4

a Court of Appeals can also modify a District Court 

5

dismissal.  And so if, for instance, a Court of Appeals 

6

concludes that a District Court erred by determining 

7

that the action was frivolous, or malicious, it is not 

8

uncommon for a Court of Appeals to say, That 

9

determination was incorrect, we're going to remand for a 

10

determination about whether or not there was a failure 

11

to state a claim.  We cite a number of those such cases 

12

in our reply brief. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

In a case such as 

14

that, is there anything preventing the Plaintiff from 

15

getting a stay of the District Court judgment?  The 

16

third strike, seeking a stay of the judgment, and if in 

17

fact it is because of a failure to state a claim, so has 

18

more merit than one of the frivolous ones, I suppose the 

19

Court of Appeals could grant a stay, and the problem 

20

we're addressing would totally go away. 

21

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

So, neither Respondents, nor 

22

the Federal government suggest that that is a 

23

permissible solution.  We have identified a couple of 

24

District Court cases where District Courts have entered 

25

stays.  I would respectfully submit that the concept of 

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a stay is a little bit counterintuitive in this context.

2

Because, I think what a District Court would essentially 

3

be doing is saying that it isstaying the grounds on which 

4

it disposes of the case. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yeah, but that's a 

6

problem that is always presented when you have to ask a 

7

District Court to stay its own judgment.  But you can 

8

also ask the Court of Appeals, right? 

9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Right, but you're not really 

10

staying the dismissal in that circumstance.  What you 

11

would really be doing is staying the consequences of the 

12

dismissal. 

13

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

No, you just stay the 

14

judgment.  Because the judgment  I mean, that's the 

15

typical reason you ask for a stay is because the 

16

judgment is going to have some very adverse consequences 

17

that should be suspended pending appeal. 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I'm a little 

19

confused here.  There's no judgment to be entered if the 

20

prisoner can't file because of the third strike.  There 

21

is no complaint to stay, and there's no judgment to 

22

stay. 

23

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I think, Justice Sotomayor, 

24

if I'm understanding the Chief Justice correctly, that 

25

what the Chief Justice is suggesting is that a District 

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court when it enters the potential third strike it

2

somehow enter a stay of the disposition and what I'm 

3

submitting is a little bit counterintuitive about that, 

4

is that what the District Court would essentially be 

5

doing is entering the dismissal because after all, the 

6

dismissal would need to take effect but at the same time 

7

saying that in essence the collateral consequences of that 

8

 dismissal are not immediately going to take effect. 

9
10
11

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

The remedy will be 

stayed in effect, of the third strike. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, but the only remedy is 

12

the disposition of the case and so, again, I think that 

13

that is why this idea really hasn't gotten 

14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Are you suggesting 

15

that the District Court cannot stay the disposition of 

16

the case?  Or that a Court of Appeals asked to review it 

17

or going to be asked to review it can't stay it? 

18

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, but the only 

19

consequence of the case here is the actual act of 

20

entering the dismissal.  So this is not a circumstance 

21

in which, for instance a court affirmatively provides 

22

relief, whether it's a monetary judgment or injunctive 

23

relief, and then says that that is not going to take 

24

effect until the appellate process is complete. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It says the dismissal will 

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not take effect.  Why can't it say the dismissal  you

2

know, we think you deserve to be dismissed but we're going 

3

to enter a stay so you can go up and see if we were right.

4

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Yeah, again, I don't think 

5

that there is a lot of precedent for this even in the 

6

jurisdictions that have adopted respondents or the 

7

Federal government's interpretation.  But let me just 

8

say one 

9

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I actually don't even 

10

 I hadn't considered this, because we 

11

appellate courts have no jurisdiction until there's a 

12

final judgment.  There's no 54(b)  there's no 54(b) 

13

standard that would be met and there's no anything 

14

standard that would be met. 

15

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

I mean, in essence what you 

16

have to do is to prevent the very judgment from becoming 

17

a judgment, because of course at the moment 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I'm sorry, isn't 

19

that what stays do?  They suspend the effectiveness of 

20

the judgment and by doing so you stay any collateral 

21

consequences of it? 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, what they tend 

23

to do, Mr. Chief Justice, I think, is to really stay the 

24

relief that is being provided until the appellate 

25

process runs its course. 

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The problem here is not

2

that case.  The problem here is the next case, if there 

3

is one. 

4

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, that is correct.  And to 

5

get back to Justice Scalia's question, because I just want 

6

to make sure that all of the consequences of the various 

7

interpretations are on the table.  I think that there 

8

are actually two sets of pernicious consequences here. 

9

The first is the one that you 

10

identified here, which I think is a problem both with 

11

respondent's and the Federal government's 

12

interpretation, which is what to do in a circumstance in 

13

which a prisoner is effectively barred as a result of an 

14

erroneous third strike, a third strike that is reversed or 

15

modified. 

16

 I think with respondent's 

17

interpretation, there is a much more fundamental 

18

anomaly, which is this anomaly of precluding appeals of 

19

dismissals that count as the third strike.  And so again we 

20

are not arguing today 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought in this case 

22

there was no such preclusion.  I thought that the Court of 

23

Appeals said, yeah, we'll take the appeal on the strike. 

24

So that's  that's  you can't urge that issue because 

25

you prevailed on it. 

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But that is a problem,

2

Justice Ginsburg, that I think inheres in the 

3

interpretative question that is before the Court.  It is 

4

certainly true that petitioner is not in that position. 

5

In other words, we're not here trying to get the right 

6

to appeal from the third strike dismissal.  But I do 

7

think that it is a problem that has to be dealt with in 

8

construing the statutory provision and it's a problem that 

9

has been recognized by every court. 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But it has to be dealt 

11

with under anybody's interpretation.  Once you admitted, 

12

which you must, that in one case there can be two 

13

strikes, then if there's a second case, a third case, or 

14

no, a second case, but a third strike at the District 

15

Court level, you still have to face the question of 

16

whether there's a right to appeal 

17

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

But, Justice Sotomayor, 

18

under our interpretation, all of these anomalies are 

19

dealt with for the simple reason that you wait until the 

20

end of the appellate process and even those courts, those 

21

two Courts of Appeals that have gone the other way on 

22

this issue have recognized this anomaly.  It's really 

23

only respondents who think that this anomaly is no big 

24

deal.

25

 Now, there have been various solutions 

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

devised to this problem.  The Sixth Circuit, the Seventh 

2

Circuit and Federal government have all come up with

3

different interpretations of the relevant statutory 

4

language in order to address the problem. 

5

 I want to specifically address the Federal 

6

government's proposed interpretation, because no one 

7

before this Court is defending the exact reasoning of 

8

either the Sixth Circuit or the Seventh Circuit.  The 

9

Federal government argues that the phrase "prior 

10

occasion" should be construed to mean a prior dismissal 

11

in a different case.  Now, that certainly addresses this 

12

anomaly, but we simply don't think that you can get that 

13

interpretation out of the phrase "prior occasion."  And 

14

so while there may be textual ambiguity here, 

15

and I would certainly acknowledge as I did to 

16

Justice Scalia that the text of the statute does not 

17

unambiguously preclude respondent's interpretation, we 

18

do believe that it unambiguously precludes the Federal 

19

government's interpretation. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Are you saying the 

21

government is being illogical or inconsistent, because 

22

if strike number 3 is a District Court ruling, the 

23

government says, well, there's no bar to your appealing 

24

that.  There's just a bar for filing a new District 

25

Court suit, and you would say that that's just illogical.

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, we think that that is 

2

something that Congress could logically have done.  We

3

simply don't think there is any footing in the statutory 

4

language for that distinction. 

5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

If prior occasion  means 

6

what it means, then there's only two strikes anyway 

7

because there was or two prior cases or two prior 

8
9

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Under our interpretation, 

that is certainly true and, of course, it bears 

10

emphasizing that this is the interpretation of the 

11

overwhelming majority of lower courts who have considered 

12

the issue. 

13

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

By the way, how many of 

14

those courts count the time or rely on the time for 

15

cert? 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

You know, I'm not sure that 

17

all of the Court of Appeals opinions have expressly 

18

dealt with that issue simply because the cases haven't 

19

quite been postured in that position.  We think that 

20

that rule makes sense because that is the ordinary rule 

21

that is applied for instance when this Court is 

22

construing statutes that expressly require finality on 

23

appeal, and that's the Clay versus United States case 

24

that I referenced earlier. 

25

 Of course that time is not likely to be all 

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that extensive particularly in cases in which the 

2

petitions plainly lack merit the time to resolution of 

3

petitions of that variety is typically relatively short.

4

But my point here is simply that under our 

5

interpretation, there really have been no identified 

6

problems with administrability and after all 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Why not?  I mean, what they 

8

argue is if we take your interpretation, it has to be final 

9

to become a strike, all that takes time, and if you have 

10

a really real frequent filer during that year, perhaps 

11

you will file 38 more cases or maybe a hundred and there 

12

will be no way to stop him really.  You'll have to pay 

13

for the  you know, I mean, you see the problem. 

14

 On the other hand, the evil that you're 

15

worried about, which is that there is a reversal of a 

16

strike on appeal, has happened precisely zero times. 

17

Ever.  So this sort of undermines the statute.  There's 

18

not a real need for it, your interpretation, and if 

19

there were by the way and it were reversed, he could 

20

proceed under Rule 60(b)5.  So that's basically their 

21

argument.  I would like to hear your answer. 

22

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Sure.  Well, Justice Breyer, 

23

let me start with the problem that we are addressing 

24

here.  And I would note that it's the twofold problem. 

25

Again, it's the problem of prisoners who are barred as a 

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

result of erroneous third strike dismissals, and there 

2

are such cases.  It's not a null set.  Even the Federal 

3

government acknowledges that there are at least two

4

reported cases in which that has occurred.  And again, 

5

we point out that there are cases in which there have 

6

been modifications, and those modifications would also 

7

be cases where someone under the interpretations on the 

8

other side would go from having three strikes to two 

9

strikes. 

10

 But let me address the perceived vices with 

11

our position as well.  I think really the only vice that 

12

has been identified is this supposed floodgates problem 

13

that's going to ensue under our interpretation where a 

14

prisoner, on the eve of a third strike, is suddenly 

15

going to come in with a flurry of lawsuits.  I would 

16

note at the outset, that that is a potential problem 

17

really with any interpretation. 

18

 In other words, once you set the rules for 

19

what constitute three strikes a prisoner  when the 

20

prisoner has two strikes, will have an incentive to come 

21

in with a number of different lawsuits.  So I don't think 

22

that that problem really disappears under any 

23

interpretation.  But again, that's not a problem that 

24

seems to have been borne out. 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Now, wait.  Wait, wait, 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wait, wait, wait.  I mean, what's distinctive about 

2

yours is you have to wait for the period of the appeal. 

3

You have to  and, you know, that could take a long

4

time.  And you talk about floodgates.  The reason this 

5

statute exists is because of floodgates, because these 

6

prisoners file one  one frivolous appeal after 

7

another. 

8
9
10

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Two points in response to 

that, Justice Scalia. 
 First of all, even under Respondent's 

11

interpretation, where a prisoner has two strikes, a 

12

prisoner could come in with a flurry of lawsuits, and it 

13

seems to be undisputed that you assess whether or not a 

14

prisoner has three strikes at the point at which the 

15

prisoner submits the complaint.  And so a prisoner could 

16

bring a flurry of lawsuits even under that 

17

interpretation. 

18

 But second, and more importantly, I think 

19

there's a reason why this problem hasn't borne out in 

20

practice, and that is simply by virtue of the other 

21

provisions of the PLRA.  Even a prisoner who is not 

22

subject to the three strikes provision still has to pay 

23

the filing fee, albeit in installments, and that filing 

24

fee, of course, is substantial.  It's now $400 in the 

25

district courts.  It's now $505 in the courts of 

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

appeals. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Shanmugam, why isn't 

3

this case just a casebook example of what the danger is?

4

Because this Petitioner, as I understand it, filed not 

5

only the petition that's before us, but three more.  In 

6

what span of time? 

7

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Over the span of about a 

8

year and a half.  But I would note that it took my 

9

client, who has been in prison in Michigan since 1983, 

10

25 years to get to three strikes even under Respondent's 

11

interpretation.  So I think that this effort to  to 

12

create the impression 

13
14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but he's making up 

for lost time. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, he did file four 

17

lawsuits.  And as a result, he does have to pay the 

18

filing fee in installments for each lawsuit, and that's 

19

20 percent of his income.  And in addition, district 

20

courts are not somehow left without tools in the event 

21

that those subsequent lawsuits are meritless. 

22

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but I don't  I 

23

don't think that your earlier point that when he has two 

24

strikes he can file a flurry of suits is relevant. 

25

That's  that's the grace period that the government 

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has given him.  The government has granted that with 

2

only two strikes, you can proceed.  But now we have 

3

three, and that's quite different.

4

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, and of course, that is 

5

the question.  And the question really is whether 

6

Congress, in imposing this sanction, which is a 

7

considerable one in which of course applies to 

8

meritorious and meritless claims alike, whether Congress 

9

would have wanted to attach that consequence before 

10

ensuring that a prisoner, in fact, had three valid 

11

dismissals for pursuing meritless claims. 

12

 And, of course, we have a statute here that 

13

does not specifically address that issue, and there are 

14

plenty of statutes that address that issue in both 

15

directions.  And we also have no legislative history for 

16

those members of the Court who are interested in 

17

legislative history that speaks to this issue. 

18

 And so the real question we would submit is 

19

that if the Court agrees with us that the language of 

20

the statute is at least ambiguous, which interpretation 

21

avoids anomalous consequences and leads to a rule that 

22

is easy for lower courts to administer? 

23

 The great virtue of our interpretation is 

24

that once a prisoner has three strikes, the prisoner 

25

always has three strikes.  You don't have this specter 

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the possibility that a prisoner could go from having 

2

three strikes one day to having two strikes or fewer the 

3

next.

4

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Do you know if any of 

5

those courts, the majority of the courts except for two, 

6

have opted  for addressing things your way?  And  and 

7

I have a slight leaning towards letting the majority of 

8

circuit courts figure out administrative  the ease of 

9

administrative rules.  How many of them thought of it as 

10

just being easier to do? 

11

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, I think that when you 

12

look at the court of appeals' opinions that have gone 

13

our way, a number of them have recognized that the text 

14

is ambiguous.  So they have not just been, as Respondents 

15

and the Federal government suggest, somehow disregarding 

16

the language of the statute. 

17

 The Fourth Circuit in the Henslee case 

18

specifically relied on the phrase "prior occasion" and 

19

said that, "The phrase prior occasion may refer to a 

20

single moment or to a continuing event to an appeal 

21

independent of the underlying action, or to the 

22

continuing claim, inclusive both of the action and of 

23

its appeal."  And that's, of course, precisely the 

24

argument we're making today. 

25

 But with regard to administrability, I just 

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

want to be clear about how this works, because this is 

2

obviously a very important practical issue for district 

3

courts.

4

 Under our interpretation, all that a 

5

district court, or for that matter a court of appeals, 

6

need do is to look to see whether in a prior case there 

7

has been a determination that a prisoner has three 

8

strikes.  If, in fact, that is so, that is the end of 

9

the analysis.  And indeed, our understanding is that in 

10

many jurisdictions, the district court clerk's offices 

11

actually keep lists of people who have been subject to 

12

the three strikes prohibition. 

13

 There's a decision from the Western District 

14

of Louisiana that refers to the keeper of the three 

15

strikes list, and our understanding is that that is 

16

actually a fairly common practice.  And, of course, 

17

where a prisoner has not previously been subject to the 

18

three strikes provision, it will be relatively easy, and 

19

it's a familiar task for a district court to make the 

20

determination whether a prisoner's prior dismissals are 

21

final on appeal. 

22

 Under Respondent's and the Federal 

23

government's interpretations by contrast, there is no 

24

such ease of application because a court will not be 

25

able to be sure that a prisoner, in fact, has three 

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

strikes even if the prisoner has previously been barred. 

2

And under either of the interpretations on the other 

3

side, you will have to figure out what to do in a

4

situation in which a third strike dismissal has been 

5

reversed or even modified. 

6

 Now, the Federal government 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Again  again, that's a 

8

big problem depending upon how frequent that is.  If 

9

it's once in a blue moon, you know, it's no big deal. 

10

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, everyone before this 

11

Court agrees that we're not exactly dealing with a large 

12

set of cases to begin with.  And the question presented 

13

in this case is not going to affect a large number of 

14

cases in the aggregate.  Though I would note that the 

15

issue has arisen in virtually every single one of the 

16

courts of appeals. 

17

 My point is simply that you're dealing with 

18

a somewhat larger number of cases than the Federal 

19

government would suggest.  When the Federal government 

20

says look, we've only been able to identify two cases 

21

where there have been outright reversals.  And to the 

22

extent that the Federal government in its brief points 

23

to the reversal rate in civil actions by prisoners, the 

24

Federal government accurately represents that that rate 

25

is about 4 percent.  I think it's important to emphasize 

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the fact that the overall reversal rate in the Federal 

2

courts of appeals is only 7 percent.  And so it isn't as 

3

if the prisoner rate is, you know, somehow orders of

4

magnitude lower.  And of course 

5

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I would think that the 

6

 I would think the situation that we should be concerned 

7

about is the situation in which the dismissal, which is 

8

initially counted as the third strike, ultimately 

9

results in some relief for the prisoner.  And I don't 

10
11

know that there's even one of those. 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Well, but, of course, under 

12

the statute, the dismissal no longer qualifies even if 

13

the prisoner doesn't obtain relief.  And I think 

14

everyone agrees that if there is either a reversal or 

15

vacatur of the dismissal or a modification to eliminate 

16

the grounds specified in the statute, that the dismissal 

17

no longer has any effect.  And those cases, I would 

18

respectfully submit, are somewhat more common than my 

19

friends on the other side would have you believe. 

20
21

 And I would like to reserve the balance of 
my time for rebuttal. 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

23

 Mr. Lindstrom. 

24
25

Thank you, Counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. AARON D. LINDSTROM 
 ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS 

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

2

it please the Court: 

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may 

 The plain language of Section 1915(g)

4

identifies when a strike occurs.  It occurs when an 

5

action or appeal was dismissed.  The phrase "action was 

6

dismissed" has an everyday meaning and the ordinary 

7

meaning of "action was dismissed" does not.  Action was 

8

dismissed and affirmed. 

9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Lindstrom, I  I 

10

understand that argument, and it seems to me a very 

11

natural reading of the statute.  But the  I'm troubled 

12

by the scenario where it's dismissed and then it's 

13

reversed, not for these practical reasons that people 

14

have been talking about.  But it seems to me that if you 

15

were really reading the statute that way, that that 

16

would count as a strike, too, and that that strike would 

17

not go away even when it was reversed. 

18

 And so I'm wondering whether the statute is 

19

actually a little bit more ambiguous than  than you 

20

are suggesting, because at the very least, I mean, 

21

everybody agrees that you have to make an exception for 

22

that case, and it seems to me that on your reading of 

23

the statute, that case would be included.  A strike 

24

would be a strike even if it's reversed. 

25

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

No, Justice Kagan, we think 

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the ordinary rules that apply to judgments apply.  When 

2

Congress passed this statute, they weren't trying to 

3

change the ordinary rules of how judgments are applied.

4

The ordinary rules in district court judgments matter 

5

until they're reversed.  That's the ordinary rule in the 

6

res judicata context and in every other context. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, but that's something 

8

you're now appealing to some default principle that 

9

exists outside of the statutory text.  I can't find any 

10
11

basis in the statutory text for that result. 
 I mean, it's  there have been three or 

12

more prior occasions in which either an action or an 

13

appeal has been dismissed.  Now, one of those dismissals 

14

was later reversed, but it was dismissed.  And so on 

15

your reading, we  we really, you know, it's  it's 

16

your reading is kind of  this is the natural reading, 

17

but we're not going to  we're not going to apply the 

18

natural reading in a case where it obviously doesn't 

19

fit. 

20

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

I think we're assuming that 

21

Congress is drafting against the ordinary background 

22

rules, and there's an ordinary meaning of what's 

23

dismissed, and that's what my colleague is changing 

24

is challenging. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

The problem with the 

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ordinary rule is that it really doesn't apply completely 

2

until the next case.  It applies in that case, but it 

3

doesn't apply in the next case.

4
5
6

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

If you mean it doesn't 

apply, I guess I'm not sure what you're saying. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Meaning let's talk about 

7

res judicata or collateral estoppel.  If it's res 

8

judicata, it's the two parties.  So that  that's that 

9

case, essentially. 

10

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

11

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
If it's collateral 

12

estoppel, it could be until a third party.  But I think 

13

that that third party would be entitled to a stay of his 

14

or her action pending the adjudication of the main 

15

action. 

16

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

But we do know that Congress 

17

did want to cut off IFP status in the same case in at 

18

least some instances.  If you look at 

19

Section 1915(a)(3), that specifically says that an 

20

appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis status if the 

21

trial court certifies in writing that it was not taken 

22

in good faith.  That's not  that's setting aside the 

23

three strikes rule entirely.  That could happen in any 

24

given case.  And that shows that Congress specifically 

25

wanted to cut off IFP status on appeal in at least some 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

cases. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Except that the 

3

there's still a right to ask the court of appeals for a

4

COA, and so there is an appellate process of sorts. 

5

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

There  there would be, and 

6

that's correct.  But in terms of what the background 

7

rules are, I think the ordinary rule of the background 

8

interpretation would be you start with the plain 

9

language.  Congress expects you to look at the word "was 

10
11

dismissed," figure out what that means. 
 They would also expect you to apply the 

12

ordinary rules that apply to judgments, and the ordinary 

13

rule is that district court judgments matter.  They have 

14

a legal effect immediately.  You can see this from 

15

trivial matters, like when interest starts to accrue, 

16

and also through very significant matters, such as a 

17

criminal conviction.  If somebody is a convicted of a 

18

criminal  of a crime in Federal court, they get to go 

19

to jail, even though they're pending in 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Right.  Answer  answer 

21

Judge  Judge Easterbrook's point, that there is no way 

22

to revive a subsequently filed case that was dismissed 

23

because of a third strike.  Judge Easterbrook, and I 

24

think there's some force to his logic, says with this 

25

this threestrike situation, when the next case comes to 

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the court of  to a district court, district court 

2

never files the complaint.  There was nothing dismissed 

3

that can be revived.  There was no judgment entered.

4

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

That wouldn't have barred any 

5

of the four lawsuits that Mr. Coleman could have brought 

6

in this case, because he could have brought all four of 

7

his lawsuits in State court.  He could have filed each 

8

one of these in State court.  So there is recourse, 

9

interpreting the statute according to the plain 

10
11

language. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

But  but there's no 

12

remedy for the fact that subsequent lawsuits that 

13

were  that were filed based on the erroneous third 

14

strike would have been turned back without the filing of 

15

a complaint. 

16

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

In other words, it was never 

17

filed, so there was nothing to relate back, at which 

18

point 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

And nothing  or to 

file a 60(b). 
 MR. LINDSTROM: 

But, again, it  there's an 

22

easy way for a prisoner to get around that, and the 

23

prisoner could have done that by  once he's got three 

24

strikes and the last one is on appeal, he has to make 

25

the decision:  Should I file my next four cases that I'm 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to file  should I file them in Federal court, or 

2

should I file them in State court?  And this statute is 

3

saying you shouldn't file them in Federal court.

4

 I think  I'm not sure if I fully answered 

5

your point about reversal, but I think that's the 

6

ordinary background rule.  Again, even though a prisoner 

7

would be convicted, they still go to jail even though 

8

there's the possibility that a reversal might happen.  And 

9

the ordinary rule is that a reversal is something that 

10
11

is if it had never occurred. 
 You can see that in the  as some examples 

12

cited in the Federal government's brief about 

13

sentencing, if you have a conviction that is then 

14

reversed, it can no longer be used to enhance a later 

15

conviction.  There's double jeopardy context, where if a 

16

conviction is reversed, then it's as if it never 

17

happened, which is why in Ball v. United States, this 

18

Court said you can retry the person. 

19

 So the plain language, both in the "was 

20

dismissed" language and the action or appeal, they 

21

show that Congress is talking about the filing fees, 

22

that the context of this statute, I think, is really 

23

helpful.  It's about filing fees. 

24

 When you enter the district court, you have 

25

to pay a filing fee to file a complaint.  And then on 

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

appeal, you have to pay a filing fee so you can file 


2


your notice of appeal. 


3


 So what Congress is doing is saying, these

4

are the two events we're talking about, and if you have 

5

brought an action that was dismissed or brought an 

6

appeal that was dismissed, that lines up with these two 

7

stages of litigation.  It was trying to separate them 

8

out and treat them differently because Congress was 

9

trying to deter not just frivolous actions, but also 

10

frivolous appeals.  It includes language, "action or 

11

appeal," in the statute. 

12
13
14
15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What does it cost to file 

an appeal? 
MR. LINDSTROM: 

In the Federal courts, it 

costs $505. 

16

JUSTICE BREYER: 

17

MR. LINDSTROM: 

Sorry? 

$505, Your Honor.  In State 


18

courts it's less.  So you'd have are that option, and 

19

you also have the IFP status option in State courts as 

20

well. 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sort of an interesting 

22

question, basically admitting that in terms of your 

23

time, the suits would still remain because they could 

24

file in State court? 

25

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

Yes, I think they could file 

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in State court.  That's what the plain language of the 

2

statute, it doesn't say anything about  to preclude 

3

State court.  And there's other outlets as well that

4

would 

5
6
7

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Do states have similar 

rules? 
 MR. LINDSTROM: 

States do have similar 

8

rules.  And Mr. Coleman has not run afoul, as far as 

9

we can tell and as far as he has reported in the 

10

complaints that he filed, which are all in the joint 

11

appendix.  He hasn't filed anything in State court.  So 

12

this would not have precluded him from filing all four 

13

of his lawsuits in this verycase. 

14

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

You know, I guess what 

15

I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question, 

16

Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell 

17

me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to 

18

these background principles and we decide that a strike 

19

doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a 

20

strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal. 

21

But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your 

22

best argument?  I mean, aren't you then admitting that 

23

the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on 

24

appeal and encompasses finality on appeal? 

25

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

We don't think it does.  I 

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think Congress is looking at the filing fee stages.  It 

2

was looking at the fact that you're going to file a fee 

3

at the district court level and at the appellate court

4

level.  So the statute clearly draws a distinction 

5

between the two and wants them to be treated separately 

6

so that if you get the IFP status in the district court, 

7

that's one thing. 

8
9

 Getting IFP status in the Federal court is 
another thing because what's going on here is Congress 

10

is granting a subsidy to prisoners to allow them to 

11

pursue further litigation, and Congress simply drew a 

12

line in the statute saying, We'll subsidize a certain 

13

number of these  of IFP appeals and actions before we 

14

cut it off. 

15

 There's other statutes that also show that 

16

if Congress wants to delay the legal effect of a 

17

district court judgment, it knows how to do it. 

18

Section 2244 which we cite in brief good example of 

19

this.  It was passed by the same Congress that was 

20

considering the Prison Litigation Reform Act.  It was 

21

considering it at about the same time throughout the 

22

19951996 time period.  Congress was voting on both 

23

parts.  And in Section 2244, it said something doesn't 

24

count, doesn't have a legal effect with respect to a 

25

statute of limitations until it's final by the 

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the 

2

time preceding such review. 

3

 So the exact same Congress threw out the

4

words that was dismissed, knew how to write a different 

5

rule and didn't do it here.  And that's very telling, 

6

especially given how they were enacted within two days 

7

of each other. 

8
9

 So this Court itself has stopped in forma 
pauperis status appeals, so some of the concerns that 

10

are being raised are the fact that district court 

11

decisions could be ossified errors.  They could be 

12

depriving people of meritorious claims.  But that 

13

concern would be worse with respect to petitions that 

14

are filed in this Court because if this Court cuts 

15

somebody off and says you can't 

16

 file any more petitions, as it does under 

17

the Martin case.  Then after that, there's a much 

18

greater case of ossification because those decisions may 

19

be precedential. 

20

 So I think that our reading is consistent 

21

with what Congress is trying to do, which is to look at 

22

the great bulk of the cases and say 95, 96, some high 

23

percentage of cases, those are going to be cases where 

24

the original strike was affirmed, and so it's a very 

25

remote possibility.  If the language were completely 

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ambiguous, then you would still have to figure out which 

2

one is closest to Congress' intent, and Congress' intent 

3

would be to address the 95plus percentage of cases, rather

4

than the case where my colleague admits there are not a 

5

lot of them and hasn't really cited very many of them. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

This is a question I 

7

probably should have asked petitioner, but what do you 

8

understand his  what do you understand him to mean 

9

when he says it has to be final on appeal? 

10

 Suppose that there is an appeal pending in 

11

one of the prior strike cases, but it's perfectly clear 

12

that the notice of appeal in that instance was filed 

13

woefully out of time.  Would that be final on appeal? 

14

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

I think it would  I assume 

15

his answer would be to look at, once the notice of  I 

16

think he would say the end of the expiration of time is 

17

when the court would look at it.  So if it was filed 

18

late, the expectation would be if it's filed out of 

19

time, because you're looking at the time period for 

20

review, that time period has passed and it's final, I 

21

guess subject to reopening if there's a way to get 

22

around that.  It would be jurisdictional.  So I don't 

23

know how you would get around it. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Under your position, I 

suppose we don't have to ask about certiorari, pending 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether or not that 

2

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

4
5
6
7

Yes, Your Honor. 
You can say that that's

the petitioner's problem, not yours. 
 MR. LINDSTROM: 

I think that's right.  I 

don't think I need to address that. 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What do you think about the 

8

government's argument about the third?  You imagine he 

9

has  the prisoner has filed one, dismissed as 

10

frivolous; appeal, the dismissal affirmed.  That's one. 

11

Now he does it again.  That's two.  And he does it a 

12

third time.  District court dismissed.  And he says, I 

13

want to appeal that, and I don't want to pay the $500, 

14

505.  And the government has to say  could say, sorry, 

15

you have to pay the 505.  That's the third, because he's 

16

a separate.  Then he says, but it says, "on a prior 

17

occasion," and this is the same occasion.  And therefore 

18

he doesn't have to pay the 500.  What's your view of 

19

that? 

20

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

I think that that reading 

21

takes the word "prior" and changes it from meaning 

22

"before" to meaning "before or after in a separately 

23

filed suit."  So I think it's going too far with what 

24

the word "prior" could possibly mean. 

25

 That "occasions"  I mean, the whole point 

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the statute is to identify what occasions are going 

2

to give rise to a strike.  And those occasions are when 

3

an action was dismissed, which is a district court

4

event, or when the appeal was dismissed. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

It seems to 

6

me the government does give away too much in that 

7

position.  The only question is whether that undercuts 

8

this whole argument.  It gives a little bonus for the 

9

appeal of the  if strike number three is the district 

10

court, the government doesn't count the appeal, as I 

11

understand it.  It counts  obviously it counts in a 

12

later district court suit, but not here. 

13

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And I 

14

should be quick to point out that they agree with our 

15

interpretation of the facts of this case, where he had 

16

three strikes and then he filed  it's about the 

17

subsequent actions. 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why use the word 

19

"occasion" at all?  Meaning:  What meaning do you give 

20

to that word?  Why didn't they just say "three 

21

dismissals"? 

22

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

I think the statute  I 

23

think "occasions" is just kind of a way of framing the 

24

long clause that follows after it. 

25

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It seems to me you could 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have just said, if a prisoner has three dismissals, 

2

then  three prior dismissals; not three prior 

3

occasions, three prior dismissals  he can't get IFP

4

thereafter. 

5

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

I don't think that would 

6

change the outcome in this case, because that language 

7

still would remain.  His action was dismissed  or 

8

appeal.  It was dismissed.  So the language that draws a 

9

distinction between the court of  the district court 

10

level and the appellate court level would still be 

11

there.  I mean, "occasions" is just identifying those 

12

two, what those two occasions are. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

What about the fact that 

14

this provision refers to a prior occasion on which an 

15

action was dismissed?  If you put "prior" and "action" 

16

together, isn't there the suggestion that you're talking 

17

about an action that is different from the action that 

18

is before the court of appeals in what is arguably the 

19

third strike? 

20

 MR. LINDSTROM: 

That word would also carry 

21

through to prior appeal, apparently.  I think the "prior 

22

occasions" is simply talking about the fact that it is 

23

an action that happened before.  I don't think that that 

24

word would have to modify both.  It doesn't make sense 

25

that it would modify "prior appeal" as well in a way that 

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is distinguished from the appeal in this case.  In both 

2

events you'd be talking about anything that goes before 

3

it.

4

 If there are no further questions, I will 

5

yield the time to my colleague from the federal 

6

government.

Thank you, counsel. 

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLON KEDEM 
 ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS 
 MR. KEDEM: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 If I could start with the issue of finality 

15

and the normal background principles, the argument that 

16

petitioner makes, and this is echoed by the argument 

17

that he makes in pages 9 to 10 of his reply brief, is 

18

that sometimes Congress specifies that finality is 

19

required and sometimes it specifies that finality is not 

20

required, and so we can draw no negative inference from 

21

the fact that Congress was silent here. 

22

 But if you look at the example of the 

23

statute in which Congress specified nonfinality that he 

24

gives, it's actually not a statute at all.  It's a 

25

Federal rule of evidence.  Moreover, petitioner 

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

identifies no instance in which Congress has a statute 

2

in which it is silent about whether or not you require 

3

finality, like subsection G, and yet finality was 

4

implicitly read to be required; in other words, no

5

instance in which a finality requirement was inferred 

6

rather than expressed.  And even if you think that 

7

sometimes finality might be able to be inferred, 

8

Section 1915 is an especially bad candidate, because it 

9

distinguishes so repeatedly and so sharply between the 

10
11

trial and appellate stages. 
 And that brings me to petitioner's single 

12

occasion theory, articulated most clearly in pages 18 to 

13

19 of his opening brief.  It's the idea that a trial 

14

court dismissal plus the appeal from that dismissal 

15

constitute a single ongoing occasion.  And if Congress 

16

had that in mind, presumably it would have used some 

17

sort of processoriented language. 

18

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

19

of appeals held here? 

20

 MR. KEDEM: 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

22
23

Isn't that what the court 

Pardon? 
The court of appeals said 

you do get the appeal from the third strike. 
 MR. KEDEM: 

Yes, the court of appeals said, 

24

we believe incorrectly, that the appeal from the third 

25

strike is the same occasion. 

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But is that before us? 

2

You  I thought that this appeal is about the fourth 

3

case, and that you haven't  you haven't contested the 

4

court of appeals' holding that you do get an appeal from

5

the third strike. 

6

 MR. KEDEM: 

We don't believe that's directly 

7

at issue and we can talk about it if the Justices are 

8

interested in that.  But the question as to how to read 

9

"occasion" and whether it encompasses just the trial or 

10

the appellate stage, or both of them at the same time, 

11

is very much at issue in this case.  And we believe that 

12

you could end up with overlapping occasions, not only 

13

the trial court dismissal, but on appeal, also a 

14

separate appellate dismissal, which, as Petitioner 

15

concedes, is an occasion in its own right. 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But that's  that's the 

17

why I asked the question on page 25 of your brief; you 

18

say the bar goes into effect if the prisoners received 

19

strikes on three or more prior occasions. 

20

 Now you say a prior occasion is not the 

21

district court dismissal in this third case.  That's not 

22

a prior occasion.  But when you look at the earlier two 

23

strikes, you don't consider it as a whole.  So we 

24

consider this one as a whole, but we don't consider the 

25

others as a whole.  That's why I asked the question. 

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KEDEM: 

The question, Justice Breyer, is 

2

whether the prior occasions that might prevent you from 

3

appealing a civil action includes that very action, the 

4

one you're trying to appeal.

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

No, it doesn't  yes, it 

6

does.  Because the dismissal of  by the district court 

7

of this lawsuit after it's done is a prior occasion. 

8

The present occasion is your appeal of that dismissal to 

9

the court of appeals. 

10

 MR. KEDEM: 

Justice Breyer, it's important 

11

to consider the posture you're in when you're making 

12

that choice. 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm not saying it's good 

14

policy or anything.  I'm just saying it's hard for me to 

15

see how you can say the one and not the other. 

16

 MR. KEDEM: 

Because at the time that you're 

17

making the decision, a new occasion hasn't started.  You 

18

have to decide whether the prisoner is allowed to file 

19

the IFP appeal. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Good.  And when we're in 

21

the second one, when you file the appeal from the first 

22

one, the new occasion hadn't started.  So we're still in 

23

the middle of the occasion. 

24
25

 MR. KEDEM: 

No.  Justice Breyer, the prior 

occasion has concluded.  It concluded with the issuance 

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the judgment of dismissal.  Let me provide an analogy 

2

that, hopefully, can articulate our position. 

3

 Imagine that a school had a policy that said 

4

in no event shall a student retake a test if on three or

5

more prior occasions that student had taken and failed a 

6

test.  Now, I suppose you could read that policy to say 

7

that the very test you want to retake is a prior 

8

occasion that might prevent you from retaking it. 

9
10

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I'm going to fail this test 

because 

11

 (Laughter.) 

12

 MR. KEDEM: 

We don't think that's the 

13

natural reading.  And moreover, in order to give 

14

independent content to the word "prior," it can't simply 

15

mean before the very decision when you're making the IFP 

16

determination.  Because, of course, you're only taking a 

17

count of strikes that are prior in that sense.  You're 

18

not going to take a count of strikes that haven't yet 

19

happened. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Was it your brief that 

21

said there were very few cases  you found only two 

22

published cases? 

23

 MR. KEDEM: 

24
25

Only two cases, and that 

includes cases that are not published. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

That's what my question 

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

was, okay. 
 MR. KEDEM: 

And, of course, it's important 

3

to emphasize, we're not just talking about the problem 

4

of a third strike reversal.  In order for Petitioner's

5

concerns to come about, you need a  a prisoner who 

6

wants to file a fourth suit, one that doesn't qualify 

7

for the imminent danger exception and there has to be 

8

some risk of the statute of limitations running in that 

9

fourth suit while the third one is on appeal. 

10

 Presumably, that's going to be 

11

extraordinarily rare, if it ever happens.  And even if 

12

it does, we believe in that instance, Rule 60(b)(5) 

13

would allow you appropriate relief. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Then answer Judge 

15

Easterbook's point, which is, when the fourth case comes 

16

in, the court is just not granting IFP.  It's not 

17

dismissing the case, it's just not filing it at all. 

18

It's just saying to you, I won't commence the 

19

litigation, I won't accept it without you paying IFP. 

20

 MR. KEDEM: 

Well, what usually happens is 

21

what happened in this very case; namely, that the court 

22

says, I'm not granting you IFP status and I'm going to 

23

dismiss your case if you don't pay the filing fee.  And 

24

so you could file Rule 60(b)(5) motion to have that 

25

reopened.  Because Rule 60(b)(5) applies whenever a 

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

litigant seeks to reopen a case that was dismissed on 

2

the  or where the case was based on a prior judgment 

3

that was reversed or vacated, which would seem to apply 

4

here.

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do you  do you 

6

have to file  pay a filing fee to go with a 60(b) 

7

motion?  Is that a separate proceeding? 

8
9

 MR. KEDEM: 

My understanding is that there's 

a circuit split as to whether if you're denied IFP 

10

status, you nevertheless are still on the hook for the 

11

filing fee. 

12
13
14

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that would 

really make your position complicated. 
 MR. KEDEM: 

Your Honor, I think if you are a 

15

prisoner who's three strikes barred and you still want 

16

to file a fourth suit, there might be some consequence; 

17

namely, that you might be on the hook if that third 

18

strike is ultimately affirmed, as most third strikes 

19

are. 

20

 I'd like to address also the point that 

21

Petitioner makes that his position is much more easily 

22

administered.  Because I actually think the inquiry is 

23

basically the same on either approach.  It's true that 

24

if you only know that the prisoner is three strikes 

25

barred, then you can rely on that under Petitioner's 

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

approach. 
 But that's not normally what happens. 

What 

3

normally happens is what happened in this very case. 

4

Namely, the trial court lists the prior dismissals, plus

5

what it knows about what happened to those dismissals on 

6

appeal, and it makes an IFP determination. 

7

 And under either approach, the inquiry is as 

8

follows:  For any appellate dismissal or a trial court 

9

dismissal that was affirmed on appeal, you can always 

10

rely on that going forward.  And for any trial court 

11

dismissal where you don't know what happened on appeal, 

12

you simply have to check the appellate docket, something 

13

that, as Petitioner points out, courts are already very 

14

familiar with.  So under either approach, essentially 

15

the inquiry is entirely the same. 

16

 And finally, Your Honor, if you are simply 

17

not convinced by the textual arguments and you just want 

18

to know what makes practical sense, you should go with 

19

the approach that works in the vast majority of cases. 

20

And in the vast majority of cases, what happens is what 

21

happened in this very case.  You have a third strike 

22

that was ultimately affirmed on appeal. 

23

 Under Petitioner's approach, notwithstanding 

24

that affirmance, even though the Sixth Circuit said that 

25

strike was properly administered, he would nevertheless 

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be permitted to proceed IFP in those four additional 

2

suits that he filed.  Under our approach, he would not, 

3

because the third  he would not because he was three 

4

strikes barred.  But if the third strike had been

5

reversed rather than affirmed, he could have gone back 

6

to the trial court and asked for relief under Rule 

7

60(b)(5). 

8
9

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And just to be clear, 

Mr. Kedem, if we say, you know, we're not buying this 

10

prior occasion thing, does your  does the rest of your 

11

position stay your position? 

12

 MR. KEDEM: 

It does.  I think you would end 

13

up with Respondent's position.  But one additional point 

14

on prior occasions.  Although Petitioner disagrees with 

15

our reading of the phrase "prior occasions," he does 

16

agree with us that if Congress meant "prior occasions" 

17

to include an appeal  to applying the situation from 

18

an appeal of a third strike, it would have said so 

19

explicitly.  So if you simply go with that background 

20

understanding, you would still end up with our position. 

21

 Thank you.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM 
 ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER 

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief 

Justice: 

3

 Justice Kennedy asked Mr. Lindstrom whether 

4

the inconsistency between Respondent's position and the

5

Federal government's position undercuts the whole 

6

argument here, and we would respectfully submit that it 

7

does.  Let me start with Respondent's interpretation. 

8

 I don't think that I could put the problem 

9

with that interpretation better than the Federal 

10

government itself does in its brief where it suggests 

11

that "an interpretation, which precludes even an appeal 

12

from the very dismissal that counts as a third strike, 

13

would be inconsistent with quote,  "common practice, in 

14

which a litigant is permitted an appeal as of right, 

15

from any adverse district court ruling that is final." 

16

 One would expect Congress to have spoken 

17

more clearly if that had been Congress's intention.  And 

18

while in Section 1915(a)(3), Congress specified certain 

19

circumstances under which an IFP appeal is not 

20

permitted, it conspicuously did not bar IFP appeals from 

21

third strike dismissals. 

22

 Now, Respondents attempt to mitigate the 

23

harsh consequences of their position.  Wisely, they do 

24

not make the argument that they did in their brief that 

25

a prisoner need only, quote, "buckle down" in order to 

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

earn the $505 filing fee in order to pursue an appeal. 

2

All I heard Respondents suggest was, well, a prisoner 

3

can refile in State courts.  But as Mr. Lindstrom wisely 

4

acknowledged, because Michigan itself has such a

5

provision, many States following the PLRA adopted three 

6

strike provisions of their own.  And so, I would 

7

respectfully submit that that provides cold comfort. 

8
9
10
11
12

 Let me turn to the Federal government's 
interpretation. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Including strikes in 

Federal courts? 
 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

Some States do.  I'm frankly 

13

not sure what the practice is in Michigan, but I know 

14

that many States count dismissals in both sets of courts 

15

toward the three strikes. 

16

 Let me start with  let me address the 

17

Federal government's interpretation very briefly.  I 

18

think it is telling that my friend, Mr. Kedem, did not 

19

start with the government's interpretation of the phrase 

20

"prior occasion."  He instead started with background 

21

principles.  And that is, I would respectfully submit, 

22

for the simple reason that you simply cannot get this 

23

different suit distinction out of the phrase "prior 

24

occasion."  It would lead to the odd result, as Justice 

25

Breyer highlighted in his colloquy with Mr. Kedem, that 

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a prior dismissal could count as a prior occasion in 

2

some circumstances, but not in others. 

3

 Let me address the question of background 

4

principles because that was such the focus of Mr.

5

Kedem's argument.  We would respectfully submit that 

6

principles differ in the law whether as a matter of 

7

statute or whether as a matter of background principles. 

8

Congress can be explicit in both directions and, 

9

obviously, here Congress was silent.  I think in terms 

10

of nonstatutory background principles, frankly, the 

11

primary principle on which the Federal government relies 

12

in its brief is the principle of claim preclusion.  And 

13

it is certainly true that in some jurisdictions, 

14

consequences attach immediately upon judgment.  That's 

15

not the rule in others.  In California and Texas, 

16

consequences don't attach until the judgment becomes 

17

final on appeal. 

18

 But that doctrine serves a quite different 

19

purpose.  The whole point of attaching consequences 

20

immediately is precisely to ensure that a losing party 

21

does not get a second bite at the apple.  Here, by 

22

contrast, you're talking about a provision that applies 

23

consequences in other lawsuits, however unrelated and 

24

however meritorious.  And that just underscores, in our 

25

view, the point that there are different policy 

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

justifications that may require attaching consequences

to a judgment immediately or that may require attaching 

3

consequences only when a judgment becomes final on

appeal.

5

 At bottom, recognizing that there is some 

6

ambiguity here, given the fact that you have three 

7

parties here who are offering different interpretations, 

8

none of which lines up with the interpretation of the 

9

court of appeals below.  We would respectfully submit 

10

that considerations of workability and administrability 

11

ought to be paramount when construing a statute that 

12

governs the processing of Federal lawsuits.  Our rule 

13

has been the rule 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Before 

15

your time runs out, can a case be final on  can a case 

16

be final on appeal if there is a  an appeal pending 

17

but the notice of appeal is untimely? 

18

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

We believe that in that 

19

circumstance, it probably would be until the Court of 

20

Appeals disposes of the case, because the Court of 

21

Appeals would, typically, eventually dismiss the appeal 

22

as untimely.  But these are issues that lower courts 

23

deal with all the time and not just in the context of 

24

our interpretation of the three strikes provision. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So a prisoner could at least

temporarily put some of these strikes in abeyance by

filing untimely notices of appeal.

 MR. SHANMUGAM: 

And I suppose that a court, 

4

if a court believed that that was a serious problem,

5

could construe the finality rule differently.  Our 

6

submission is simply that our rule has been the rule in 

7

the overwhelming majority of lower courts and there's no 

8

evidence that lower courts have had any difficulty.  The 

9

interpretations on the other side are solutions in 

10

search of a problem.  Thank you.
