 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Our first case this 

term is Case 12872, Madigan v. Levin. 

5

 Mr. Scodro? 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO 

7

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 

8

 MR. SCODRO: 

9

please the Court: 

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 Congress has crafted a comprehensive body of 

11

administrative and judicial procedures and remedies that 

12

are tailored specifically to combatting discrimination 

13

against older workers.  In extending these procedures 

14

and remedies to government employees, Congress did not 

15

intend to permit State and municipal workers alone to 

16

frustrate this regime or bypass it entirely using the 

17

more general remedies of Section 1983. 

18

             

19

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Mr. Scodro, there's a 

20

preliminary question before we get to the question you 

21

presented, and that is, what authority did the Seventh 

22

Circuit have to deal with the question under the Age 

23

Discrimination Act?  I mean, it was  it went to the 

24

Seventh Circuit on interlocutory review 

25

 MR. SCODRO: 

That's correct.

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

 a qualified immunity 

2

question.  Everybody agrees that there is no qualified 

3

immunity, that there  that there is, indeed, a claim 

4

that the Equal Protection Clause includes age.  So 

5

Second  Seventh Circuit had no authority to deal with 

6

any question other than that, did it? 

7

 MR. SCODRO: 

It did, Your Honor.  The 

8

Seventh Circuit properly followed this Court's holding 

9

in Wilkie.  In footnote  in footnote 4 of that 

10

opinion, the Court concluded correctly that whether or 

11

not there was a Bivens action for a recognized  in 

12

that case, due process violation, was itself part and 

13

parcel of the first prong of the qualified immunity 

14

inquiry and, therefore, properly considered on 

15

interlocutory 

16

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But in Wilkie, the whole 

17

case was dismissed by the district court, wasn't it?  So 

18

whatever was said in that footnote was dicta. 

19

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, there's an argument 

20

in one of the amicus briefs that the  there was an 

21

alternative route under 1254 in Wilkie and  and, 

22

therefore, the argument is raised that it was dicta. 

23

But it wasn't dicta in context, Your Honor.  The court 

24

didn't consider that alternative route. 

25

 The court squarely held that it had

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurisdiction, and that  it goes on to say in the 

2

footnote that the appellate court properly exercised 

3

jurisdiction because the question of whether there is or 

4

is not a Bivens action for this constitutional right is 

5

properly considered part of the QI in 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Now, we have an amicus brief 

7

from law professors who argue that the Seventh Circuit 

8

should not have considered the question of whether there 

9

was a cause of action under Section 1983.  But they also 

10

go on to argue that we, nevertheless, have jurisdiction 

11

to consider that question and that it is a  a matter 

12

of discretion for us to decide whether to do that.  Is 

13

that  do you agree with that position? 

14

 MR. SCODRO: 

We do agree with that position. 

15

They cite Clinton versus Jones, and they cite the 

16

Fitzgerald decision for that position, Your Honor.  And 

17

we would agree that  while those may be modest 

18

extensions of the holdings in those cases, we would 

19

agree that this Court can exercise 2254 jurisdiction 

20

over the question. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

If we adopt that 

22

formulation and that solution, is it as if we are 

23

granting certiorari before judgment on an issue in our 

24

own discretion?  Is that the way it works? 

25

 MR. SCODRO: 

That's  I think that  no, I

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

think the Court would still fairly consider the  the 

2

Seventh Circuit's judgment on the issue, Your Honor. 

3

And, again, I would  I would return to 

4

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, but how  what's 

5

the mechanism for us  what's the rationale that we can 

6

exercise jurisdiction where a court of appeals could 

7

not?  Because we have 

8

 MR. SCODRO: 

9

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

10
11

Well 
 authority to grant 

certiorari before judgment or for some other reason? 
 MR. SCODRO: 

The theory advanced in the 

12

amicus brief, with which we confer, is that 1254 grants 

13

the Court jurisdiction over the case, and that would 

14

include issues like this that were part and parcel of 

15

the case before the appellate court. 

16

 Now, I should note that that amicus brief 

17

begins with the false premise that there was an exercise 

18

of pendent appellate  appellate jurisdiction in this 

19

case.  And, as we explained briefly in our reply brief, 

20

the one reference  the sole reference to pendent 

21

appellate jurisdiction on Page 7A of the Petitioner's 

22

appendix is merely a reference or a brief description of 

23

the failed argument advanced by the Respondent that 

24

pendent jurisdiction would not be a proper proceeding 

25

here.

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

3

 And the Court did not advance. 

They  they 

squarely cited Wilkie and advanced along the 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Could  could I go back, 

4

Mr. Scodro, to the  to the rationale of  of the 

5

that  that you're relying on.  I mean, you keep on 

6

saying, "part and parcel."  But how is it part and 

7

parcel?  That seems to allay the distinction between a 

8

right and a remedy.  There's one question whether there 

9

has been a violation of law. 

10

 MR. SCODRO: 

11

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Sure. 
There's another question 

12

whether a cause of action exists to remedy that 

13

violation.  Why aren't those two separate inquiries? 

14

 MR. SCODRO: 

Well, Your Honor, the Court, in 

15

Wilkie, moved from one to the other in the footnote. 

16

And I think that 

17

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

18

to explain it to me 

19

 MS. SCODRO: 

20

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I guess I'm asking you 

Sure.  Sure 
 because that footnote is 

21

about a sentence long.  So what's the theory as to why 

22

these are part and parcel of each other? 

23

 MR. SCODRO: 

Because a  the Qualified 

24

Immunity Doctrine itself arises out of Section 1983 in 

25

Bivens, it would seem sensible, as a matter of first

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

principles, to consider whether or not there is such a 

2

cause of action at all, at the outset, with the right to 

3

interlocutory appeal, rather than, given the qualified 

4

immunity as defense from litigation is  and not just 

5

judgment, rather than waiting until final judgment and 

6

on a 1291 appeal, then addressing for the first time on 

7

appeal. 

8

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, that seems a different 

9

argument, not that the two really are intertwined with 

10

each other, but it  that it just might make sense to 

11

consider the one at the outset, even though, in fact, 

12

it's a separate inquiry. 

13

 MR. SCODRO: 

I think  and I want to be 

14

clear  I think there are two different rationales here. 

15

When discussing why it's  Wilkie was correct in what 

16

it said in footnote 4, I would submit my most recent 

17

answer, namely, that it's part and  it is  not part 

18

and parcel, but it is natural and rational to  to 

19

consider whether or not the cause of action exists at 

20

the outset. 

21

 With regard to 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, if you're correct 

23

that the two are one and the same, how  how is it that 

24

we have authorized district courts to do the one or the 

25

other?

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 We  we have not required district courts 

2

to reach the merits if they're  if they can resolve 

3

the question on  on the basis of qualified immunity 

4

alone.  Well, how can that be, if the merits are 

5

necessarily part of the qualified immunity 

6

determination? 

7

 MR. SCODRO: 

Well, Your Honor, some of the 

8

merits we know are part of it under the Court's decision 

9

in Hartman, where the Court concluded that the absence 

10

or the failure to properly plead an element is, indeed, 

11

properly considered a part of the qualified immunity 

12

inquiry. 

13

 And here, the  what  what Wilkie did 

14

essentially, as I read it, is essentially add to that 

15

line of cases the idea that the presence or not of the 

16

Bivens action in that case, but logically speaking, the 

17

Section 1983 action here would be  would be 

18

appropriately considered as part of the  the first 

19

prong of the traditional twoprong qualified immunity. 

20

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

You're running up against 

21

the Seventh Circuit in that respect because the Seventh 

22

Circuit held that the existence of  of an  whether 

23

ADEA was the exclusive remedy, that that was irrelevant 

24

to the qualified immunity issue. 

25

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, toward the end of

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Court's opinion, it's true, the Court uses the 

2

phrase that "it's irrelevant to the qualified immunity 

3

inquiry." 

4

 In that context, I would submit the Court is 

5

using the phrase "qualified immunity," and I think this 

6

is clear in context, to refer as  as lower courts 

7

have, at times, done  to the second prong; that is the 

8

clearly established element of qualified immunity. 

9

 Earlier in the opinion, in the section 

10

labeled "jurisdiction," the Court actually cites Wilkie 

11

and makes clear that it's following Wilkie's command 

12

that the presence or not of the Section 1983 action for 

13

a recognized constitutional right is considered part of 

14

the first prong. 

15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If the existence of a cause 

16

of action could not be considered in an interlocutory 

17

qualified immunity appeal, what would the effect be on 

18

the defendant's right not to be tried, which is the 

19

whole reason for allowing an interlocutory appeal in 

20

qualified immunity cases? 

21

 Wouldn't it be the case that, if the 

22

district court found that there was no qualified 

23

immunity, then the case would have to be tried, and 

24

only at the end of the case could it be determined 

25

whether there actually was a cause of action?  So you'd

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

have a trial, potentially, about nothing. 
 MR. SCODRO: 

That  that's correct, Your 

3

Honor.  In my earlier response to Justice Sotomayor's 

4

question, I think there  or Justice Kagan's 

5

question  I apologize  I think it was  that 

6

that's exactly right.  This is immunity from litigation, 

7

immunity from suit. 

8
9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

The decision was that 

there was no qualified immunity.  And the question is, 

10

having determined there was no qualified immunity, 

11

should they have stopped there?  There wouldn't have 

12

been a trial  if there is no qualified immunity, then 

13

they have no exemption from trial. 

14

 MR. SCODRO: 

No, Your Honor.  To decide that 

15

there isn't qualified immunity, the Court needs to 

16

consider both prongs and resolve them both adverse to 

17

the defendant.  And, therefore, it was essential for the 

18

Court here to consider the argument that there is no 

19

Section 1983 action. 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm not sure you see the 

21

distinction or  or you're facing the distinction.  The 

22

right not to be tried is one of qualified immunity. 

23

 MR. SCODRO: 

24

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

25

Correct. 
But you can have a 

constitutional violation and still not have a remedy,

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

which is what this question involves. 
 So how do we deal with the concept that 

3

other people who have motions to dismiss that are denied 

4

still undergo trials, still experience the expense, and 

5

yet, we've said, repeatedly, an interlocutory appeal is 

6

not warranted. 

7

 And so what makes it warranted here, where a 

8

court has already said that there was a  or at least 

9

there's enough evidence to suggest a constitutional 

10

violation and that a reasonable officer wouldn't have 

11

believed his or  a person would have believed his or 

12

her conduct was appropriate? 

13

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, with regard to that 

14

question, I would return to the notion that is a matter 

15

of first principles, given that qualified immunity is an 

16

outgrowth of Section 1983.  The Court was very just 

17

was justified in Wilkie in treating the presence or not 

18

of the cause of action. 

19

 This is a  we're not talking about an 

20

affirmative defense, for example, in the form of statute 

21

of limitations as one example.  We're talking about the 

22

existence or not of the Bivens right in that case, in 

23

the Section 1983 right here. 

24
25

 It seems consistent with the fact that 
qualified immunity exists as a defense against Section

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

1983 and Bivens to contemplate the existence or not of 

2

that cause of action right at the threshold. 

3
4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Maybe  well, maybe you 

better say a few words about the merits? 

5

 MR. SCODRO: 

6

 (Laughter.) 

7

 MR. SCODRO: 

Thank you, Your Honor. 

The  the ADEA's remedial 

8

regime has the two elements that this Court has looked 

9

at, repeatedly, in determining whether a comprehensive 

10

regime or a regime is sufficiently comprehensive to 

11

displace more general Section 1983 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There's another 

13

preliminary question, and that is, why are we talking 

14

about the ADEA, when the district court held that the 

15

ADEA doesn't cover Mr. Levin?  And there seems to be not 

16

much of a dispute about that.  You're not arguing that 

17

the ADEA does cover him, are you? 

18

 MR. SCODRO: 

Well, we are  we are arguing 

19

that the ADEA's rights and remedies do apply to 

20

Mr. Levin.  And the reason is that, in 1991, with the 

21

amendments  as part of the Civil Rights Overhaul Act of 

22

that year, the amendments in that Act extended, and it's 

23

a section entitled "Coverage of previously exempt State 

24

employees." 

25

 It  it extended ADEA rights and remedies

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to the previously exempt policymakers at other high 

2

levels. 

3

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, has  has the Court 

4

ever held that an antidiscrimination statute that does 

5

not provide any rights for a particular class of 

6

plaintiffs, nevertheless, extinguishes the right of 

7

action that those plaintiffs would have under Section 

8

1983? 

9

 What if Mr. Levin were under 40 years old? 

10

Would you say that his equal protection Section 1983 

11

cause of action was extinguished by the ADEA? 

12
13
14

 MR. SCODRO: 

No, we would not, Your Honor. 

And the reason 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

So what is the difference 

15

between someone who's under 40 and someone who is not an 

16

employee, within the meaning of the ADEA? 

17

 MR. SCODRO: 

Sure.  And, again, we're 

18

talking about the 1974 to 1991 period, just to be clear, 

19

because, since '91, appointees and employees, alike, 

20

are  are  have the full range of ADEA rights and 

21

remedies. 

22

 During that period, under 40s  as this 

23

Court held in Cline, that workers under the age of 40 

24

simply were not part of the social ill that Congress 

25

aimed to redress.  They were concerned with the plight

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of the relatively older worker.  It's why the Court 

2

concluded in Cline that reverse discrimination is not 

3

covered and, also, the explanation for why Congress drew 

4

a line at age 40. 

5

 Just as in Smith, for example, the Education 

6

of the Handicapped Act didn't extend to cover all manner 

7

of hurdles confronted by a disabled student.  It  it 

8

focused solely on a single issue facing  a 

9

curricular issue facing these students.  Undoubtedly, 

10

those students not covered by it would have retained 

11

their Section 1983 right, same with under40 here. 

12

 Now, as to the  the narrow exception that 

13

existed between '74 and '91 for highlevel government 

14

policy  policymakers, we have the EEOC's understanding 

15

of why exactly Congress did that.  They did so because 

16

there was concern on the part of members of Congress 

17

that it would be inappropriate from a matter of 

18

federalism and operationally to have federal involvement 

19

in the hiring decisions made by the highest members 

20

the elected members of state and local government.  And 

21

that concern applies equally to Section 1983 claims. 

22

 Because that concern applies equally 

23

we're not talking about people who weren't within the 

24

scope of the social ill; we're talking about a 

25

deliberate carveout for reasons that apply equally to

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Section 1983  we would submit that the exception, 

2

likewise, would have had force during that interim 

3

period. 

4

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Why 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

For some  for  please. 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why should we consider 

7

that question?  If this  if we were back in the era 

8

before the enactment of the GERA, yes, we would have to 

9

consider that question.  But now that the new statute 

10

has been passed, why should we consider whether someone 

11

who was a nonemployee lacked a  a 1983 cause of 

12

action during the period when that  prior to the 

13

enactment of that statute? 

14

 MR. SCODRO: 

You're actually  absolutely 

15

correct, Your Honor.  As we say in our reply brief, 

16

there is no need for the Court to confront that question 

17

in this case. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

19

 MR. SCODRO: 

Which question? 

The question of whether or not, 

20

between 1974 and 1991, exempt employees  those who 

21

then obtained ADEA rights in 1991, whether those 

22

employees could be  their Section 1983 claims could 

23

have been displaced by  notwithstanding the fact that 

24

they were carved out. 

25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But I think the point here

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is that Mr. Levin is covered not by the ADEA, but by a 

2

separate statute, the GERA.  And there's a separate 

3

question whether the GERA would displace constitutional 

4

relief, which apparently has  has never been argued to 

5

anybody in this case. 

6

 MR. SCODRO: 

Two points, Your Honor.  First, 

7

as we explain in reply and in  in our opening brief, 

8

the GERA is properly considered merely a part of the 

9

broader remedial regime under the ADEA, and we explain 

10

why to look at it otherwise would create all sort of 

11

manner of artificialities. 

12

 It's  it's  we know, from past statutes 

13

like the Genetics Act that was passed more recently, the 

14

way in which Congress would incorporate GERA by 

15

reference instead of viceversa.  We know that, for 

16

example, in that same 1991 Act, 1981(a) was added and 

17

provided punitive damages for a whole array of 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, there are some 

19

similarities  many similarities, between the ADEA and 

20

the GERA, but there are also real differences.  I mean, 

21

they're obvious  they obviously cover different 

22

people; there are different procedural prerequisites for 

23

the suit; you get a different kind of review, you only 

24

get administrative review under the GERA. 

25

 So it's a separate inquiry as to whether

17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this statute that has some commonalities, but some 

2

differences, displaces constitutional claims, and it's 

3

an inquiry that really has never been addressed in this 

4

case. 

5

 MR. SCODRO: 

And, Your Honor, to the extent, 

6

if the Court has concerns about addressing that  and, 

7

again, I  I'm happy to go on as to why it would be 

8

artificial to consider the two separately. 

9

 But if the Court were to conclude that, 

10

rather than an  effectively amending the ADEA, that 

11

the GERA amendments in 1991 really created a whole new 

12

statute that needs to be considered independent, the 

13

proper remedy would not be to dismiss this appeal, but 

14

would be to vacate the Seventh Circuit's judgment to 

15

permit Respondent to raise a claim that is new to this 

16

case on the merits here; namely, that there are 

17

different rules for appointees than employees. 

18

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

This is an  the 

19

qualified immunity question is presented on 

20

interlocutory appeal. 

21

 MR. SCODRO: 

22

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It is, Your Honor. 
Decisions on the 

23

merits, factual and legal, are still pending.  Now 

24

now, we have a determination by the district court that 

25

Mr. Levin is not an employee.

18

Alderson Reporting Company

1

 MR. SCODRO: 

2

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Yes. 
The prior district 

3

court determined that he was.  The Respondents alleged 

4

that he was an employee in their complaint.  I presume, 

5

depending upon how we rule on the qualified immunity 

6

issue, the parties may want to revisit their positions 

7

on that question as the case goes go forward. 

8

 And the district court in the first 

9

instance, I suppose, would be the one to decide whether 

10

they're allowed to revisit the issue in light of the 

11

change in his perception of the law or not. 

12

 MR. SCODRO: 

That's correct, Your Honor.  If 

13

this  if I'm understanding your question, that if 

14

if the  depending on how this Court rules, it is 

15

always true, under Rule 54, that he could seek to have 

16

the district court reconsider his status. 

17

 It's also true that, if he wished to proceed 

18

under the GERA process for vindicating ADEA rights, he 

19

has the option of seeking a dismissal without prejudice 

20

of his statutory claims  this has occurred in a 

21

handful of district court opinions  and then ask the 

22

EEOC if he can proceed in the first instance before an 

23

ALJ and to advance those claims.  That is also an option 

24

that 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But there are a few things

19

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I  I don't really know.  I mean, does  do you have 

2

to allege a claim under GERA for this particular 

3

individual?  I don't know. 

4

 And if you do, I don't know whether GERA 

5

simply picked up whatever saving of the equal protection 

6

otherwise would have existed in the ADEA or didn't.  And 

7

I believe that GERA applies to employment discrimination 

8

claims based on gender or race or other things, right? 

9

 Well, every circuit in the country has said 

10

you don't lose your  your constitutional claim there. 

11

So are we supposed to read GERA, it goes this way in 

12

some cases and that way in other cases, when GERA is 

13

silent on the matter? 

14

 And so I looked to see what the Seventh 

15

Circuit said.  Nothing.  I looked to see what you argued 

16

below.  Nothing.  I looked to see whether it's obvious 

17

that GERA does apply or doesn't apply and simply picks 

18

it up or not.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just being 

19

thick. 

20

 But nonetheless, where I don't know so much 

21

and the whole case turns on it, why are we hearing an 

22

issue that might not even be in the case? 

23

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit 

24

was  pronounced a rule that was indifferent as between 

25

appointees and employees.  The reason for that was the

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Seventh Circuit was asked to announce a rule that is 

2

indifferent as to employees and appointees.  There 

3

was  the Respondent sought and obtained a rule that 

4

the ADEA does not displace, period. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's about people not 

6

like the client who's at issue here.  That is about 

7

people whom the ADEA did cover.  Isn't that an advisory 

8

opinion in respect to this case?  I don't know.  That 

9

has a certain ring to it. 

10

 But  but what are we doing, deciding 

11

whether the ADEA applies and in what way to a person to 

12

whom it doesn't apply, assuming that GERA is, in fact, a 

13

separate statute that you have to sue under, the answer 

14

to which I do not know and which has never been argued. 

15

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, there's very little 

16

lower court authority on the effect of GERA.  I will say 

17

that what courts have done for I  there is a case, for 

18

example, in which the allegation was Title VII as 

19

amended in 1991, and the Court construed that, 

20

naturally, to include the GERA rights. 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

And so, if there's so 

22

little about it, sometime, on occasion, we dismiss a 

23

case as improvidently granted, which is not a 

24

particularly desirable thing to do.  But how could we 

25

avoid doing that here?

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, to reiterate a 

2

point made just a few moments ago, I think that the 

3

proper resolution, if  GERA and the ADEA, again, are 

4

really one remedial regime.  And  and I've  I've 

5

pointed out 1981(a) as an example of a  of a similar 

6

regime, where punitive damages were added to a number 

7

of statutes. 

8
9

 And yet, if we considered any one of those 
statutes today, we would agree that it includes punitive 

10

damages, even though it was added in a freestanding 

11

statute as part of the 1991 Act. 

12

 But, again, I would say, as a procedural 

13

matter, should the Court harbor concerns about this 

14

issue and wish to permit the claim that appointees and 

15

employees are entitled to different displacement rules 

16

and the counterargument that, no, they're not because 

17

GERA effectively amends and adds to the ADEA, the way to 

18

handle that procedurally would be to vacate the judgment 

19

below and to let the parties argue those points to that 

20

court. 

21

 As it stands, the Seventh Circuit was asked 

22

to issue a broad pronouncement that is indifferent to 

23

whether  the Seventh Circuit was well aware and states 

24

that Mr. Levin was subject to an interlocutory 

25

determination that he was an appointee.

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And the court went on  and the only 

2

relevance that had in the court's analysis, based on the 

3

way it was framed below, is that, well, because 

4

appointees and people under 40 and other categories 

5

appear to be carved out  and we have answers to all of 

6

those in our briefs in response  but because all of 

7

them appear to be carved out, the ADEA does not 

8

displace, ever, as to appointees or employees. 

9

 That doesn't contemplate a new argument that 

10

as an  as an appointee, rather, Mr. Levin has  is 

11

subject to a different displacement rule.  It would be 

12

for the Seventh Circuit to confront that in the first 

13

place. 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  I  the 

15

only issue that's before us is whether someone who's 

16

exempted from the ADEA still has a 1983 claim, correct? 

17

That's what the Seventh Circuit said.  If you're not a 

18

part of the statute, then you still have your 1983 

19

rights? 

20

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, what the Seventh 

21

Circuit held is that the ADEA does not displace Section 

22

1983 claims for employees or appointees.  It was a 

23

sweeping ruling that was sought.  And the contention now 

24

is, well, perhaps the court should not have reached such 

25

a sweeping ruling, perhaps the court could have ruled,

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

instead, that, as an appointee, Mr. Levin is entitled to 

2

a different rule that is specific to appointees because 

3

they're exempt under the ADEA. 

4

 That argument was never advanced before the 

5

Seventh Circuit.  And, at this point, again, we would 

6

say should the Court harbor concerns about addressing 

7

this case, we would ask that they  they vacate and let 

8

the Seventh Circuit address that issue in the first 

9

instance. 

10

 If permitted, I would like to reserve my 

11

remaining time for rebuttal.

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD R. THEOBALD, III, 
 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 

18

 I'd like to first address the jurisdictional 

19

issue.  We made the argument before the Seventh Circuit 

20

that the Seventh Circuit did not have jurisdiction to 

21

on this issue of preclusion.  And we argued that, under 

22

Swint  the Court's decision in Swint, on an 

23

interlocutory appeal of qualified immunity, the Court 

24

would have to reach the  in order to reach the issue 

25

of qualified immunity, it would have to address the

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

preclusion issue. 
 And our position was you don't have to look 

3

at  you don't even consider that on qualified 

4

immunity.  It's not part of the equation. 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, we said the 

6

exact opposite in Wilkie in footnote 4.  I mean, you can 

7

say it's only a footnote, but it is what we said. 

8
9

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, we respectfully 

disagree, Your Honor.  And we made that argument, and in 

10

the decision that the Seventh Circuit reached, they 

11

said, we didn't have to consider this preclusion issue 

12

to reach the qualified immunity denial, that qualified 

13

immunity was not applicable.  So we did argue that, and 

14

that was our position there. 

15

 With respect to the issue presented here, 

16

the only thing that is pertinent is whether or not the 

17

ADEA can preclude an individual who's not covered by it, 

18

regardless if that individual is under 40 years old or 

19

if they're exempt from the statute or if they have a 

20

claim that the ADEA doesn't address.

consider the issue that you're  you're talking about

now. 

3

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, I would respectfully 

4

disagree, Your Honor.  We  the Seventh Circuit  we 

5

made it clear in the Seventh Circuit that Mr. Levin had 

6

been excluded.  He was excluded in July of 2011 by a 

7

decision of District Clerk Chang.  He said in that 

8
9
10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Was that the  was 

that the first one or the second one? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

The second one.  Judge Korr 

11

initially decided the issue twice and said Mr. Levin was 

12

covered by the ADEA. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

In your brief, could I 

14

just  you say  I think this is pretty close to the 

15

exact words  there's no realistic possibility of your 

16

obtaining a holding that Mr. Levin is an employee within 

17

the ADEA.  But do you concede that now? 

18
19
20

 MR. THEOBALD: 

I concede that there's no 

realistic possibility. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No.  Do you concede that he 

21

is not an employee?  If you just say that there's no 

22

realistic possibility that the courts are going to take 

23

this correct position, then the issue is still in the 

24

case. 

25

 So is it your position that he is an

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

employee or he is not an employee? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, I  I mean, they 

3

dodged  he's  the court has ruled  the Seventh 

4

Circuit in Opp v. Cook County State's Attorney, Your 

5

Honor, made it very clear their State's attorneys would 

6

be  appointees would not be covered under the ADEA. 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, if you're not willing 

8

to say that he is not an employee, then the issue is 

9

still in the case, and we would have  if we were to 

10

rule on the ADEA issue, wouldn't we have to decide 

11

whether there is a remedy for somebody who is an 

12

employee within the ADEA? 

13

 MR. THEOBALD: 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well 
The district court might be 

15

wrong on that.  The Seventh Circuit might be wrong on 

16

that.  And you may be right.  There's not much of a 

17

realistic possibility that you're going to get a 

18

reversal of that.  But the issue is still in the case, 

19

unless you want to give it up. 

20

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, the Court will so rule. 

21

The Seventh Circuit ruled in the Opp v. Cook County 

22

case, and this Court denied cert in 2011 on the Opp 

23

v. Cook County case.  But to stand here 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So you don't want 

you don't want to  you don't want to give it up, which

27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

makes sense.  I mean, you've got a client.  It depends 

2

on what we do, right?  I mean, depending on what our 

3

ruling is, it may be advantageous to you to argue, as 

4

you alleged in your complaint, that he's an employee. 

5
6
7

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, as we stand here now, 

he is not in this case.  And I  I don't know 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's pretty universal he's 

8

not an employee under ADEA, though he might be under 

9

GERA.  You have to say yes or no because, if you're 

10

going to say  I mean, you know, let's either do it or 

11

not do it.  If you  if you want to leave this issue in 

12

the case, it's possible to argue we should decide this 

13

whole issue on the ground that, although he's not really 

14

a bird, he's a fish or whatever. 

15

 (Laughter.) 

16

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But, I mean, that  this 

17

is supposed to be fairly realistic, I think, what we're 

18

supposed to do. 

19

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Okay.  Well, going back to 

20

Mr. Levin being not covered, we believe the Court's 

21

decision in Davis v. Passman and the Court's decision in 

22

Smith v. Robinson, which is the only case where the 

23

Court has precluded a 1983 constitutional claim, that 

24

that 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Well, just to get

Official

1

this clear, you asked for this ruling from the Seventh 

2

Circuit.  And  and you won based on a factual record 

3

that was no different then than it is now.  You asked 

4

for this ruling based on these facts, you won, and now, 

5

you want to insulate that from any review. 

6

 I mean, I think it'd  it'd be a feather in 

7

your cap if you can pull it off.  But it seems to me 

8

 (Laughter.) 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

It seems to me that, 

10

since you asked for the ruling on the merits and got it, 

11

we ought to be able to review it, to determine whether 

12

it's right or wrong.  And to the extent there's a 

13

factual issue that would persist in the case, if it goes 

14

back on qualified immunity, you and the parties can 

15

reposition themselves on that. 

16

 I mean, it is an issue that was apparently 

17

close enough for one district court to say, yes, the 

18

other district court, on looking at it again, to say no. 

19

The deck will be reshuffled depending on how we rule. 

20

And as I see you standing there, I don't see you willing 

21

to concede for  for the future that he's not an 

22

employee. 

23

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, we think the difference 

24

was, after the district court's decision in our case, 

25

that the Seventh Circuit decided another case in 2010,

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and that's why the second district court judge followed 

2

that precedent.  And that precedent, where this Court 

3

denied cert, there's no real possibility that any court 

4

is going to find Mr. Levin as being covered by the ADEA. 

5

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

There's no real possibility 

6

that any court is going to find that your client was, in 

7

fact, an employee without GERA.  That's what you said; 

8

is that right? 

9
10

 MR. THEOBALD: 

GERA is  is another 

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

It's a different statute. 

11

But just without GERA 

12

 MR. THEOBALD: 

13

 JUSTICE BREYER:  he's a political 

Right. 

14

appointment or whatever it is, so he's not within ADEA. 

15

That's what I think this is about. 

16

 MR. THEOBALD: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

18

 MR. THEOBALD: 

19

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

20

 MR. THEOBALD: 

21

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
That's correct? 
Yes. 
And you agree with that? 
Yes. 
Okay.  Then thank you very 

22

much.  And then my argument comes into play that we 

23

shouldn't be deciding issues of an advisory nature that 

24

do not involve individuals who fall within the statute 

25

that someone once interpreted.

30

Alderson Reporting Company

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Do you also agree that he is 

covered by GERA? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

It is unclear, Your Honor. 

4

We don't  GERA is unclear whether, first of all, in 

5

the Alaska case v. EEOC, whether it applies to States. 

6

States have argued that they're not included in the 

7

definition  definition of GERA.  And the State of 

8

Illinois has not waived sovereign immunity under the 

9

GERA statute. 

10

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

11

 MR. THEOBALD: 

So what 
So whether or not there's a 

12

remedy there is very unclear.  And this  as 

13

Justice Breyer mentioned, it's been never discussed in 

14

this case.  It was never discussed in the Seventh 

15

Circuit, never discussed in the district court.  It 

16

wasn't discussed at the EEOC.  When we filed a charge, 

17

the Attorney General didn't come in and say this should 

18

be handled under GERA 

19
20
21

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, it was never discussed 

because you never raised it; isn't that right? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

Our position was it was 

22

inapplicable.  We didn't  we wouldn't raise it.  It 

23

would be  someone else would raise it.  There's about 

24

a handful of cases, nationally, that are filed under 

25

GERA every year.  Some years, there's no cases filed at

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the EEOC.  It's seldom used. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You want us to hold that the 

3

Seventh Circuit lacked jurisdiction to consider 

4

whether  whether there is a cause of action under 

5

Section 1983.  So that precedent, that Seventh Circuit 

6

precedent, would be wiped from the books.  The issue 

7

would be back in the case.  If ultimately there was 

8

another appeal, maybe it would go to a different Seventh 

9

Circuit panel.  Maybe it would come out differently. 

10

 So you want that wiped away. 

And you want 

11

us to hold only  to limit our consideration to the 

12

ADEA and not consider GERA, so that would be back in the 

13

case when it came  when it went back to the district 

14

court.  So that's correct?  That's what you want? 

15

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Yes, Your Honor.  And 

16

that's  our position is we didn't argue the 

17

jurisdictional issue in our brief, but the court was 

18

concerned about it, and we did address it in the Seventh 

19

Circuit. 

20

 I would point out, in the Seventh Circuit's 

21

decision, though, their decision throughout the  for 

22

instance, the  the Seventh Circuit talks about 

23

Mr. Levin not being an appointee on the policymaking 

24

level and exempt, so that was in the case.  It wasn't 

25

something where they just decided whether the ADEA

32

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

precludes individuals that are covered. 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

And as far as the  the 

3

preclusion is concerned, why does it make a difference 

4

whether it's ADEA or GERA?  Wouldn't the arguable 

5

preclusion be even stronger under  under GERA because 

6

there is a special administrative remedy, you have to go 

7

to the EEOC first, and the only form for review is the 

8

Federal Circuit? 

9

 MR. THEOBALD: 

That's correct, Your Honor. 

10

The  there's no preclusion under GERA or the ADEA. 

11

We've set forth that the Court should look at preclusion 

12

with two questions.  The first question, under 

13

preclusion, is under Sea Clammers. 

14

 Sea Clammers was a case where they passed a 

15

new statute with the new right and had an enforcement 

16

provision in the statute, and the issue was whether or 

17

not, under Sea Clammers, the Congress intended to 

18

preclude 1983 to enforce that statute.  And the Court 

19

came to the conclusion, yes, that it would be 

20

inconsistent to use 1983 with that statute. 

21

 The second standard that the Court has used 

22

is under Smith v. Fitzgerald, which is applicable here, 

23

if we're looking at whether the ADEA precludes somebody 

24

covered by the ADEA.  And that is, when a statute is 

25

passed with an enforcement provision, did Congress

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intend to use that enforcement provision to also enforce 

2

preexisting independent statutory or constitutional 

3

rights? 

4

 And, two, did Congress intend to use this 

5

provision in the new statute to be the sole exclusive 

6

remedy of the preexisting independent constitutional 

7

right?  GERA cannot preclude a constitutional  GERA 

8

there's no evidence that, when Congress passed GERA, 

9

they intended GERA to enforce the constitutional right 

10
11

to equal protection of the law.  It doesn't 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, can I ask you a 

12

question about the constitutional right?  Do you  do 

13

you agree that the standard for an equal protection 

14

agediscrimination claim is traditional, fullblown, 

15

rationalbasis review? 

16

 MR. THEOBALD: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
So that if there's any 

18

conceivable ground on which the decisionmaker could have 

19

decided that age was  it was proper to make an age 

20

classification, there is no constitutional violation? 

21

 MR. THEOBALD: 

We can see where the rational 

22

basis test  and the court found  we survived summary 

23

judgment on our equal protection gender discrimination 

24

claim and the age discrimination claim. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

No, I'm just talking about

34

Alderson Reporting Company

equal protection age discrimination.

about the ADEA, there is no ADEA, there is no state 

6

antidiscrimination law involved here, all we are 

7

talking about is equal protection.  And they passed a 

8

law that said, all attorneys working for the State of 

9

Illinois must retire at the age of 60 because everybody 

10

knows  you know, once a lawyer passes 60, there's 

11

nothing left. 

12

 (Laughter.) 

13

 MR. THEOBALD: 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15
16

We're all in trouble. 
Would that be  would that 

survive a rational basis review? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

I don't believe so.  This 

17

Court has considered the  that issue on two occasions. 

18

In Gregory v. Ashcroft, that was before the Court, It 

19

was a  the plaintiffs were excluded, like Mr. Levin, 

20

and yet, this Court acknowledged the equal protection 

21

1983 claim.  They didn't  the reasons that were used 

22

in that case were insufficient to meet the rational 

23

basis test. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Theobald, are there any 

cases out there in the universe of cases in which a

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person does not have an ADEA claim or a GERA claim, but 

2

has  has pressed a successful constitutional claim 

3

based on age discrimination? 

4

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, GERA has never been 

5

there's one case on GERA that we could find.  It's over 

6

a 20yearold District Court of New York decision that 

7

said GERA can't preclude anything.  So if we put GERA 

8

together with the ADEA, it's only been really one 

9

district court has addressed that issue.  And 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

I guess the question is what 

11

are the circumstances in which, given the very low 

12

standard  or given  given the very low rational 

13

basis standard, what are the circumstances in which you 

14

would have a viable constitutional claim, but not a 

15

statutory claim?  What would that case look like? 

16

 MR. THEOBALD: 

If you had a claim under 

17

1983, it would also, I believe, violate the ADEA. 

18

If that  if I  if that's your question. 

19

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Would there be any 

20

unfairness to the parties if this case were remanded to 

21

the court of appeals with instructions for it in turn to 

22

remand to the district court to see whether or not the 

23

GERA issue has been properly presented or waived and to 

24

consider that?  Would there be 

25

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, it would be 

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

2

parties in doing that? 

3

 MR. THEOBALD: 

 any unfairness to the 

It would be very unfair to 

4

us, Your Honor.  We were scheduled to go to trial in May 

5

before the Court granted cert.  The case has been 

6

pending almost six years.  And to raise this issue at 

7

this  this issue in GERA was raised this year.  It 

8

wasn't raised for six years, never  whenever it was 

9

part of this case.  And I don't think that 

10
11
12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

That argument  that 

argument could be made in the district court. 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, for something that's as 

13

suspect as GERA, whether it even applies, it's  the 

14

State has not said it applies 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

 MR. THEOBALD: 

17

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about doing 
 the State of Illinois. 
What if the  is there 

18

anything unfair about this?  I think Justice Ginsburg 

19

wrote an opinion in  I recall a Third Circuit case 

20

involving ERISA or some medical thing, and an issue came 

21

up that was quite relevant, and nobody had really 

22

thought about it before or done much about it.  And what 

23

she wrote, to my recollection, is, well, we would like 

24

the advice of the lower court if they want to give it. 

25

 And so we send it back for the Third Circuit

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to consider whether it's appropriate to reach the issue 

2

and, if it is appropriate to reach the issue, do so. 

3

Or, if they think the district court should reach it, do 

4

so.  In other words, we can't figure it out at this 

5

moment what's fair in terms of the entire litigation. 

6

 Now, would that  would that be a serious 

7
8
9

problem for you or your client? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, our position is that, 

yes, that none of these apply.  ADEA cannot preclude 

10

somebody that's covered.  The Seventh Circuit opinion 

11

covers that.  The ADEA can't preclude somebody that's 

12

not covered.  And this Court's opinion in 

13

Davis v. Passman and footnote 22 in Smith v. Robinson 

14

talks about 

15

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I don't know if you've 

16

satisfied my colleagues.  I'm not sure that you've 

17

answered directly.  I think your adversary is right, 

18

that the Seventh Circuit held that no one is precluded 

19

from a 1983 claim, whether they're an employee or a 

20

nonemployee. 

21

 That's the way the case was litigated. 

22

That's the way they decided.  The broad statement, 

23

whether he's an employee or not an employee, he doesn't 

24

have a 1983  he has a 1983 action.  You've come in, 

25

and you've said he's not an employee, so he's entitled

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to his 1983 claim. 

2

 MR. THEOBALD: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yes. 
All right.  My 

4

colleagues are asking you, that only takes care of half 

5

of this problem because the circuit said, even if he was 

6

an employee, he would still have it.  And so you're 

7

being asked are you giving up that part of the claim, 

8

that he's not an employee? 

9
10
11

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Yes, he's been excluded. 

I 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, then I 

12

assume  if you're saying the qualified immunity ruling 

13

should not be reviewed because this person was not an 

14

employee, but instead covered by GERA, right?  Is that 

15

what 

16
17
18

 MR. THEOBALD: 

We don't agree that he's 

covered by GERA, but it's  it's not clear. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, they didn't 

19

address GERA in the preclusion ruling, right?  So 

20

presumably, they get another  they get a chance on an 

21

interlocutory appeal.  The whole thing is  qualified 

22

immunity is supposed to protect them from trial. 

23

 And if you say the GERA issue wasn't 

24

wasn't considered, even though the Seventh Circuit's 

25

ruling was sweeping and didn't distinguish, well, they

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should have a chance to assert qualified immunity under 

2

that ground, I would think. 


3


 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, I don't think that that 

4

would factor in, Your Honor, with the qualified immunity 

5

analysis.  The Seventh Circuit held and the district 

6

court held that your decision in Kimel and 

7

acknowledged equal protection 1983 claims, and that's 

8

the issue in qualified immunity. 

9

 They have not asked this Court to review the 

10

qualified immunity aspect of the Seventh Circuit's 

11

decision, just the preclusion part. 

12

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, that's true, but is 

13

that the issue?  Is that really the qualified immunity 

14

issue, whether irrational age discrimination violates 

15

equal protection?  Or is the qualified immunity issue 

16

whether, on the facts here, an official could believe 

17

that there was no constitutional violation  reasonably 

18

believe there was no constitutional violation? 

19

 Isn't the latter 


20

MR. THEOBALD: 

It's the  it's the latter, 


JUSTICE ALITO: 

Isn't the latter the real 


21
22
23

yes. 

question? 

24

MR. THEOBALD: 

25

JUSTICE ALITO: 

Yes, Your Honor. 

Well, that's not what the


40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4

district court held though, is it? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

The district court did so 

hold, yes. 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I thought the district 

5

court simply held that an official should have realized 

6

that irrational age discrimination was a violation of 

7

the Constitution, not that an official should have 

8

realized that it was a violation of the Constitution to 

9

do what was alleged to have been done here. 

10

 MR. THEOBALD: 

I think they  it answered 

11

both questions, really.  I don't  I don't see the 

12

difference. 

13
14
15

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

You don't see the difference 

between the two? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

No, Your Honor.  I  I think 

16

that the court's  the district court's decision held 

17

no qualified immunity.  The Seventh Circuit cited this 

18

Court's decision in Kimel.  The other cases before this 

19

Court, Gregory v. Ashcroft, acknowledged an age 

20

discrimination case  case brought through 1983, and it 

21

was clearly established. 

22

 The Seventh Circuit acknowledged the 1983 

23

age discrimination equal protection claim in 1977 in 

24

Gault v. Garrison.  This is a wellsettled issue. 

25

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If there's a qualified

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

immunity appeal on the question  on the issue of 

2

whether, let's say, a search was an unreasonable search, 

3

would qualified immunity be denied on the ground that an 

4

official should realize that an unreasonable search is 

5

unconstitutional? 

6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13

 Would that be  that  would that be the 
issue under qualified immunity? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

Well, if the facts that the 

officer was presented, if there wasn't  it wasn't well 
settled, that the conduct 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Ah, on the facts that were 

presented? 
 MR. THEOBALD: 

Yes, Your Honor.  So on the 

14

people that aren't covered, we have four groups:  People 

15

that are under 40 under the ADEA; people in the  that 

16

are exempt; individuals that work for a government 

17

employer that have less than 20 employees are not 

18

covered by the ADEA; and people that have a particular 

19

type of claim  a retaliation claim, a claim for 

20

emotional distress damages, something like that 

21

they're not covered. 

22

 The State concedes that the people under 40, 

23

they're going to bring equal protection claims through 

24

1983.  There's no difference between those people and 

25

Mr. Levin and the other two categories.  You're either

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

in or you're out. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, but that's not what 

3

the Seventh Circuit held.  I mean, that  that may well 

4

be, but we're asked to review a holding by the Seventh 

5

Circuit that, even if you aren't covered, even if you're 

6

not exempt, you still have a 1983 claim.  That's 

7

that's why we took this case. 

8
9
10

 And now, you're  you're telling us we 
should not review what the Seventh Circuit held.  And 
that would, presumably, remain the circuit law, right? 

11

 MR. THEOBALD: 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Yes, Your Honor. 
Well, not if there's no 

13

jurisdiction, right?  If they didn't have jurisdiction, 

14

the thing would be wiped out. 

15

 MR. THEOBALD: 

Yes, that  that is true. 

16

But I believe the Seventh Circuit, in its opinion  and 

17

I could just refer to things in the appendix at page 

18

57A, the district court's opinion, the district court 

19

said Mr. Levin is exempt.  In the Seventh Circuit 

20

opinion, the Seventh Circuit Docket No. 44 talks about 

21

endruns.  The Seventh Circuit Docket No. 37, page 67, 

22

the plaintiff was an employee on the policymaking level. 

23

 So it's clear that the Seventh Circuit knew 

24

we argued that he was exempt.  We argued that the 

25

being exempt under this court's decision in

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Fitzgerald gives an individual the right to bring an 

2

equal protection claim.  And the Court mentioned that, 

3

in Fitzgerald, the decision in 2009, being exempt from 

4

Title IX 

5

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

In the Seventh 

6

Circuit, even though they  you had that reference to 

7

him being exempt, the Seventh Circuit basically said it 

8

didn't make a difference, right?  Whether he was covered 

9

as  as an employee or not covered or covered under 

10

GERA or anything else, under their analysis, it doesn't 

11

make a difference. 

12

 MR. THEOBALD: 

I think we could read the 

13

opinion that way, but they certainly were aware that 

14

Mr. Levin was not covered.  The  the State has argued, 

15

since Mr. Levin has been excluded, before the Seventh 

16

Circuit and before this Court, they used the terms 

17

"exhaustion," "not exhausting remedies," and they used 

18

the word "avoids the scheme," "avoids the ADEA." 

19

 In the opening brief before  the merits 

20

brief before this Court, the State used the term 

21

"exhaustion" or "failure to exhaust" more than a dozen 

22

times.  They used the term "avoiding the ADEA" at least 

23

six times. 

24
25

 This argument is the old Zombro argument, 
the first case that held preclusion where somebody

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't go through.  Exhaustion has nothing to do with 

2

this case.  This Court's opinion in Patsy v. Board of 

3

Regents said you don't have to exhaust from 1983. 

4

 All the cases, Johnson v. Railway Express, 

5

CBOCS v. Humphries, there's no exhaustion required.  And 

6

to top it off, Mr. Levin, he exhausted his remedies.  He 

7

filed at the EEOC.  He got a right to sue under Title 

8

VII.  So 

9

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Let  let's assume that 

10

the question that was presented is before us.  And 

11

you  you have argued Fitzgerald.  The other side says 

12

Smith v. Robinson should control.  So why shouldn't the 

13

Handicapped Act decision control?  That, like the ADEA, 

14

has allowed procedural parts that wouldn't be included 

15

in an equal protection claim. 

16

 MR. THEOBALD: 

We believe, Your Honor, that 

17

those two cases are the second standard.  The Smith 

18

we  we agree with the standard in Smith.  We agree in 

19

the standard with Fitzgerald.  And the standard in 

20

Smith, what that case was about was the Education for 

21

All Handicapped Act, whether that Act precluded the use 

22

of 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the statutory claim, 

23

and whether it precluded 1983 constitutional claims. 

24

 And the Court in Smith v. Fitzgerald said 

25

that it did because there was no  the EHA, the

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

remedies and the procedures there was not for a de novo 

2

review in court, so the plaintiff's claim was precluded. 

3

We have no problem with the Smith standard. 

4

 But the Court also said, in Smith, that if 

5

there are matters that are offered to the children, the 

6

disability of the disabled children or their parents 

7

under the EHA that that doesn't cover, those things, if 

8

they're offered to parents and if they're offered in a 

9

discriminatory manner or denied for discrimination, 

10

those claims can be brought under the 1983 equal 

11

protection claims or under Section 504 of the 

12

Rehabilitation Act, the  the preexisting statutory 

13

claim. 

14

 So applying that to the ADA, there is no 

15

evidence that in passing the ADA, for covered 

16

individuals, that Congress intended to preclude the 

17

preexisting 1983 equal protection claim, so our second 

18

standard in our brief is the SmithFitzgerald standard. 

19

In Fitzgerald, the Court went further and explained, if 

20

the rights and protections of the statute that is 

21

seeking to be  precluding are different than the equal 

22

protection claim, then there is no preclusion. 

23

 And here, the rights and protections between 

24

the ADA and the equal protection through 1983 are 

25

vast  are vast.  There's different parties, there are

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
1

different defendants.  In the ADEA, the entity is the 

2

defendant.  In equal protection 1983, it's individuals. 

3

In the ADEA, all these exemptions of people that aren't 

4

covered, if somebody pursues a 1983 equal protection 

5

claim, there is no exemptions of individuals. 

6
7
8
9

 So to conclude, Your Honor, we adopt the 
Smith standard.  We have no problem with Smith. 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Counsel, I'm trying to 

trying to see how  how many of these arguments that 

10

you have made before us about why  why we can't get to 

11

12

made in your brief in opposition.  I mean, we  we 

13

don't like to dismiss a case as improvidently granted,

 MR. THEOBALD:

We could have done

of reasons why we shouldn't have taken it in the first

 MR. THEOBALD: 

We could have done a better

22

I apologize for that.  We did try to point out that

Mr. Levin was exempt.  We did say that and how, under

Fitzgerald, the exemptions formed the basis of an equal

protection claim.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. SCODRO 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS 
 MR. SCODRO: 

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 

Just a couple of quick points. 
 Justice Kagan, in answer to your question to 

19

my colleague, I am not aware of any cases, nor can I 

20

conceive of one, in which one would have an equal 

21

protection claim, but could not state a cause of action 

22

under the ADEA, and I think this Court's decision in 

23

Kimel makes clear that such a universe does not exist. 

24
25

 The question  in response to a question 
from Justice Sotomayor regarding the scope of the

48

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Seventh Circuit's decision below, proof positive that 

2

the Seventh Circuit was  was, in fact, announcing the 

3

sweeping rule that Respondent sought, is the fact that 

4

the Court departs openly from the  the law in other 

5

circuits.  So it was, in fact, they were creating, they 

6

were knowingly creating the split. 

7

 The only reference in the analysis portion 

8

of the case to the fact that there are exemptions for 

9

highlevel officials appears on page 33A 

10

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Can you tell me what the 

11

authority is for Congress to extinguish a right for a 

12

constitutional violation?  Meaning 

13

 MR. SCODRO: 

14

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Sure. 
 assume that 

15

someone  it was the question that Justice Alito asked 

16

you  someone under of the age of 40, someone who's not 

17

covered by any statute, someone who's part of an 

18

employer under 20, what would suggest to you in  in 

19

this statute that Congress intended to extinguish those 

20

people's rights? 

21

 MR. SCODRO: 

Sure, Your Honor.  There are 

22

really two parts to my answer.  The first is they 

23

they didn't.  It has been overstated what has not 

24

what has been exempted.  Our position is that nobody 

25

whose Section 1983 claims are  would be displaced

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would not, in exchange, receive the full rights and 

2

benefits under the ADEA.  There is a reference to 

3
4
5

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I'm sorry.  Restate that 

again, so I understand what you are saying. 
 MR. SCODRO: 

Of course.  Nobody who  the 

6

universe of  of employees  or workers, to use the 

7

neutral term here  the universe of workers who would 

8

not have a Section 1983 claim under the State's theory, 

9

that every member of that universe would have a right to 

10

bring a claim under the Equal Protection Clause. 

11

 The under40s, we agree  as we say in our 

12

brief, we agree that under 40, that was not the social 

13

ill that Congress was addressing in the Age 

14

Discrimination Act, consistent with this Court's holding 

15

in Cline; and therefore, those individuals retain their 

16

right, the small workplace, the under 20.  The EEOC 

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

18

 MR. SCODRO: 

19

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

20

Yes. 

 MR. SCODRO:

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24
25

 would people who are 

executive officers, et cetera, absent the GERA 

21

23

Absent the GERA 

Yes. 
 would they have 

retained a constitutional right? 
 MR. SCODRO: 

They would.  We do not  we 

we understand the displacement doctrine and  and

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

certainly, as applied here, it would displace the 1983 

2

remedies.  We assume that courts retain their inherent 

3

authority to use equitable power to stop the ongoing 

4

violation of the Constitution.  And 

5

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Mr. Scodro, you are in a 

6

situation where the question is not whether the remedial 

7

scheme displaces a 1983 suit brought for a violation of 

8

the same statute that contains the remedial scheme. 

9

Instead, you have to argue that this remedial scheme 

10

displaces a preexisting statutory or constitutional 

11

right.  And when we've had that situation in the past, 

12

we've looked to more than just the remedial scheme 

13

itself. 

14

 You know, Smith looks to the language of the 

15

statute, which refers to constitutional claims.  It 

16

looks to legislative history.  It looks to the 

17

coincidence between the statute  the new statutory 

18

claim and the old constitutional claim.  And it seems to 

19

me that you don't have any of those things. 

20

 All you have is a complicated remedial

scheme, which would be enough to say, look, you can't 

22

bring 1983 suits to vindicate this statute.  But seems 

23

as though it's not enough under our case law to repeal 

24

preexisting rights and remedies. 

25

 MR. SCODRO: 

Your Honor, Smith  as we

1

understand Smith, and certainly, as it's been read by 

2

Rancho Palos Verdes in Fitzgerald, even, it stands for 

3

the proposition that the lodestar inquiry  and I think 

4

the word "primary emphasis" or that phrase may be used 

5

in Fitzgerald to describe the comprehensiveness of the 

6

regime as the first and most important inquiry. 

7

 After that, Smith makes clear that we are 

8

allowed to consider if there is a comprehensive regime, 

9

whether there is contrary evidence in the face of the 

10

legislative history, as there is, for example, for 

11

Title VII, not so for the ADEA. 

12

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But why  if the ADEA is 

13

expanding the Civil Rights protection against age 

14

discrimination much more generous to the employee, isn't 

15

it strange to think that Congress, at the same time, 

16

wanted employees to have these expanded rights and to do 

17

away with the preexisting remedy? 

18

 MR. SCODRO: 

19

 When Congress provided the expanded right, 

No, Your Honor, not at all. 

20

they recognized that there were characteristics 

21

particular to age discrimination that warranted very low 

22

damages awards and a procedural predicate that would 

23

emphasize swift and informal dispute resolution. 

24

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

25

 MR. SCODRO: 

Thank you.

52
