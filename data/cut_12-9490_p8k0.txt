 P R O C E E D I N G S 
 (1:00 p.m.) 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

We'll hear argument 

in Case 129490, Navarette v. California. 

5

 Mr. Kleven. 

6

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN, 

7
8

 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS, 
 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 

9

 MR. KLEVEN: 

10

please the Court: 

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

 In this case, the Court should hold that 

12

officers acting on anonymous tips must corroborate the 

13

tips' assertions of illegal conduct, as well as the 

14

identifying details before making a stop, whether that 

15

tip involves erratic driving, illegal gun possession, or 

16

any other allegation of misconduct. 

17

 Now, the State proposes that the reasonable 

18

suspicion rule in established in Terry v. Ohio, which 

19

courts and law enforcement officials have been applying 

20

now for more than 40 years, should be altered so that, 

21

now, it applies as a sliding scale where the level of 

22

suspicion varies depending on the nature of the crime 

23

that an anonymous tipster claims someone has committed. 

24
25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So if the tip  so 

if the tip is, is this car is driving by and throwing

3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bombs out the window, okay, every  you know, whatever, 

2

500 yards, the police find the car, they have to wait 

3

until they see the person actually throw a bomb out the 

4

window themselves, before pulling them over? 

5

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, Your Honor, in terms of 

6

the reasonable suspicion, yes.  If there  if all they 

7

have is an anonymous tip and there is no  they have no 

8

way of corroborating any of the  any of the innocent 

9

details, except that they can identify the car, then, 

10
11

yes, under 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So your answer is 

12

yes, the car is going there, and he's throwing a bomb 

13

out, and it goes off, but he has to wait till he sees 

14

them throw out another bomb? 

15

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Your Honor, under the 

16

FloridaJ.L., the Court has said that when they are 

17

looking  when all that they are able to corroborate 

18

are obvious reasonably observable details, such as that, 

19

then there is no basis for the Court to go beyond 

20

that  and 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

I thought that  that 

22

J.L. gave an example of an exception that the report is 

23

somebody is carrying a bomb? 

24
25

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, there is that exception, 

Your Honor.  And in FloridaJ.L, it said that it was

4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not  the Court said that it was not required on the 

2

facts of that case to speculate about a situation where 

3

such a serious danger 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Throwing bombs doesn't 

5

count, but carrying a bomb does, is that it?  Were they 

6

throwing bombs that they weren't carrying? 

7

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Your Honor, that would not make 

8

a difference.  However, in this case, in terms of 

9

adjusting the reasonable suspicion standard, the Court 

10
11

should not address that.  The Court has never said 
 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Excuse me.  I'm sorry. 

12

Could I ask you what you mean by an "anonymous tip"? 

13

Suppose somebody calls up 911 and gives a name?  Does 

14

that make it not an anonymous tip? 

15

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Your Honor, technically, it 

16

would not be, but in the circumstances here, I think it 

17

should be treated as an anonymous tip because, again, 

18

the name could be false when the tip first comes in.  If 

19

it's corroborated in some way, then 

20

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how would you 

21

corroborate it?  Let's say the person calls up and gives 

22

a name and gives an address?  So what would be 

23

necessary?  What would the police have to do then before 

24

they could stop the vehicle, other than observing the 

25

vehicle do something illegal?

5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well again, if all they have is an 

2

assertion by the  by the tipster that this is the name 

3

and the address, and if the officers can somehow, again, 

4

by caller identification or some other method verify 

5

that, in fact, that is the person so that, somewhere 

6

down the line, that person will be  will be held 

7

accountable for a false tip, then it can be treated 

8

differently. 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, what if you 

10

have caller ID.  I mean, you have one of these anonymous 

11

flip phones, right?  You can buy them, it's prepaid. 

12

You call up and say, I'm  you know, John Smith, I've 

13

seen this, and they look, there's the caller, there's 

14

the number. 

15

 Then they can do it. 

16

 MR. KLEVEN: 

No, Your Honor.  That would not If all they 

17

have is a number, then they are not going to be able to 

18

use that as a basis for 

19
20
21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, isn't that all 

caller ID gives you? 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, with caller ID, if they 

22

are somehow able to verify, not just that this is coming 

23

from this phone, but that, in fact, there's a particular 

24

person there, if they can identify the location, that 

25

sort of thing.  As the  as the tip gets more and more

6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

like the known informant in the Adams case, then the court

2

officers can take more solace in the fact that that 

3

person is going to be able to be held responsible. 

4

 In Adams, of course, there's a situation 

5

where there is a known informant who can be arrested 

6

immediately if, in fact, the tip turns out to be false. 

7

The problem with so many of these cases, with the 911 

8

tape  911 caller, is that even if  is that there's 

9

not going to be any sort of accountability even if they 

10

do manage to identify the person in terms of showing the 

11

tip is false where the allegation, for example, is 

12

weaving. 

13

 There's no way to prove that that 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

If we transport the standard 

15

that applies outside of the vehicle context to this 

16

context, what would happen in this situation?  A person 

17

calls up and says, this is my name, this is my address 

18

and it's  it's not blocked by caller ID, so the 911 

19

operator can see that that's the name, that's the 

20

address. 

21

 The person says, this guy ran me off the 

22

road.  The police find the vehicle.  They drive behind 

23

the vehicle for a while.  They don't  they don't see 

24

any  they don't see any violation.  So then they 

25

think, well, this guy must have lied.

7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 So are they going to prosecute the guy for 
calling  calling that in? 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

No, Your Honor, because still 

4

they wouldn't be able to prosecute them because the fact 

5

that the vehicle is now not weaving doesn't show that 

6

they were  that it was or was not weaving 

7

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

I mean, your argument goes 

8

well beyond.  You're saying this has to do with 

9

anonymous tips, but it really goes well beyond anonymous 

10

tips.  It covers tips where you know exactly who called 

11

in, and what you're saying is that they really can never 

12

stop a vehicle no matter what kind of a tip they get, 

13

unless they see the vehicle committing an illegal act. 

14

That's the argument. 

15

 MR. KLEVEN: 

No, Your Honor.  I'm sorry. 

16

No, I don't think it goes that far, Your Honor.  I think 

17

as the tip becomes  as the tip contains more detail 

18

and as the tipster becomes more accountable for a false 

19

tip, again, getting more over toward the Adams v. 

20

Kennedy, then, at some point, the anonymous tip would be 

21

or that the tip 

22

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, give me an example of a 

23

situation in which the police can pull somebody over 

24

after receiving a tip without actually seeing the 

25

vehicle commit an illegal act?

8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KLEVEN: 

I think, Your Honor, in a 

2

situation where the caller calls in, says I'm  I've 

3

been  this car is driving erratically.  The caller 

4

then says, I'm following the car.  Now, we're at 

5

suchandsuch a location.  The vehicle has just done 

6

something else that's wrong. 

7

 And they continue to follow up to the point 

8

where, okay, I can now see the  the patrol car coming 

9

up, again, where the tipster is putting his or her 

10

credibility on the line and becomes more and more 

11

accountable towards the Adams v. Kennedy known 

12

informant, then if you add that together under the 

13

totality of the circumstances, then you will have a 

14

situation probably to do it. 

15

 I think it's going to be rare, and I think 

16

it should be rare because it is so easy  as the Court 

17

has indicated, the Court has shown skepticism for 

18

anonymous tips because the tipsters are able to harass 

19

other people without running any risk of being held 

20

accountable. 

21

 And it should be particularly skeptical in 

22

the case of anonymous tips about erratic driving 

23

because, with the ubiquitous cell phones, it's so easy 

24

for somebody who's on the road, who's been annoyed by 

25

somebody else, to just pull out the cell phone and call

9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in a false tip. 

2

 And so 

3

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Do we have any 

4

indication that this is a serious problem?  The false 

5

tips? 

6

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, there's no empirical 

7

evidence in the record.  However, it was the same 

8

concern that led the Court, in J.L., to refuse to adopt 

9

the firearm exception, the concern that making it so 

10

easy for people to subject others to the harassment of 

11

a  of a stop and  and potential  potential search 

12

concerned the Court enough that it denied  it refused 

13

to adopt the firearm exception. 

14

 And in this case, we have a firearm 

15

exception  we have an exception that's being requested 

16

that's doctrinally the same as a firearm exception. 

17

There is there is no indication in the record that drunk 

18

driving on its own, in totality, presents a more serious 

19

threat to public safety than  than firearms do. 

20

 In fact, it 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, is that  is 

22

that true?  I mean, how many people die from drunk 

23

driving versus how many people drydie from firearms? 

24
25

 MR. KLEVEN: 

The most recent  the most 

recent statistics show a little more, about 11,000

10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

people die from homicides by firearms, and it's usually 

2

under 10,000 now that are driving  dying by drunk 

3

driving. 

4

 And in terms of public safety, approximately 

5

twothirds of the people who die as a result of drunk 

6

driving are the drunk drivers themselves.  So, in fact, 

7

the overall threat to public safety is not as great when 

8

you're talking about drunk driving as  as with 

9

firearms. 

10

 And the Court indicated, in J.L., that it 

11

was specifically concerned about the serious threat that 

12

armed criminals pose to public safety, and, despite that 

13

serious threat, they denied  the Court denied the 

14

firearms exception. 

15

 Now, what the  excuse me. 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I was just going to 

17

say, we have held that the  the standards are loosened 

18

in the vehicle context because your expectation of 

19

privacy is diminished when you're out on the road 

20

driving along in  in a vehicle.  Does that have any 

21

pertinence? 

22

 MR. KLEVEN: 

I don't think so in this case, 

23

Your Honor, because even though it's diminished as 

24

opposed to, for example, in the home, it's  in J.L., 

25

of course, the person was on a public sidewalk; the

11

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

person was not in the home. 

2

 And in  in Prouse, the Court talked about 

3

the fact that, in modern day times, people  a lot of 

4

people will feel more of a sense of security, they'll 

5

feel more privacy in a vehicle than they would out on 

6

the street. 

7

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But in the context in which 

8

we've approved sobriety checkpoints, why should we get 

9

bent out of shape over this? 

10

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, Your Honor, in the 

11

sobriety checkpoint case, the Court has looked at the 

12

intrusion and found that to be at the very rock bottom 

13

in terms of intrusion, the fact that somebody is 

14

along with a number of other people, that they have to 

15

submit to a brief stop, it has put that on the lowest 

16

on the lowest level. 

17

 And so it's a  the Court has not approved 

18

any situation where individual vehicles, as in this 

19

case, are pulled over without reasonable suspicion that, 

20

in fact, somebody in that vehicle is engaged in  in 

21

criminal activity. 

22

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, but why is that an 

23

important line?  Why should we be more concerned when an 

24

individual automobile is pulled over? 

25

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, because the  the

12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

intrusion is greater, Your Honor.  And the 

2

MartinezFuentes case and the BrignoniPonce case, the 

3

Court talked about the very minimal intrusion of the 

4

checkpoints, as opposed to  and Prouse talks about 

5

this also, that there is a serious intrusion when 

6

somebody is pulled over. 

7

 You have the activation of the emergency 

8

lights, you have a siren, you're pulled over, possibly, 

9

in a neighborhood where  where you're known and people 

10

see it, possibly out in the middle of a road in the 

11

middle of the night as in the  the Wells case.  And in 

12

either circumstance, it is a serious intrusion and one 

13

that people are not going to take that lightly.  So 

14

it's  it's a different situation. 

15

 And the Court, again, if they're going to be 

16

pulling over individual cars, signaling them out for 

17

for stops which could, under the Court's rules, again, 

18

the driver, all the passengers can be ordered out of the 

19

car if  if the Terry standards are met. 

20

 They can 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

White suggested that we 

22

don't have an absolute rule with respect to requiring 

23

independent corroboration of the actual illegal conduct. 

24

In White, the  the tipster gave future predictive 

25

information, but all of it was innocent, somebody

13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

driving a car and going to a particular place. 

2

 Now, you're asking us to import that 

3

wholesale.  Why don't we just stick to our general 

4

standard, which is the totality of the circumstances, 

5

and look at what failure there is in the logic of the 

6

California court below.  It  it looked at the quality 

7

of the information regarding the vehicle, which is a 

8

legitimate tipster will tell you what the vehicle looks 

9

like and its license plate or enough information so it 

10
11

can be identified. 
 It looked at the caller actually witnessing 

12

the event and giving you enough detail to know that it's 

13

not a legal conclusion, but an actual event that 

14

suggests recklessness, and a corroboration of the  of 

15

the details given by the tipster. 

16
17
18
19
20

 Isn't that the application of our 
traditional test? 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

No, Your Honor.  And that's 

exactly what the court was looking at in Florida J.L.v. J.L. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, that's just not 

21

true in Florida v. J.L. because the individual didn't 

22

match the description completely, and there were two or 

23

three individuals there, not just one, and so  and 

24

there was no predictive or no other detail, other than 

25

someone in this general area.

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, there was no predictive 

2

detail, but in J.L., the tip was young black male in a 

3

plaid shirt at a bus stop.  Those details were 

4

confirmed. 

5

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Correct me if  if I'm 

6

wrong.  I might be missing something.  The tip in J.L. 

7

was not a  did not assert that a crime was being 

8

committed, so there was something suspicious.  There was 

9

no crime in possession of the gun.  Or correct me if I'm 

10
11
12
13

wrong. 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, it was  it was 

Possession of the gun 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but here  here, 

14

there was  the report was a crime.  Or is that not a 

15

correct distinction? 

16

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, in  in J.L., they 

17

didn't say illegal gun possession, but presumably, the 

18

tipster thought it was an illegal gun possession, and 

19

the officer must have thought it was illegal gun 

20

possession. 

21

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. KLEVEN: 

24

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

25

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well 
And it was illegal. 
What? 
It was illegal. 
Oh, it was because he turned

15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

out to be under 21. 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

But  but the tip, in and 

3

of itself, did not indicate that a crime was being 

4

committed, which is different from this case. 

5
6
7
8
9

 MR. KLEVEN: 

I'll agree that the tipster 

didn't say it, but I think the assumption 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

No, I'm talking about an 

interpretation of what the tip said. 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well  unless  unless 

10

the  the implication is that the gun possession is 

11

illegal, then there's no reason for the officer to 

12

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

13

 MR. KLEVEN: 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

15

for a Terry stop. 

16

 MR. KLEVEN: 

No, a Terry stop. 
Hmm? 
You might have had grounds 

But if  if the tip calls 

17

if the tips says, I'm looking at a case of gun 

18

possession that, as far as I know, is perfectly legal, 

19

it's like, in this case, if the tip came in and said, 

20

I've just been passed by a car whose  which was driven 

21

very skillfully, there's no point in  in pursuing the 

22

tip in J.L., unless there's some  some element of 

23

illegality. 

24
25

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, I  I think there's 

a difference, but I think, for our purposes, we can

16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

assume that the cases are comparable in that respect 

2

 MR. KLEVEN: 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

4

Okay. 
 but not comparable, 

perhaps, in others. 

5

 MR. KLEVEN: 

6

 Justice Sotomayor, going back to  to 

Okay. 

7

your concern, so in Florida v. J.L., those elements 

8

were  were confirmed and  but the Court found that 

9

the fact that those elements which could be observable 

10

by anybody who was looking at the situation and probably 

11

even more clearly an observation where the plaid shirt 

12

was identified, that that didn't give any reason to 

13

believe that the person was also being truthful in 

14

talking about concealment. 

15
16

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 
caller had personal knowledge. 

17

 MR. KLEVEN: 

18

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

19

No reason to believe the 

Pardon me? 
No reason to believe the 

person had personal knowledge. 

20

 MR. KLEVEN: 

21

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Well, but personal knowledge 
He didn't say that the 

22

gun was pulled on him or that  or how he saw it or how 

23

he knew. 

24
25

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Right.  There was no indication 

as to how the person knew about the gun.

17

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

So you don't think 

2

there's something significant about calling up and 

3

saying, someone forced me off the road? 

4

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, there is something 

5

significant, Your Honor.  But, by itself, that just 

6

gives the officers some reason to go check and see 

7

whether, in fact, there's a chance to corroborate. 

8

 In the case of an inebriated driver, the 

9

fact that the driver is inebriated is concealed in the 

10

same way that J.L.'s gun was, unless there's some sort 

11

of erratic driving going on. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What if there's no 

13

way for the officer to corroborate the allegation?  You 

14

know, you see  see somebody on the street grab a young 

15

child, throw her in the trunk of the car, and then take 

16

off. 

17

 And somebody calls with an anonymous tip 

18

saying, this fellow  you know, in this car, has got a 

19

child in the trunk.  The police can follow the person 

20

you know, for hours and they're not going to see any 

21

corroborating evidence. 

22

 Can they pull that car over? 

23

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, Your Honor, if  if 

24

that's all they have to go on, then, under Florida v. 

25

J.L., they would not 

18

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So just  your 

2

answer in that case is that the police cannot pull that 

3

car over? 

4

 MR. KLEVEN: 

If  in terms of  obviously, 

5

it's a more serious situation, but the Court has not 

6

held that the seriousness 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, let's expand 

8

it a little bit.  It's a  it's a onelane  twolane 

9

road going down, but it merges into  you know, an 

10

eightlane expressway.  You have one police car.  It's 

11

going to be hard for that police car to maintain 

12

surveillance.  And you say they've just got to let them 

13

go. 

14

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, Your Honor, if you're 

15

talking in terms of just the seriousness and you're 

16

looking in terms of the Florida v. J.L. exception, the 

17

Court seemed to be indicating, in that case, that there 

18

would be a danger that was so extreme where the Court 

19

would find a search or a stop justified without any 

20

showing of 

21

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, just in terms 

22

of your position, do you think they could pull the car 

23

over? 

24
25

 MR. KLEVEN: 

No, Your Honor.  I don't think 

it would change.

19

Alderson Reporting Company

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

2

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Really?  Okay. 

Because, again, it's just 

3

the  the seriousness of the claim should not affect 

4

whether there is, in fact, reasonable suspicion. 

5
6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

consistency.  I'm  I'm not sure about common sense. 

7

 (Laughter.) 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

You get an A for 

I'm  I'm not sure he gets 

an A for consistency.  I thought  I thought you said 

10

you acknowledged or didn't repudiate the statement in 

11

in our opinion in J.L., that, if there was a bomb in the 

12

car, that would be something else. 

13

 What  what if there's in the car  the 

14

tip is this person has an atomic bomb given him by Al 

15

Qaeda; he is driving it into the center of Los Angeles 

16

to  to eradicate the entire city, okay? 

17

 Let it go? 

18

 MR. KLEVEN: 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

20
21

Your Honor, I believe 
He tells you the license 

number, where the car is.  You can't stop the car? 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

I believe, consistent with what 

22

the court said in Florida v. J.L., that may be a 

23

situation, again, where the Court decides that  that 

24

the risk is so great 

25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

So you see, he's not

20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consistent.  I mean 

2

 MR. KLEVEN: 

No, but it would not be  it 

3

should not change  it should not be in terms of the 

4

level of suspicion required under  under Terry.  The 

5

reasonable suspicion standard should not change on that. 

6

The Court seemed to be indicating, in Florida v. J.L., 

7

that at some point, the level of danger becomes so great 

8

that, in fact, there was 

9

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So the  the atomic 

10

bomb, the level of danger is great enough, but the young 

11

girl in the trunk, the level of danger is not great 

12

enough? 

13

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Your Honor, what I'm saying, in 

14

either of those situations, the Court may want to 

15

consider some sort of exception to the reasonable 

16

suspicion standard and that seems to be 

17

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What is your position what 

18

you would do if you were on this Court, with those 

19

hypotheticals?  What is your position that should happen 

20

in those two hypotheticals? 

21
22
23
24
25

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, Your Honor, I think that 

the Court may well want to  to craft some 
 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

What is your position as 

to what the Court should do in those cases? 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, let me start off by

21

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

saying, if I could, that I don't think the Court needs 

2

to reach that question in this case, just as it did not 

3

need to reach that question in J.L. 

4
5
6

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

I understand it, but we're 

interested in a hypothetical. 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

Right.  Your Honor, I believe 

7

that, again, I don't know what particular doctrine the 

8

Court would  would choose, but I think that probably 

9

the Court could find some  some doctrine that would 

10
11

allow it, in that circumstance, to find it. 
 But it shouldn't be  it shouldn't be 

12

moving toward the sliding scale element in  that 

13

that we're talking about. 

14

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

What about this:  In J.L., 

15

the Court made quite a point of saying, "An accurate 

16

description of a subject's readily observable location 

17

is reliable in a limited  limited sense, namely, 

18

identifying the person.  Such a tip, however, does not 

19

show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed 

20

criminal activity." 

21

 MR. KLEVEN: 

22

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

23

That's right. 
All right.  Not concealed 

here. 

24

 MR. KLEVEN: 

25

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

I mean 
So that's an obvious

22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

difference.  I mean, one case, it was concealed; this 

2

case, it isn't concealed.  What do you say? 

3

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Oh, but, except, Your Honor, that, in 

4

fact, when we're talking about drunk driving, whether 

5

the person is inebriated or not 

6

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Didn't  didn't the tip 

7

here have something to do with his driving around in a 

8

wild way  or at least an unusual way?  I'm not sure I 

9

would have followed him, if it had been me.  Anyway, you 

10
11

see the point. 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

Right.  But the question is, 

12

Your Honor, is the person inebriated or not, to take 

13

the  the State's best example.  And that  that 

14

issue, that is a concealed element of criminal behavior, 

15

unless the person is actually driving erratically. 

16

 If the person is driving erratically when 

17

the officers appear, then there's no Fourth Amendment 

18

issue, and it's clear that they have either reasonable 

19

suspicion or probable cause to pull over the vehicle. 

20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

It seems to me you're 

21

willing to accept our allowing  or allowing the police 

22

to stop the car with the atom bomb and even allowing the 

23

police to stop the car with the kidnapped girl in the 

24

trunk. 

25

 Once  you know, once you give away those,

23

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we're just arguing about details, where you draw the 

2

line.  Does  does drunken driving fall on one side or 

3

the other of the line, and some of us may think drunken 

4

driving is  is pretty serious and probably  you 

5

know, as serious as having a kidnapped girl in the 

6

trunk. 

7

 MR. KLEVEN: 

And, Your Honor, I didn't mean 

8

to concede that the Court should  should reduce the 

9

level of suspicion for reasonable suspicion in order to 

10
11

do that 
 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  More than that, I 

12

want you to say the Court shouldn't.  Let the car go. 

13

Byebye, Los Angeles.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

grade for consistency depends on this answer.

 MR. KLEVEN: 

18

 JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

In this case, your  your 

Excuse me? 
Your grade for consistency 

depends on this answer. 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

What I'm saying, Your Honors, 

21

is the State is arguing for a sliding scale that changes 

22

things.  The Court postulated, in Florida v. J.L., a 

23

situation that was so extreme, that was so unique, that 

24

the Court might decide to address it without even 

25

getting into reasonable suspicion.

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

But  that's why I asked 

2

you, and I pressed the point a little bit, because in 

3

the beginning of your brief, it says that the anonymous 

4

tip, what did you say, indicated that a Ford F150 

5

pickup truck had run someone off the road. 

6

 MR. KLEVEN: 

7

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

That's right. 
Now, maybe you do have to be 

8

known specially whether the person's drunk or not, but 

9

you don't have to have some special knowledge of 

10

anything concealed to know if somebody has run somebody 

11

off the road. 

12
13
14

 MR. KLEVEN: 

But, Your Honor, the  the 

idea of running off the road is concealed 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Even if the person weren't 

15

drunk, I think it's illegal to run someone else off the 

16

road. 

17

 (Laughter.) 

18

 MR. KLEVEN: 

19

I'm not disagreeing with Your 

Honor. 

20

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

21

 MR. KLEVEN: 

No. 
What I'm saying is that, unless 

22

the person is still driving erratically by the time that 

23

the officers arrive, then that activity is concealed in 

24

the same way that the question of whether J.L. had a gun 

25

or not was concealed.  You can't  the officers can't

25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

see it, and, therefore, there's no reason to treat this 

2

case any differently than the case in J.L. 

3

 They have to be able to see something like 

4

erratic driving or something else, in order to be able 

5

to corroborate that. 

6

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And I assume you would 

7

you would also say, to tie it into Justice Breyer's 

8

question, you would also say that that tip, "Somebody 

9

ran me off the road," would not justify the court  the 

10

police in stopping the car, just to make sure that this 

11

car was not the one that drove the guy off the road, 

12

right? 

13

 MR. KLEVEN: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That's right, Your Honor. 
Never mind drunkenness. 

15

The tip doesn't say anything about drunkenness.  It just 

16

said, this car drove me off the road.  You'd say the 

17

police could not follow that car, pull him over, and 

18

and ask did you  did you drive somebody off the road? 

19

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Your Honor, absolutely, the 

20

police can follow that car, and that's what they should 

21

do.  And, in fact, that's what they did here.  In this 

22

case, there was a 

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Following the car is going 

24

to do them no good as to whether he drove  drove 

25

somebody off the road.  They're not looking for a drunk.

26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

They're looking for somebody who drove somebody off the 

2

road, right? 

3

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Right.  If they can't see any 

4

erratic driving still going on, then where is it going 

5

to go?  They're not going to prosecute for the reckless 

6

driving that allegedly took place 19 miles away, and 

7

they have followed that car for an additional

admitted it, you know.

They could if the guy 

Other than that, Your Honor 
They could play Mutt and 

Jeff with him and he  oh, yeah, I did, yes. 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

But, Your Honor, the  the 

14

person who's making the claim is  is nowhere to be 

15

found.  She's gone.  There's  there's nowhere there. 

16

So there's no additional investigation 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, but you 

18

what if  what if the person said, okay, my name is 

19

this  you know, my phone number is this; this guy 

20

drove me off the road.  They can't corroborate that 

21

until they stop the guy.  Or you're saying they have to? 

22

They have to wait, they have to make the call, see if 

23

the guy is there.  Are you the guy that just called?  So 

24

that guy's got to talk on his cell phone while he's 

25

driving.

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, what I'm saying is, yes,

they have to verify in some way so that they have some

 ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY M.K. LAURENCE 

10
11
12
13

Thank you, counsel. 

 ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

please the Court: 
 A police officer may act on an anonymous tip 

14

that reports reckless or drunk driving by immediately 

15

stopping the vehicle, without waiting to personally 

16

observe dangerous driving that could threaten others. 

17

 An officer can reasonably rely on such a tip 

18

because the importance of the governmental interest in 

19

protecting the public from the ongoing and immediate 

20

threat of drunk driving outweighs the minimal intrusion 

21

of a traffic stop. 

22

 Now, Petitioners argue that  

23

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

24
25

Is every reckless 

driving drunk driving? 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

I'm sorry?

28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Is every reckless 

driving drunk driving? 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

Not every reckless driving is 

4

drunk driving.  But a report of reckless driving gives 

5

reasonable suspicion that the person may be drunk, and 

6

that's sufficient for the stop in this case. 

7

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

How about if somebody 

8

just calls and says, X vehicle is driving recklessly, 

9

says no more, doesn't describe how, doesn't give you any 

10

details as to how they know it.  Is that enough for 

11

reasonable suspicion? 

12

 MR. LAURENCE: 

I would say that the term 

13

"reckless" is.  And the reason I say that is because 

14

driving is something that's intimately familiar to the 

15

average citizen.  And when a citizen is going to call in 

16

and make a report, when they use the language 

17

"reckless," that has meaning.  That describes a behavior 

18

that poses an ongoing threat to the public. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

But not necessarily 

20

drunkenness.  I think there  there are a lot of people 

21

that get tickets for reckless driving who have not 

22

served jail terms for driving drunk.  The two are far 

23

from synonymous. 

24
25

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I wouldn't say they're 

synonymous, but I would say that one is the indicator of

29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2
3
4
5
6

the other because while you can 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Why?  How about 

speeding?  There's plenty of people who speed regularly. 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

I would say a report of 

speeding is not sufficient to have reasonable suspicion. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Isn't that reckless 

7

behavior?  So how do you know someone who calls  my 

8

mother, who can't drive above 50, thinks that, when I go 

9

51, that I'm speeding and reckless. 

10

 MR. LAURENCE: 

I would say that, once again, 

11

the public has lots of familiarity with driving, and 

12

they can recognize the difference between poor driving 

13

and reckless driving, or something, or drunk driving. 

14

And when people are going to pick up the phone and make 

15

that call to 911, they're doing so because they perceive 

16

a danger on the roadway. 

17

 And I think while the statistics are sparse 

18

on this, the footnote 2 in the government's brief is 

19

particularly helpful in this regard, in that they note 

20

that for calls that are made to 911 centers for  that 

21

are tracked by the States, between 25 and 50 percent of 

22

those calls result in arrests.  And what that shows is 

23

that the public knows what they see when they make these 

24

calls. 

25

 This is a far 

30

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

And  and between the, 

2

what, 50 and 75 percent, they've stopped people without 

3

just cause. 

4

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Yes, but we are talking about 

5

reasonable suspicion.  So it doesn't require certainty 

6

or probability. 

7
8
9

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Or they've  they've 

troubled people who shouldn't have been troubled. 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

That is correct.  And that is 

10

always a possibility in the reasonable suspicion 

11

context. 

12

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What  what if the 

13

call is  you know, I'm driving, this guy just drove by 

14

me, I looked over, he didn't have his seatbelt on.  I 

15

mean, can the police pull that guy over? 

16

 MR. LAURENCE: 

No, I don't believe that 

17

would be sufficient to pull him over because you don't 

18

have any governmental  you don't have a threat to 

19

public safety in that context. 

20

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well yeah, there are laws 

21

against driving without a seatbelt because that protects 

22

people's lives. 

23

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Certainly, there are laws, 

24

and the officer, I guess, would have reasonable 

25

suspicion that there is a traffic violation, but I don't

31

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

know that it would rise to the level of implicating 

2

public safety in this context. 

3

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well, reckless driving 

4

always does, whether it  whether it's the consequence 

5

of inebriation or not. 

6

 MR. LAURENCE: 

7

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
So a simple call saying, 

8

boy, this guy  you know, he cut in, in front of me. 

9

He's changing lanes too frequently 

10

 MR. LAURENCE: 

11

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yes. 
 that  that enables the 

12

policeman, without observing any of that reckless 

13

driving, to stop the car further down the road. 

14

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Yes.  And provided, of 

15

course, that you have the additional details of the 

16

description of the car, the location, that you can 

17

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

I've never 

18

understood  what good do those  you know, let's say 

19

that I'm at a party, I don't like somebody there.  I see 

20

they have a couple of drinks.  I know what kind of car 

21

he drives.  I know the  I can look at the license 

22

plate. 

23

 I call  you know, ten minutes later. 

24

know where he goes driving home.  There's this car. 

25

It's a white whatever.  It's got this license plate.

Whether he is or 

4

not, the police go up, they pull him over and find out, 

5

yeah  you know, he fails the breathalyzer, and I 

6

get my revenge. 

7

 MR. LAURENCE: 

The importance of those 

8

details is that they allow the officers to confirm that 

9

this is a personal observation, which is an important 

10

fact that's noted in Gates, that when you have a report 

11

of personal observation of illegal conduct, we can take 

12

that report more seriously. 

13
14

 It's entitled to more credibility than just 
a bare 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

My question 
I was just going to 

17

say my point is it need not necessarily be a personal 

18

observation of the person operating the car.  It may be 

19

prior knowledge.  And I gather one of the issues we're 

20

concerned about is people using this to  you know, 

21

exact revenge or  or do something else having nothing 

22

to do with whether or not the person is violating the 

23

law on the highway. 

24

 MR. LAURENCE: 

25

Yes, that is true.  But if 

the personal knowledge  if the officer can use that

33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

personal knowledge to confirm, okay, he was correct 

2

about the report of the car, report of the location, 

3

report of the direction where it's supposed to be going, 

4

then you have some indication that the personal 

5

knowledge is accurate, as opposed to a bare tip when 

6

you're talking about hidden conduct, then you have to 

7

look to predicted details. 

8
9
10

 And that takes us into the J.L. context or 
the 
 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

If I understand you 

11

correctly, as long as you can identify the car, you need 

12

no specificity as to what the car has actually done.  In 

13

other words  you know, just saying the driver was 

14

reckless is enough.  Is that  is that correct? 

15

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I would say that 

16

recklessness carries information that is  has some 

17

specificity. 

18

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

19

 MR. LAURENCE: 

What would fail your test? 
Well, if a caller calls in 

20

and says, I saw him in a bar, he had one drink, he came 

21

out and got on the road and went away.  One drink is not 

22

going to rise to the level 

23

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Yes.  But you're just 

24

saying  I mean, but his basic point is, on the other 

25

side, is these are all variations of the famous white

34

Alderson Reporting Company

horse defense.  You don't know the  the white horse 

2

defense?  Your Honor, my client was innocent because, at 

3

the time of the crime, he was in Yugoslavia wearing a 

4

white horse  riding a white horse. 

5

 And to prove it, I have the horse here in 

6

court.  You see?  I mean, you can't  it's 

7

bootstrapping to put it more succinctly.  All you know 

8

is that somebody came in and quoted  and said there 

9

was a crime.  And that's all you know.  And now  now 

10

when  when are instances where no more than the report 

11

that it's a crime, that's reasonable suspicion. 

12
13

 That's  give me some other instances where 
the courts have upheld, well, that's enough. 

14

 MR. LAURENCE: 

15

 JUSTICE BREYER: 

16

 (Laughter.) 

18

 MR. LAURENCE: 

20

I'm not saying common 

sense.  I'm saying what the courts have held.  Sorry. 

17

19

Well, if a caller says 

Where the courts have upheld 

based on just a bare tip or 
 JUSTICE BREYER: 

Not a bare, a 

21

description that a crime is occurring, where has 

22

that's all, I mean, and  and then we have a question 

23

of, well, is it in the one category or the other? 

24

Because what we have here, someone phones in and says, a 

25

crime is occurring.

35

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 And  and we know, we've corroborated the 

2

following.  If a crime was occurring, he was in a 

3

position to know because he can define  he can talk 

4

about the white horse, or he can talk about the car. 

5

 MR. LAURENCE: 

The closest case I can think 

6

of is Hensley, where an officer was relying on an arrest 

7

bulletin from another jurisdiction.  And in that case, 

8

United States v. Hensley, in that case, the court did 

9

consider, for purposes of whether a prior crime had been 

10

committed, whether the officer had reasonable suspicion 

11

to stop that individual, it took into account the nature 

12

of the offense and whether there's a current threat to 

13

public safety. 

14

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Well, correct me if I'm 

15

wrong, but my recollection of Hensley is, you're right, 

16

the police department 1 notifies police department 2. 

17

But a premise of the case, I had thought, was that 

18

police department 1 had reasonable suspicion. 

19

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, there were two parts to 

20

the  to the case.  The second  the first part was 

21

whether you could make a detention based on a prior 

22

crime, as opposed to current  an immediate occurring 

23

crime. 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

 MR. LAURENCE: 

I understand that. 
And so it looked to the

36

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

nature of the crime and whether there was threat to 

2

public safety is a validation consideration in 

3

authorizing a stop for a prior offense. 

4

 The second part of that was the  allowing 

5

the officer to rely on another jurisdiction 

6

is reasonable

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Hensley's victim wasn't 

a victim; meaning there was  it was an anonymous tip? 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

No, it was from another 

police jurisdiction. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

Yeah, that's what I'm 

saying.  So it wasn't an anonymous tip? 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

No, it was not an anonymous 

tip. 
 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

It wasn't public safety. 

It was the report of a crime by a known person. 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

Yes, it was.  And in that 

18

case, the Court said that you could arrest for prior 

19

for a prior offense, if it was a felony.  It reserved 

20

the question of whether you could do so for a 

21

misdemeanor.  So it's already looking at the nature of 

22

the offense and the threat to public safety. 

23

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

And, Mr. Laurence, do I 

24

understand what you're saying?  You're saying that in 

25

every case when we have to decide whether the threshold

37

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

level of reasonable suspicion has been met or whether 

2

the level of probable cause has been met, that courts 

3

can take into account the seriousness of the offense, 

4

and what would not count as probable cause for one crime 

5

will count as probable cause for another?  Is that what 

6

you're saying? 

7

 MR. LAURENCE: 

What I'm saying is that, in 

8

terms of when we can deem a tip reliable  White 

9

identified two components to the inquiry.  One is the 

10

indicia of reliability, and the other was the content of 

11

the tip.  And so we have to take the seriousness of the 

12

offense and the threat to public safety into account, in 

13

determining when the officer can rely on that 

14

information. 

15

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I don't understand how 

16

what you're saying is different from what I just said, 

17

and that would seem to me to work quite a substantial 

18

change in  in Fourth Amendment law, that when we 

19

decide whether reasonable suspicion exists, when 

20

whether probable cause exists, that we get to take into 

21

account how serious the offense is. 

22

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I think, since the 

23

inception of the doctrine, this Court identified in 

24

Terry that reasonable suspicion results from a balancing 

25

of the governmental interest 

38

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

The balancing occurs 

2

categorically.  We decide that there's a reasonable 

3

suspicion standard by balancing interests.  What we 

4

don't do is say  you know, depending on how serious we 

5

think this crime is, more or less will meet that 

6

reasonable suspicion standard. 

7

 That would be a very substantial reworking 

8

of Fourth Amendment law  or so it seems to me.  Maybe 

9

I'm wrong. 

10

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I believe that was 

11

something that was indicated in Hensley.  This Court 

12

looked to the nature of the offense in deciding whether 

13

or not the officer had reasonable suspicion at the 

14

inception in making that stop for a crime that had 

15

occurred two weeks earlier. 

16

 And it didn't  it declined to consider 

17

whether or not that would be sufficient for a 

18

misdemeanor.  But in taking the seriousness of the crime 

19

into account, in determining whether or not they could 

20

make that stop, that's a recognition that balancing does 

21

play some role. 

22

 And in White, this Court recognized that the 

23

reliability component is variable.  There's a difference 

24

between probable cause and reasonable suspicion.  And in 

25

J.L., this Court left open the question of at what point

39

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

do we need no reliability because of the seriousness of 

2

the government 

3

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

Could you explain to me 

4

one more time why it's relevant that there were these 

5

details that it was a particular kind of crime, that it 

6

was silver, the license plate, that's this case. 

7

Suppose in another case, a car just ran me off the road, 

8

and it's the only  the only car that's on Highway 1 

9

between Fort Bragg and the state park. 

10

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I think it helps 

11

twofold.  There's particularity, so you know who you're 

12

stopping.  And it goes to the totality of the 

13

circumstances in helping confirm that the person 

14

actually observed what they're saying. 

15

 So that you have  it goes to the 

16

reliability of the personal observation.  So it 

17

builds  it adds an additional layer of  of the 

18

indices reliability so the officer can rely on it 

19

sooner. 

20

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

And incidentally  it 

21

doesn't have much to do with the case  is this a 

22

two  a twolane road? 

23

 MR. LAURENCE: 

24

 JUSTICE KENNEDY: 

25

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Yes, it is, Your Honor. 
That's what I thought. 
Twolane coastal highway,

40

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which, obviously, when someone runs somebody off the 

2

road, poses a grave threat to public safety in that 

3

context. 

4

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

There's a tip that 

5

someone is carrying a concealed weapon, and we have held 

6

that that has to be corroborated  corroborated.  You 

7

can take out a concealed weapon in an instant and fire 

8

it and kill lots of people.  In fact, it was pointed out 

9

that there are more deaths caused by guns than there are 

10
11

from drunk driving. 
 So what's the difference? 

The  the 

12

argument on the drunk driving is very, very dangerous, 

13

but so is having a gun in one's pocket. 

14

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I think there's a 

15

significant difference between having a gun in your 

16

pocket and actually brandishing it or firing it.  I 

17

think, if the J.L. case involved somebody threatening 

18

other people with a gun or firing the gun, it would have 

19

involved a different calculus. 

20

 And so 

21

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But if you  once 

22

once you brandish it, it's too late.  The damage will be 

23

caused. 

24
25

 MR. LAURENCE: 

That is  that is correct. 

But once you're driving drunk down the road, it's  you

41

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

have  the threat is now posed to everybody on the 

2

highway because of the potential for that person to lose 

3

control because 

4

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Of course, this call didn't 

5

say, I think the guy was drunk.  It just said, somebody 

6

drove  you know, drove me off the road. 

7

 MR. LAURENCE: 

8

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

9

Yes. 
Right?  So this isn't  it 

isn't a call that says there's a drunken driver.  It's 

10

just a call that says somebody drove irresponsibly, 

11

right?  And that's enough to stop them. 

12

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I would say  I would 

13

say that, in this case, it is enough.  But I would say 

14

it's more than just driving irresponsibly.  Running 

15

somebody off the road reflects that they're incapable of 

16

driving their car in a way that's  without posing a 

17

safety threat to other people, and when you're dealing 

18

with reasonable suspicion 

19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Okay.  Really 

irresponsibly, okay? 

21

 MR. LAURENCE: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Very irresponsibly. 

24

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

So do you think, 

25

Okay. 
Really irresponsibly. 

Mr. Laurence, if the police had followed this man for

42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

half an hour and seen no other signs of erratic 

2

driving and nobody can drunk drive  can drive drunk 

3

for half an hour without swerving, without doing 

4

something else. 

5

 So they could still have stopped the car? 

6

 MR. LAURENCE: 

I think there may be a point 

7

where the threat to public safety would suggest that the 

8

reasonable suspicion is dissipated in that context.  And 

9

so after  after 50 miles 

10

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, I thought you were 

11

saying as long as somebody had  had given an account 

12

that, some time ago, he had driven another driver off 

13

he had run another driver off the road, doesn't matter 

14

whether you're drunk, doesn't matter anything, there was 

15

an account of an illegal act taking place, and that was 

16

enough to stop him.  It doesn't matter what he's doing 

17

now. 

18

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I believe that the 

19

threat to public safety plays a role in the balance. 

20

And so if that's dissipated, then at that point, you 

21

have  the  the reliability of the tip that you're 

22

relying on is not as significant.  Put it this way: 

23

When you have the threat to public safety balanced in 

24

the totality for purposes of reliability, if that 

25

dissipates, then you have to go back to the tip itself,

43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether it is internally reliable or whether it has 

2

enough to satisfy J.L. 

3

 I think that, when you have an immediate 

4

threat and you have a report of drunk driving, the 

5

officer shouldn't have to wait to see that 50 miles, to 

6

see if they can pass or fail.

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
driving. 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Somebody ran me off the 

road.  Somebody was driving really irresponsibly. 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

16

I'm sorry.  Yes.  A report 

that someone ran him off the road. 

13

15

It wasn't a report of drunk 

Yes.  Yes. 
That's enough to stop him 

down the road. 
 MR. LAURENCE: 

It is, it is, because this is 

17

how drunk drivers display their actions.  And when 

18

you're dealing with reasonable suspicion 

19
20

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 
too quickly, you know? 

21

 MR. LAURENCE: 

22

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

23

What about cutting me off 

I think that 
Cuts right in front of me. 

Really ticks me off. 

24

 (Laughter.) 

25

 MR. LAURENCE: 

That would present a

44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

different set of circumstances.  If you have an 

2

instant  a recognizable instant of bad driving as 

3

opposed to something that reflects recklessness or 

4

drunkenness, then you analyze the tip differently.  And 

5

I think that 

6

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, how would somebody 

7

how would somebody ever be able  who observes another 

8

car driving ever be able to say that person was drunk? 

9

All they could  all they could observe is what they 

10

see.  They don't know whether the person  what is 

11

causing that kind of behavior. 

12

 MR. LAURENCE: 

I agree.  And that's because 

13

what we do  we look to the nature of their driving, 

14

draw reasonable inferences from that.  And that's all 

15

officers can ever do.  When they observe something, they 

16

draw reasonable inferences and determine whether it 

17

gives them suspicion. 

18

 One thing I would point out, that the CHP 

19

dispatchers, the testimony in this case reflects that 

20

they asked.  They asked the driver, well, what did you 

21

see?  So that they can get that information and pass it 

22

along to give the officers as much as possible

23

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

I think it's an entirely 

24

different case if the tip  if the tip here was  you 

25

know, I was at a party, this guy got in his car, he

45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

should not have turned the key on in that car, this guy 

2

is really drunk, you should stop that car on the road. 

3

 I think that's totally different from 

4

somebody just saying, this guy swerved, or this guy 

5

drove me off the road.  You're  you're just making the 

6

assumption that  that every  every one of those 

7

incidents demonstrates a drunk behind the wheel, and I 

8

just don't think that's true. 

9

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, again, I would say it's 

10

not about demonstrating.  It's not about certainty or 

11

probabilities.  It's suspicion.  And that behavior 

12

allows the officer to suspect drunk driving. 

13

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, why is it limited to 

14

drunk driving?  I don't understand that.  I've been 

15

I've been on an expressway, and I've had people go by 

16

me at  they went by in a blur.  They must have been 

17

going well over a hundred miles an hour. 

18

 Now, if the police catch up with that 

19

person, of course, the person's going to slow down while 

20

the police follow the person.  And then when the police 

21

decide to stop, they're going to go back to engaging in 

22

this intentional, extremely dangerous conduct. 

23

 So I don't understand why there's a 

24

distinction between reporting that somebody necessarily 

25

is driving erratically, so the person may be impaired,

46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and somebody who is  where you have extremely reckless 

2

driving that's intentional. 

3

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I wouldn't draw that 

4

distinction.  I think reckless driving, in and of 

5

itself, can pose a threat to public safety that also 

6

mandates an immediate stop.  If someone's playing 

7

chicken with another car on the road, if someone 

8

is  you know, trying testing out their new Ferrari, is going 

9

a hundred miles an hour, weaving in and out of lanes, 

10

those all represent threats to public safety. 

11

 All those circumstances 

12

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But all crime represents a 

13

threat to public safety, and yet, we have these 

14

standards. 

15

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Yes, we do have standards. 

16

But that  the threat to public safety is part of the 

17

totality of circumstances.  It's not something you 

18

invoke that wipes away all other inquiries.  What we 

19

have here is we have a tip that, if it was given by a 

20

known person, I think would undoubtedly allow the 

21

officer to pull that car over immediately. 

22

 The question is because it was anonymous 

23

 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why?  Why  the  we 

24

have the case of the trusted informer.  The informer 

25

several times has given the police tips and it turned

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

out to be right.  And then we have another side, the 

2

anonymous person.  Then there's somebody who calls, 

3

gives a correct name and address, but no record at all 

4

of reliability. 

5

 Why should the fact that the name is 

6

known  the name of the informant is known, if the 

7

police have no reason to believe one way or another that 

8

this informer is reliable? 

9

 MR. LAURENCE: 

Well, I believe that, when 

10

you're looking at  at what point it's reasonable for 

11

the officer to rely on the content of that tip or to 

12

rely on  on that tip coming in and act on it, that 

13

when somebody gives their name, that adds a layer of 

14

reliability to it, even without verification. 

15

 And I think one thing that Gates says in the 

16

context of somebody who reports a  a personal 

17

observation of a crime is that even if we doubt their 

18

veracity, even if we have some question as to their 

19

motives, the fact that they are giving a personal 

20

observation, they note that it's a personal observation, 

21

and giving a detailed account of what occurs, that 

22

report is entitled to a greater degree of reliability 

23

than 

24
25

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

You don't think that a 

teenager standing on a street corner with a couple of

48

Alderson Reporting Company

1

other teenagers with a gun in his belt represents a 

2

threat to public safety? 

3

 MR. LAURENCE:

Not the same threat as in 

this case, Your Honor.

 Ms. Kovner. 
 ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER 
 FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, 
 SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS 

13

 MS. KOVNER: 

14

please the Court: 

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it 

15

 Brief car stops based on anonymous tips of 

16

reckless or drunken driving are reasonable under the 

17

Fourth Amendment because they serve a critical 

18

government interest in removing drunk drivers from the 

19

roadway 

20

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

All right.  Please 

21

define for me what behavior would give police officers 

22

or what descriptors would be adequate for the police to 

23

think someone's drunk.  Swerving, I know, has been 

24

mentioned.  But reckless driving, there's been a lot of 

25

discussion that there could be a wide variety of

49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reckless driving. 

2

 MS. KOVNER: 

3

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

4
5

So 
What  what other 

things would a  would a caller have to say? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

So, Your Honor, I think  I 

6

agree with the observation that there are some behaviors 

7

that pose an ongoing threat to others on the roadway, 

8

and some driving violations that don't.  NHTSA, the 

9

National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration and 

10

other organizations, do keep track of what kinds of 

11

behavior are associated with drunkenness. 

12

 And the Court, in this case, of course, 

13

looked at the particular behavior and said, is this 

14

really a reckless driving behavior, the kind of behavior 

15

that poses this imminent danger?  So there is a line 

16

that courts would need to draw, but the courts that are 

17

engaging in this kind of analysis do draw that. 

18

 And of course 

19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

Well, what  what goes on 

20

the other side of the line?  I mean, why  why is this 

21

on one side?  And then tell me what's on the other. 

22

 MS. KOVNER: 

Sure.  So examples of behavior 

23

on the other might be a seatbelt violation, and they 

24

also might be behaviors that it's a real judgment call 

25

whether a violation occurred or not.

50

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 So for instance, that person didn't fully 

2

stop at a stop sign.  We might have doubts about whether 

3

an informant, who we don't know anything about, can 

4

accurately perceive that.  But when we're talking about 

5

behavior like 

6

 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: 

I think what you're 

7

saying to me, am I correct, that almost any moving 

8

violation counts?  Changing a lane without a signal, 

9

which seems to be endemic in Washington, but 

10

 (Laughter.) 

11

 MS. KOVNER: 

I think that would be a harder 

12

case.  I'm not sure that it's correlated with  with 

13

intoxication or impairment.  As you say, it's very 

14

common, but I think the behavior that we're talking 

15

about here, driving somebody else off the road, is the 

16

kind of behavior that shows this person is a 

17
18
19

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

How about somebody cutting 

someone off in their lane? 
 MS. KOVNER: 

I think that's close to the 

20

line, Your Honor.  I'm not sure that it's always 

21

illegal, and it's something where we may have doubts 

22

about whether the informant can accurately separate this 

23

person was breaking the law from this person wasn't.  I 

24

think the courts are going to have to answer the 

25

question of whether this is the  you know, kind of

51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

behavior that poses 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, where does 

3

that  I think this is the question Justice Kagan asked 

4

earlier  how does the nature of the offense affect the 

5

reasonableness of the suspicion? 

6

 MS. KOVNER: 

7

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So 
I mean, in either 

8

case, you have  let's say the seatbelt and the 

9

swerving driver.  It's the same witness.  He said, 

10

still, it's a white Ford.  The reasonableness of the 

11

suspicion would seem, to me, to be totally divorced from 

12

what it's about. 

13

 MS. KOVNER: 

I think that's true, Your 

14

Honor, and we actually think and  you know, we argued 

15

in our brief that there is reasonable suspicion here. 

16

When an informant gives a basis for knowledge, you have 

17

reason to think they are an eyewitness. 

18

 But the Court has also recognized that there 

19

are certain dangers on the roadway that allow 

20

intrusions, even when we might not otherwise allow them. 

21

So, for instance, in the Sitz case, the Court said drunk 

22

that drunk driving is such a great danger that we're 

23

going to allow even random stops of vehicles to detect 

24

drunk drivers.  So I think the court has indicated there 

25

are certain driving behaviors that are so dangerous

52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

we'll allow even suspicionless stops. 
 And here, of course, we're not dealing with 

3

suspicionless stops.  The questions from the Court have 

4

indicated some of the reasons why that's the case. 

5

Here, we have a caller who has demonstrated their basis 

6

for knowledge, and officers have been able to confirm 

7

that.  So we're talking about tips where the person 

8

relays the kind of details you can really only have if 

9

you are an eyewitness to this person's driving on the 

10
11

road. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

Well, that's just 

12

not true.  It's  it's an acquaintance, I know what 

13

kind of car he drives, I know where he's going.  I 

14

didn't see anything on the road, but I call the police 

15

and say, oh, there's this  you know, white Ford 

16

swerving all over the road. 

17

 MS. KOVNER: 

So, Your Honor, I think this 

18

class of people who are going to have the relevant 

19

knowledge is almost exclusively eyewitnesses.  You may 

20

also have a few people who have seen the person's car 

21

and happen to know what direction they're headed in, but 

22

for the most part, we're talking about a very narrow 

23

class of individuals that are largely going to be 

24

eyewitnesses to this person's driving on the road. 

25

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

53

Alderson Reporting Company

No, I'm talking

Official

1

about the concern that you want to have the police pull 

2

over people that you don't like, where you know 

3

somebody's got something bad in the car, and you don't 

4

like it, and so you're going to take advantage of the 

5

fact that the police don't have to observe anything, and 

6

yet, you can still get them to pull over this person. 

7

 MS. KOVNER: 

So somebody who's malicious, 

8

who's a prankster, is still going to have this kind of 

9

specialized knowledge, and that's not something a 

10
11

malicious prankster is necessarily going to have.  I 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

Why is that different 

12

from the knowledge in J.L., that they were three young 

13

men, and they were described, and the caller said, "The 

14

one with the gun is the one with the plaid shirt."  All 

15

of that was corroborated by the police, and yet, we held 

16

that that was no indication that a crime had been 

17

committed. 

18

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I think the 

19

critical thing that's present here that wasn't present 

20

in J.L. is the basis for knowledge.  So as the passage 

21

that Justice Breyer read signals, we're talking there 

22

about concealed criminal activity, and the Court pointed 

23

out in that case there's nothing in the tip that signals 

24

how the informant knows this person had a gun. 

25

 Here, in contrast, the person is telling you

54

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"I'm an eyewitness.  This person just ran me off the 

2

road." 

3

 JUSTICE KAGAN: 

But then you think J.L. 

4

would have come out differently if the tipster had said, 

5

"I just saw these guys and I saw  you know, one of 

6

them had a gun"? 

7

 MS. KOVNER: 

I think this case comes out 

8

differently for two reasons.  One is, yes, the tip would 

9

be stronger than the tip in J.L., if the person related 

10

eyewitness basis.  But the second has to do with the 

11

imminent danger here that's posed by a car that's moving 

12

down the roadway and that's being operated by a 

13

potentially drunk driver, and the reduced expectations 

14

of privacy you have when you're talking about a vehicle 

15

stop. 

16

 And those were front and center in Sitz, 

17

where the Court said that even suspicionless stops can 

18

be justified by that particular danger. 

19

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Yeah, but that  but that 

20

second danger  you may have a drunken driver on the 

21

road; that danger can be eliminated by following the 

22

car.  You don't have to stop the car right away.  You 

23

can follow it and if, indeed, the driver seems to be 

24

driving erratically, then you can stop.  You'd have 

25

probable cause.

55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

 I don't think you have to automatically 

2

allow a stop in order to prevent all of the horribles 

3

that are going to arise from drunk driving.  Follow the 

4

car.  If he's behaving like a drunk driver, then stop 

5

him. 

6

 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, officers could 

7

follow the car, and if they do, they may witness a 

8

subsequent dangerous behavior that could justify pulling 

9

over the car.  The problem is that the subsequent 

10

dangerous behavior they may observe may be the car 

11

swerving into another lane and hitting another vehicle. 

12

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

That is so remote.  I mean, 

13

it seems to me you're asking us to adopt a broad rule 

14

that is contrary to what we normally do for searches and 

15

seizures because, now and then, it would seem, to me, 

16

very rarely, before the police can stop the drunk 

17

driver, he kills somebody. 

18
19
20

 I mean, I suppose that could happen now and 
then but it's pretty fanciful. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I don't think it's 

21

a remote harm at all.  Now, this is a harm that causes 

22

onethird of all traffic accidents, that takes tens of 

23

thousands of lives a year, and it's a harm that this 

24

Court has always said is a harm of the first order that 

25

justifies the kind of intrusions that we might not

56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

otherwise allow in 
 JUSTICE GINSBURG: 

But here, we have the 

3

police did follow the vehicle for about 5 miles and saw 

4

nothing erratic about the driving.  So perhaps, if the 

5

police had immediately stopped the person or  but 

6

don't  don't we have to take account that there was no 

7

corroboration?  When the police get there.  Even if they 

8

could stop him instantly, when they have no 

9

corroboration, then that doesn't amount to reasonable 

10
11

suspicion. 
 MS. KOVNER: 

Your Honor, I agree that police 

12

might follow a car for such a long period of time that 

13

the reasonable suspicion would dissipate.  On the facts 

14

of this case, Your Honor, the record indicates there 

15

were five minutes between when the officers first saw 

16

the car and when they pulled it over. 

17

 They weren't five minutes of uninterrupted 

18

observation.  They were five minutes in which the 

19

officers were turning their cars around because they 

20

were headed in the opposite direction, were catching up 

21

to a car along the freeway.  So the California Supreme 

22

Court analyzed that delay and found the fact that they 

23

didn't observe additional

4

the road, they are dead. 

5

 I mean, there are sheer drops, and so I just 

6

wonder, if I look that up here, what's the situation 

7

where this supposedly took place? 

8
9

 MS. KOVNER: 

The only thing I can point to 

about that, Your Honor, is the way that the California 

10

Supreme Court treated this, which is that, because they 

11

pointed to the fact that this is a twolane highway and 

12

that it's particularly dangerous on this particular road 

13

to engage in this behavior. 

14
15
16

 But I don't know about  you know, whether 
there are cliffs on the side of the road. 
 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

What about the 

17

danger from the police side?  In other words, they 

18

know  or they suspect that the guy driving the white 

19

car has a lot of marijuana in the trunk.  They have no 

20

basis for pulling him over.  And they say, well, guess 

21

what, we got an anonymous tip that he was driving 

22

erratically, so we pulled him over.

 REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KLEVEN, 
 ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS, 
 APPOINTED BY THIS COURT 
 MR. KLEVEN: 

In this case, we're talking 

14

about a single uncorroborated tip of reckless driving. 

15

After that single incident, the car  the truck went 

16

for approximately 19 miles with no indication of any 

17

other problem and then was followed for up to 5 miles by 

18

the police officers, again, with no indication of any 

19

erratic driving or any other violation that would have 

20

been a reason for pulling him over immediately. 

21

 There's no reason to believe that the driver 

22

of this truck presented any kind of danger about being 

23

about to lose control, which is the argument that the 

24

State is relying on, and the Federal government, and 

25

neither one of them came up with any anecdote, even,

59

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

where that actually occurred, much less any statistics 

2

that show that that is a serious problem, of people 

3

losing control while they're being under surveillance by 

4

the police officers. 

5

 This case is even farther away from the bomb 

6

situation than J.L. was.  In J.L., you had a person who 

7

was armed, who could have pulled out a gun and started 

8

firing at any moment.  Here, you have something where 

9

there's no indication of any ongoing risk to the public. 

10

I don't think  I don't know that there's a good answer 

11

to the bomb question. 

12

 I read through the transcript from the oral 

13

argument in J.L.  I didn't see any  you know, there 

14

didn't seem to be any good arguments  any good 

15

discussions there, either, as to which way the Court 

16

could go. 

17

 But this case  in J.L., the Court said, 

18

there's no reason for us to resolve that.  We don't have 

19

to speculate about a situation where that would happen. 

20

In this case, I submit, there's even less reason for the 

21

Court to speculate about the bomb situation or even the 

22

kidnapping situation. 

23

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, I find that 

24

unsatisfactory because if you  unless you're willing 

25

to say, it doesn't matter whether it's a bomb, an atomic

60

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bomb, a little bomb, then there  there must be  if 

2

you're going to draw the line someplace, then you're 

3

going to have to distinguish between those reports of 

4

crimes that are serious enough to be on one side of the 

5

line and those reports of a crime that are not serious 

6

enough to be on that side of the line. 

7

 You either have to go all the way, or you 

8

have to draw a line, and if you're going to draw a line, 

9

I would like to know where the line is. 

10

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, Your Honor, except I 

11

don't think  I don't think you can draw the line in 

12

terms of reasonable suspicion because, then, you're 

13

going to have this 

14

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

15

All right.  Forget about 

reasonable suspicion.  Just can it be done? 

16

 MR. KLEVEN: 

17

 JUSTICE ALITO: 

Well, certainly, Your Honor 
You can say it can never 

18

done, even if it's an atomic bomb, even if it's some 

19

other type of bomb.  You can say that.  Or you can say, 

20

no, there's a line someplace.  If you're going to say 

21

there's a line someplace, then, really, I think you need 

22

to tell us where the line is. 

23

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Your Honor, I think the line is 

24

certainly, when we get into the bomb situation, but not 

25

in terms of reasonable suspicion.  The severity of the

61

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

crime does not affect it, but the Court could fashion a 

2

rule that would say there's an exception in this case 

3

that would apply

For a bomb.  For any kind of

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, I don't think  I think

8

 JUSTICE ALITO:

 MR. KLEVEN: 

It has to be a big bomb. 
 that says a white  a white 

10

Prius has a bomb  you know, that doesn't seem to be 

11

the sort of case under the  under the established 

12

circumstances where this Court would find a reasonable 

13

suspicion 

14

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

What about drawing the line 

15

at intentional conduct?  The guy who has a bomb is going 

16

to use it.  He's intentionally going to use it. 

17

 MR. KLEVEN: 

18

 JUSTICE SCALIA: 

Well 
Or maybe intentionally 

19

doing an action that is going to harm more than one 

20

person, as opposed to, hmm, maybe this person might 

21

accidentally, because he's inub inebriated, hurt somebody? 

22

 It seems to me there's a clear line between 

23

somebody who's  who's bent on an intentional crime and 

24

somebody who might harm somebody because of his conduct. 

25

You like that one?

Yes, Your Honor, I think 

4

those  those are two significant distinctions, 

5

certainly, between the  the bomb analogy and the 

6

situation, even in the drunken driving situation, where 

7

you don't have anybody who is intentionally trying to 

8

harm anyone and the magnitude of the risk is  is much 

9

greater.  The 

10

 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: 

So somebody has five 

11

drinks and goes and gets in the car, that's not 

12

intentionally trying to harm someone?  Or recklessly 

13

trying to harm 

14

 MR. KLEVEN: 

Well, in terms of their 

15

their decision to get drunk, there's intent there, in 

16

terms of  by the time the officer becomes aware of it, 

17

there's no indication that that drunk driver is going 

18

down the road trying to harm somebody. 

19

 There is an indication that they may be 

20

too  too inebriated to be driving properly, and police 

21

officers are pulling people over for that situation 

22

since the car was invented, and they're really good at 

23

it.
