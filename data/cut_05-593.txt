ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC GRANT

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GRANT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals misinterpreted the

11

Westfall Act in a way that unfairly deprives tort

12

plaintiffs of the most basic procedural protections

13

routinely afforded in both Federal and State courts.

14

That misinterpretation cannot be reconciled with the

15

text and history of the statute, the nature and

16

operation of official immunity or the jurisdictional

17

limitations of article III.

18

of the court of appeals should be reversed and this

19

State law case should be remanded to the State courts

20

where it rightfully belongs.

21

court of appeals judgment should be vacated for lack of

22

appellate jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the judgment

In the alternative, the

23

Prior to the Westfall Act, courts considered

24

whether, assuming the alleged acts occurred, the Federal

25

employee was acting within the scope of his employment.

In Westfall v. Erwin, this Court added the additional

2

requirement that the acts be undertaken with a

3

discretionary function, but invited Congress to address

4

the issue.

5

Congress did not change the basic rule that scope of

6

employment sets the line for immunity.

7

confirmed that rule.

9

Federal district courts to determine the merits of

In responding with the Westfall Act,

Indeed, Congress

In particular, Congress gave no

10

wholly State law claims in some sort of unprecedented

11

summary proceeding.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it a wholly State

13

law claim if the principal matter is whether this

14

Federal employee is immune from suit?

15

threshold question that has to be answered.

16

determined wholly by Federal law, so you must get

17

through that Federal law gateway before you can go any

18

place else in the suit.

19

MR. GRANT:

That's the
It's

Your Honor, that is true in

20

perhaps a majority of Westfall Act cases, but in cases

21

like this and a significant and recurring subset of

22

cases there is no Federal law question because scope of

23

employment simply is not at issue.

24

does in those subset of cases is merely to assert the

25

defense of he didn't do it or it never happened.

his authority.

7

He was there on the premises.

He is

It seems like it's a question of

MR. GRANT:

With respect, Your Honor, that

8

is not the case, certainly in this case and in others.

9

The Government has conceded that if Respondent Barry

10

Haley acted as alleged in the complaint he was acting

11

outside the course and scope of his Federal employment.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I think Justice

13

Ginsburg's point, and it concerns me as well, is that

14

the Government is entitled to say that during the time

15

the event occurred, i.e., the firing, he was on duty and

16

he refrained from committing any unlawful act.

17

MR. GRANT:

Your Honor, there may be cases

18

where even if the acts occurred, they were within the

19

course and scope of the Federal employment.

20

case like this, as in Wood versus United States, as in

21

Melo v. Hafer in the Third Circuit, the Government

22

concedes, because the law and the facts require the

23

Government and the employee to concede, that if the

24

alleged acts took place they were necessarily outside

25

the scope of employment.

But in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the actual

2

statutory language refers to acting within the scope of

3

employment at the time of the incident, and so a

4

certification based on the view that at the time of the

5

alleged incident, he was acting entirely within his

6

scope would seem to be within the language of the

7

statute.

MR. GRANT:

Your Honor, on its face the

certification in this case, as in others, tracks the

10

statutory language.

11

was examined in the district court, it became apparent

12

that the Government's essential defense, in fact

13

supported by two declarations, including the declaration

14

of Respondent Haley, was that he simply did not do the

15

acts alleged.

16

But when the Government's position

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but the question is

17

what the district court should examine, and the statute

18

talks about the incident out of which the claim arose.

19

So that necessarily requires the Government to look at

20

the complaint, see the incident out of which this claim

21

arises, whether or not the claim is true, and to certify

22

it.

23

MR. GRANT:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

Your Honor "Out of which the claim

arose" it seems to me is of some importance.

Your Honor, this Court has

5

consistently made a distinction between immunity and the

6

merits.

7

in 1985 and continuing through cases like Richardson

8

versus McKnight in 1997, the Court has consistently

9

recognized that immunity is different from a defense on

Starting in cases like Mitchell versus Forsyth

10

the merits.

It's different from a defense of he didn't

11

do it or it never happened.

12

although the time of the incident is important, that is

13

only one of several factors certainly under Kentucky law

14

in determining whether something happened within the

15

course and scope of employment.

And I would say that,

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

mean, that line is awfully difficult to draw.

18

he didn't do it versus something else.

19

let's say it's an assault case and the person says, you

20

hit me, and the person says, well, it was entirely an

21

accident; I was gesticulating with my hand so it wasn't,

22

wouldn't have met the requirements for the tort.

23

are they denying the incident in that case?

24
25

MR. GRANT:

Well how is it -- I
You assert

Now,

Your Honor, the Court in Wood v.

United States took account of the possibilities of

artful pleading and would allow the Government to

2

challenge the characterization of the incident.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's not just a

4

characterization.

5

example, a mental element, the plaintiff can assert, you

6

did that with malice aforethought and the defendant can

7

say, no, I didn't.

14

just described in his hypo, and if in fact that is an

17

act at all.

factual findings.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, in this case the

3

immunity defense is, number one, as you said, the

4

Government forthrightly said at the beginning right in

5

terms of the statute that he was acting within the scope

6

of his employment.

7

Government in effect elaborated on that and said the

8

reason he was not acting outside the scope of his

9

employment is that these acts which would have been

Secondarily, as you said, the

10

outside scope didn't happen.

Why is that any

11

different from the claim in the Chief Justice's hypo

12

that there was no intent to harm?

13

MR. GRANT:

Your Honor, because a claim of,

14

that the alleged act did not occur, that he didn't do

15

it, is not a claim of immunity.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Again, this -

It's a claim upon which the

17

immunity depends.

18

immunity claimed here is that at the time in question he

19

was not acting outside the scope of his employment.

20

reason he was not acting outside the scope was that he

21

didn't do what they say he did.

22

The immunity is claimed -- the

MR. GRANT:

The

Your Honor, I'm sorry if I have

23

the same answer to the question, but again, this Court's

24

jurisprudence has consistently distinguished between

25

defenses, so to speak, on the merits, a claim that the
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

alleged act did not occur, that one of the elements of

2

the State law claim is not met.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

In this case, if Mr. Haley

4

had said, I had some conversations with the private

5

employer and the plaintiff's name was mentioned during

6

the conversations, but I never told them to discharge

7

her, would this, would that be something -- would your

8

argument apply there?

9

MR. GRANT:

It would apply, Your Honor, if,

10

if that factual determination were relevant to scope of

11

employment under the applicable law, namely the agency

12

law of Kentucky.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, is it?

I mean,

14

that's -- the problem that I have with your argument,

15

Mr. Grant, is that in life things are often not, it

happened or it didn't happen.

ground, which is this officer is saying, I was there at

18

the relevant time or place and when I was there

19

everything that I did was within the scope of my

20

employment, I didn't do anything that was outside the

21

scope of my employment.

22

MR. GRANT:

There is a middle

There are cases in which there

23

is a middle ground, Your Honor.

But this case is not

one of them, and there is certainly a distinct and

recurring subset of cases, like Wood and Melo and

13

of cases to go to Federal court?

MR. GRANT:

Why would you want one set

Your Honor, it's Congress that

set the line at scope of employment.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, that's what

17

we're debating, whether the line is there or not, and as

18

you've seen from the discussion, there is at least some

19

ambiguity in it.

20

find a line that doesn't make any sense?

21

There being ambiguity, why should we

MR. GRANT:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

22

line does make sense because if the Government's view is

23

adopted and the view of the majority of the court of

24

appeals, the merits of the wholly State law claim will

25

be resolved in Federal court and resolved in a
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

procedural context that denies a tort plaintiff the

2

right to discovery, that denies the tort plaintiff a

3

right to the normal evidentiary presumptions on a motion

4

to dismiss or motion for summary judgment, and denies

5

that tort plaintiff the right to a jury trial.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that can happen when in

7

fact the certification of the Attorney General turns out

8

to be wrong and there isn't any immunity.

9

whole thing is going to be tried in Federal court.

10

MR. GRANT:

Still, the

Your Honor, in that situation,

11

the merits will at least be tried under the normal

12

provisions for discovery and evidentiary presumptions,

13

14

States.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But Mr. Grant, I'm a

16

little puzzled.

17

system any less valuable in the State system?

18

Why is the discovery in the Federal

MR. GRANT:

Because what the Government

19

advocates here, as I think most starkly illustrated by

20

the Third Circuit's decision in Melo v. Hafer is some

21

sort of summary proceeding that takes place before the

22

normal processes of Federal litigation.

23

the Government's position that this employee is immune.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

After all, it's

Isn't that only summary

proper?

2

MR. GRANT:

It's for the purpose of deciding

3

scope of employment, but the Government's interpretation

4

of that phrase encompasses essentially the merits of the

5

case.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not for

7

deciding whether removal -- I thought the statute says

8

that the Attorney General's certification is conclusive

9

with respect to removal.

10

MR. GRANT:

It is conclusive, Your Honor, in

11

those cases that truly do implicate scope of employment.

12

In this case, by contrast, the certification was

13

essentially to raise the he didn't do it or it never

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what does it

16

mean to say that the certification is conclusive with

17

respect to scope of employment for purposes of removal

18

if it doesn't mean that it's conclusive, if you're going

19

to have judicial review that is going to address the

20

question of removal as opposed to the validity of the

21

certification on the merits?

22

MR. GRANT:

Your Honor, it's conclusive

23

where it satisfies the definition in the statute.

24

is conclusive in the final sentence of paragraph (d)(2)

25

of section 2679 is this certification, and this

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you're saying

it's only conclusive if it's right?
MR. GRANT:

No, Your Honor.

It's only, it

6

can be conclusive right or wrong, but it's only

7

conclusive if it satisfies the statutory definition,

8

being about scope of employment, not about the merits.

9

In this case, for example, there never will be, never

10

could be a true scope of employment determination, the

11

Government having conceded it.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose, Mr. Grant, that

13

the district court had said, I'm going to deny the

14

substitution of the United States as the defendant, but

15

I realize that this is a debatable question, so I'm not

16

going to order a remand until the defendant and the United

17

States have had a chance to challenge my initial ruling

18

that I deny the substitution of the United States.

19

Suppose that it had happened that way?

20

right to get back in the State court?

MR. GRANT:

Would you have any
Wouldn't that

Your Honor, that, that could

24

discretionary appeal procedure in section 1292(b), or

14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, suppose that

2

happened, and then the court of appeals said the United

3

States should have been substituted?

4

MR. GRANT:

That would -- that would on its

5

merits restrict the district court from remanding, but

6

of course in this case, the district court did enter an

7

order of remand based on its interpretation of section

8

2679.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But your position is that

10

the Attorney General's certification is conclusive -

11

is not conclusive in those situations in which the

12

Attorney General doesn't draw the line properly between

13

an event denying answer and an event characterizing

14

answer?

15

very nuanced decision in some instances, then the

16

Attorney General's certification is not conclusive?

17

Whenever the Attorney General is wrong on that

MR. GRANT:

The short answer is yes, Your

18

Honor.

The Attorney General's certification is not

19

conclusive where it does not satisfy the statutory

20

definition, where it is not a certification that truly

21

implicates scope of employment.

recently as the Kircher opinion last term that section

18

1447(d) means what it says.

19

district court entered an order remanding the case to

20

the State court from which it was removed, and 1447(d),

21

of course, bars review of that order by appeal or

22

otherwise.

The court of appeals in fact did lack

purposes of removal, the Attorney General's certification

2

is conclusive.

3

suggests, you'd think that case would proceed in Federal

4

court rather than be immediately remanded without the

5

availability of review.

6

And it doesn't, if you look at 2679, it

MR. GRANT:

Your Honor, on the merits of the

7

interpretation of 2679(d)(2), we tried to explain why

8

conclusive does not operate in a case like this, but I

9

think the important point for jurisdiction is that this

10

Court has consistently said that even if a district

11

court misinterprets a jurisdictional statute, that

12

review is nonetheless barred by section 1447(d).

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This is a different

14

type of jurisdictional statute in that there is concern

15

on Congress's part here to provide a Federal forum for

16

the adjudication of whether something is within the

17

scope of a Federal employee's duty.

18

inconceivable, but it would seem illogical to

19

specifically provide for review of that determination

20

but then have that review take place in State court

21

rather than Federal court.

22

MR. GRANT:

It's not

Well, Your Honor, Congress

23

obviously knows how to make exceptions to section

24

1447(d).

25

Court's opinion in Kircher that cited a number of

2

U.S.C. section 1441(a), and that statute which involved

3

the Resolution Trust Corporation specifically refers to

4

appeal and remand.

5

the bar of section 1447(d), which has been around for

6

more than a century, is not to be ignored unless there

7

is a clear statutory command that makes an exception.

8
9

The Government in its brief relied on 12

And so what this Court has said is,

JUSTICE ALITO:

But here not only, not only

does it say that the Attorney General's certification is

10

conclusive for purposes of removal, but there is no

11

mention about remand in relation to a case that is

12

removed after the Attorney General's certification.

13

Whereas by contrast, where the Attorney General doesn't

14

certify and the case is removed, the statute does

15

address the issue of remand.

16

things together, isn't it perfectly clear that Congress

17

did not want these cases that are removed on the

18

Attorney General's certification to be remanded?

19

MR. GRANT:

So if you put those two

No, Your Honor.

The authority

20

to remand in this case proceeds from subsection C of

21

section 1447.

22

including the International Primate Protection League

23

case in 1991, when a Federal district court lacks

24

subject matter jurisdiction because a case, a party

25

attempting to remove has done so without authority to do

As this Court has said in various cases,

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

so, section 1447(c) obliges a remand.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would have thought your

3

answer would have been even if, even if the remand was

4

improper, even if it is the case that, what is it,

5

(d)(2) envisions that the suit remain in the Federal

6

court.

7

is still a remand that is covered by the prohibition of

8

review.

9

the remand is wrong, the remand is not reviewable.

10

Nonetheless, if there is an erroneous remand, it

I mean, we said in other cases that even when

MR. GRANT:

That is my answer, Your Honor.

11

Section (d)(2) goes, gives direction to district courts,

12

but section 1447(d) gives direction to appellate courts.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

If that's your answer, can

14

I go back to the other main issue for a second?

I would

15

have thought that your case, unfortunately for you in my

16

mind, is the classic case where there should be

17

jurisdiction because the AG is supposed to say look, I

18

don't think anything happened, okay?

19

his job all day.

20

you what, it was within the scope of his employment.

21

And apparently, that's just what they did say here.

22

then it got mixed up in the courts below.

23

words, if he made some phone calls and even if he

24

mentioned the employee, even if he said something

25

improper, it was within the scope of his employment,

So he was doing

seems to me this makes a lot of complexity out of

3

4

So because of that, it

Now you explain what your answer is.
MR. GRANT:

5

that, which is just what Wood says they can do, if

3

anybody, you know, thinks that's valid?

4

what's the problem then?

5

that the reason this case appears difficult is because

6

yours is a case where the AG should be able to come in

and remove it.

MR. GRANT:

But the -

Because I would have thought

The district court, the very

same district court that the Government so, so

10

desperately wants to review the facts of this case, said

11

that given Mr. Haley's declaration under penalty of

12

perjury, it would not accept that alternative.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it's wrong in that,

isn't it?
MR. GRANT:

Well, the Government did not

appeal that point in the court of appeals, and in fact JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, the Wood issue was

18

the issue of where if anything happened, of course it's

19

outside the scope.

It's like one employee shoots

20

another, you know.

There is nothing to do with scope of

21

employment there, it's plainly outside.

22

this act, in my view then, then, was that this is not an

23

act that allows the AG to defend that kind of thing.

24

But if it's arguable at least that something happened,

25

if it happened at all it was within the scope of
21

MR. GRANT:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your Honor, the Government What's the problem with -

4

there should be a problem with what I say from your

5

point of view, so -

6

MR. GRANT:

I think the problem is in the

7

record, Your Honor, and the Government's brief at the,

8

at the petition stage on page 14 in note five quotes its

9

own appellate brief in the court of appeals, and that

10

brief says the memorandum of understanding between the

11

Forest Service and the private respondent showed that if

12

Haley did cause the contractor to fire Osborn, he acted

13

outside the scope of his employment.

14

appeals quite logically took that -

JUSTICE BREYER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Mr. Chief Justice

Official

1

and may it please the Court:

2

In the Westfall Act Congress provided an

3

absolute immunity for Federal employees for acts

4

taken within the scope of their employment and it

5

went further and provided that when the Attorney

6

General certifies that the employee was acting

7

within the scope of his employment at the time of

8

the incident out of which the claim arose, that that

9

issue of Federal immunity is to be decided by the

10

Federal court.

11

of this Federal defense of immunity that satisfies

12

article III just as the employee's own assertion of

13

immunity satisfies article III under the Federal Officer

14

Removal statute and just as a, in other circumstances a

15

plaintiff's assertion of a claim under Federal law

16

satisfies article III.

17

It is the Attorney General's assertion

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So what if the

18

Attorney General certifies and removes a case in a

19

criminal case, a case clearly not within the statute?

20

What happens then?

21

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I think that

22

the, the -- that would probably be a defect in removal

23

procedure rather than a jurisdictional defect but even

24

if it is -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
23
Alderson Reporting Company

No, no, on the

Official

1

procedure, he follows the procedure meticulously; it's

2

just wrong.

3

can do it in a civil case.

4

also says that his certification is conclusive.

5

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It's a criminal case.

The statute says he

On the other hand the statute

Well, Your Honor

6

even if that is a case that would be removed without

7

jurisdiction, that case is quite different from this

8

case because this case -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, this one is a

10

civil one and that's a criminal, but I'm just

11

trying to understand how broad your argument that this

12

is not subject to further review goes.

13

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, the issue

14

that is not subject to further review for purposes of

15

jurisdiction is the Attorney General's certification

16

that the employee was acting within scope.

17

statute doesn't provide that the Attorney General's

18

certification that it is a civil action is conclusive

19

but only the Attorney General's certification that the

20

employee was acting within scope is conclusive for

21

purposes of removal.

22

the Federal defense and that's what satisfies article

23

III jurisdiction.

24

Willingham case recognized that an employee could assert

25

a claim of Federal immunity even though he was also at

The

That's the essential element of

And in fact, this Court in the

24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the same time denying that he caused any harm to the

2

plaintiff.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well I thought your

4

analogy to Willingham was a strong one until you go back

5

and read the statute.

Willingham is a very different

6

statutory predicate.

It's acting under color of law.

7

This is much more specific.

8

incident, he was acting within his scope, so I'm not

9

sure the analogy holds up.

10

At the time of the

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well if anything

11

the language of the Westfall Act is broader because as

12

Your Honor emphasized earlier, the statute, the Westfall

13

act provides that the Attorney General is to certify

14

that at the time of the incident out of which the claim

15

arose the employee was acting within the scope.

16

arguably the necessary question is what was the employee

17

doing at the time.

18

is somewhat narrower because it requires that the claim

19

arise out of the, the acts taken under color of office.

20

So

The Federal Officer Removal statute

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But yet that would

21

be a good argument if the statute said the Attorney

22

General can certify that the employee did not do

23

anything outside the scope of his employment, but it's

24

phrased in the affirmative.

25

was acting within the scope of his employment.

He has to certify that he

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right.

And

2

that's what the Attorney General did here, certified

3

that Mr. Haley was acting within the scope of his

4

employment at the time of the incident out of which the

5

claim arose.

6

And as several -

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that's the issue then.

7

And what I -- is my, my question for you is this, let's

8

imagine not this case, which as I said I think is too

9

complicated and probably is one that the Government

10

should be able to defend, but suppose it's an assault

11

like Wood's, a sexual assault and there is absolutely no

12

doubt that if it happened it was outside the scope of

13

employment, everybody concedes it but Government.

14

the Government's position is, nothing happened.

15

right?

16

like to argue that if something happened, and they may

17

be able to prove something, something like a movement?

18

No, we agree there was nothing like that, we agree

19

nothing like that happened; we are not going to defend

20

on any scope of employment ground.

21

is that ordinary work went on and that was within the

22

scope of employment.

23

not?

24

it was a close question but you read what I thought the

25

other way in Wood, though it was obviously a close

Nothing happened.

And
All

You say Government, would you

All we are arguing

Now, does this act cover it or

Your view is yes and you read, you know I thought

2

So what is your basic response to that?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

You are correct

3

that our view is that yes, the Attorney General can

4

certify in that case.

5

continuum as I think Your Honor has recognized.

6

on the one extreme, one might say that the Attorney

7

General must accept all of the plaintiff's allegations

8

as true.

arguing that.

12

The issue is really one along a
Of on,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That was the position of

the district court, though, wasn't it?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That was the

13

position of the district court, although I don't think

14

the Petitioner is now advocating that view.

15

view would certainly be inconsistent; it would create

16

the anomaly that the Attorney General's authority to

17

certify scope and to assert the immunity on behalf of

18

the employee would be narrower than the employee's own

19

authority to assert the immunity, because again going back

20

to the Willingham case, the Court never asked whether it

21

would be within the scope of employment for the prison

22

officials to have maliciously tortured the prisoner;

23

rather the defense was we didn't harm the prisoner but

24

anything that happened between us and the prisoner

25

happened within the scope of our employment.
27

Alderson Reporting Company

And that

And so the

Official

1

Attorney General's authority to certify has to be at

2

least as broad as that in our view.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

The basic point I think in

4

Wood is this.

I'm the district judge.

And the

5

Government, you come in and argue in the alternative.

6

Nothing happened, but if it did happen it was within the

7

scope of employment and they say there is no

8

possibility.

9

if there is a reasonable chance, maybe any chance, that

You'd say, plaintiff, I want to know here

10

a jury could find that something went on here that was

11

within the scope of employment that shouldn't have.

12

if the answer to that question is no, the defendant wins

13

either because of summary judgment or because -- no,

14

sorry.

15

it?

16
17
18
19

I've gotten lost in what I said.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Do you follow

The -- I think I do.

In our view JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Good, I'm glad

that someone did.

20

[Laughter.]

21

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

In our view, it

22

would be anomalous that the, that the more innocent

23

employee would be deprived of the benefits of the

24

Westfall Act, and if I could use a more simple -

25

And

JUSTICE BREYER:

I was talking really about

Alderson Reporting Company

1

practicality of it.

2

case that is going to be hard for me as a district judge

3

to decide because I'm going to ask you, the Government,

4

to tell me if anything went on here that might have been

5

within the scope of employment.

6

you're saying; if you say no, if you say no you can't

defend it.

9

on a reasonable reading of the record.

10

I don't think you can give me a

And I look at what

If you say yes, you can defend it and that's

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I don't think

11

that that could be the end of it.

12

pointed out, reality is much murkier than the black or

13

white and even in the hypothetical that Your Honor

14

poses, it is quite possible that as the case progresses,

15

the plaintiff is going to attempt to introduce evidence

16

that is much more ambiguous as to whether the employee

17

was acting within the scope or not.

18

As Justice Ginsburg

If I could use a simple example of assault.

19

If the, if a supervisor is dressing down her employee

20

for, for inadequate work, the employee then sues the

21

supervisor alleging that she assaulted her, shaking her

22

fist right under her nose, threatening harm to her.

23

Even if that would be outside the scope of employment,

24

the employee might say -- the supervisor rather might

25

say, I never raised my hand at all.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

I raised my voice

Official

1

certainly but I never raised my hand.

2

witness may say well I saw the supervisor wag her finger

3

at the employee but not in a threatening fashion.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

A third party

Now -

And as long as a jury could

5

find that there is a view of the record such that the

6

plaintiff might prove something wrong that it was within

7

the scope of employment, such as finger wagging that

8

hits her forehead, for example, you can defend it.

9

What's the problem?

10
11
12

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, if the

employee JUSTICE BREYER:

The only problem is if you

13

admit that you can't prove anything like that.

14

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

If the employee was

15

acting within the scope of the employment when she

16

wagged a finger, then a fortiori she was acting within

17

the scope of her employment when she didn't raise her

18

hand at all.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, not a fortiori, for the

20

reason that Congress wrote this statute not to give the

21

defendant the right to call in the Government to defend

22

him no matter what he did.

23

wrote the statute was to repeal the Westfall case, which

24

was a question of the scope of immunity, which was the

4

That

Congress could have written a

What's your response to that?

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

But Congress made,

5

established an absolute immunity where the employee was

6

acting within the scope of employment, and Petitioner

7

agrees that scope of employment is the essential

8

question for immunity.

9

supervisor was acting within the scope of her employment

10

when she dressed down, raising her voice but not raising

11

her fist, her, her subordinate, then she is protected by

12

the Westfall Act from a claim arising out of the context

13

of that employment.

So if in my hypothetical the

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

case where the certification is clearly wrong?

16

you get into a fight with your neighbor.

nothing to do with your employment at all but the

"They are always thinking about your cases.

is of course what this Court has often said as well, and

4

so I don't think we should construe the statute on the

5

presumption that the Attorney General would, would

6

certify ridiculous cases.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well what about the,

8

Lamagno, where the question was, was the employee

9

working within the scope of his employment or was he off

10

on a frolic of his own?

11

question that the Chief Justice put to you.

12

certification, if it were wrong, the Attorney General

13

said what he was doing was within the scope of

14

employment and turned out he was on a drunken binge with

15

his friends and they got in his car and killed someone.

16

If that certification within the scope was wrong and

17

instead he is on a frolic of his own, then the United

18

States isn't substituted.

19

I think that's the kind of

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

The

That's right.

That

20

would mean that the district court did not on the merits

21

ultimately uphold the defense of immunity, but as the

22

Court said in Mesa, the merits of the immunity defense

23

have nothing whatsoever to do with the question of

jurisdiction.

25

that could be reviewed.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right.

It

is not conclusive for purposes of the substitution.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

19
20

Right.
It is conclusive

for purposes of the court's removal jurisdiction.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What does that mean?

Does

21

that mean that if the district court finds that in fact

22

the defendant was not acting within the scope of his

23

employment, the United States is eliminated as the

24

defendant and the individual employee is resubstituted?

25

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes, Your Honor.

Official

1

That's what happened.

4

But, and in that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where, where does that come

from?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, the procedure

5

for what happens upon the district court's review is not

6

spelled out in the Westfall Act, neither is the review

7

itself in particular.

8
9

But the, the employee -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe the United States

should remain the party defendant and the United States

10

should pay which would be the, you know, the price of

11

the Attorney General's certification.

12

careful what he certifies.

13

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

He should be

Well, the uniform

14

view of the lower courts is that when the certification is

15

overturned, the effect is to resubstitute the employee

16

as the defendant and it proceeds in Federal court as a

17

pendent claim.

18

defense of immunity which we presume to be colorable

19

because we presume regularity by the Attorney General,

20

confers article III jurisdiction on the courts, even

21

though it may ultimately on the merits be rejected.

22

This Court held in the Carnegie-Mellon case that the

23

district courts have discretion whether to exercise

24

jurisdiction over pendent claims once the Federal

25

question has been resolved.

The Attorney General's assertion of the

If the courts have

34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discretion to exercise that pendent jurisdiction, then

2

certainly Congress can instruct them to exercise that -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, they wouldn't

4

have discretion in that case, though, because the

5

statute says the Attorney General's certification is

6

conclusive for purposes of removal.

7

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's right.

8

Congress has removed the discretion in this class of

9

cases and says that the courts must retain jurisdiction.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought maybe your

11

answer, one alternative answer, would have been that you

12

can't remand the case but you can still dismiss it.

13
14

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:
perhaps that's so.

15

Well, the, perhaps,

Certainly Carnegie-Mellon -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would still be

16

conclusive for purposes of removal, but it doesn't mean

17

it's conclusive for purposes of subject matter

18

jurisdiction.

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

20

statute speaks to removal and that the Attorney

21

General's certification is conclusive for purposes of

22

removal.

23

By its text, the

But I think JUSTICE SOUTER:

Couldn't it be conclusive

24

for purposes of removal jurisdiction, but still leave

25

the district court with discretion to remand on the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

grounds that, although it had removal jurisdiction, in

2

fact the premise of that removal jurisdiction was wrong,

3

and it would therefore remand, in effect, because the

4

only claim it had before it was the equivalent of a

5

pendent claim.

6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

But the -- as the

7

Court held in Carnegie-Mellon, a remand of pendent claims

8

after the Federal issue has been resolved is not a

9

remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction within

10

the meaning of 1447(c).

11

remand under the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction, and

12

so -

13
14

Rather, it is a discretionary

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In that case it would be

reviewable.

15

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

And it would be

16

reviewable.

17

the district court's order here is reviewable, because

18

it is not an order of remand authorized by 1447(c)

19

because, first of all, Congress has instructed the

20

courts that they are not to remand.

21

That's why -- that's one of the reasons why

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's, that's what the

22

district court said it was, though, isn't it?

23

-- wasn't the district court remanding for lack of

24

jurisdiction?

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Alderson Reporting Company

Didn't it

It is certainly

Official

true that the district court -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you want us to review

3

the, the assertion of the district court that it was

4

remanding for, I mean that would mean every case would,

5

would be reviewable.

6

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No, Your Honor,

7

because here the Court need not go beyond the face of

8

the district court's order to understand what it was

9

doing.

The court exercised jurisdiction over the

10

Federal question that was properly brought before it by

11

the Attorney General's certification and this Court's

12

decision in Lamagno.

13

court said, having concluded that the United States is

14

not a proper party to this case, the court must now

15

determine whether or not it has jurisdiction, and it

16

also said that the absence of the U.S. as a party to the

17

case destroys the court's jurisdiction.

18

that the court understood that it had jurisdiction and

19

that it was a subsequent event that deprived it.

20

After resolving that, the district

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That is true.

But

I think that the intent of Congress was the same as this

7

Court, all the members of this Court, recognized in

Lamagno.

In Lamagno, even the dissenters, the

was what Congress intended.

20

pendent jurisdiction what, what I meant to convey was

21

that it is within the Court's article III jurisdiction

22

to exercise jurisdiction over the State law claims that

23

were pendent to a Federal claim.

24

judicially developed doctrine of pendent jurisdiction,

25

that is discretionary with the court.

Under this Court's

38
Alderson Reporting Company

But if it is

Official

1

discretionary with the court, then certainly Congress

2

can mandate that the court exercise that jurisdiction

3

and that it would be consistent with article III.

4

But another reason why Congress would have

5

wanted the case to remain in Federal court even if the

6

certification is overturned is, as we've alluded to

7

before, the development of the case subsequent to the

8

certification substitution decision may, may illustrate

9

that the plaintiff's claim does indeed assert facts that

10

were within the scope of employment.

11

the very -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The court would at

Well, the

13

jurisdiction wouldn't depend on that.

14

point that there's more than pendent jurisdiction here I

15

take it is because these are not separate State claims

16

appended to what you thought was a Federal claim.

17

is the same claim that you initially thought was a

18

Federal claim and then it turned into a purely State law

19

claim, and that may be analyzed quite differently for

20

purposes of jurisdiction.

21

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Justice Ginsburg's

No.

This

The case is I

22

think not distinguishable from removals under the

23

Federal Officer Removal statute, where Congress has

24

indicated that it is the Federal defense that confers

25

jurisdiction rather than the Federal claim.
39

Alderson Reporting Company

Then, the

Official

ultimate merits of the Federal defense are irrelevant to

2

the jurisdictional issue.

3

And the Court -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you're saying there are

4

two claims, one claim is raised by the defense, and if

5

you look at that claim which is by definition Federal,

6

then it's fair to look at the original State claim by

7

analogy as a pendent claim?

8

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

Is that fair?

10

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor.

What happens if the

12

Attorney General doesn't certify and it goes to State

13

court?

14

that there will be a deprivation of jury trial if the

15

certification is wrong and if it's in Federal court.

16

Suppose that there is a denial of certification.

17

under (d)(3) -

I take it one of the concerns we have here is

18

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then

(D)(3).

-- the employee can ask

20

for a certification decision.

I take it that's a

21

Federal law defense that the, or a Federal law

22

point, that the State court must hear and so now we're

23

back in State court?

24

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

And we still don't have a

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jury trial and if that's so I'm not sure if that helps

2

you or helps the Petitioner.

3

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, I think that

4

Your Honor's point illustrates that this issue of Federal

5

law is one that Congress has mandated be resolved at the

6

outset by the judge, and if the employee petitions for

7

certification over the Attorney General's objection the

8

statute allows the Attorney General to remove the

9

petition to Federal court and the statute states that

10

the district court shall find and certify whether the

11

employee was acting within the scope.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in my case I guess I

13

don't think it ever gets to district court because

14

there's no certification, but then the employee can ask

15

the State court to have a bench trial on the scope of

16

employment.

17

Am I right about that?
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

He can, you are

18

correct.

It is at the option of the Attorney General

19

under (d)(3) to remove the case at that point so that

20

the review of his noncertification happens in Federal

21

court.

22

that if the district court holds that the Attorney

23

General was correct that the employee was not acting

24

within the scope the case is to be remanded to State

25

court.

(D)(3), in stark contrast to (d)(2), provides

So the presence of the remand 41

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But my point is I suppose

2

the Government can just say, we're not going to make the

3

certification and we're not going to remove.

4

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

So then the State court

6

still has to have the bench trial on the scope of

7

employment.

8

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's right.

I'm not sure if that helps.

10

It seems to me that might be an argument for limiting

11

the inquiry just so that we can avoid having bench

12

trials in almost every case.

13

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

The -- I think what

14

that illustrates is that Congress wanted the issue of

15

immunity resolved at the outset of the case by the

16

court.

17

the Westfall Act FTCA scheme is that if the immunity -

18

if the scope of employment issue is resolved in favor of

19

the employee, that has many, many consequences,

20

including that the United States is the proper

21

defendant, exclusive jurisdiction lies in the Federal

22

court, the case must be dismissed until an

23

administrative claim is filed and that avenue is

24

exhausted.

25

And one reason that that is so essential under

All of these procedural and substantive

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right, but that's the

4

strongest argument I thought the other way initially,

5

that suppose the issue is whether he is on a frolic of

6

his own.

7

answer he was, okay, it stays in the Federal court

8

anyway.

That you resolve in a bench trial.

If the

I understand that.

9

But if you're going to take your position

10

whether, say, it's a sexual assault as it was in Wood

11

and the question is well, was there a sexual assault or

12

not, and if there was it's clearly outside of the scope

13

of employment, well, then you're going to have all these

14

things resolved in a bench trial and actually it's

15

supposed to normally be before a jury, for example.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that so?

If the

17

employee is resubstituted, it's going on now, the United

18

States is not a party, just the Federal employee, but

19

it's staying in Federal court under this pendent

20

jurisdiction-like theory, wouldn't either party be

21

entitled to a jury trial?

22

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Yes.

Yes, Your

23

Honor.

I think Justice Breyer's question, though, had

24

to do with the procedure at the certification review

25

stage.

That is to be done by the district court sitting
43
Alderson Reporting Company

without jury and that's because under the statute the

Attorney General's certification has the legal effect of

making the United States the defendant.

the United States and the United States shall be

5

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No, Your Honor, I

And we have two arguments that both the

issues, substitution and remand, are appealable.

8

a very specific one and that is that Congress has

9

categorically taken this kind of remand outside the

court's authority under 1447(c) by specifically

prohibiting remand at all in 2679(d)(2), and that

argument of course would not have relevance, I don't

13

think, much beyond this case.

14

recognized that Congress can exempt a certain class of

15

orders from the scope of 47(c) and (d) without

16

cross-referencing those provisions.

17

the Court said that that specific removal provision did

18

not purport to impair or restrict the application of the

19

then equivalents of 747(c) and (d).

20

2679(d)(2) does purport to impair the authority to

remand by making the certification conclusive for

purposes of removal.

argument -

And this Court has

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the problem, and

maybe I'm missing, and I may be missing something here,

10

but isn't the problem with your argument is that the

11

statute didn't come out and say you can't remand.

12

statute said, for purposes of removal, the certification

13

is conclusive, and that allows for the kind of dichotomy

14

that you and I were talking with before.

15

say look, I know that I have article III jurisdiction

16

here, but in point of fact I am, I am remanding because

17

what you and I are calling here the pendent claim does

not support any of the Government's theory.

the case, then under 1447(d), there could be a review of

it because it was not a jurisdictional ruling.

21

on the contrary, the judge said, as I think the judge

said here, I am remanding because based on this

23

analysis, I do not have jurisdiction, i.e., the judge

went against the statute saying that jurisdiction is

conclusive.
