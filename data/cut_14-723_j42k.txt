             ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

9

              ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

            MR. STRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

and may it please the Court:

12

            In this ERISA case, a fiduciary has sued a

13

beneficiary to establish and enforce an equitable lien

14

by agreement.

15

            As this Court has repeatedly acknowledged,

16

an equitable lien is enforceable only against specific

17

property and its traceable product in the defendant's

18

possession.

19

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Mr. Stris, there's some

20

fuzziness about the facts in this case, and maybe at the

21

outset you can clarify them.

22

            Different figures are given about how much

23

money from this settlement was actually delivered to

24

your client.  And also, what did your client do with it?

25

Did he put it with his general assets, or did he keep it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

4
1

in a separate fund?

2

            Maybe you can start by answering those

3

questions.

4

            MR. STRIS:  I think I can, Justice Ginsburg.

5

            So I  I want to start with what's in the

6

record, and then I want to add some color that I think

7

will provide context.

8

            So as far as what's in the record, there was

9

a genuine issue of  of material fact on how much

10

dissipation there was.  One thing that's clear from the

11

record is that 

12

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Before we get to

13

dissipation, how much did he receive?

14

            MR. STRIS:  Yes.  So that's clear, he

15

received over time, after all expenses were out, about

16

$200,000.

17

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  200.

18

            MR. STRIS:  I think that's clear from the

19

record.

20

            What's also clear procedurally  and this

21

is important, and this is Page 64 of the Joint

22

Appendix  is that he took the position in opposing

23

summary judgment that he has very little of the money

24

remaining, and he cited a declaration and an attached

25

sheet that I admit are confusing.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

1

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  And  and this $200,000,

2

did he put it in a general account or was it set aside

3

in a specific account?

4

            MR. STRIS:  It is nothing in the record to

5

indicate that, but I think as far as the rules work, it

6

wouldn't matter because the rules for equitable lien by

7

agreement, the tracing rules, are actually very robust,

8

Justice Kagan.  And so as equity evolved, you cannot

9

dissipate money by putting it in its own account and

10

spending it.  Something called the "lowest intermediate

11

balance rule" developed to prevent against precisely the

12

kind of mischief that we would reasonably worry about.

13

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But Mr. Stris, it does

14

make a difference, because if he just put it, say, in

15

the bank account where he had all of his other money,

16

then how  how could we say that he spent all of the

17

proceeds on childcare and living expenses?  If you have

18

one mixed pot, how can we say, oh, yes, this came from

19

the settlement and not from his general funds?

20

            MR. STRIS:  It's a very fair question,

21

Justice Ginsburg.  And there  there are settled

22

tracing rules at equity, and it worked as follows:

23

            If you took money and it was cash and you

24

put it in a bank account, what was presumed was that,

25

unless your total cash assets dipped below the amount

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

6
1

that you got, that the spending that you did was not out

2

of that, the creditor's rights were not impaired.

3

            So the only way we would prevail on

4

remand  I want to be clear about the modesty of the

5

position that we're taking here.  The only way we would

6

prevail on remand is if he got the money and he spent it

7

down  all of his money, not just the settlement but

8

all of the cash that he had  down below the  the

9

amount of the settlement.

10

            That's why this is very important.

11

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Well, what 

12

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I  I don't

13

know if it's the right Latin phrase or  "pro tanto" or

14

something.  I mean, you would lose  it  it  it

15

doesn't have to spend it all the way down.  Whatever is

16

left would be subject to tracing.

17

            MR. STRIS:  Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

18

correct.  But the point I was trying to make is, there

19

is a big difference between the way equity worked, which

20

was to have a sensible rule below its intermediate

21

balance, and what I view as the extreme swollen asset

22

theory, that never was applied at equity, that my friend

23

Mr. Katyal is advocating.

24

            Under the swollen asset theory, if you get

25

new money in the future, if you spend below the lowest

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

7
1

intermediate balance but then you start earning income,

2

people can come and garnish your wages.  So the  the

3

point that I'm making here is that the equity

4

lienbyagreement remedy is actually far more robust

5

than one would think if one read the briefs of the other

6

side.

7

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Equitable lien by

8

agreement.

9

            Was there an agreement  do you think

10

there's an agreement here because of the Plan?

11

            MR. STRIS:  I think the  that issue, we've

12

lost.  So I mean, you know  I think that's another

13

important point, Justice Kennedy.  We hear a lot about a

14

promisebreaking by beneficiaries.  And that happens.

15

And those are legitimate concerns.  But from where I'm

16

sitting, I see a lot of cases where there's

17

promisebreaking by fiduciaries, where they take a

18

reimbursement provision that's preempted in an insured

19

plan and then try and enforce it, or where they try and

20

enforce a provision that doesn't apply by its own terms.

21

            So when we're thinking from the perspective

22

of, is this a sensible rule that is consistent with the

23

broad purposes of ERISA, I think it very much is because

24

if you take the ability of fiduciaries to reach the

25

general assets of participants 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

8
1

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Just as a background

2

matter, when we left, as I understand, Great 

3

GreatWest, we left  left the issue open.  If the

4

beneficiary receives a check that by mistake is three

5

times more than it should be, but he may think it's a

6

bonus, he may not understand; he spends it all.  Is

7

there an  or is there a legal action that the Plan can

8

take to recover that money?

9

            MR. STRIS:  Yes.  If  if  if I could not

10

answer it yes or no for a minute, and I promise I'll

11

come back to a yes or no.  I think it's a very important

12

question, because this happens all the time in the

13

pension context.

14

            So the first thing I'm going to tell you is

15

that usually when that's the case, there is an error on

16

the part of the Plan.  And our view is even if there

17

were no remedy, that it's not consistent with the

18

purposes of ERISA or the way historical equity practice

19

worked to make the participant the insurer of that type

20

of error.

21

            Now, there are remedies, and here's what

22

they are under ERISA.  The first one is a setoff

23

remedy.  And in exception II C of the GreatWest

24

opinion, you  this Court made that very clear.

25

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  For future payments.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

1

            MR. STRIS:  Against future payments.  And 

2

and that's used repeatedly in pending and disability

3

cases 

4

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Suppose that weren't

5

available.

6

            MR. STRIS:  Okay.  So if that's not

7

available, if  if you have a case where there's

8

outright fraud  and I don't think that's your  your

9

fact pattern.  But if you have a case where there is

10

outright fraud  and I've seen these, where a

11

participant receives money because they claim that

12

someone is still alive, but they're actually dead, I

13

think that there is a remedy there, because in terms of

14

outright fraud 

15

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  In law.

16

            MR. STRIS:  Well, the second prong of Davila

17

wouldn't be satisfied.

18

            So ERISA does not  ERISA's broad

19

preemptive sweep does not go so far as to stop plans

20

from policing outright fraud.

21

            Now, the more difficult issue is your

22

question 

23

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Right.

24

            MR. STRIS:   which is, what if there's not

25

outright fraud?  What is  what is the obligation of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

10
1

the beneficiary who gets that check and knows it's three

2

times, you know, what I got, like, this can't be right.

3

You know, if  if the beneficiary is a bad actor and

4

says, you know, I'm going to get one over on the Plan,

5

and I'm going to keep this money, and I'm going to spend

6

it, in the rare case where that person was of limited

7

means and they spent the money down and it was

8

dissipated, I think unfortunately, I would have to say

9

that I  I think a plan would not have a remedy.  But

10

the reality is that's a very rare case.

11

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  And  and  and because

12

State law, legal remedies are preempted by ERISA?

13

            MR. STRIS:  Yes.  That's essentially 

14

that's essentially the regime.

15

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Is that a position that's

16

generally accepted, or is this an arguable point?

17

            MR. STRIS:  From the perspective of this

18

Court's cases, or  or 

19

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Yes.  Yes.

20

            MR. STRIS:  Well, I mean, I think the  the

21

letter of your cases 

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I  I thought

23

GreatWestern had left that open.

24

            MR. STRIS:  Yes.  So I think that's fair.

25

The letter of your cases does not bind  does not bind

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

11
1

us here.  I'm  I'm not making a pure statutory stare

2

decisis argument, but if 

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I'm just asking, is there

4

a rule in the courts of appeals, or in the  in the

5

legal system generally, or  or are they divided on

6

this, or just nothing written on it?

7

            MR. STRIS:  Well, in the context of ERISA,

8

how you would rule on this case would determine that

9

issue.  And so the  the circuits are split.  That's

10

why I think the issue is very important.  This is not

11

just a subrogation matter.  This is an issue that will

12

have dramatic impact in the pension and the disability

13

context as well.

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Counsel, if  if

15

you prevail here and are representing a fund, what would

16

you advise them to do so they don't confront this result

17

in the future?

18

            MR. STRIS:  Yes.  It's  it's  it's a

19

good question.  And I do advise funds.  And I think that

20

there is a simple answer, which is funds that are

21

responsible and sophisticated will do exactly what

22

they've always done.  And this is a very important

23

point:  Funds are always worried about dissipation.

24

Health insurers have always been worried, and here's

25

why.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

12
1

            The  the mine run of individuals who get a

2

large tort settlement  this is just a reality of

3

life  they're effectively judgmentproof except for

4

that tort settlement.  So the remedy doesn't matter.  In

5

other words, even if you had a compensatory damages

6

remedy in most cases, once that money is spent, you've

7

got nothing.  So what health insurers and plans have

8

done since well before GreatWest and has continued to

9

do it after GreatWest is, when a medical claim is

10

submitted, they investigate it carefully.  And they look

11

and flag the ones where there is likely a tort  there

12

could be a tort recovery.  They monitor them carefully,

13

either internally or through outside subrogation agents.

14

And they act promptly.

15

            And, you know, I'm not going to say it's not

16

a dance, because we see a lot of litigation in this area

17

because there is a lot of money passing through, but

18

plans have faced this problem since before GreatWest.

19

These policy arguments about how this is a concern about

20

dissipation were made in GreatWest.  And I just think

21

they're  they're substantially overrun.

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  When you say "they

23

act promptly," what do they act promptly to do?  And is

24

it always the case that they can act promptly enough?

25

            MR. STRIS:  No.  The  you know, whatever

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

13
1

rule you pick, there will be cases where we don't like

2

the result on both sides.  I can give you examples on

3

the  on the other side as well.  But 

4

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, presumably in

5

the  in the hypothetical, your  your opposing

6

counsel will be advising the recipient to, I  I

7

suppose, spend it right away, because then there won't

8

be anything left; it will have been dissipated, or put

9

it in different accounts, or  or commingle it with,

10

you  you know, a variety of things.  And I'm just

11

wondering if the solution you're advocating is going to

12

make life a lot more complicated and expensive for the

13

funds, which is, of course, contrary to the idea of

14

preserving the assets.

15

            MR. STRIS:  I  I understand that point.

16

I  I think the answer is, no, not in any meaningful

17

way.  And  and here's why.  You ask what you do.

18

Well, you write letters, and you put people on notice of

19

your lien.  And a lot of people are affected by that,

20

lawyers 

21

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  How do  how do you put

22

people on notice?  That's a 

23

            MR. STRIS:  Pardon?

24

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  That's a legal concept.

25

A letter is one thing.  But how  what is  what is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

14
1

necessary?  What is the action necessary?  Is it going

2

into court and say, enjoin this person from spending any

3

of that money?

4

            MR. STRIS:  Here's what plans do, and here's

5

what plans should do:  They  they write a letter.  The

6

minute they find out there's a settlement, they contact;

7

they ask to be paid.  If they're not paid immediately,

8

they say put this money in escrow because we have a

9

dispute.  If the person says no, you have a pretty good

10

idea that you might have a problem, and you go into

11

court.

12

            And this is a perfect example with regard to

13

Mr. Montanile.  There was six months of negotiation,

14

several letters where it was said, hey, if  if you

15

don't  if we don't decide by this date, we're going to

16

distribute the money.

17

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  How  how do you

18

find  how does the Plan find out that there's been a

19

settlement?

20

            MR. STRIS:  Well, they  they find out in

21

many ways.  So a lot of cases actually result  include

22

where there's large dollars amounts, and a lawsuit is

23

actually filed.

24

            But in cases where no lawsuit is filed,

25

there's traditional

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  The

2

lawsuit between whom and whom?

3

            MR. STRIS:  A State court lawsuit is filed.

4

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You mean by the

5

beneficiary to recover 

6

            MR. STRIS:  The tort.

7

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:   the tort claim?

8

            MR. STRIS:  Yes.

9

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  And how is the Plan

10

notified of that?

11

            MR. STRIS:  Well, because of the risks that

12

we're talking about right here in this dialogue, plans

13

are very sensitive to making sure that the minute that

14

there's a potential subrogation recovery, they write

15

letters to everyone:  To the participant, to the

16

participant's lawyer, to the tortfeasor, the

17

tortfeasor's lawyer, the insurer.  And they say we have

18

a lien, and please notify us if anything happens.

19

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Do they, heavily?

20

            MR. STRIS:  In some cases they do some; some

21

cases they don't.  That's ultimate 

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  But they say they do,

23

anyway?

24

            MR. STRIS:  Well, I've  I've seen both.

25

Look, I  I don't actually think it's a pretty

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

16
1

controversial point.  There are some people, no matter

2

where they're sitting, that misbehave.  And so I have

3

seen participants who break promises absolutely.  And

4

also, I've seen plans that are trying to enforce

5

provisions that are not enforceable.

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Would it basically,

7

ignoring the impact of that letter by a beneficiary, be

8

a basis for the sort of fraud action you were talking

9

about earlier?

10

            MR. STRIS:  No.  I don't think so.  I

11

believe 

12

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So the  the

13

beneficiary, even the beneficiary's counsel gets a

14

letter saying, by the way, we have a lien on this, you

15

know, good luck.  I hope you recover a fair amount.  But

16

if you do, make sure you put it in a separate account.

17

Make sure you notify us.

18

            And  and if the beneficiary or the lawyer

19

just ignores that, that's not a basis for fraud?

20

            MR. STRIS:  It would depend on the facts of

21

the case.  You know, I  merely ignoring the letter,

22

I'm not so sure.  But I guess I keep coming back to the

23

same point.  This is a legitimate problem.  I don't mean

24

to  to demean that at all, but this has always been a

25

problem.  And because of the fact that most people who

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

17
1

have these moneys are of limited means, the compensatory

2

damages remedy is  is of very little help.

3

            And so plans came to this Court in

4

GreatWest and said, oh, well this is going to be a

5

disaster if there's a present possession requirement.

6

And yet, it hasn't proven to be the case because people

7

in their circumstances act promptly, and in most

8

instances, they're able to protect their rights.

9

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Mr. Stris 

10

            JUSTICE ALITO:  This may be where the law

11

leads us.  But in your brief, you try to make the

12

argument that this is equitable in the ordinary sense of

13

the word.  And I don't understand that.  What sense does

14

all of this make?

15

            MR. STRIS:  Okay.  So that's a fair point,

16

but I  I would put it a little bit differently.  What

17

I would say is that I think a fairminded policymaker

18

could certainly pick the rule that we're describing.

19

I'm not going to get up here and tell you that it's the

20

rule that I would pick, but I think a fairminded

21

policymaker could  and particularly, Justice Alito,

22

when you appreciate that it's a rule that's going to

23

apply to all cases, not just subrogation.  I think the

24

case for this as a policy matter becomes much stronger

25

in the pension context.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

            The reason I make that point is I know that

2

I'm running up against this counterintuitive view that

3

how can our  how can our position, even if it's what

4

the cases say, even if the unbroken line of history

5

means this, how can it not be totally at odds with

6

the  the core purpose of ERISA?  And I think it's not.

7

It may not be the better policy in your view, but it's

8

certainly one that is consistent with the spirit of

9

ERISA, and so the decision that needs to be made is:

10

What is this line of cases that this Court has decided?

11

What did they say?

12

            And I think repeatedly from GreatWest to

13

Sereboff, you reiterated in CIGNA that in nonfiduciary

14

cases, a lien is not equitable relief unless it's

15

against property in the defendant's possession.  You

16

have adopted a historical test.

17

            And so unless applying it here is so

18

obviously at odds with the purposes of ERISA, I think

19

that applying that test, the unbroken line of

20

authorities tell us that the rule is you can only

21

enforce these liens against specific property or its

22

traceable product.

23

            If I could reserve.

            ORAL ARGUMENT OF GINGER D. ANDERS

2

   ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

                  SUPPORTING PETITIONER

4

            MS. ANDERS:  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

please the Court:

6

            If I could just start with Justice Alito's

7

question about what  what sense this framework makes,

8

in limiting available relief to equitable relief in

9

ERISA, Congress, I think, contemplated that there

10

wouldn't be a remedy for plan breaches in every case.

11

And so the framework this Court developed was to

12

distinguish between equitable relief on the one hand and

13

things like damages that, clearly, Congress didn't mean

14

to include in the relief that would be available.

15

            And so  I think it's been true since

16

GreatWest when this Court interpreted equitable relief

17

pretty narrowly that a beneficiary will have an

18

incentive in some cases to structure a settlement in

19

order to avoid paying reimbursement to the Plan.  But

20

it's also been true since GreatWest that because of

21

that, plans have a need to counter those incentives by

22

diligently protecting their rights.

23

            And so I think the way that the Court rules

24

in this case is not going to affect the existence of

25

those incentives on the part of beneficiaries or the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

20
1

need for plans to be diligent.  So I think it's

2

important to keep in mind here that the only reason this

3

issue comes up in this case is that the Plan wasn't

4

diligent, that the Plan waited for months when it knew

5

that it had a reimbursement claim, and that that was

6

being disputed.  It didn't seek an injunction.  It

7

didn't file suit.

8

            So yes, I think this is a situation that is

9

unlike the mine run of cases where we see that plans

10

since GreatWest have developed measures that they can

11

take in order to protect their rights.

12

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Ms. Anders, in

13

GreatWest, the government filed on the side of the

14

Plan.  What led the government to shift its position?

15

            MS. ANDERS:  I think in GreatWest, I think

16

we were taking a somewhat broader view of equitable

17

relief than the court ended up adopting in that case.

18

And so as we get here today, we've taken this position

19

because we think it is absolutely the logical

20

consequence of GreatWest and Sereboff together.

21

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  So you took your position

22

because of GreatWest?

23

            MS. ANDERS:  That's absolutely right.  In

24

GreatWest, the Court said that when the funds are not

25

in the beneficiary's possession, the Plan cannot enforce

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

21
1

an equitable lien  cannot get equitable relief against

2

the Plan.  And it relied on equitable authorities that

3

said, quoting, "If the property or its proceeds have

4

been dissipated so that no product remains, the

5

plaintiffs may not enforce a constructive trust or

6

equitable" 

7

            JUSTICE ALITO:  Probably what 

8

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  You thought  you

9

thought 

10

            JUSTICE ALITO:  I'm sorry.

11

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  But you thought

12

GreatWest adopted a  a narrower understanding of what

13

equitable meant in this context than you thought was

14

appropriate.

15

            MS. ANDERS:  I think at the time we were

16

arguing for a broader understanding.  But as we  as we

17

come here today, of course, nobody has  has argued

18

that GreatWest or Sereboff should be overturned, or

19

Mertens, for that matter.  And so we think the

20

consequence of those two decisions is that there will

21

not be relief in a case in which the Plan participant

22

has dissipated the funds.

23

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  But would you  say,

24

what is the government's position on commingling?

25

There's no  the beneficiary gets the check, puts it in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

22
1

his bank account, together with whatever else he has in

2

there.  So how do we tell if he's dissipated?

3

            MS. ANDERS:  I agree with my friend that the

4

commingling rule at equity, I think, reflected the fact

5

that once funds have been dissipated, the lienholder can

6

no longer collect.  So the way it worked was that if you

7

had funds in your account that  and you spent them,

8

that at first it would be presumed that you were

9

spending your own money.

10

            But  but once you got down below the

11

amount that  that was originally subject to the lien,

12

the lienholder would only be able to enforce against

13

whatever remained in that account even if it wasn't

14

sufficient to satisfy the lien amount.

15

            So it's basically the same dissipation rule

16

that applies in cases that don't involve commingling.

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why can't  in a case

18

where there's no time problem  forget the delays and

19

so forth  but like this one, the Plan sue the lawyer?

20

I mean, if there was $500,000 and the lawyer received

21

200,000  but he certainly received it with notice.

22

It's not any kind of goodfaith purchaser  why can't

23

they get it back from him?

24

            MS. ANDERS:  I think there may be situations

25

in which the Plan could sue the lawyer.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

23
1

            JUSTICE BREYER:  Why couldn't they normally

2

in my situation?

3

            MS. ANDERS:  I think they probably could.

4

            JUSTICE BREYER:  All right.  If they could,

5

then doesn't that solve the problem for them because

6

lawyers will be awfully careful not to dissipate the

7

funds if, in fact, they're going to be subject to the

8

lawsuit?

9

            MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think that's right, and

10

I think lawyers also have ethical rules that  that

11

prevent them from  from dissipating funds 

12

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  But wait a minute.  I mean,

13

if they can get it from the lawyer immediately, why

14

can't they get it from the lawyer at  at the end of

15

the day?  I mean, do you mean that  that the  the

16

fund can get back not only what the beneficiary

17

receives, but also what he has paid his lawyer?

18

            MS. ANDERS:  No.  I just mean that  that

19

if the funds are in the lawyer's possession, the lawyer

20

is the agent of  of the  of the beneficiary, I think

21

in that situation, equity would permit the plaintiff,

22

the lienholder to trace that  that lien amount.

23

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  To  to get the whole

24

amount from the lawyer, right, so leaving the lawyer

25

without his fee?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

24
1

            MS. ANDERS:  Yes.  I  I think that could

2

be correct.  I mean 

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought in most States,

4

the lawyer has a lien on the fee.  His lien is prior 

5

I may be wrong.  His  his lien, the lawyer's lien is

6

prior to the 

7

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Yeah.

8

            MS. ANDERS:  I think 

9

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That has to be or nobody

10

would take these cases.

11

            (Laughter.)

12

            MS. ANDERS:  That may be correct.  I

13

don't  I don't think this situation has come up very

14

much.  But I 

15

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I don't see why it would

16

be.  There is a fund.  The fund belongs to person X.

17

The lawyer knows it belongs to person X.  Nonetheless,

18

the lawyer takes $200,000 out of the money that belongs

19

to person X and gives 300,000 to the client.

20

            I assume the client is more likely to spend

21

money down than the lawyer, because lawyers tend, in

22

general, to have a largely bank account than poorer

23

clients.  So therefore, I do not see why they wouldn't

24

sue the lawyer.

25

            But they aren't, so there's something I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

25
1

didn't understand; hence, I a.m. asking the question.

2

            MS. ANDERS:  All right.  Well, I don't think

3

 I don't think it's come up very much, but I do think

4

it's possible that in some situations, plans may be able

5

to sue the lawyers.  They can sue other 

6

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  I think it must depend on

7

how the agreement reads, and I can't imagine the

8

agreement wouldn't  wouldn't require the beneficiary

9

to turn over the net.  Not the gross, but the net

10

recovery, what  what he receives after paying legal

11

fees.

12

            MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think a lot of these

13

plans are going to disclaim a common fund or  or 

14

you know, they're going to disclaim their  their 

15

any obligation to have the attorneys' fees counted

16

against them.  So the  the person is not 

17

            JUSTICE BREYER:  I'm 

18

            MS. ANDERS:   going to  the entire

19

amount 

20

            JUSTICE BREYER:   thinking in my mind 

21

            MS. ANDERS:   but just to  just to make

22

a  a broader 

23

            JUSTICE BREYER:  There is a model.  There is

24

a  two diamond rings belonging to a trustee.  They end

25

up being given to the cousin.  The lawyer has them in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

26
1

his safe.  I do not believe that no matter what the

2

agreement between the cousin and the lawyer, the lawyer

3

can take the diamond ring that belongs to somebody

4

else  and he knows it  and put it in his pocket, no

5

matter what the agreement.

6

            MS. ANDERS:  Right.  He's not a bona fide

7

purchaser for value in that situation.

8

            But I think the Plans do have many other

9

remedies in these situations.  They can trace against 

10

against any third party who takes the  the property

11

with notice of the lien.  They  they could monitor the

12

litigation.  They can intervene in these suits.  They

13

can seek injunctions.  These are all things that the

14

Plan here did not do.

15

            And just to  to pick up on a point that my

16

friend was making, I do think that this is a situation

17

in which reasonable policymakers could differ.  There

18

are legitimate concerns on both sides.  It is absolutely

19

a legitimate concern that in some cases a plan may not

20

be able to recover even if it has diligently protected

21

the rights.  But 

22

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  All  all of those

23

things you say  all of those things you say the Plan

24

can do, though, are  are a lot more complicated than

25

simply saying they should be able to recover that to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

27
1

which they're entitled under the agreement.  And when

2

you get into  we've noted before that we try to avoid

3

complicating the procedures in this area, for the simple

4

reason that nobody has to set up one of these plans.

5

And if they don't know, you know, how much it's going to

6

cost in advance and all of them just say, well, it's not

7

worth it, and if I've got to go and file injunctions or

8

this or that every time somebody makes a  has a tort

9

recovery, you know  but I'm not going to do it.  I

10

won't set up one of these plans.

11

            MS. ANDERS:  Well, I think  I think an

12

important point, Your Honor, is that no matter how the

13

Court rules here, the Plans are going to have those

14

obligations and they're going to have those burdens,

15

because GreatWest permits beneficiaries to structure

16

their settlements to avoid paying reimbursement to the

17

Plan.

18

            So because of that, ever since GreatWest,

19

Plans have taken these measures and  and they will

20

continue to take them even if the Court rules for

21

Respondents.

22

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  What are the concerns on

23

the other side, which you have mentioned and  and

24

which your  your friend also mentioned?  What are

25

they?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

28
1

            MS. ANDERS:  So one concern, as you said, is

2

that  that whatever rule the Court announces, it's

3

going to apply in the pension and disability benefit

4

context too.  And in that situation, the Plan may be

5

making overpayments to beneficiaries over a long period

6

of time.  And the beneficiary may spend the money

7

without knowing that she's going to be responsible for

8

reimbursing it later, or  or that it's not her money

9

to spend in a sense.  And so in that situation, I think

10

a policymaker could be concerned that  about a plan

11

being able to go  go back months or years later and 

12

and get reimbursement from the beneficiary.

13

            So I think, you know, this is really a

14

question for Congress.  But what Congress could do is it

15

could weigh that potential against the downside to the

16

Plan, the fact that, since GreatWest, they have  they

17

have had these obligations, they have needed to

18

diligently protect their rights, and, I think, in the

19

minerun of cases, they've been able to do so.

20

            So I think those are the things that

21

Congress could weigh in looking at the policy  policy

22

concerns on either side of this.

23

            And that's why we think those concerns

24

really shouldn't drive the analysis here.  The 

25

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Ms. Anders, could I  could

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

29
1

I shift gears a little bit and  and just ask:  The

2

test that we've set up is whether a remedy is typically

3

available at equity.  And there's been some

4

backandforth, I think, about what that means.

5

            What does it mean?

6

            MS. ANDERS:  I think "typically available in

7

equity" meant remedies that were considered to be

8

equitable in nature.  And so it certainly did not

9

include, as this Court said in Merten, the type of 

10

Mertens, the type of  relief, such as deficiency

11

judgments or lien destruction damages, that that Court

12

thought of as legal to the end of the  the time of the

13

divided bench.

14

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

             ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

17

               ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

            MR. KATYAL:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

19

and may it please the Court:

20

            Three things are undisputed.

21

            First, that Montanile signed a form saying,

22

quote, "I agree to reimburse in full the Plan from any

23

settlement."

24

            Second, the Plan provides that such funds

25

are, quote, "Assets of the Plan not distributable to any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

30
1

person without the Plan's written release."

2

            And third, under Sereboff, that the Plan

3

would have an enforcement claim under 502(a)(3) if

4

Montanile still possessed the funds.

5

            What we're disagreeing about is whether

6

Montanile's decision to commit a second wrong of

7

spending the Plan's money himself has made him

8

judgmentproof.  And the answer is no for a very simple

9

reason:  When a right under equity has attached and a

10

defendant then knowingly frustrates that equitable

11

claim, it is absolutely part of equity to permit that

12

claim.  This reflects the cold reality that the

13

defendant took actions that blocked an otherwise valid

14

claim in equity.

15

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I  I have no idea

16

where you think this lien attached.  Do you think it

17

attached at the fund, immediate  the whole 500,000, or

18

the amount of that 500,000 that ended up in his pocket,

19

or that 500,000 minus what, if anything?

20

            MR. KATYAL:  So it  it's  Barnes says

21

that the  that the lien attaches at the moment that he

22

is  that he has gotten title to the thing.  He gets

23

title to the thing when there is a $500,000 settlement.

24

Settlement, of course, that we didn't know about, but

25

that he nonetheless did.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

            Our only 

2

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  So your position is at

3

that moment it goes to the lawyer, it's his money, all

4

500,000.  You're entitled to whatever 

5

            MR. KATYAL:  To a  to a lien of $121,000

6

on it.

7

            And so our claim is not that we have some

8

general remedy at law that we can get compensatory

9

consequential damages or punitive damages.  It's limited

10

by the lien itself.

11

            And that is the rule in equity, that when

12

someone frustrates a valid claim in equity by taking

13

actions to dissipate the fund, you can get 

14

recover the value of that fund.  You can't recover more

15

than that.  So this is the bitter with the sweet that

16

when  when you make an equitable claim like this, you

17

have to be limited by all the rules of equity.

18

            So in addition to that, Justice Sotomayor,

19

we couldn't, for example, try and attach the asset, try

20

and attach and file a lawsuit, until he actually took

21

possession of the funds.

22

            JUSTICE BREYER:  So I  I found a list.  On

23

this list I have, one, there is the fund, 500,000 in it.

24

It belongs to the company, not to him.

25

            Now, he takes the fund and he begins to

distribute it with the aid of his lawyer.  Some of the

2

money goes to the lawyer.  If that money is still there,

3

I imagine you could get it.

4

            Some of the lawyer's goes to his bank

5

account.  If, in fact, that bank account has not gone,

6

from the time he put it there to the time you sue, below

7

$121,000, you can get it.  Indeed  and if it has gone

8

below, you can still get it even if there's a penny, but

9

you can only get the penny.

10

            If he has taken the 121,000 out of it and

11

given it to a person with knowledge, for example, his

12

wife or children, and it is in their bank account, I

13

guess you could get it.

14

            And indeed, if they have got and bought with

15

it some tangible item that you can trace it to, I guess

16

you can get it.

17

            But what we could not find and, in fact, if

18

you can't find any of those, you could still sue him

19

under State law, under State fraud statutes, and recover

20

in damages.  That's at law.  And maybe you can do it

21

even under such a remedy where it's much more mixed up

22

than the other side was prepared to give you credit for,

23

in which case, you have State law remedies at law.

24

            Now, what I could not find is a case

25

embodying the theory you are now advancing, that he

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

33
1

simply gets the damages even where he doesn't have any

2

of the remedies that I just mentioned.

3

            MR. KATYAL:  So  so first of all, we're

4

not advancing that theory, Justice Breyer.  You cannot

5

get  we're not advancing a damages theory whatsoever.

6

All we're saying is that you can recover the value of

7

the lien itself when someone frustrates an equitable

8

claim that otherwise exists.

9

            And we point to three different traditions

10

in equity that permit you to do that:  substitutionary

11

monetary decrees, deficiency judgments, and swollen

12

assets.  All of those reflect the basic idea that

13

someone shouldn't profit from their second wrong, their

14

wrongdoing of dissipating a fund.

15

            So look, there is a  they're absolutely

16

right.  The general rule is that you can't recover from

17

general assets.  That is absolutely right.  But there's

18

an urban legend that  that I think the briefs try and

19

spin around that rule, to say that that general rule

20

encompasses a situation when someone acts wrongfully to

21

dissipate a fund, as to which someone has a claim.

22

            And that circumstance, just as Holmes's

23

opinion in Otis says, he says, if the complaint, quote,

24

"seeks the recovery of an identified fund, that

25

complaint will not fail because the fund is gone and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

34
1

misappropriated by the defendants.  Rather, under those

2

circumstances, the plaintiff has a right to compensation

3

as alternative relief."

4

            That's not damages 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  That would be wonderful, if

6

he said "has an equitable right to compensation."  I

7

mean, you know, that sounds like cleanup to me.

8

            MR. KATYAL:  No, it's not, Justice Scalia.

9

I think it's not, for several reasons.

10

            Number one is, of course, in that case, the

11

entire fund was gone.  So if it were cleanup

12

jurisdiction, there had to be something to pend to.

13

There had some ancillary jurisdiction, some equitable

14

claim.  There had to be some fund that was still

15

remaining in order for there to be something to pend to.

16

There wasn't there.  The entire fund was gone.

17

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is  is  is that the

18

requirement?

19

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, I think that otherwise 

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Is some of the fund there?

21

            MR. KATYAL:  Otherwise, Your Honor, there

22

wouldn't have been any reason  there is a requirement

23

that, in order for 

24

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  There was an equitable

25

jurisdiction, so long as the person had possession of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

35
1

the fund at one point.

2

            MR. KATYAL:  I don't think that there's 

3

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  And then  and when the

4

suit is completed, it's discovered that all of the fund

5

is gone.

6

            MR. KATYAL:  No, your Honor.  If  if their

7

argument is right, and this is something that Judge

8

Posner has said, for example, in  in describing this

9

in the Medtronic case.  In order for ancillary

10

jurisdiction to exist, there has to first be a valid

11

equitable claim.  And then, for the convenience of the

12

parties, you can resolve a legal claim.

13

            In Otis there was no equitable claim under

14

their theory, which  which is, you  you know, if the

15

fund is gone, there's no lien that it's attached.  It's

16

gone.  It's dissipated.

17

            So  and then it also say, you know, it's a

18

remarkable that they say that all of these cases are

19

cleanup jurisdiction.

20

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Wait.  If  if  if

21

there's no equitable cause of action for them, why is

22

there for you?

23

            MR. KATYAL:  Because we think that the

24

proposition that they're trying to say is wrong, the

25

idea that when you dissipate a fund, you lose your

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

36
1

equitable claim.

2

            Our point is that is  that's generally

3

true; not true in a circumstance when a defendant

4

frustrates an otherwise valid equitable claim.

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  So  so you ought to be

6

able to bring suit in equity without asserting that the

7

person ever had the fund in his hands.

8

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, you can't do that, of

9

course.

10

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You say, he owes me the

11

money.

12

            MR. KATYAL:  You can't do that, of course,

13

as Knudson says.  And  and that's a standard rule.

14

We're not here 

15

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  You're saying even if you

16

know the person has dissipated all the funds, you can

17

sue for the equitable lien, even if you know the funds

18

are all gone?

19

            MR. KATYAL:  Correct, Your Honor.  As long

20

as that was a knowing dissipation, that that's what

21

happened.  And that's what the substitutionary momentary

22

cases 

23

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Do you have any cases?

24

            MR. KATYAL:  Sure.  Otis itself is a case

25

that does that.  Justice Homes's opinion, Justice Story

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

37
1

has a description of other cases in his treatise.

2

Our  our brief talks about the Baxter case and the 

3

and the Bank of Marin case.  These are the closest

4

analogue to this case, because they're not the general

5

rule about can you recover from general assets; they're

6

about the specific rule, can you profit from your

7

wrongdoing when an equitable lien by attachments is 

8

or an equitable lien by agreement is already attached.

9

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  It has to be pretty

10

easy for you to protect yourself, doesn't it, as soon as

11

at some suitable time after the injury you do write a

12

letter to the person and say, look, you need to know

13

that if you sue somebody, the money is ours, and because

14

we have these rights of subrogation, or let us know if

15

you're going to, and we'll show up in court with you

16

and  and  and help you?

17

            Where  see, I guess it would probably be

18

pretty easy to  to monitor it yourself.  I mean, the

19

court's computerized dockets, you just punch in

20

"Montanile," and  and whenever that pops up on the

21

docket and you find out right away.  It's certainly long

22

before the case is resolved.  It  it doesn't 

23

I mean, I  I think your friend has  has a

24

significant point that it's actually not as hard as it

25

might appear.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

38
1

            MR. KATYAL:  So  so three things, Your

2

Honor.  First, we're not grounding our argument in the

3

policy of things.  We do think that the policy

4

consequences are  are important, but we think that if

5

the test is what's traditionally available in equity,

6

these three specific lines of authority that we're

7

pointing to answer that question.

8

            But as to the policy concerns, we think

9

exactly as you said to my friend on the other side.

10

There are two big problems with that.  Number one is

11

Plans don't get noticed about when settlements occur.

12

In the amicus brief from NASP explains most auto

13

accidents, for example, are settled without any public

14

record, without any lawsuit being filed whatsoever.  So

15

you can't exactly type it into Westlaw or something like

16

that.  So that's one problem.

17

            The other is that it becomes very expensive

18

for Plans to monitor this stuff.  And Plans are, you

19

know, some for profit entity.  Every dollar that you

20

spend that the Plan has to spend on monitoring or

21

writing these letters or filing lawsuits or filing TROs

22

is a dollar that is taken away from innocent Plan

23

beneficiaries, people who have done 

24

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Right.  I mean,

25

that's the point we have made in our precedents, but it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

39
1

can't  you can't carry that so far that otherwise you

2

would say, well, the Plan always wins.

3

            MR. KATYAL:  Right.  I'm certainly not

4

trying to do that.  All I'm saying is that the policy

5

arguments here, I do think, are substantial and have

6

weight.  The amicus briefs, before you say, over a

7

billion dollars each year is recovered through these

8

reimbursement actions.  And  and if you adopt their

9

plan, then as you were saying as to my friend, you're

10

going to just tell the client  you are  telling the

11

Montaniles of the world, spend that money right away.

12

Settle the case at 10:00, and by 10:01 spend all the

13

money.  And in that circumstance, then Plans are out of

14

luck.  Innocent beneficiaries, that means, are out of

15

luck, and people like Mr. Montanile get a double

16

recovery.  And equity is not so brittle.  There is no

17

tradition in equity that supports this idea.

18

            As, Justice Alito, you were saying, how

19

could this make any sense?  It didn't make sense at

20

equity.  Equity has always been more flexible than that.

21

It's always recognized the idea that people shouldn't be

22

able to profit from their wrongdoing, and that rights

23

have remedies, and avoiding formalistic distinctions.

24

            And speaking of formalistic distinctions,

25

the Solicitor General's rule is as formalistic as it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

40
1

gets because they say you can get the remedy out of

2

general assets as long as the lawsuit is filed in time

3

for  the lawsuit is filed  is filed at a time when

4

there was possession of the fund.  That is 

5

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Mr. Katyal, equity itself

6

is a formalistic distinction.  I mean, to  to argue

7

that  that we shouldn't make formalistic distinctions

8

in trying to figure out whether particular relief is

9

equitable relief or not, I don't  that's

10

incomprehensible to me.

11

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Scalia, as

12

Justice Frankfurter says, equity, quote, "assures

13

mechanical rules and depends on flexibility."  Every

14

equity treatise  look at Pomeroy, for example, of

15

Section 111.  All the other treatises say 

16

            JUSTICE SCALIA:  Pomeroy doesn't  doesn't

17

support you as 

18

            MR. KATYAL:  I think very much 

19

            JUSTICE SCALIA:   Pomeroy's quotes are

20

contrary to what you 

21

            MR. KATYAL:   very much it does.  There is

22

not a quote from Pomeroy or from any of the other

23

treatises that deal with this situation when someone is

24

trying to profit from their second wrong, when there is

25

already an equitable lien by attaches.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

41
1

            And, you know, for example, Pomeroy, just on

2

the flexibility interchange, were saying, Section 111,

3

"Equity has followed the true principle of contriving

4

its remedy so they shall correspond both to the primary

5

right of the injured party and to the wrong by which

6

that right has been violated.  It has therefore never

7

placed any limits on the remedies it can grant either

8

with respect to their substance, their form or their

9

extent, but it's always preserved the elements of

10

flexibility and expansiveness so that they can be

11

modified to meet the requirements of every case."

12

            And this is a perfect example 

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I don't know

14

that you can read our precedence in this area to say

15

that they're very flexible.  I mean, Sereboff, the

16

difference between equitable lien for restitution and

17

equitable lien by agreement, you  you know, you can

18

get, you know, deficiency judgments as opposed to legal

19

judgments, and whether one's sort of an adjunct to the

20

equitable action or freestanding.  It's an area where

21

the  the equity rules strikes me as very technical.

22

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, they are technical when

23

it comes to that first question, is there an equitable

24

claim in the first  first instance.  And so Knudson,

25

for example, says no, because there's no possession of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

42
1

the fund.  Sereboff says here there is possession;

2

therefore, there is.

3

            We don't quibble with any of that.  Here as

4

this case comes to the Court, everyone agrees  that's

5

the third point I made at the outset  everyone agrees

6

there was an equitable lien by agreement.  The only

7

thing we're disagreeing about is whether or not by

8

spending all the funds we've lost our remedy.

9

            And with respect to that question, they have

10

general precedents which say you can't go after general

11

assets.  We agree with that.  The relevant question is,

12

when someone has wrong  when  when  when a valid

13

equitable lien by agreement attaches and then someone

14

acts to dissipate that, can they profit from their

15

wrong.

16

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The  the essence of

17

GreatWestern  I don't know if I'm reading it rightly

18

or not.  I'll certainly be corrected by the author and

19

dissenters if I'm not.  But it seemed to me that they're

20

basically saying, whatever remedy you have has to be an

21

equitable remedy.

22

            MR. KATYAL:  Right.

23

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  The most that I read

24

about a substitution decree or deficiency decree is that

25

it's an ancillary jurisdiction to issue those.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

43
1

            Is that consistent with saying it's

2

equitable?  Isn't it just a legal claim that equity

3

sometimes permitted an  an equitable court to

4

exercise, but wouldn't it still be legal 

5

            MR. KATYAL:  Right.  Justice 

6

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:   and not within 

7

within the  the scope of ERISA?

8

            MR. KATYAL:  Justice Sotomayor, this is,

9

again, part of the urban legend that  that's being

10

developed around this.  There is no case that says that

11

a substitutionary monetary decree is a legal judgment or

12

is ancillary.  To the contrary, cases that we're citing

13

such as Baxter and Otis suggest that it is an equity not

14

in that.  And  and indeed, if there's any doubt about

15

this, I  I suggest that you'd have to say it's equity,

16

because the tradition for ancillary, which was pendent

17

jurisdiction was, if an equity court was going to decide

18

a legal claim, they had to label it as a legal claim

19

because of the Seventh Amendment reasons, because

20

otherwise, they might, you know, there's  there's all

21

sorts of jury trial issues that come up.

22

            So that's why the tradition for cleanup

23

jurisdiction was to label those claims specifically to

24

say, okay, first we're going to solve our  our

25

equitable claim, and now we're going to turn as part of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

44
1

our pendent jurisdiction 

2

            JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:  I'm still a little bit

3

confused by all of this.  In my mind, you get money when

4

somebody gives it to you.  And I  I know that a lawyer

5

is an agent, but the agent is keeping a piece of the

6

money.  You can still go after the client for the piece

7

the lawyer took?

8

            MR. KATYAL:  So with  with respect to

9

the  the lawyer piece is much more complicated.  And

10

this goes to Justice Breyer's question.  I mean, there's

11

actually a circuit split on this question about can you

12

go after the lawyer, and the reason why you may not be

13

able to go after the lawyer is the lawyer is not a party

14

to the underlying agreement.

15

            And that's what I think the Eighth Circuit

16

says in contradistinction to others.  And so that's 

17

that  that it is  that is not a great remedy.  And,

18

of course, it requires the lawyer to be on notice of the

19

Plan and all the reimbursement obligations and the like.

20

            Under equity, Justice Sotomayor, I think the

21

idea is that when someone has made a valid promise to 

22

for these funds, such as here, Montanile knew that he

23

was playing with house money.  He knew that these

24

weren't his  this wasn't his money; it was the Plan's

25

money from the start.  And then he goes and spends that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

45
1

money on other things.  Yes, you can go after his

2

general assets to recover that spending on other things.

3

            And that is something amply supported by

4

these three different traditions in the case law.  Those

5

are the closest analogs to what's going on here when

6

someone has dissipated and frustrated a  an action

7

that  that otherwise existed.

8

            JUSTICE GINSBURG:  Can you say again, when

9

does the lien attach?  Is it when the tortfeasor pays 

10

gives it  the check to the lawyer, or is it when the

11

beneficiary actually gets the 200,000?

12

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, I don't think that the

13

answers are clear on that, but I do think it's when

14

he takes  I think the most this Court has said it's

15

when he takes title to the thing.  And presumably, he

16

takes title to the thing at the moment that the check is

17

given to the lawyers.

18

            Now if, at that moment, Justice Ginsburg,

19

say the bank account of the lawyer was hacked and the

20

$500,000 settlement was gone, our view is his general

21

rule then kicks in.  In that circumstance, we cannot

22

recover.  The only thing we're saying is that when a

23

defendant knowingly dissipates a fund as to which

24

someone else has a claim, it's in that circumstance that

25

the exception  as Justice Story called it, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

46
1

peculiar exception applies to try and basically make

2

sure that he isn't profiting a second time from his

3

wrongdoing.

4

            That's why the claim is a very limited one

5

at equity.  It's just a  it's a  and again, it's

6

only limited to the amount of the lien.  You can't go

7

more than that.  You can't have punitive damages and the

8

like, and it's encumbered by all the defenses in the

9

equity.  We have to take the bitter with the sweet, so

10

laches and unconscionability.  All of that would be

11

standard defenses that are available to such an action.

12

            Now, my friend on the other side has said,

13

well, this is going to reach disability situations.

14

Absolutely not.  I mean, I think you have a variety of

15

amicus briefs before you that say that there's a

16

specific statute, 407(a), which prohibits liens against

17

Social  Social Security Disability overpayments.  He

18

says it's going to reach pension overpayments.  Again,

19

that's not our rule.  Our rule in  in those  in

20

those circumstances, a pension plan is overpaying a

21

beneficiary.

22

            And if the beneficiary spends that, well,

23

that's not something that they're knowingly dissipating.

24

That's very different than a circumstance like this in

25

which someone is dissipating a fund as to which they 

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

47
1

someone  as to which the Plan has an underlying lien

2

against.  And that's why it's a  it's a very limited

3

rule.  It's one that tracks the tradition at common law.

4

Both Otis talks about misappropriation, and Baxter talks

5

about wrongful dissipation when someone has a valid lien

6

against you.  And as well, the Orr case, for the swollen

7

assets theory and the like.

8

            Now, my friend on the other side says in his

9

brief, well, then why in the world are we spending so

10

much time  are all these equity cases spending so much

11

time on tracing?  And our view is very simple on that.

12

Tracing makes a lot of sense.  In the lion's share of

13

cases, tracing becomes very important because you don't

14

have a defendant who is acting wrongfully and knowingly

15

dissipating a fund.  And so the Plan or whoever the

16

trustee is wants to  wants to go after general assets

17

but then can't, unless they can trace them to a specific

18

asset.

19

            Tracing is just a lienpriority doctrine.

20

It's nothing more than that.  The Restatement that my

21

friend cites on the other side that is cited in Knudson

22

in Section 215 is as clear as day.  It just talks about

23

lien priority.  It doesn't say that there is no claim if

24

general  if  if someone dissipates a fund.  It says

25

that they are not entitled to lien priority.  That is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

48
1

it.

2

            And look, we agree with that.  We're not

3

here trying to say we have a priority over other

4

asset  over other creditors.  We're just simply saying

5

we are to use the language of the Restatement, a

6

"general creditor."

7

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  So you don't have

8

priority over other creditors.  So if Mr. Montanile owes

9

somebody money, he  it's all right if he takes money

10

from the fund and pays that debt?

11

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, we are then  you know,

12

as long as we can't trace it in a world of no tracing.

13

So there's obviously some funds here that we may able to

14

trace, because as the interchange with Justice Ginsburg

15

was suggesting, it's not totally clear what was spent

16

and what isn't.

17

            But with respect to the rest, yes.  I mean,

18

we have to take the bitter with the sweet, and that

19

means we are a general creditor out of general assets.

20

It's not like we get first priority over those assets,

21

which is why this remedy is at best a secondbest one

22

for us.  I mean, the ideal is, of course, to prevent

23

someone from dissipating the funds altogether.

24

            And we do think, if this Court recognized,

25

as I think most of the circuits have, that we have a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

49
1

cause of action here, then I think it would deter people

2

from engaging in the kind of behavior that Mr. Montanile

3

did.

4

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I just want to be clear:

5

I understand your position and your answer.

6

            Fund has  has a claim for reimbursement

7

from the accident proceeds.  Accident proceeds put into

8

the bank account of the Plan beneficiary, the injured,

9

the person who was injured in the accident.  He also has

10

another creditor.

11

            You're  you stand evenly with that

12

creditor?

13

            MR. KATYAL:  So if 

14

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Was that your answer?

15

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, it is in the situation of

16

a dissipated fund.  So obviously, if we can trace  and

17

this is why tracing is still important.

18

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Well, it's  it's your

19

example.  The case is settled at 10:00 in the morning.

20

At 10:30 in the morning, it's in the bank account.

21

            MR. KATYAL:  Yes.

22

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  Nothing has been spent,

23

but there's a creditor.  And the creditor's claim is

24

equal to the Plan's claim, and there's only enough money

25

for one.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

50
1

            What happens?

2

            MR. KATYAL:  Well, Justice Kennedy 

3

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  I thought you would have

4

priority.

5

            MR. KATYAL:  I would if  it sounds like we

6

could trace that fund.  That is, the fund hasn't been

7

spent in that circumstance.

8

            JUSTICE KENNEDY:  It's traceable.  It's in

9

the bank account.

10

            MR. KATYAL:  Right.  So then  and that 

11

that's exactly right.  So we would have priority over

12

that $500,000, in that circumstance, over other

13

creditors.

14

            My only point is if we're in the

15

Montanilelike situation in which he has  let's say he

16

spent down that entire fund and there's another creditor

17

who also  Montanile owes money to.  Once that happens,

18

we are  we can only recover just like the other

19

general creditor.  And that's what the Restatement says.

20

That's all it says.

21

            It does not say that if a fund is

22

dissipated, that there is no claim anymore.  That would

23

be contrary to the whole idea as Justice Alito's

24

question was, about what equity is all about.  That

25

makes  that makes no sense.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

51
1

            An equity is not that brittle, Justice

2

Scalia.  I understand that there are traditions in

3

equity and there are certain rules.  But at the end of

4

the day, there  it was never that formalistic and 

5

and  and have the idea that someone could profit so

6

much from their wrongdoing in frustrating an equitable

7

claim that otherwise exists.

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  But it seems, Mr. Katyal,

9

that you are relying on remedies that really developed

10

very late in equity's life.  In other words, you know,

11

equity was going along, and there were these very formal

12

rules distinguishing it from the legal world.  And then

13

as it progressed, there were  people thought we need

14

some cleanup authority, or maybe even people just

15

thought these rules aren't working in the way that we

16

want them to work.  So equity got a little bit less

17

equitable as it approached the merger with law.

18

            But that, I think, is not really what we've

19

meant when we've said we're looking to things that are

20

typically equitable.  You know, not like the last throes

21

of equity as it was becoming a legal system.

22

            MR. KATYAL:  So, Justice Kagan, I'd spot you

23

that with respect to swollen assets, you know, which

24

does come around in the 1930s, and so maybe there's an

25

argument there.  But  but for example, substitutionary

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

52
1

monetary decrees, Justice Holmes's opinions in 1897,

2

exactly the same year as Barnes, the Chief Justice's

3

opinion that was the foundation for Sereboff.  And

4

indeed, it has a tradition that goes back to

5

Justice Story's 1828 treatise, which cites earlier cases

6

even still.

7

            So I don't think that we're relying that.

8

            JUSTICE KAGAN:  Well, you take the  the

9

deficiency judgments, which, I take it, was a rule was

10

needed to give equity that authority, because everybody

11

thought equity didn't have that authority.

12

            MR. KATYAL:  Well  well, even if you can

13

make that argument about deficiency judgments, which

14

I'll respond to in a moment, you can't make it about

15

substitution or monetary decrees, which is a distinct

16

body in equity.

17

            And with respect to that, in 1864,

18

absolutely.  This Court promulgated Equity Rule 92,

19

which allowed for deficiency judgments.  But I think the

20

fact that they had to issue a rule doesn't somehow make

21

it a law claim, as my friend says.  I mean, after all,

22

Rule 73, promulgated in 1864, was a rule about

23

preliminary injunctions.  And I certainly think

24

preliminary injunctions were available in equity, and,

25

you know, the fact that there was a rule about it didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

53
1

somehow convert it into a law claim.

2

            So I think the very fact that this Court

3

issued a rule called Equity Rule 10 is suggestive of the

4

 of the fact that this is a tradition in equity.

5

            Now, look, if there's some doubt about this,

6

if there's some doubt on the traditions, and they've

7

got  I don't think they have a single case, but even

8

if you thought they did, that said that we were

9

prohibited  that we were prohibited from making these

10

claims at equity, I think you should err on the side of

11

recognizing the claim.

12

            Why?  For three reasons.  One, because as

13

the Solicitor General's brief in Sereboff said, the

14

point of ERISA is to try and give effect to written

15

plans and their determinations.  And if there's doubt

16

into the  as to what the equity tradition is, you

17

should read it in light of trying to enforce Plan terms.

18

That is the pages 23 and 24 of their brief.  It is

19

consistent with the way this Court approaches, for

20

example, Title VII cases and the like.

21

            The second is that, again, all we're seeking

22

here is a remedy.  We're not trying to get more than

23

what would have been otherwise available at equity.

24

Our  our view is that when someone frustrates an

25

otherwise equitable claim, we can only try and reinstate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

54
1

that claim.  You can't get more from it because of their

2

second wrongdoing.  So I think we're giving effect to

3

what equity is all about.

4

            And then, third  and this goes back to

5

your last question to Ms. Anders, you said, you know,

6

what was  what was the  what does "typically

7

available at equity" mean?  And you know, that test

8

comes from Mertens.  Mertens isolates three examples of

9

what was traditionally available as equity  at equity:

10

mandamus, injunction, and restitution.

11

            Now, if you look at mandamus, for example,

12

there are precedents from this Court making  that 

13

that suggest that equity  that equity didn't recognize

14

mandamus.  You know, this Court twice in the nineteenth

15

century in Hine and Downs both said that  said that

16

twice.

17

            And I think that's a good textual clue that

18

when there's doubt as to whether something is actually

19

traditionally available at equity or not, you should err

20

on the side of recognizing it as traditionally

21

available, as this Court did in the foundational Mertens

22

test.

23

            We're not quibbling with Mertens.  We're

24

simply saying we're at least as strong as to whether

25

something was traditionally available at equity as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

55
1

mandamus.  Because in mandamus, two cases from this

2

Court suggested it wasn't traditionally available, and

3

yet, the Court still, in Mertens, used that as one of

4

its three examples.

5

            If there are no further questions.

6

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

7

            Mr. Stris, you have four minutes remaining.

8

           REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PETER K. STRIS

9

               ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

            MR. STRIS:  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

            I'd just like to make two brief points.  The

12

first one is that the historical authorities are

13

unquestionably on our side.  And it was interesting

14

hearing my  my friend Mr. Katyal go straight to the

15

substitutionary monetary remedy.  I want to say a couple

16

things about this:

17

            First, if you look carefully, the exact

18

argument he's making was rejected by the holding of this

19

Court in GreatWest.  This is Section II C of the

20

Court's opinion.  It's kind of a lesserknown part of

21

the opinion.

22

            The  the argument was made that a

23

beneficiary of a trust commits that second wrong that he

24

was talking about when they get a loan contractually and

25

refuse to pay it back.  And what this Court said is, no,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

56
1

that's not typically available in equity.  And, you

2

know, it's precisely the distinction that he's trying to

3

now push upon you to squeeze this remedy through.

4

            So let's look at the substitutionary

5

monetary decree cases he talks about.

6

            Not a single one of them involves an

7

equitable lien by agreement.  They  they don't involve

8

an agreement.  They're restitutionary cases.  So that's

9

also interesting to me that he criticizes our side

10

talking about the  the Restatement of Restitution,

11

Section 215, whereas we talk about Pomeroy.  We talk

12

about Jones on liens.  We talk about the Person case.

13

It's an 1880 case on page 35 of the Blue brief.  It's an

14

equitable lien by agreement case.

15

            The historical authority here is beyond

16

dispute.

17

            And  and I guess the last thing I'll say

18

on this is look at the Shafer's Appeal cases.  It's one

19

of his lead cases on page 37, note 6.  It says that

20

substitutionary monetary relief is legal.

21

            So I  I think if you look at the cases,

22

not that I would wish that upon anyone, they  they

23

really do not even credibly support the proposition

24

historically.

25

            So where does that leave us?  I mean, I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

57
1

think I was honest from minute one when I got up here.

2

The only reason that you would contort the standard that

3

you've developed  let's be honest; you know, spot me

4

this  you have to believe our position is

5

fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of ERISA.

6

If you do, then I have a problem.

7

            But here's where we're at.  Mr. Chief

8

Justice, you made a very strong policy argument about

9

why my rule is no good.  With respect, I think I could

10

make a very strong policy argument about why

11

participants who prove a clear badfaith brief by a plan

12

should get consequential damages.  I could make that

13

argument.  I think I could make it very persuasively.

14

But that's not what we're here to do.  We're here to

15

apply the historical test.

16

            So let's end, essentially, with, I think, a

17

key concession that Mr. Katyal makes about the

18

disability context.

19

            So if you look at this case and you say,

20

well, all this subrogation, I don't know.  These

21

arguments that the Plans have ways to protect

22

themselves, maybe they're right, but maybe they're

23

onerous.  And, you know, I'm just not sure if it's going

24

to add to the cost of plans.

25

            Go look at the disability cases.  Because I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

58
1

was stunned when Mr. Katyal got up here and said, oh,

2

well, the disability cases are different, like this

3

doesn't extend to them.  He filed a cert petition with

4

respect with this Court in the Bilyeu case, which was

5

one of the circuit split cases that's here.  Half of the

6

circuit split cases involve the disability context.

7

            So I'll end with this:  What does that tell

8

you?  The fact that you look at these disability cases

9

and you see that money is being advanced and it's being

10

spent before the lien even attaches, and yet they're

11

made part of the circuit split, and in this case

12

Respondent is not willing to defend that as a policy

13

position, I think what it tells you is that fairminded

14

people could disagree as to where you want to place the

15

risk.

16

            And so when we go and look at this and we

17

think about it in terms of burdens, if there is any

18

reasonable position, as you look at this, that a rule

19

that says you can essentially go after general assets,

20

means that some meaningful number of fiduciaries will

21

abuse that to assert rights they don't have or to delay,

22

then I think you need to go with the clear line of

23

historical authorities.

24

            Thank you.

25

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, counsel.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

59
1

You say he filed a cert petition.  Is that on behalf of

2

the same client this year?

3

            MR. STRIS:  It's not on behalf of the same

4

client, no.  But it  it shows that the disability

5

cases are governed by precisely the same legal rule,

6

since for him to suggest that the legal rule that you're

7

going to decide here would not also  also apply in

8

disability cases, flies in the face of the precise

9

position he took when he filed the cert petition 

10

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I'm just

11

trying to 

12

            MR. STRIS:   in the Bilyeu.

13

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Are you saying that,

14

because he represented a different client and took a

15

position in that case, he's somehow bound by that here?

16

            MR. STRIS:  Oh, no, no.  Certainly not.

17

What I'm saying is we have a circuit split.  And half of

18

the cases are subrogation, and half of them are

19

disability.  So the Court's recognized that the legal

20

principle in this case will not only apply in

21

subrogation cases but they'll apply in disability cases.

22

            And Mr. Katyal recognizes that because he

23

represented a party in one of those cases.

24

            So my  my point only is, don't accept the

25

representation that the rule here can somehow be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official  Subject to Final Review

60
1

confined to subrogation cases.

2

            Because, as an empirical matter, it cannot.

3

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Well, I would be

4

surprised by the proposition that lawyers are somehow

5

collaterally estopped if they take a particular position

6

on behalf of one client from taking a different position

7

in a different case.

8

            MR. STRIS:  No.  Most certainly that's true.

9

And perhaps I've miscommunicated.

10

            We have a circuit split which led to the

11

Court granting this case, and all of the cases purport

12

to resolve the same question presented.  Half of them

13

are in the subrogation context; half of them are in the

14

disability context.  So I don't  I don't see how one

15

could credibly take the position that you can decide

16

this case and it would not affect the mine run of

17

disability cases, because they're part of precisely the

18

same circuit split.  It's the same issue.

19

            CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:  Thank you, counsel.

20

            The case is submitted.
