CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Holowecki.

Ms. Lensing.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING

8

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. LENSING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Congress clearly set out a statutory scheme

12

in which timely notice and the opportunity for

13

conciliation are required before an age discrimination

14

private suit may be brought.

15

reading -- the reading of ADEA Section 626(d) as a whole

16

shows that "charge" encompasses notice, even if that

17

definition is too broad and you accept only a content

18

definition of "charge," it is clear from the structure

19

of the statute that notice and an opportunity to

20

conciliate before a lawsuit commences is required.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

While our position is that

Well, EEOC Form 5 is

22

labelled "Charge."

And would it be your position that

23

if an employee filled out that form and submitted it to

24

the EEOC, but the EEOC made a mistake and did not notify

25

the employer, that that would not be a charge?
3

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. LENSING:

We think the better rule is

2

that it would not be a charge until notice is given,

3

because that's the only rule that is faithful to the

4

statute, that notice is required.

5

is available for such a mistake and that's the exact

6

situation in which equitable tolling should be used, to

7

rectify a true mistake on the EEOC's part at the time,

8

rather than what they have been engaging in of late,

9

which is second-guessing the decision made at the time.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But equitable tolling

Well, why don't we do

11

exactly that here?

12

thing to do, now a charge labelled Form 5 has been

13

filed, is to dismiss this lawsuit; and then we wait 60

14

days; and the identical lawsuit is reinstated.

15

shouldn't the court simply toll the case and say, now we

16

have a proper Form 5.

17

to engage in settlement.

18

allow the 60 days to elapse, and then the complaint is

19

there.

20

case?

21

I mean, you say that the proper

Why

The employer didn't get a chance
So we hold on to the case and

Why isn't that the appropriate solution for this

MS. LENSING:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, to

22

begin with, the plaintiff never requested that the court

23

do that.

24

thing to do because there's a very big difference in

25

conciliation after notification and before a lawsuit has

But in a broader sense, it's not the proper

4

1

been filed.

2

this conciliated, if possible.

3

There is -- the emphasis is on let's get

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you said the same

4

complaint could be filed at the end of the conciliation.

5

What difference does it make that you have a piece of

6

paper there?

7

What I don't understand is the only effect

8

of your position -- dismiss the whole thing, 60 days,

9

start over -- is you're making the plaintiff file an

10

additional filing fee.

11

filed.

12

The complaint has already been

The filing fee has been paid.
Now, everything would work out just the same

13

except the plaintiff has to pay a second filing fee.

14

the court there are certain inefficiencies if it's first

15

dismissed and then they have to docket it again.

16

don't see any -- it doesn't seem to make any sense to

17

me.

18

MS. LENSING:

In

So I

Well, Congress believed that

19

notice and a chance to conciliate without a lawsuit was

20

the proper way for this to be done, and there is a

21

difference in efforts to conciliate before and after a

22

lawsuit is filed.

23

And if -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think -- I

24

think you're right about that.

I mean, once the

25

lawyer's involved and they're in litigation and all
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, they're not going to take conciliation efforts

2

with the same light as before.

3

But the question is whether the remedy for

4

that, which is some unfairness to you, is to throw the

5

suit out or try to fix it as much as possible, such as

6

through a stay or dismissing without prejudice or

7

something.

8
9

Why should the Plaintiff -- it's not his
fault that the EEOC didn't notify you.

Why should he

10

suffer the categorical sanction of dismissal simply

11

because it's a little unfairness to you?

12

MS. LENSING:

I think it could be dismissed

13

without prejudice.

I think that that's fine, because

14

then you would have an opportunity, as in this case

15

where there is a proper charge, to have that period of

16

conciliation, and the plaintiff would not be out

17

anything other than the filing fee, which the employer

18

is out a little bit, too, because the employer never got

19

a prompt notice at the time of the first situation.

20

But the biggest reason -

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why should the -

22

the filing fee penalty, in effect, go to the plaintiff

23

when it wasn't the plaintiff's fault?

24
25

MS. LENSING:

Well, you know, I would submit

that perhaps it is the plaintiff's fault when the
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

plaintiff does not do everything a plaintiff can to be

2

sure that a charge is filed.

3

instance, stated that it is for -- pre-charge counseling

4

is the purpose, and that it's to determine potential

5

charges.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This particular form, for

May I interrupt you to this

7

extent:

8

plaintiff had filed on Form 5 and the EEOC had done

9

nothing and the plaintiff then brought suit, you'd be

10

making the same argument.

11
12

As I understand it, if -- your position, if the

MS. LENSING:

That is true, and equitable

tolling is available.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that.

14

mean, that -- that seems to me a very strange argument.

15

You say since -- since the EEOC must give notice when a

16

charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge

17

has been filed.

18

That doesn't make sense.

I mean, it's just

19

like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of

20

civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint

21

has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days.

22

And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?

23

MS. LENSING:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Well, Justice -- sorry.
I mean, it just doesn't

track.

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. LENSING:

Justice Scalia, I understand

2

your hesitancy to accept our definition of "charge" as

3

including notice, but the other view -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5
6

So give me another one that

will enable me to rule in your favor?
MS. LENSING:

It is -- it is just as true

7

and the results are just the same if you look at the

8

statute as a whole and you uphold the sense of the

9

statute and you understand that the requirement before

10

bringing a suit, whether or not notice is part of the

11

definition of "charge."

12

under the statute that notice and an effort to

13

conciliate be made before the suit is brought.

14

understanding the statute as a whole and upholding that

15

purpose, that it's a requirement, an indispensable

16

prerequisite to a lawsuit, is a different way of getting

17

to the same result.

18

But there is a requirement

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

So

Now, does -

19

does the person who's filed a proper charge know whether

20

notice has been given or not?

21

always given to the filer.

22

MS. LENSING:

Is a copy of the notice

I don't know if it always is.

23

Certainly when it's not given, it is not.

24

think the person easily can contact or find out from the

25

EEOC, what is happening with my, what she believes or
8

Alderson Reporting Company

But, yes, I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

may not believe is a charge.

2

certainly she did within the time limits because she

3

filed a charge later.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this particular case,

After she had a lawyer.

5

But is it -- is it not the practice at the EEOC when

6

you're dealing with an unrepresented person who files

7

the intake questionnaire and if the SEC reviewer thinks

8

that it fits within the statute, that the Form 5 will be

9

filled out, not by the layperson, but by the EEOC

10

officer herself?

11

MS. LENSING:

Well, I think that the, the

12

practice has been so inconsistent and that's part of the

13

problem.

14

in '01 and one in '02, because she submitted the

15

questionnaire twice, two field agents did decide that it

16

was not a charge and did not treat it as a charge -- no

17

charge number, no notice.

18

charge.

Two field agents in this particular case, one

They decided it was not a

And so no Form 5 -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's not the

20

question.

The question I asked is if they decide that

21

the, what the intake -- the information on the intake

22

questionnaire fits within the statute so that the claim

23

can go forward, isn't it the practice not to ask the

24

layperson to fill out the Form 5, but for the EEOC to do

25

it itself?

her, by the, by the employee.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, she filled out hers

15

after she was already in court and had a lawyer.

16

thought that this statute, as all the statutes EEOC

17

administers, are designed for claims that are put forth

18

initially largely by unrepresented people.

19

notion is that the agency should make it as easy as

20

possible for them to get through the legal process.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

didn't it?

4

It said it wasn't a charge,

Didn't it say that it's not a charge?
MS. LENSING:

Yes, it did.

Well, it did not

5

say that this is not a charge, which I think would be a

6

better practice if it did say that in the future.

7

it said the purpose of this is for precharge

counseling -

perhaps this is a question your friend on the other side

15

will be able to answer better than you.

16

where she got the form, why she filled it out?

couldn't find in the record whether this was given to

her by someone at the EEOC or whether she downloaded it

from the website or what.

MS. LENSING:
know.

But do we know
I

We do not know, or I do not

It is not in the record.

You're correct.

The problem is, is that the practice at EEOC

23

has been so inconsistent, both the, what they call a

24

charge, what they recognize as a charge, and their

25

treatment of documents as a charge.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Again, the Web site

Official - Subject to Final Review

clearly says a Form 5 that is signed and completed and

received back in the field office is a charge.

when your charge is filed.

4

that went out, one after the Edelman case and one after

the opening brief in this case, to field agents that

say, no, you're supposed to use this manifest intent

And yet we have two memos

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
with everything you said.

I agree completely

I just don't understand your

10

leap from government incompetence to saying the

11

plaintiff loses.

12

MS. LENSING:

That is

The plaintiff does not lose.

13

And that is the difference in this situation and the

14

Logan case, which the government, I think, and also the

15

Respondent have cited.

16

because equitable tolling is available.

case -

18

The plaintiff does not lose,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, in our

What happens -- what

19

happens if -- in this case it's not a problem, but I can

20

imagine it would be in many cases -- - if you have a

21

300-day or a 180-day problem, you withdraw the

22

complaint, and then you're out there and the clock keeps

23

ticking, and you get past the 300 days and you are

24

totally out.

to say, well, it's, it doesn't make any difference, if

That's why it's important not to follow -

we dismiss this complaint, she comes back in 60 days.

2

Well, but 60 days may be 360 days.

3

MS. LENSING:

Yes, Your Honor.

4

equitable tolling comes in.

5

equitable tolling.

That's where

That's the purpose of

6

If the situation is that you have missed the

7

time to file the charge, either the 180 or the 300 days,

8

equitable tolling saves from you that.

9

you can now file the charge.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words,

Do you think

11

Ms. Kennedy is entitled to equitable tolling in this

12

case?

13

MS. LENSING:

Ms. Kennedy didn't need

14

equitable tolling, because in this case she caught the

15

situation before the time ran and she filed a charge.

16

The problem in this case is that she chose not to file a

17

lawsuit based on that charge, and she decided to do that

18

for quite some time.

19

once the charge was filed, the EEOC recognized it as a

20

charge, they gave notice to us, the employer.

21

began the time -

22

She did finally get -- you know,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They

I guess she,

23

reasonably or otherwise, thought there already was a

24

lawsuit.

25

MS. LENSING:

Well, not after the lawsuit
13

Alderson Reporting Company

was dismissed, Your Honor.

I mean after the lawsuit was

2

dismissed, she got the right to sue letter and she still

Wasn't she appealing?

Pardon me?
Wasn't she appealing the

dismissal?

9

MS. LENSING:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

But, you know, the equitable tolling is not

11

needed where you file within the 180 or 300 days.

12

you have to do is file a -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Did you undertake

14

conciliation efforts after her formal, her filing of the

Form 5 charge?

We

can't, we can't talk to her.

19

20

investigate, rather than an informal investigation.

21

that never occurred and that's part of the problem here,

22

because we spent a long, long time on the motion to

that this has been in litigation, and that changes the

face of conciliation completely.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the employee files an

4

intake questionnaire but not a Form 5, would you say

5

that there would be equitable tolling, or would you say

6

that the employee wouldn't be entitled to equitable

7

tolling because the employee didn't file the right form?

8

MS. LENSING:

I think that unless she was

9

relying on the EEOC, and there have been cases like that

10

in which the EEOC says, the field agent says, that's all

11

you need to do, this is a charge and notice is going to

12

issue.

13

that in the record, which of course this record is

14

completely silent.

15

information in about whether she believed, didn't

16

believe or what she was relying on.

where the EEOC misleads her, yes.

no in a situation where the form clearly says that it's

But in a situation
I would certainly say

I don't see much difference

fact that the Form 5, I think, requires a listing of the

number of employees that the employer has.

come in and say, you know, I have this charge of

that's not a charge, and they can read through them and

reason for the intake questionnaire.

giving the information to the EEOC and not a charge, and

13

must be treated, must be treated differently.

14

That's the

But it is simply

You know, going back, Justice Ginsburg,

15

because I don't think I ever finished the answer to your

16

question some time ago.

17

staying the lawsuit is if that were the answer, then we

18

would be doing away with presuit notice, because anybody

19

could go in on an intake questionnaire a year later

20

because, remember, nothing is happening to -

21

One of the problems with

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I don't understand

22

that, because EEOC is a responsible agency.

Congress

23

has told it:

24

something that happened in Paris, and then you give

25

notice.

You weed out the people complaining about

But the notice obligation -- and I understand
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it is EEOC's, not the complainant's.

2

expect this agency -- yes, it messed up in this case -

3

routinely not to give notice, routinely not to engage

4

the employer in conciliation efforts.

5

MS. LENSING:

So we would not

But that is the problem.

If

6

you -- they are routinely not giving notice of intake

7

questionnaires, and they are not supposed to.

We agree

memo and say, oh, those field agents were wrong.

11

need to take the opinion of the EEOC at the time.

12

of course this was a very reliable, very justified

13

opinion of the field agents because it clearly said on

14

the form it was precharge.

15

But we
And

But if you -- if you just say the lawsuit,

16

that means that anybody that files an intake

17

questionnaire can come in 2 years later because it's not

18

being processed, so no notice to sue letter will ever go

19

out, and so there is no end to the statute.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the new form,

21

the EEOC's new form -- I suppose responsive to this case

22

and others like it -- that says if you don't file any

23

other administrative complaint, we'll count the intake

24

questionnaire as the charge?

25

MS. LENSING:

Well, that's -- that's an
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interesting form because that means it you come in the

2

day after the act of discrimination, that form is filled

3

out; it is neither a complaint nor a charge.

4

what it is until 300 days run.

5

days, if the -- if the complainant has not filed another

writing, then there -- there can be no prompt notice.

7

Then it is -- has morphed into a charge; then there can

be no prompt notice to the employer.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who knows

So at the end of 300

If the EEOC treats it as

a charge, then the EEOC is obliged to give notice.
MS. LENSING:

But they won't know if it's a

12

charge until the entire time runs, to know if it's the

13

only timely filed document, because it says it's only a

charge if you don't file anything else on time.

Counsel, the

argument.

17

And

So I wonder what your answer is to that

MS. LENSING:

Well, the -- the regulations

18

are certainly entitled to deference, and taken as a

19

whole, the regulations, just as the statutes, require

notice.

enough, and the entire definition is not embodied in the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

And And you're only -

when you say you're hurt, the only prejudice that you

to go through prelitigation conciliation.

MS. LENSING:

We didn't have prompt notice.

We could not investigate CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but my point

13

is, you're not alleging prejudice from the lack of

prompt notice.

Do we know whether -- I

10

mean the difference -- what you are suggesting would be

11

perfectly fine is once the charge was filed, and this is

12

a lawsuit, and then you would investigate or whatever,

13

it's a situation that the statute did not envision.

14

MS. LENSING:

I

And I agree, Justice Scalia.

15

I think they did -- the statute did envision it because

it does require prompt notice.

and the opportunity to conciliate without a lawsuit

And particularly in this suit and in many

others now, when you have the piggyback situation, a

8

question you had asked me about deference in the Auer

The Auer case is an interpretation of a

about manifest intent, and that is just a wholly new

12

situation that -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How is it -- how is it new?

14

I thought that you argued for that test in the court of

15

appeals.

16

MS. LENSING:

as the test had been administered by other courts which

18

required evidence -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, didn't -- didn't your

brief say that was the appropriate test?
MS. LENSING:

Because in that court we were

bound by precedent and that was the test, but we said JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you -- I know you're

24

bound by precedent, but if you think it's wrong, you can

25

say it's wrong.

2

MS. LENSING:

Well, we -- the manifest

3

intent test that we talked about was the one the courts

4

have used, which is the situation we were talking about,

5

where equitable tolling should occur.

6

you have, in the record, reliance on the EEOC that

7

you've done everything you need to do and this is a

8

charge.

And that is where

10

Circuit's ruling, where they just say:

25

MS. LENSING:

It's just not true.

But -- but notice is required
27

Alderson Reporting Company

for the suit.

So, while a charge may be a charge before

2

notice is given, and I understand your reluctance to

3

accept that definition, but -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, only because I'm sane.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MS. LENSING:

7

We still -- we still get to the same place

A point well taken.

8

if you -- if you accept the position that notice is

9

required in the statute and suit can't be brought.

10

Maybe there is a minimal charge, but suit cannot be

11

brought on that minimal charge until notice is given, is

12

a more sane way to put it.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If she had the obligation

14

to give notice, you would have a much stronger argument,

15

but the statute places that burden on the EEOC, not on

16

the lay complainant.

17

MS. LENSING:

The burden is on the EEOC, and

18

that is why there's equitable tolling.

19

plaintiff needs to demonstrate in the record she's done

20

everything she can.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the

But there can't be

22

equitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge.

23

So sooner or later -- you cannot run away from it -

you're going to have to give us a definition of what a

25

charge is.

And you don't give me any -- unless you want to

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. LENSING:

No.

A charge needs to clearly

8

delineate that it's a charge.

And I think the EEOC

9

could do that if they knew they had to live by that, and

10

then we're perfectly happy with the EEOC defining

11

"charge" as long as they consistently define it and give

us notice.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. ROSE

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20
21
22

MR. ROSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to make two points initially.

And

23

I'll make them briefly, and I'll try not to re-cover the

24

ground that's been covered by a number of the questions.

25

The first major point is that the statute
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and the -- well, this has been made sort of -- the

2

statute and the regulations state that, after a charge

3

has been filed, the responsibility for sending the

4

notice and docketing the case is upon the commission.

5

It's not on the aggrieved individual.

6

a petitioner has -- the charging party, excuse me, or

7

aggrieved individual has a duty to provide notice is

8

just absolutely flatly inconsistent with the statute, as

9

Justice Scalia was just stating.

The argument that

10

I want to make a second point which ha also

11

been alluded to by, I think, Justice Breyer and others.

12

The Petitioner suffered no harm from the fact Ms.

13

Kennedy filed a Form 283 rather than a Form 5, which is

14

entitled "Charge," because EEOC did not give prompt

15

notice to the defendant Federal Express, the Petitioner

16

here, on May 30th.

17

filing of the charge until sometime after August 20th,

18

2002.

19

though the charge was filed and -- EEOC did absolutely

20

nothing with it.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But are you telling us

3

stuff that's not in the record at all?

4

relevant to the argument here?

5

MR. ROSE:

Why is that

Well, it's relevant because this

6

is a complaint that was dismissed before any evidence

7

was taken, and therefore any set of facts that's alleged

8

in the complaint is assumed to be true for purposes of

25

It either is or isn't.
34

Now, what about this:

It is a charge if it

2

reasonably appears to be a charge, or if you want to say

3

"manifest intent," that's okay, too.

4

Now, if you signed a document which -- which

5

says that it is a prefiling document and the purpose is

6

to discuss a future charge, it seems to me you know, or

7

ought to know, that this is not a charge.

here where the company has been deprived of the

22

conciliation opportunity, deprived of the opportunity to

23

preserve evidence and whatnot, it seems to me the fault

adds, if we get the notice, we also start getting

evidence and preserving it and talking to people.

Sure.
Now, I replied to that,

her response is, sure, they sometimes don't give notice

22

when they file a charge.

23

you start calling these documents charges, well, they

24

never give notice, so they will never do it.

2

the first part of what I said.

that if the employer is really hurt, there is a statute

and a rule and the statute and the rules say you have to

5

give notice and if they are hurt by that, they can

6

complain about it.

7

MR. ROSE:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

My -- I was assuming

Right.
But they must make mistakes

in their history when they file charges and didn't give

10

notice.

So what does the law tell us?

11

any case ever where the EEOC didn't give the notice, now

12

the complainant files a lawsuit and it's not the

13

complainant's fault, her response is work out some kind

14

of equitable tolling.

notice.

that contains all three of those things.

11
12

It doesn't say that

anything that contains that is a charge.

9

That's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

Let's try

something else.

MR. ROSE:

-- which is (a) and (b).

16

"Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) of 8 above of

17

this section, a charge is sufficient when the Commission

18

receives from the person making the charge either a

19

written statement or information reduced to writing by

20

the Commission that conforms to the requirements of

21

1626," which I just read on page 351.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I like my cite

23

better.

If you look at 1626.3 on page 351, it says:

24

'Charge' shall mean a statement filed with the

25

Commission by, or on behalf of, an aggrieved person
44
Alderson Reporting Company

which alleges that the main prospective defendant has

4

MR. ROSE:

I like that one, too, Your Honor.

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. ROSE:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's the same thing.
But if an employee files

8

something like that and says I don't consent to

9

notification of the employer, can that be a charge?

10

MR. ROSE:

I think that it -- it really

11

depends whether the employee has put on top of it -- I

12

think you need -- I think there is a -- we take the

13

position that if it meets the definition of 1626.3, or

14

the other parts of 1626, it is a charge.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then, all intake

16

questionnaires are a charge, because they all contain

17

that.

18

with the -- with the agency's assertion that it has

19

something called an intake questionnaire which does not

20

constitute a charge unless -- I don't know -- unless

21

there's manifest whatever it is.

22
23

I mean that definition is simply inconsistent

That's inconsistent because all of those
intake questionnaires contain all of that information -

24

MR. ROSE:

Well, I think -

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- set forth in 26.3.

whether if -- if she checked the other box, it would be;

has done in that situation.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, there may be none,

6

but if the -- if the employee indicates by the box

7

checked that the employee does not want the company to

8

know that the employee is making whatever this is, this

9

statement -

10

MR. ROSE:

Right.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- how can it be regarded

12

as a charge against the employer which sets in effect a

13

litigation process?

14

MR. ROSE:

Well, I think that's why the

15

better reading probably, as Your Honor suggests, is that

16

it's not a charge if that's all the form is, and she

17

checks only -

These regulations that are

This whole situation can be traceable back

to the agency, and I -- whoever ends up bearing the

burden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme

16

has to be revised.

17

MR. HEYTENS:

The agency absolutely agrees

18

with that, Your Honor, and the agency has taken a number

19

of concrete steps, some of which we illustrate in our

20

brief, to deal with what in reality is a very serious

21

problem.

22

I think it is important to point out,

23

therefore, right at the start, that the problems that

24

arose in this case are in some measure -- not

25

exclusively but in some measure -- a reflection of when
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it arose.

2

Ms.

Kennedy submitted her form in December

3

of 2001.

That was before the Edelman litigation; and,

4

most importantly, it was before the February 21st, 2002,

5

memo that was issued in response to the Edelman

6

litigation.

7

Now, some members of the Court may recall

8

that one of the problems that surfaced at the time of

9

Edelman was that the agency, or at least some of the

10

field offices of the agency, had a practice of not

11

serving notice until after they received a verified Form

12

5.

13

stop right now because our statutory obligations require

14

us to serve notice within 10 days of the charge.

And the February 21st memo was to say that needs to

So that happened immediately following the

16

Edelman litigation, which was, regrettably, after this

17

case arose.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. HEYTENS:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Sure.
That's within 10 days of

21

the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to

22

be proven.

I mean what is the charge?

MR. HEYTENS:

MR. HEYTENS:

Scalia:

First of all I think it's important to

understand that, from our perspective, the test is an

10

objective intent test that looks to the intent of the

11

employee, not the intent of the EEOC in promulgating a

12

form.

And the reason that's important -

Why do Federal district judges have to

MR. HEYTENS:

The fundamental source of the

21

problem, Justice Scalia, is, as this Court has

22

recognized, the vast majority of people who initiate

23

EEOC proceedings are lay people who aren't familiar with

24

the statute.

25

And the other dilemma is that a great many
49
Alderson Reporting Company

of the initial contacts with the EEOC -- the EEOC, as we

MR. HEYTENS:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah.

Well, I read those

regs, and those regs had a definition that can't

5

possibly be right as applied to "intake questionnaire,"

6

because they make it a charge when the person says I

7

don't want notice.

9

So we know that isn't the thing.

I also know what you just said does sound
like a rule.

I just want to know where to read it,

10

because I don't think you'd refer to a rule of an

11

agency, though normally we do -- but you don't refer to

12

a rule that doesn't exist; you don't refer to a rule

13

that nowhere can be found; you don't refer to a rule

stated can be found.

Just as a point of

clarification, Justice Breyer, the three requirements

is the provision of the regulations labeled "Form of

5

in front of them, where I would go to read just what you

6

said.

7

MR. HEYTENS:

8

First of all, you could go to the final rule

9

Four places, Justice Breyer:

as it was promulgated in 1983.

There was an issue that

10

came up when the agency promulgated the final rule that

11

the definition of "charge" versus the definition of

12

"complaint," both of which are defined terms in 1626.3,

13

was ambiguous and unclear.

14

And in the final rule at Volume 48 of the

15

Federal Register, page 138, the EEOC stated that one of

16

the distinctions between a charge and a complaint is

17

that a complaint is a way for the EEOC to receive

18

information about allegations of discrimination where

19

"the party providing the information does not wish to

20

file a charge."

MR. HEYTENS:

We certainly do not assert,

Mr. Chief Justice, that the compliance manual gets

Chevron deference.

In our view, the compliance manual

represents the agency's considered judgment about the

3

proper interpretation of its regulations, and is thus

4

entitled to deference under Auer.

5

allege that our regulations don't get Chevron deference.

6

The EEOC has clearly been given the authority to issue

7

regulations dealing with this topic.

Under the Mr. Heytens, is it true

10

that the Form 5 for somebody who's not represented by

counsel is usually done by EEOC itself?

12

true?

MR. HEYTENS:

Is it that

In situations where the Form 5

14

is filled out in the office, Justice Ginsburg, yes,

15

that's correct.

16

visit, my understanding is that the typical practice

it's filled out by the EEOC office.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Heytens, what's your

20

solution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a

21

charge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has

22

happened here?

23
24
25

How do you think that should play out?

MR. HEYTENS:

In situations where the

employer does not receive notice, Justice Scalia?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.

55

MR. HEYTENS:

The first thing we think -- at

2

that point, Justice Scalia, I think that task is to try

3

to recreate as well as possible the situation that

4

should have existed, and the Commission agrees notice

5

should have been given.

6

in our brief, the employer should be entitled to a stay

7

of the litigation for up to 60 days to attempt to intent

8

to work out, absent discovery requests, absent motions

9

practices -- the problem -- Justice Scalia, you raised

So the first thing, as we say

10

the problem that at that point, the person probably has

11

a lawyer and you can't talk to him, but there's really

12

-- but I think that's conceptually a separate question,

13

for two reasons.

14

when they filed the charge, in which case the same

15

problem you discussed would arise; but the flip side is

16

it they could also be pro se after they filed a lawsuit,

17

in which case the ex parte bar wouldn't count either.

18

So I think it's conceptually, although I can see it's

19

probably related in practice, it's at least conceptually

20

different.

21

First, they might have had a lawyer

The second thing we think, and it's been

22

explored during the oral arguments so far, if the

23

employer could allege or show some concrete prejudice as

24

a result of not having received notice, then the

25

district court should take that into account.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

But in

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this case Federal Express has simply not alleged any

2

concrete prejudice.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's on the notice

4

point.

Going back to the other, more important point,

5

your words that I found quite useful are the "manifest

6

intent," that shows a manifest -- are those words going

7

to be in these four sources that I look up?

8

MR. HEYTENS:

The precise words manifest?

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. HEYTENS:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. HEYTENS:

No.

I suspect not.

Well, then Therefore -- I'm -

Well, but I would say, Justice

13

Breyer, the word intend is in fact in the 1983 final

14

rule; it says where the person "does not intend to file"

15

--I apologize, Justice Breyer.

16

word is "wish," "does not wish to file a charge."

17

As I stand here, the

The language in the compliance manual which

18

is repeated in the memorandum is well, is it states that

19

you look at whether the submission constitutes a clear

20

request for the agency to act, which we think, though

21

not exactly the words manifest -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Just to get one thing

23

perfectly clear in my mind, does that mean if the intake

24

questionnaire is checked not consent, that would not be

25

a charge?

MR. HEYTENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may I ask

2

-- in our view that if she had checked the box saying do

3

not disclose for identity, this would not have been a

4

charge.

Thank you.

Thank you,

Mr. Heytens.

Miss Lensing, you have a minute left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CONNIE L. LENSING,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. LENSING:

First of all, in this case the

11

affidavit attached to the intake questionnaire began -

12

and this is at Joint Appendix 266 -- with the statement,

13

"I have been assured of confidentiality by the EEOC."

14

So it is a confidentiality concern.

15

Congress determined that there must be an

16

opportunity for conciliation before a lawsuit was filed.

17

We never saw the numbers that are not in the record,

18

that were testified to today, but if 247 charges were

19

filed against FedEx, in that period of time we had 25

20

age discrimination cases.

21

does work.

22

it just shows that we conciliate, we look into it, but

23

you can't do it once the lawsuit is filed.

24
25

So conciliation before a case

And I appreciate those numbers because it -

The best rule obviously are the clear forms
that many of you have mentioned today.
58
Alderson Reporting Company

One can say it's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not a charge.

The other one can say it is a charge, and

2

this could all be a situation where you'd have only rare

3

occurrences where notice was not given.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do we fix it?

You

5

haven't gotten notice, you haven't had a chance to

6

conciliate -- how do we fix it?

7
8

MS. LENSING:

Well, this particular case,

she could -- may I answer?

9

She could have filed her lawsuit, she had a

10

charge.

She chose not to file a subsequent lawsuit 60

11

days later.

12

opportunity to file another lawsuit was there.

13

didn't need equitable tolling because she caught it and

14

she filed a charge, indisputable, and we did get notice

15

of the charge in July.

16

end of May; we got it in July.

This lawsuit was properly dismissed.
She

I think it was filed the very
