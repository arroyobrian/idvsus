<p>Here is a 2 minute screencast describing our project:</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation and Background</h2>

<p>The comments made by Supreme Court justices often carry a lot of weight over public opinion. For example, Justice Antonin Scalia’s recent comments about affirmative action have attracted major media attention. For our final project, we wanted to see how effectively we can predict the court rulings based on the words used by the justices and attorneys in the courtroom. </p>

<p>We want to predict the outcome Supreme Court decisions using oral argument transcripts. Studies in linguistics and psychology, as well as common sense, dictates that the word choices that people make convey crucial information about their beliefs and intentions with regard to issues. Rather than use precedents or formal analysis of the law to predict Supreme Court decisions, we attempt to extract essential emotional features of oral arguments made by justices and advocates in the court.

Through this project, we sought to answer three primary questions:
<ul>
  <li>How does natural language processing on oral arguments help us predict the outcomes of Supreme court decisions?</li>
  <li>Which features of oral arguments would best help us do this? (number of words uttered by justices, sentiments of words, or others)?</li>
  <li>Which approach would yield better results - latent semantic indexing or sentiment analysis?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a id="what-will-code-look-like" class="anchor" href="#what-will-code-look-like" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview of Methodology</h2>

<p>One natural language processing method is to analyze the sentiments expressed. Analyzing sentiment is commonly used to capture public opinion in social media outlets such as Twitter and Yelp, for example. The Supreme Court releases transcripts of court proceedings the day before each verdict. We collected all the transcripts from 2000 to 2014, and extracteddescriptive words from each transcript to make predictions based on the word list. These words vary from “improper” to “negligent” to “precise” to “straightforward”. 
</p>

<p>However, our method of capturing sentiment only accurately predicted about 55% of the court cases. In a way, the relatively low accuracy actually makes sense because the language used inside courtrooms are very legalistic and emotions don’t typically play a big role.
</p>

<p>Subsequently, we conducted Justice-centered data analysis (without NLP) as our baseline model, before delving into 2 different approaches to NLP - Latent Semantic Indexing and Sentiment Analysis - to see if these datasets and insights gleaned from them would provide valuable insight and help supplement our model. The analysis of baseline and 2 NLP methods are detailed below.

<a id="what-will-code-look-like" class="anchor" href="#what-will-code-look-like" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data Sources</h2>

<p>The original Efros-Freeman algorithm works by going through our target image in raster scan order in steps of one block. For every block, we search the input sample for blocks that satisfy overlap constraints within some error tolerance. This means that we randomly choose a candidate patch with a sufficiently low overlap error. A higher error tolerance means that overlapping patches might not be as well fitted together whereas a lower error tolerance increases the chances of growing garbage, hence this is a tradeoff. Overlap errors were calculated using L2 norm of a pixel-wise vector across the number channels (3 for RGB-colored images).</p>

<a id="sub-nav-questions" class="anchor" href="#sub-nav-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>There are 3 phases of the Efros-Freeman algorithm in which we can exploit parallelism:</p>

<ul>
<li>Searching for candidate patches: This is essentially an “embarrassingly parallel” problem since we are not writing to shared memory, and threads never access the same part of shared memory. 
</li>
<li>Parallelizing dynamic programming: Filling in the dynamic programming table has potential for improvements via parallelism. However, since our overlap sizes are usually not that large, scheduling overhead might override any potential benefits from parallelism. The theory behind this though …
</li>
<li>Insertion of patches into the generated texture: This comprises the brunt of the work of the algorithm, and is not easy to parallelize because overlapping areas are being read from and written to, hence each patch depends on previous patches having been finalized. The way this problem might be approached is using locks with condition variables to schedule threads to insert patches such that it is ensured that the current patch’s dependent patches to the up and left have been inserted.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The serial implementation of the algorithm gives us surprisingly good results for a wide range of textures. Here are some examples:

In some of them, for example the pebbles on this slide, the jagged edge is clearly visible.</p>
